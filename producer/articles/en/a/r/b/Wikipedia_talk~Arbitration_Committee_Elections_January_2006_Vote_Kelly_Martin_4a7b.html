<li>As my <b>Oppose</b> vote was wiped from this page (I came back from not using Wikipedia specifically to vote here), apparently because of some rule about when you first register this account or some nonsense, I thought that I'd say here why I think that she should be removed. It is not about user boxes. In the end, who cares if user boxes remain or not? The issue is cover ups. You could say removing my vote from here is a cover up. Or you can say her pretending that she had nothing to do with the improper banning of <a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoetlister_675f.html" title="User:Poetlister">User:Poetlister</a> when she was actually the one behind it. You could talk about her covering up of other administrator errors, her abuse of <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMistress_Selina_Kyle_f76f.html" title="User:Mistress Selina Kyle">User:Mistress Selina Kyle</a>, and so many other things. Whilst its nice that she finally got caught out because of the user box scandal, this is far from a first offence for this serial offender. But as her Request for Arbitration showed, while she remains an arbitrator she is untouchable. Hopefully this is the first step towards her losing her administrative priveleges. Wikipedia doesn't need people like this. Its people like Kelly who destroy Wikipedia. And her covering up the truth makes Wikipedia in to nothing short of a fraud. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 07:14, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's unfortunate timing, Zordrac. With 4,000+ edits we're all pretty damn sure you're not somebody's sockpuppet. A month ago you had more edits than me. But without (a) conclusive proof of sockpuppetry, or (b) inflexible age/edit threshholds of some kind, there would be no impartial way to keep the system from being gamed in one way or another. Without standards of some kind, such foul play would be inevitable and beyond control.

<dd>Reluctantly <b>oppose</b>. She appears to have made many good contributions to Wikipedia and the community...BUT besides the concerns raised by Oleg (see #13), she has behaved inappropriately regarding her talk page. She apparently doesn't see that her stringent blocking policy (for users making comments she deems unsuitable) assumes she has a special right; obviously, I, a non-admin, would not be able to get an admin to block a user merely on my say-so, which is basically what Kelly Martin's policy amounts to. <s>She also blocked an (allegedly) trouble-making user Mistress Selina Kyle for a "lie" which Kelly Martin said amounted to a personal attack. The lie in question was MSK's statement that a user had been banned from IRC, a statement that Kelly Martin later said was true but somehow still a lie since the ban was only temporary.</s> --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 10:54, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It "was true but somehow still a lie" because MSK claimed that the person was banned "permanantly from the chat room by Kelly's friend Ambi," when he wasn't; he was banned temporarily. I went and read this "stringent blocking policy" on her talk page, and the reality is it states users "making personal attacks of any editor other than [Kelly]," will be blocked. It doesn't say that people will be blocked for making comments "she deems unsuitable". Do you honestly blame her for not wanting third party cat fights clogging up her talk page?

<dd>Sigh, thanks for catching that error. In any case, it's not the main reason I voted oppose. It's part of what I see as a larger pattern of behavior. As for her blocking policy, I know what it says. And in practical terms, it comes down to comments "she deems unsuitable". I don't even know of a single admin that agrees with the reason for the block, although I suppose there could be some. On the other hand, plenty of admins have voiced disagreement. Since Kelly does not have to get another admin to back her up by doing the block for her, what else does this really amount to? I don't <i>blame</i> her for not wanting squabbles on her talk page, but they do happen and one has to ask the question of whether blocking people in, at best, a controversial manner is really the way to deal with that. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 07:46, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But anyway, now I wish to make my own long comment about Kelly.</dd>
<dd>I am noncommittal regarding a personal opinion about the block of MSK (and of the block warning notice AND that damn tipjar, though I don't believe it looks good) as I really don't know all the facts. There seems to be a lot of background to it which I have not personally witnessed. And I acknowledge that there are a lot of <i>genuine</i> people who are very sincere in their objection to some of Kelly's actions. I am not a friend of hers, so I have no vested interest either way. In fact, I have never even exchanged a single word with her. However, from reading the ArbCom pages and many of her other (non userbox fiasco related) comments, I believe that ArbCom is the best place for her. I agree with the contents of the email she wrote Jimbo last year. And it seems to me that a lot (not all) of the people who oppose her are merely being spiteful and are wanting to teach her a lesson. I believe Wiki is better off with Kelly on ArbCom than it is with her off it. At least, I have yet to see any evidence that would make me believe otherwise. I think people need to stop and ask themselves whether it is necessary to remove her from ArbCom or whether the backlash might have been enough of a reality check for her. It <i>has</i> visibly affected her and she <i>has</i> conceded some ground, stating: "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ezhiki&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34538773|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ezhiki&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34538773|" rel="nofollow"><i>Enough time has passed that an apology for not involving more of the community in a discussion beforehand would not be out of line; enough community support for a more moderate position exists to keep the radicals on this point under control. I still believe that the userboxes I deleted should have been deleted and should again be deleted, but I am not going to press the issue at this point as there is a robust and relatively civil debate on the topic now that will, hopefully sometime in our lives, lead to a conclusion. I had also misjudged the degree to which the community has become committed to process, probably because I don't have much to do with deletion anymore (an area where process has become arguably too important). For those two misjudgments, I am willing to apologize.</i></a>"</dd>
<dd>Also, I find it kind of amusing that there are people who object to her being on ArbCom due to actions she took while acting as an Admin, seemingly failing to realise that by removing her from ArbCom, she'll back to Admin full time. If they object to her Admin activities, but don't object to her behaviour thus far on ArbCom, it seems to me she should <i>remain</i> on ArbCom and not be put in the position where she is most likely to commit this "offensive" behaviour.

<dd>Oh, and regarding the tipjar: I have high medical expenses (estimated at $20,000 this year, not nearly all of which will be covered by insurance), and I'm also trying to save up for travel to Wikimania in Boston. I'm not the only editor with a tipjar (in fact, I got the idea from one of my mentors, <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethIlys_e593.html" title="User:SethIlys">SethIlys</a>, who has a paypal link on his user page). So far, I've received $16 less PayPal fees, from someone I met at a Wikimeet (and who may well have been compensating me for buying the food!), and that was less than my monthly pledge to the Foundation (I contribute $20 a month). Now, can we please stop making such a big deal out of this? <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 21:49, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think Kelly Martin needs to defend the jar, despite the fact that she gives a good reason for it. No one has to donate if they don't want to, and it's her user page. I'm sure that donations to it have very little impact if any at all on her contributions. My vote for oppose was strictly regarding the RfC, and personally, I think these type of non-germane attacks only cloud the situation and distract attention from the real issues that are at stake here. -- <a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHinotori_3bf9.html" title="User:Hinotori">Hinotori</a><sup><small><a href="../../../h/i/n/User_talk%7EHinotori_c2fa.html" title="User talk:Hinotori">(talk)</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hinotori_253e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hinotori">(ctrb)</a></small></sup> 22:44, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That's a bit sharp, mate. Accurate, but sharp none the less. Surely you can understand how frustrating it would be to be in that position? And can't we apply <i>some</i> common sense here? We're not a bureaucracy, process is supposed to <i>help</i> us. And Arkon, you'd do much better with this crowd by arguing similary. There are few insults that carry greater sting around here that "wiki-lawyering", and you're skating dangerously close.</li>
<li>Let's just have the facts, and be honest about how we feel. Is there anyone else withing 15 edits of suffrage? Do we actually fear some sort of landslide of new accounts? Wouldn't we all be better off to simply make our votes, make out notes on the votes, and let it rest?<br />

<dd>Aaron, commonsense tells me that voters (in <b>any</b> election) require eligibility, which is frustrating for editors like Arkon who just miss out, but thems the breaks. If we didn't have and enforce guidelines for this election then why even bother with it? Yes, process should help Wikipedia, but flawed process never will.

<dd>The sufferage bar seems to be 150 at the start of the election, which I think almost anyone would define as the exact moment that it says the election started, not somewhat later that day. I certainly can sympathise with being a few edits short, but if it makes you feel better, there is one editor that was at 148. That editor was denied sufferage too (or, rather, Cryptic marked his votes as being short of the criteria set). If 148 were allowed to slide, wouldn't that start a slippery slope ending up at 138, and then 125 and then 42 and then 11 and then 1 and then 0??? Again, I sympathise but from the moment I started editing here I recall the suggestions pretty clearly, anons should strongly consider registering. Hope that helps. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 06:16, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, I absolutely can agree with your interpretation. But my objection to the arbitrary nature of these rules, the fact that I had no idea they were even in place (why would one bother coming to the page until they were ready to vote?), and the rigidness of these rules, are actually independent of that agreement. To expand on my complaint about the rigidness, I find it humorous that someone with 150 edits as of 12:00 is allowed in where someone with 150 edits at 12:01 would not be. Rules can be good, but only if they abide by common sense to a point. Hopefully, my bitching and moaning may help promote the idea of having a neat little notice next time this happens, saying what the criteria are in the same notice that the elections will occur. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkon_a61e.html" title="User:Arkon">Arkon</a> 06:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Yes, I've made far more than 150 edits in my years of being here. Yes, it is funny (and annoying) to have my opinion discarded for a lack of 12(11?) edits.

<dd>Make mine an arf. Arkon, the gist of you saying "it shouldn't matter" is in effect saying "stuff the process", which is the reason many people voted oppose against Kelley Martin. It doesn't seem to be getting through. You want to stuff the process so you can vote against someone who said stuff the processs.

<dd>I'm afraid we are still talking past each other. I am not saying stuff process (I, unlike Kelly, don't have the ability to do so). I am simply stating my opinion that the arbitrary rules set forth for my opinion counting aren't very bright, not particularly well advertised, and evidently far too rigid (IE 11 or 12 votes away, missing it by a few hours etc). You seem to be making some pretty large leaps in your assumptions of my reasons for voting against Kelly.

<dd>Where the cut off has been placed was somewhat arbitrary, but the existance of a cut off is not - there's good reasons to have a cut off somewhere and 150 is what was agreed. 150 ill considered edits are of course worth less than 149 brilliant edits, but that would be hard to automatically verify.

<p><i>"I have had basically no opportunity to actually discuss the situation with anyone other than a few friends. Discussion on an RfC is expressly prohibited (although people violate this rule all the time); by adhering to this rule I have apparently offended a number of people who think I should have instead "discussed" the matter on the RfC. In addition, very few people have contacted me via my talk page, email, or IRC in an attempt to discuss the situation.</i>"</p>
<p>Talk Page: People attempted to discuss the issue with you on your talk page, but you moved the discussion to another page with the comment <i>"Please do not make further comments here. Instead, make them on the RfC or its talk page."</i> effectively closing off that line of communication. You made it clear you wanted no discussion of the issue on your talk page. No one is going to risk being blocked by going against that.</p>

<dd><b>The problem is that people were debating <i>amongst themselves</i> on my talk page. My talk page is a place for talking <i>to me</i>. Extended discussions between two people who are not me do not belong on my talk page.</b> -This unsigned response is from Kelly Martin</dd>

<p>Email: Email is impractical for resolving a dispute involving hundreds of people. How would such a discussion take place?</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>One on one is a perfectly reasonable form of discussion. I've had a lot of one on one discussions since the start of this election.</b> -This unsigned response is from Kelly Martin</dd>
</dl>
<p>IRC: Many people do not use IRC. People know that bringing discussion from IRC can get you blocked from editing or banned from the channel. Discussion is limited to whoever happens to be in the channel at the time so both sides may not be fairly represented. The communication is instantaneous so people do not have time to reflect on others' words and compose a thoughtful response.</p>
<p>The best opportunity you had to discuss the situation was your talk page. Please don't stifle discussion there and tell us now that no one tried to communicate with you. You essentially forced the RFC, a process which limits discussion. <a href="../../../m/e/x/User%7EMexcellent_dde8.html" title="User:Mexcellent">Mexcellent</a> 23:28, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for responding. I've taken the liberty of bolding your responses to avoid confusion since they were unsigned and placed within my original comment. I see where people were debating amongst themselves on your talk page, which was certainly inappropriate. However, you don't have a problem with limiting other inappropriate behavior on your talk page by means of a prominent warning. A simple note requesting comments be addressed to you would have sufficed, instead you cut off all (talk page) communication on this matter. Communication is the key to resolving disputes; resolving disputes is the goal of the arbitrator. Regarding email: I agree with you, one on one is a perfectly reasonable form of discussion. The problem is that this was not a one on one dispute. It affected hundreds of people and brought forth too many underlying issues to be addressed through simple one on one conversation.
