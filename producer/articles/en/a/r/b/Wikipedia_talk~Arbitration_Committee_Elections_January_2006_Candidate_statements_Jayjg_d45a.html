<dd>What I know about the pages Jayjg monitors is this: right-wing pro-Israel editors read the Arab-Israeli pages and have a screaming fit because they believe their POV isn't fully represented. Left-wing pro-Palestinian editors have exactly the same reaction to the same words, except of course they see pro-Israeli bias. Based on this, I'd say Jayjg is getting things just about right in one of Wikipedia's most contentious areas. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:05, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that anyone who is considering supporting Jayjg's candidacy should take a good look at the history of his "participation" in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-occupied_territories.html" title="Israeli-occupied territories">Israeli-occupied territories</a> article and the reaction of a broad range of editors to it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=23486336&amp;oldid=23462821" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=23486336&amp;oldid=23462821" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=26858662&amp;oldid=26858613" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=26858662&amp;oldid=26858613" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=25103002&amp;oldid=25077507" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=25103002&amp;oldid=25077507" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=24919389&amp;oldid=24909549" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=24919389&amp;oldid=24909549" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#Aquifers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#Aquifers" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#Jayjg.27s_.22oops.22_and_.22no_good_faith.22_edits" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#Jayjg.27s_.22oops.22_and_.22no_good_faith.22_edits" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#The_naming_dispute_so_far" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#The_naming_dispute_so_far" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>.

<p>Jayjg, since this is your candidate statement page, perhaps you can weigh in as to how you wish it to be utilized by people asking questions and making other comments. Marsden posted a question to you the candidate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29650641&amp;oldid=29538296" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29650641&amp;oldid=29538296" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. And some other editors, including SlimVirgin, have posted critical comments about Marsden <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29717872&amp;oldid=29697077" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29717872&amp;oldid=29697077" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. Marsden replied to SlimVirgin with more diffs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29725914&amp;oldid=29722749" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29725914&amp;oldid=29722749" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, and SlimVirgin deleted Mardens' post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29730582&amp;oldid=29725914" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29730582&amp;oldid=29725914" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. Since SlimVirgin seemed to be deleting comments not directed at the candidate, I deleted all the side comments and moved them to talk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29731605&amp;oldid=29730582" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29731605&amp;oldid=29730582" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. However, SlimVirgin reinserted them, calling my deletion "trolling" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29732491&amp;oldid=29731605" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29732491&amp;oldid=29731605" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. Since SlimVirgin was reinserting side comments, I inserted my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29736011&amp;oldid=29735941" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29736011&amp;oldid=29735941" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. However, SlimVirgin deleted that one calling it trolling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29736745&amp;oldid=29736499" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=29736745&amp;oldid=29736499" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. It would appear that SlimVirgin can make side comments to Marsden and Unbehagen, but no one can make side comments to SlimVirgin. Given that, would you prefer that (1) your candidate page have no side comments and only questions directed at you or (2) that anyone can post a side comment to anyone or (3) let SlimVirgin decide on a case by case basis? <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 22:58, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why do you think you attract so much criticism as being an editor who agressively pushes pro-Israeli POV?

<dd>Unbehagen, as I said below, it's not true that the Arbcom censured Jayjg for "edit warring over POV issues". In fact they never said his edits were POV or even incorrect, as Fred Bauder made clear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Xed&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28033893" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Xed&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28033893" rel="nofollow">here</a>. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 22:55, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The context was <i>Yuber's</i> POV edit warring with many editors, in which <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Yuber_a45e.html#Enforcement" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Yuber">Yuber received a one year probation</a>, and Fred made it clear <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Yuber_a45e.html#Jayjg" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Yuber">the finding regarding Jayjg</a> was to encourage him to use the dispute resolution process (the preferable way of dealing with a POV editor--Yuber) instead of reverting Yuber's POV edits. Bottom line, Jayjg was *not* warned for POV edits.

<dd>Sorry for the lateness of the reply. No, I won't supply examples of anything. Jay's not on trial here and even if he was, I leave that sort of thing to those with absolutely nothing better to do. I am talking to you editor to editor, person to person. You don't demand proofs of people you have a conversation with. If you don't think he has editwarred, fine; I'm not pushing the point with you. I think he has a long track record of it, as a cursory scan of his contributions would illustrate. You might well think he has in every instance been correct but I think it's rather disingenuous to suggest he has never editwarred. But what the hell, if that's your view, it's your view. -- Grace Note</dd>

<p>I have checked over the history of the article and see a little revert war involving what I consider personal attacks. I am protecting the page for today. I don't see the harm in taking 24 hours to cool off and really think about what is a constructive comment and what isn't. I urge people commenting on these pages to stick to comments concerning Jayjg's compliance with, or violation of, core policies when making edits to articles, and his willingness or lack of willingness to explain himself — and not make his personal views themselves an issue. My belief is that personal views are irrelevant unless they lead to violations of policy. That being the case, there is no need to discuss personal views, only violations of polcies. That's is just my opinion. But whether people share it or not, this page <b>must not</b> become a venue for personal attacks against <i>other</i> editors. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 23:57, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>The answer to that is "It depends". If you're an admin accusing a non-admin of trolling, then it is simply reporting an observation or stating an opinion. If you're a non-admin accusing an admin of trolling, then it can qualify as "hurtful remarks" and may get you a block.

<p>Both FuelWagon and Marsden make the mistake of engaging Jayjg in content questions. Both editors have a long history on the pages they describe, and as the editor trying to find the correct balance Jayjg has naturally become the lightening rod of their criticism, as is the sad reality on controversial pages.</p>
<p>However, this is the ArbCom election. Jayjg has recused himself in the past from issues where he has been a party, and is likely to continue doing this in line with Arbcom policy. The questions from FuelWagon and Marsden then suddenly become academic. In my experience Jayjg has a better track record than several other candidates when it comes to dealing with difficult articles where NPOV is nigh impossible.</p>
<p>I therefore suggest FuelWagon and Marsden rephrase their questions to deal with Jayjg's future functioning as a member of the Arbcom. He has been a member for several months. There is no evidence that Jay's hard work on the Middle East-related articles has been of any influence on his functioning as an Arbcom member. Unless such evidence can be advanced, they are advised to retract their posts. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 21:04, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I dispute your characterization of my question, Jfdwolff. It is not my differences on content matters with Jayjg that my question addresses, but rather the manner with which he has promoted his prefered content. If someone resorts to uncivil and disruptive behavior in promoting his POV when acting as no more than an editor, why should he be trusted to act as an arbitrator? I could also post details of his abuse of his authority as an administrator.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my experience, as bourne out by the history I have provided, Jayjg has some serious character issues that prevent any confidence that he will not abuse any authority he is given in order to advance his personal point of view. It may be that the mix of other arbitrators that he has served with has so far prevented his misbehavior, but in any case Wikipedia would be foolish to appoint an arbitrator who has demonstrated himself to be willing to promote his point of view in uncivil and disruptive ways, with no more than the hope that other administrators will keep him in line. If Jayjg is reappointed and an opportunity arises where he can promote his point of view by abusing his ArbCom authority, no formal process exists in Wikipedia to stop him. The time to stop him is now, as he stands for reappointment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If there have been other members of the Arbitration Committee who are even worse than Jayjg, that is disgraceful. I am not aware of any such situation, but I hope and expect that you, Jdfwolff, will do whatever you reasonably can do to keep the offending arbitrators from being re-appointed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In summary, I will not be rephrasing my question nor my background comments to it. Character matters, and Jayjg's character is correctly gauged by looking at <i>all</i> of his behavior, and not just his behavior in the position for which he stands for reappointment. A thief who has served as a bank president without incident is still a thief.</dd>

<dd>I have explained why Jay cannot "abuse authority" as an Arbcom member. There are ample safeguards for that. If the internal climate of the Arbcom were to loosen those safeguards, Jimbo Wales has the authority to dismiss the Arbcom and issue new elections. One thing is for sure: incivility is not something one could level against Jayjg, and the "disruption" you characterise is rather low on the Richter scale of Wikipedia disruption. Wikipedia has a long record of editors disagreeing on POV issues still supporting each other in other decisions, and I do think it is a shame that your have been letting your editorial disagreement with Jayjg inform this statement you have made. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:32, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>My questions are one of "practice what you preach". Jayjg has performed a number of edits that I've witnessed that appear to be against standard wikipedia policy, and it seems quite relevant to me to find out how he justifies his editing behaviour. For example, when I inserted a verbatim quote from a notable source on the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> article, Jayjg reverted me. My edit seems perfectly in line with policy, and his reason given at the time does not explain his actions. In the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refusal_to_serve_in_the_Israeli_military_9a94.html" title="Refusal to serve in the Israeli military">Refusal to serve in the Israeli military</a>, I added a verbatim quote from a public letter (<a href="http://www.seruv.org/english/combatants_letter.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.seruv.org/english/combatants_letter.asp" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>), and again, Jayjg reverted me. and in <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Jews_75db.html" title="Historical persecution by Jews">Historical persecution by Jews</a>, Jayjg <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historical_persecution_by_Jews&amp;diff=24430846&amp;oldid=24430761" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Historical_persecution_by_Jews&amp;diff=24430846&amp;oldid=24430761" rel="nofollow">deleted</a> a massive amount of text containing URL's, which seems to be in direct opposition to arbcom precedent as explained in the first bullet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_policy/Precedents#Neutral_point_of_view_.28and_associated_principles.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_policy/Precedents#Neutral_point_of_view_.28and_associated_principles.29" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which states:</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Jayjg's deletion of this material seems in direct opposition to this precedent by arbcom. So, these aren't simply questions of content, these are questions of how Jayjg's editing behaviour appears to be in direct opposition to wikipedia policy and precedent, and asking Jayjg to explain his behaviour.</dd>

<dd>I will reply to you the same way as I did to Marsden above. Wikipedia has a fine track record of editors who disagree on issues still supporting each other in other areas. It is more than just a shame that disagreements have prompted you to come out in such a way against a fellow editor. These issues can be dealt with a normal conflict resolution process, and not on this election. To repeat my question: do you have any evidence that Jayjg as an arbcom member has abused his position or voted on cases he himself had a stake in? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:32, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's an interesting argument. Basically, you're telling me that Jayjg could be violating wikipedia policies as an editor, for example, showing a distinct pro-Israel bias by deleting a block of text containing well-referenced material <i>in direct violation of arbcom precedent</i>, but that means nothing as to how he might <i>vote as a member of arbcom</i>. So, if a Supreme Court nominee published a number of newspaper articles that were advocating for the complete outlawing of, say, abortion, we should ignore those articles, and focus specifically on his decisions as a judge? That's a nice way to filter out that which reflects poorly on Jayjg. Here's a question for you, then: if a candidate <i>has never been on arbcom</i>, exactly how would we determine how neutral the candidate would be but to look at his editing behaviour? Your argument is essentially cherry picking what you like, and telling us to ignore everything else that we see. Oh, and by the way, JFW, would you consider <i>yourself</i> to have a pro-Israel bias as an editor? Because that would put your campaigning for Jayjg in a certain context. Or should we all ignore questions such as that as well? <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 16:02, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>LMAO!!!! "you edit some of the most contentious articles on Wikipedia: those about the Arab-Israeli conflict, anti-Semitism, Zionism, and related areas.

<dd>SlimVirgin, out of curiosity, have you <i>ever</i> had a significant content dispute with Jayjg? You know, have you ever found that Jayjg and you disagreed on what should go into a particular article? Because I can find a litany of edits by you and Jayjg that show the two of you tag-teaming in direct support of one another, but I can't find any such history that shows you ever disagreed on any significant content issue. With evidence to support that you and Jayjg are a tag-team, and with absolutely no evidence to show you ever acted in opposition to one another, would it be fair to say that you might be advocating for Jayjg here because you're as biased as he is, and keeping someone on arbcom who is as biased as your are would be directly beneficial to you? How do you respond to <i>both you and Jayjg</i> deleting a large block of text from the History of Persecution by Jews that contained numerous references and source, which would appear to be in direct opposition to <i>precedent established by arbcom</i>? That <i>both you and Jayjg</i> act as a tag-team, directly reverting in support of each other, enforcing your version of edits that a lot of poeple consider to be NPOV violations? <a href="../../../f/u/e/User%7EFuelWagon_d995.html" title="User:FuelWagon">FuelWagon</a> 16:10, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>But now I've been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Marsden#Personal_attacks" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Marsden#Personal_attacks" rel="nofollow">threatened with blocking</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=29935483" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005/Candidate_statements/Jayjg&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=29935483" rel="nofollow">had my question deleted</a> (while being accused, again, of "trolling") for trying to bring him to account for avoiding questions.</p>
<p>Does anyone else think this is peculiar? Does anyone participating in the ring of protection want to explain himself?</p>

<p>On the Terrorism talk page, you stated: "Being described in a Dictionary of Philosophers as <i>a</i> critic of <i>American</i> policy does not make one an expert on terrorism. Chomsky's opinions have no relevance to an article on terrorism to begin with, but adding gratuitous and irrelevant flattery only compounds the error." Jayjg (talk) 20:23, 14 October 2005 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terrorism&amp;diff=25530650&amp;oldid=25530589" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terrorism&amp;diff=25530650&amp;oldid=25530589" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> This comment was in line with this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terrorism&amp;diff=25530053&amp;oldid=25529686" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terrorism&amp;diff=25530053&amp;oldid=25529686" rel="nofollow">revert</a> on the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> article with the edit summary: "being cited in a Philosophy Dictionary as a critic of American policy does not make you an expert on terrorism - removing gratuitous flattery, we have a link for his name if people care", where you deleted the Dictionary of Philosopher's quote.</p>

<p>The "Courage to Refuse" group signed a letter <a href="http://www.seruv.org/english/combatants_letter.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.seruv.org/english/combatants_letter.asp" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> in which they state their intention to refuse to serve in the Occupied Territories. (2) If the Courage to Refuse group uses the term Occupied Territories in their letter, why did you change it to "west bank" and "gaza strip" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Refusal_to_serve_in_the_Israeli_military&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24130066" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Refusal_to_serve_in_the_Israeli_military&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=24130066" rel="nofollow">here</a>, with the edit summary "remove POV pushing"? The letter by the group uses the term "Occupied" or "occupation" a total of five times, and uses the term "gaza strip" zero times. (3) Would you generally consider quoting a group or using their words to be POV pushing? (4) If not, why did you call using the words from the group's letter to be POV pushing?</p>
<p>More recently, I added a verbatim quote from the group's letter, using their words to describe themselves, and again, you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Refusal_to_serve_in_the_Israeli_military&amp;diff=29527704&amp;oldid=29526515" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Refusal_to_serve_in_the_Israeli_military&amp;diff=29527704&amp;oldid=29526515" rel="nofollow">revert</a> the edit. (5) If the group calls themselves reservists who have served in the "occupied territories", and if they say what they are being ordered to do is to "occupy" palestinian land, then how is using their words to describe them POV pushing? (6) Would this have anything to do with your personal dislike for the term "occupied territories"?</p>

Would you consider the deletion of a block of text containing valid references to be "vandalism" or a "content dispute". Would you consider her edit summary saying "revert vandalism" to be misleading, portraying a content dispute as simple vandalism? Or would you agree with her defintion that attempts to reinsert a block of text containing numerous URL's is vandalism? If SlimVirgin were brought before arbcom and this edit summary were submitted as evidence to show she is violating NPOV, would you as a member of arbcom "find facts" that her edit summary was misleading or not? Since 3RR does not apply to reverts against vandalism, would you say this edit would have counted towards 3RR? Or was SlimVirgin simply reverting vandalism?</p>

<p>Zephram Stark, and nobody else, has persistently claimed that there is something deeply and fundamentally wrong with the (<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">Terrorism</a>) article's introduction. Despite receiving no support whatsoever and overwhelming opposition, he has stubbornly continued repeating the same complaints and frequently making low-quality changes agreed to by nobody except himself. With his thick-headedness he is single-handedly holding this article hostage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The RfC was endorsed by a number of editors including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Zephram_Stark&amp;diff=22588250&amp;oldid=prev" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Zephram_Stark&amp;diff=22588250&amp;oldid=prev" rel="nofollow">Jayjg</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Zephram_Stark&amp;diff=22562725&amp;oldid=22562206" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Zephram_Stark&amp;diff=22562725&amp;oldid=22562206" rel="nofollow">Carbonite</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Zephram_Stark&amp;diff=22568496&amp;oldid=22565665" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Zephram_Stark&amp;diff=22568496&amp;oldid=22565665" rel="nofollow">SlimVirgin</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the "summary of dispute" uses the term "thick-headedness", which could be considered a violation of No Personal Attacks, why did you endorse such a summary without requesting the NPA be removed?</p>
<p>Given that you endorse the summary that blames Zephram Stark, <i>and nobody else</i> for <i>single-handedly</i> holding the Terrorism article <i>hostage</i>, how do you explain that a number of endorsers of this RfC resisted my addition of a verbatim quote from Noam Chomsky with a URL to verify its accuracy, and an explanation as to why he is a notable source? Could it be that some of the other editors opposing Zaphram Stark were taking "ownership" of the article, and it wasn't entirely Zephram Stark's "thick-headedness" that was "single-handedly" holding the article "hostage"? Could other editors have been contributing negatively to the dispute?</p>
<p>Personally, I found the opposition to my short quotation to be odd, and reported it on the RfC against Zaphram Stark <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FZephram_Stark&amp;diff=25678025&amp;oldid=24006598" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_comment%2FZephram_Stark&amp;diff=25678025&amp;oldid=24006598" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Is there anything in that outside comment that was incorrect? Do you believe I misrepresented what happened on the Terrorism article when I attempted to insert a verbatim quote by Noam Chomsky with a URL to verify? Do you believe that your opposition to my quote (and SlimVirgin, Carbonite, et al) was justified?</p>

<p>In my extensive experience with you, you have promoted and defended your POV with regard to matters related to Israel in ways that have been belligerent and contemptuous of the possibility that you are strongly biased in what you consider a neutral point of view. I do not know whether this is deliberate on your part or due to an honest blindspot in your thinking such that you are simply incapable of recognizing that yours is only one point of view among many, and that it is often completely biased. In any case, I consider your attitude to be a disqualifying characteristic for any sort of general arbitration function, and I intend, barring an unforeseen explanation from you, to campaign vigorously against your candidacy here.</p>
<p>In particular, I direct you to your activity in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-occupied_territories.html" title="Israeli-occupied territories">Israeli-occupied territories</a> article, and the reaction of other editors to it (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=23486336&amp;oldid=23462821" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=23486336&amp;oldid=23462821" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=26858662&amp;oldid=26858613" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=26858662&amp;oldid=26858613" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=25103002&amp;oldid=25077507" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=25103002&amp;oldid=25077507" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=24919389&amp;oldid=24909549" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli-occupied_territories&amp;diff=24919389&amp;oldid=24909549" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#Aquifers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#Aquifers" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#Jayjg.27s_.22oops.22_and_.22no_good_faith.22_edits" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#Jayjg.27s_.22oops.22_and_.22no_good_faith.22_edits" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#The_naming_dispute_so_far" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Israeli-occupied_territories/Archive_1#The_naming_dispute_so_far" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>), and to the history of the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moroccan_Wall_28ff.html" title="Moroccan Wall">Moroccan Wall</a> edits from September 23 to October 7, in which you and a few editors who are often found supporting your positions in editing disputes obstructed the improvement of the article for over two weeks (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moroccan_Wall&amp;limit=100&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moroccan_Wall&amp;limit=100&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>).</p>
<p>I honestly cannot think of anything you could say in any reasonable amount of time to change my mind about you, but given that I am going to recommend that people oppose your candidacy, is there any sort of rebuttal you'd like to make to my characterization above of your behavior on Wikipedia?</p>

<p>Jayjg, what do you think of US President Bush's "press conferences" in which he takes questions only from pre-selected journalists who have cleared their questions beforehand with his staff?

<p>It is polite to thank people for their involvement, and in the case of Jayjg I felt this was appropriate. I'm actually quite puzzled by your observation - what the hell could be wrong for thanking someone deservedly for hard work for our community?

<p>(moved from project page) My question is similar to Unbehagen's, of all the great candidates on Wikipedia, why should one like yourself who pushes a Zionist POV on the Israel/Palestine pages be rewarded by going onto ArbCom? You would have never have survived an election, which is why you were appointed instead. You wouldn't be able to survive an election this time either, but since Jimbo says there will be no election perhaps you'll make it back again. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 22:47, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Like FuelWagon and Marsden, Ruy Lopez is simply making a statement here, not even specifically at Jayjg but about the whole election process. If you feel the election is farcial, it may be time to start your own Wikipedia fork, or spend more time at <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchopedia.html" title="Anarchopedia">Anarchopedia</a>. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 16:14, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This tactic of the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallacy_of_many_questions.html" title="Fallacy of many questions">fallacy of many questions</a> has actually backfired quite badly for Marsden and Unbehagen; I think Jay's answers strengthen his case.

<dd>"This tactic of the fallacy of many questions has actually backfired quite badly for Marsden and Unbehagen;" I actually resent thisquite badly. my comment was an in good faith attempt to airn an important issue. Please show a little respect and civility. Thanks. i note that jayg did not actually attempt to answer me but instead resorted to an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack. <a href="../../../u/n/b/User%7EUnbehagen_5de2.html" title="User:Unbehagen">Unbehagen</a> 16:59, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel a pot-kettle coming on with regards to the ad hominem. Your question contained all the words necessary for a veiled attack, and you made no attempt to distance yourself from critical questioners who claimed to speak in your name. There are different ways of phrasing things like "being an editor who agressively pushes pro-Israeli POV". I also note your anti-Jayjg activity in your edit history. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 17:21, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then I am afraid that I have to call into question your impartiality. If my edit history shows a pattern of behaviour which is anti POV then this reflect well on me I think. Please note that it was the Arb Comm, not me, who found as a matter of fact that jayg edit wars on pro-Israel POV issues (incidentally not with me either - on that occasion). Am I not allowed to cite facts as determined by the arb comm now without being accused of bias or personal attack? <a href="../../../u/n/b/User%7EUnbehagen_5de2.html" title="User:Unbehagen">Unbehagen</a> 17:54, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unbehagen, it's not true that the Arbcom found that "jayjg edit wars on pro-Israel POV issues". In fact they never said his edits were POV or even incorrect, as Fred Bauder makes clear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Xed&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28033893" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Xed&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=28033893" rel="nofollow">here</a>. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 22:50, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You did not quote the ArbCom (and the link is easy to find, as all Jayjg's detractors have been quick to spread that particular finding to their chums). You thought it to be necessary to enunciate the view of some anonymous critics; you could have chosen much more unbiased phraseology in doing so. I did not in fact accuse you of anything. I simply observed that you asked rhetorical questions, but I agree fully with Jayjg's assessment that you are simply out to cause bother rather than actually promote a transparent election. You can call me biased all you like, but I call your approach low-grade harassment that is destructive to the process. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 18:12, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>SlimVirgin was insistent that it be noted that I had copied the questions that jguk had posed for all candidates (I have since deleted those questions as added by me, and jguk has added them back himself; I guess this is a significant difference to Slim). In light of this, it would seem to be appropriate to note the many questions that have been directed to Jayjg but deleted by others.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have an opinion on this?</p>

<dd>I do. Whilst I am flattered that Marsden appreciates my questions so much, I'm somewhat surprised the whole brouhaha wasn't resolved by Marsden asking the questions in his own name. I imagine what got other editors' goats was claiming the questions were asked of Jayjg by someone who had not placed those questions there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have now placed my questions on the more recent candidate statements, so that now every candidate has been asked them. Whilst I would, of course, welcome having them answered, I note that all the questions asked of candidates are voluntary - it is up to each candidate whether or not they choose to answer them - and similarly it is up to those reading the answers (or noting refusals to answer) to decide what import, if any, they have, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 19:15, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem would not have been addressed by my posing the questions in my own name, jguk.

<p>Then that's his decision. It doesn't stop your right to ask a small number of reasonable questions. Whether people agree with Jayjg's refusal to answer any questions raised by yourself (or indeed anyone else) and whether that influences their views on his suitability as an Arbitrator is entirely up to them, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 19:29, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your understanding is reasonable, but not necessarily true, given that several editors have taken it upon themselves to delete questions directed to Jayjg that they don't like, leaving no direct trace of the questions having been asked.

<dd>I believe that every user who had a question removed was asked to reword it so that it wasn't a thinly veiled personal attack. No questions were deleted on the basis that an editor "didn't like" the question. Are vandals blocked because an admin doesn't like the vandalism? No, it's because vandalism is not allowed, and neither are personal attacks. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 19:53, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I don't think any reasonable editor would see this as being a reasonable question. Marsden, surely you can tell the difference between a question such as "What line of work are you in?", which to my mind would be a reasonable question (it offers useful background knowledge about a candidate and his real-life experices), and your question, which, as Carbonite rightly states is a thinly veiled personal attack. Marsden, I don't know whether your other questions reflect genuine concerns you have about Jayjg's suitability as an Arbitrator or not - but if your last attempt is anything to go by, I am not surprised people have deemed them so inappropriate that they should be deleted, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:40, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uh, Jguk, would you think it mattered at all if someone on ArbCom was paid by an organization in order to promote a particular agenda? Would this at least be something that editors of Wikipedia, who one day could have an issue before ArbCom, should want to know? If Jayjg's employment has nothing at all to do with his participation on Wikipedia, that should be awfully easy for him to declare quite clearly.

And yet some of you claim that this is not the place for criticism? I guess if Saddam Hussein were a candidate, he could note that he ran a mid-sized nation for over a decade, and that when he left his office, the nation immediately fell into chaos. And then it would be inappropriate for anyone to bring up the matter of his using mustard gas on the Kurds in Iraq, or starting two wars that he lost.</p>

Anyhow, while not conceding that hardball questions can't be asked here, I think people should know that the hardball questions are in the talk page of this page, and you can also see them in this page's history, which JayJG's election campaigners keep deleting.

<p>A couple of days ago I advised Marsden to move his comment to the talk page. He has neither followed my advice, nor responded to my reasoning. So I am removing it to the talk page. I have removed the following from the candidate statement page because this is not a question, it is a criticism (asking if the candidate can rebut the criticism is not a real question, it is just hiding an exclamation point behind a fake question mark. As a matter of fact, Marsden labels his comment a "characterization" and I think it verges on character-assassination, i.e., a personal attack. Marsden has been blocked for this in the past. I hesitate to block him now, on the one hand because I want to see if he has learned his lesson, on the other hand, because I do not think he will — and if blocking him temporarily doesn't make a difference, I do not know what will. Marsden's comments follow:</p>

<p><b>Question from Marsden</b></p>
<p>In my extensive experience with you, you have promoted and defended your POV with regard to matters related to Israel in ways that have been belligerent and contemptuous of the possibility that you are strongly biased in what you consider a neutral point of view. I do not know whether this is deliberate on your part or due to an honest blindspot in your thinking such that you are simply incapable of recognizing that yours is only one point of view among many, and that it is often completely biased. In any case, I consider your attitude to be a disqualifying characteristic for any sort of general arbitration function, and I intend, barring an unforeseen explanation from you, to campaign vigorously against your candidacy here.</p>

<p>Thanks for at least not completely ignoring my criticism of your behavior, Jayjg. I don't think, however, that I've ever said that <i>my role</i> here was to hold a stick over your head or to beat you into submission; it is more that that has seemed to be the only way to get you off of a POV position that you have decided to promote. Nor have I made any attacks against Fred Bauder, regardless of how you may characterize my comments to him. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsden_5360.html" title="User:Marsden">Marsden</a> 01:15, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Marsden: you have every right to criticize any Wikipedian, as long as you are not making personal attacks. But this is not the place. The title of this section is "question from Marsden" but I see no question. I do not want to get involved in the debate over you and personal attacks, at least not right now. But I believe that the comment you are making here belongs on the talk page, not here. Let us use this page for raising questions we want Jayjg to answer, and the talk page for discussion of Jayjg's candidacy. This is <i>precisely</i> what the talk page is for. I will not move your comments myself, right now. I urge you to do the right thing, and move this discussion to the talk page. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 02:03, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It should be clear to anyone, that someone who states "I honestly cannot think of anything you could say in any reasonable amount of time to change my mind about you" is <i>not</i> someone who is sincere in asking a genuine question. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 04:10, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Support</b> - not sure where to put this, but Jayjg has impressed me as possibly the best and most unbiased administrator on Wikipedia. His actions in questioning admins who were using bully boy tactics to try to push through obviously wrong decisions, both in difficult POV disputes and in RFAs is to be commended. I do not think that I have ever been as impressed by an administrator, and I am confident that Jayjg would help to make the Arbitration Committee truly neutral, especially when accusations are made against administrators, and would help to stop admins being "untouchable" and increase accountability for Wikipedia. I will vote a big time support for Jayjg. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 11:23, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>My question is similar to Unbehagen's, of all the great candidates on Wikipedia, why should one like yourself who pushes a Zionist POV on the Israel/Palestine pages be rewarded by going onto ArbCom? You would have never have survived an election, which is why you were appointed instead. You wouldn't be able to survive an election this time either, but since Jimbo says there will be no election perhaps you'll make it back again. Ruy Lopez 22:47, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I should note this question has been removed multiple times. <a href="../../../r/u/y/User%7ERuy_Lopez_187d.html" title="User:Ruy Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a> 21:29, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was removed because it's a rhetorical question that only reveals your intentions but does not actually solicit any information from the candidate. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 17:44, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
