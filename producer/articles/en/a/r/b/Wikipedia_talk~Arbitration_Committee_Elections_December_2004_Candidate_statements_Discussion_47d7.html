<dd>The original format of the endorsements page, prior to it's ambiguation to the user name spaces, was the proper venue to present endorsements and justifications for granting or withholding them. I support Gzornenplatz' reversion to the orginial format and also agree that having another editor create a page in my namespace without my permission was offensive.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 19:20, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Restoring the old format of the endorsements page should be debated on the endorsements talk page, not here. If having a page with your own endorsements, written in your own words, created in your user namespace is so offensive, you have every right to blank it or have it speedily deleted. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 19:34, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And we have every right to restore the comments to the original place. You don't have authority to "move" people's comments from public talk pages to their private user spaces. That's double vandalism: deletion of other people's comments from a talk page plus unsolicited creation of subpages in other people's user space. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 19:45, Nov 19, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First time I hear that. When, where, and by whom was he so appointed? And which "set of pages" exactly does he direct?

<p>I don't appreciate the unilateral decision to bury my endorsements and opposition on an obscure subpage under my user page, where no one will ever read them, especially before asking me if it was OK. What was the motivation for wanting to hide my comments about the candidates?</p>
<p>If this election is to be free and fair, then in the "public square" that the candidate discussion page represents, everyone should be allowed to make their opinions known. Please restore my comments to the public discussion page where potential voters can read them without having to click on dozens of links before a potential voter can see what I have to say.

<p>Someone made the comment about how clicking on subpages only requires a click on one link. This comment is demonstrably dishonest - potential voters will have to click on dozens of links above mine, or below mine, (depending on the order they are going through the other user's endorsements) before they get to mine. Most users will become impatient and stop clicking long before they get to my endorsements. Hence why I posted on the central discussion in the first place - so my comments would be read!</p>
<p>Excerpts from other pages get read much more frequently than links. (Many popular news sites and blogs illustrate this every day, by excerpting what they link to in order to entice the reader to bother clicking on the link.)</p>
<p>Also, I made endorsements of Neutrality and blankfaze, and they do not appear on the candidate subpages that were recently created. Since the person doing this move wasn't super careful about moving this material around without losing some of it, those two candidates lost some endorsements that they would otherwise have.</p>
<p>The "consensus" on redistributing comments on a single page into many subpages seems weak. And who appointed Michael Snow the "boss" of the candidate endorsements discussion page in the first place? His statements that he would continue his actions despite the wishes of others doesn't seem very wiki-like. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 00:24, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Michael Snow suggested that I "pipe" my endorsements into my link on his centralized link page of endorsements. I disagree with his assessment of linking vs. a central page (for the reasons I gave above), but if this is as far as he is willing to compromise, so be it. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Vasquez_8cdc.html" title="User:David Vasquez">DV</a> 00:44, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>By this time Michael Snow should just admit that he made a mistake and restore the old version. DV's points are of course very true. Few people will click through all of this, and the whole duplication with two lists of links makes no sense. Where should people place new comments? People won't post in both places, so that ultimately if one wants to read all comments one would have to click through <i>both</i> sets of links, and thereby would get <i>most</i> comments twice. This bifurcation is an even dumber idea than having just one set of links, and even <i>that</i> is wholly unnecessary. The page was just barely 32K. What <i>are</i> some people thinking? I find no other explanation other than that some people want to deliberately hide certain opposing comments. <a href="../../../g/z/o/User%7EGzornenplatz_145f.html" title="User:Gzornenplatz">Gzornenplatz</a> 02:45, Nov 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>
