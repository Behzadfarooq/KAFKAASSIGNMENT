<dd>I've already been admonished enough times for that, and it was back when I was extremely new to Wikipedia. Although not a full excuse, that was the worst period of my life (I had extremely bad problems at home and at school), and it was a comment which was totally out-of-character. I understand if it looks bad on first sight, but trust me, I will not, nor have not, done anything similar in the <b>six</b> months since that. I can understand opposing per inexperience, but please, don't go digging through my past to back when I had less than ~500 edits (considering I have since contributed 11,000+ without anything even remotely similar). <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">T</a>&#160;·&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Daniel.Bryant_a73d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Daniel.Bryant">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 05:48, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Oppose.</b> Having reviewed user's previous interactions in other disputes, I find his temperment a bit too abrasive, confrontational, and imperious for such a sensitive position as ArbComm. Perhaps he really is just too young. Furthermore, the desire for such authority after having been here only six months is worrisome. Clearly a committed user, and should be commended for that, but serving as an arbitrator requires a different skillset than mere ability to undertake RC patrol. Would gladly reconsider if user shows a little more <i>savoir-faire</i> in the future. <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPop_Secret_7c4e.html" title="User:Pop Secret">Pop Secret</a> 22:57, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yours were the last comments before it was closed, but equally misrepresenting what had transpired, and what could be done to remedy the problem. Would it have been 'speedily' closed without your comments? Indeed, that seemed to be the impetus for the hasty closure. And why? That course of action was only due to a lack of understanding of a technical process. So, your reaction wasn't to communicate with the sister project, or the person making the request, but instead to blindly follow an oblique precedent applicable only to Wikipedia?</dd>

My personal assessment is that you are far to hasty (perhaps reactionary is a better word?) to be entrusted with a role in ArbCom. Actually, I think what you were doing was more of a knee-jerk overzealous support of something a friend said, without checking to see if it had any merit. Any way I look at it, my (only?) previous encounter with you has been resoundingly negative, hence the oppose vote. Reviewing that particular situation leads me to believe that you would give much more weight to <i>who</i> said something, rather than what was said. Even if I could be convinced that my other concerns were not 100% objective, that last one would make a support vote impossible. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnel_MacKenzie_91fe.html" title="User:Connel MacKenzie">Connel MacKenzie</a> - <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User_talk:Connel_MacKenzie" class="extiw" title="wikt:User_talk:Connel_MacKenzie">wikt</a> 04:54, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I fail to see how I am at fault here - as explained, and endorsed, by DRV, I was right in my judgement. If you had have asked for me to clarify or reassess my position, whilst explaining your reasoning in a civilised way, I would have responded in kind. I had, up until this point (I need to reassess it now), held a respect for your work on Wiktionary (where I contribute on-and-off under a totally unrelated username, which I'm not going to divulge). We had a number of productive discussions in the past, and my 4000 edits to Wiktionary were some that I felt very proud of. I still plan on contributing, mainly in sports-related topics as I have for the last three months, and I hope we can continue to improve both Wiktionary, which your input into is greatly appreciated by a large number, as well as Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel.Bryant_22a1.html" title="User:Daniel.Bryant">Daniel.Bryant</a> <sup>[&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel.Bryant_8f7b.html" title="User talk:Daniel.Bryant">T</a>&#160;·&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Daniel.Bryant_a73d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Daniel.Bryant">C</a>&#160;]</sup></b> 05:39, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Umm ... six people participated in that DRV and all six endorsed the closure. You were not requesting undeletion - you were requesting transwiki, which anybody can do. As your request did not actually involve an overturn of an administrative action, Daniel correctly suggested a speedy close. WP:DRV isn't the complaints department - it's not a five-day pass to get people to complain about an admin. Once it was resolved that no further administrative action was needed, there was no reason for the review to remain open. Had you been asking for the article to be restored to article space, then it would have stayed open for the full five days. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:35, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Apparently, there is some uncertainty about votes from users that had suffrage before the election, but have since been banned for a period of time (not indefinite) by the ArbCom. Srikeit originally struck them citing Dmcdevit, however since some conflicting opinions have occured, and hence I believe that the status of these votes is in limbo. Because of this, I have returned them to their original state, with a <b><a href="../../../l/i/n/WP%7ELINK_488d.html" title="WP:LINK">bolded link</a></b> to this discussion next to the votes that fall into this category. I will seek further opinion on the matter, and if they are disqualified per concensus or edict of Jimmy Wales, I will re-strike them.
