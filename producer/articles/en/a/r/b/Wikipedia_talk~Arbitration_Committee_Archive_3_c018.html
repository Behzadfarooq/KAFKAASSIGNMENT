<h2><span class="mw-headline">What to do if an Administrator <i>is</i> a vandal?</span></h2>
<p>More than once, I have met with rude practices from some Administrators, specifically in the Spanish language version of the WP, called "Bibliotecarios" ("Librarians"). They have sometimes acted whimsically and without grounds, as their actions have NOT been based on any rules as set forth in Wikipedia Official Policies, i.e.: they have deleted a part or the whole of an article, or have even obliterated it completely, leaving no trace and without warning, without calling for a vote, etc. That kind of attitude, I believe, may be properly called <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vandalism.html" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has happened that after placing a very civil request for justification on said administrator's Talk Page, I have been blissfuly ignored. I've noticed however that other Wikipedians who also have complained have been treated with rudeness or utter contempt. This is the case of Administrator <a href="../../../../es/c/i/n/Usuario%7ECinabrium_9b2a.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:Cinabrium">Cinabrium</a> at <i><b><a href="http://es.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://es.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">|Wikipedia en español</a></b></i>, the Spanish language Wikipedia.</p>
<p><b>QUESTIONS:</b> Who can one resort to, in order to place a complaint against an unfair, despotical Administrator? Is that title valid for life? Are Administrators exempt from, or above of, the official rules and policies of Wikipedia? Where may one take a case to? Who takes care of such situations in the Spanish version of Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Any comments / guidelines will be appreciated. <a href="../../../a/v/m/User%7EAVM_5bf2.html" title="User:AVM">AVM</a> 16:21, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Basically, if it is detirmined that an administrator is engaging in illegal activity, they will lose their admin privliges. They can lose them from a set period of time to permanantely. It all depends on the severity of the incident. --<a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">D</font></a><a href="../../../d/-/d/User%7ED-Day_7c62.html" title="User:D-Day">-Day</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/-/d/User_talk%7ED-Day_fb3a.html" title="User talk:D-Day">I'm all ears</a> <a href="../../../d/-/d/User%7ED-Day_Rate_my_progress_dc5a.html" title="User:D-Day/Rate my progress">How can I improve?</a></sup> 16:28, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question for ArbCom members</span></h2>
<p>The Capitalism article provides various citations. In some cases, the reference is an entire book (i.e. no page numbers are provided). An example is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Revolution_e3eb.html" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, capitalism gradually spread from Europe, particularly from Britain, across global political and cultural frontiers. In the 19th and 20th centuries, capitalism provided the main, but not exclusive, means of industrialization throughout much of the world (Scott 2005).</dd>
</dl>
<p>This seems appropriate to me as the remark summarizes a key point of the entire book, and is not a specific quotation from a specific page of the book. For what it is worth, this is a common practice in academic journals and books. Moreover, I cannot find where in the Verifiability policy or the Cite sources guidelines it states that specific pages must be provided. In my experience, they are some times not appropriate or necessary.</p>
<p>However, Ultramarine has just stated that</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I have participated in an arbitration case that found that books without page numbers are not verifiable sources. So I will remove them unless there are page numbers so I can verify the claims.<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 16:34, 27 June 2006 (UTC)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Capitalism#References" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Capitalism#References" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Has the ArbCom really given him the authority to delete such references? Have you made this policy? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 16:45, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the specific example Slrubenstein uses, I certainly do not object to it and it should be easy to find a source if someone objects. Although it could be less categorical. Some think that technological invention was the main cause. Should be a good discussion if using verifiable references.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here are two arbitration cases: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rktect#Relevance_of_references" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rktect#Relevance_of_references" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Ultramarine/Proposed_decision#Precision_of_citations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Ultramarine/Proposed_decision#Precision_of_citations" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. This ruling is of course common sense. Otherwise someone may argue that he/she has a source and name an extremely thick book. Now someone else actually tries to read the whole book to find the support. That person does not find anything. The editor then simply states that the person trying to verify the statement missed the support and that the thick book should read again. And so on in eternity. This has actually happened to me. Most academic journals and books require page numbers for books for specific claims so that they can be verified.<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 18:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ultramarine's comments above are misleading. In a dispute over the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> article, he is not referring to citations without page numbers for texts that are not "extremely thick books" but for sourcebooks and encyclopedias with entries in alphabetical order. I've been doing academic research long before most Wikipedia editors were born; the common style formats I'm aware of don't require page numbers for entries like (say) "capitalism" in the Oxford Dictionary of Politics. Anyone who knows the alphabet can find the entry on "capitalism" in that text without a page number. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 22:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most of your sources are not dictionaries or encyclopedias. You have repeatedly stated that you do academic research but has refused to provide any supporting evidence for this claim and edit anonymously. I regularly read numerous academic books and peer-reviewed articles. All have page numbers when discussing specific facts. <a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 22:09, 27 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>More specifically they are encyclopedia and subject sourcebooks (e.g., Oxford Dictionary of Politics and Oxford Dictionary of Sociology). Their entries are in alphabetical order. The page number is unnecessary. Frankly, I think your complaint here against the references is an example of <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_make_a_point_1ad8.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to make a point">disrupting Wikipedia to make a point</a>. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> | <a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.html" title="User talk:172">Talk</a> 22:13, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We have had cases where users simply pointed at books rather than specified any page in a reference. This practice has been criticized. Obviously an encyclopedia entry is an exception. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 22:16, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fred, it is not my place to comment on past specific decisions of the ArbCom. But if we are talking general <i>policy</i> here, the policies themselves to my knowledge do not demand that page numbers be provided. Now, I think the policies can be clearer - but also that it would be a huge error to prohibit citations unless they include page numbers. The question is, when are page numbers appropriate or inappropriate? the answer is fairly obvious: when one has a direct quotation, paraphrases, or refers to a specific passage in a book or article, one should provide page numbers. When one refers to a book or article because the book or article as a whole treats a particular topic or expresses a particular point of view, page numbers are inappropriate. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 09:50, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We have had a few situations where no reliable source was being used, the user simply providing laundry lists of books on the subject. I haven't looked at what Ultramarine is talking about. It might be our business or not. But the answer is that citing a verifiable source means giving enough information that it can be found and checked. I don't think that needs to be written down to be policy. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 12:50, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the response. Actually, I do think it should be written down in policy or at least a guide line, and I suspect it already is ("citing a verifiable source means giving enough information that it can be found and checked"). I would just add that there are situations where this does not require page numbers and page numbers would be inappropriate (examples: where the book as a whole is being provided as an example of a trend or point of view). I am in no way questioning the ArbCom decisions. I do however think ArbCom sometimes needs to be more careful about when it is applying a principle to a particular case without claiming that it would be applied the same way to all cases, versus when it is invoking a universal principle. Also, if ArbCom is invoking a universal principle, it should be explicit about from which policy or guideline it is deriving the principle. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:54, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I will again point out that page numbers are common sense. Otherwise someone may argue that he/she has a source and name an extremely thick book. Now someone else actually tries to read the whole book to find the support. That person does not find anything. The editor then simply states that the person trying to verify the statement missed the support and that the thick book should read again. And so on in eternity. This has actually happened to me. Most academic journals and books require page numbers for books for specific claims so that they can be verified.<a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltramarine_4c33.html" title="User:Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a> 14:02, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Appeal against ban: Gibraltarian</span></h2>
<p>I am unaware of the procedure for such matters, and would appreciate any relevant guidance. I had been assured that an appeal was already under consideration, but this does not appear to be the case. My ban was and is totally unjustifiable. My "crime" was simply to edit the lies, fabrications, and trollish behaviour of a racist user Ecemaml. He had taken to editing Gibraltar related pages (and has declared himself de facto sole arbiter of content in .es) by adding regurgitated fascist inspired anti-Gibraltar propaganda, showing no regard for truth, accuracy or NPOV. His racist attitudes and maliscious intent were clear from the outset, but he had the cheek to complain about me calling him a racist....which he was proving himself to be. WP is NOT a place for racists to thrive. At least it should not be. WP articles should not only be truthful, but also NPOV. This has been my sole concern when editing. My ban is totally unjustified, and I therefore request it be rescinded. I may be contacted at (a_gibraltarian@hotmail.com). Many thanks. Gibraltarian.</p>

<p>Since my ban was totally unjustifiable in the first place, and only imposed to satisfy the whims of a racist troll, I fail to see why I need to agree to anything at all. I DO agree to abide by the rules of WP, and ensure any edits I make are accurate and NPOV, BUT expect this to apply to ALL. If the unjustifiable ban is lifted I will of course have no need to post under any other name. Gibraltarian.</p>

<p>I have NOTHING to be "repentant" for! Those who DO need to repent are the ones who allowed a racist bigot like Ecemaml peddle his poison with impunity. FACT: My original ban was totally unjustifiable. I did NOT vandalise ANY of the articles........I have been forced to take drastic action recently due to the unacceptable behaviour of some WP admins, who appear more concerned with persecuting me than eradicating the fascist inspired propaganda and racism that comes from so many against Gibraltar. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. My ban MUST be rescinded forthwith. There was no justification for it in the first place. I will of course obey the rules of WP.....but expect them to apply to ALL. Gibraltarian.</p>

<p>My original ban was TOTALLY unjustifiable. I have had to resort to extreme tactics in order to get the issue noticed, and the blatant injustice reversed. I have made perfectly valid and good edits, which have been Rv'd on sight regardless of content. This is NOT acceptable. Now that you have been forced to sit up &amp; take notice.......REVIEW the initial ban, realise that it was not remotely justified, and only imposed to satisfy the whims of a racist.....and REVERT IT! Gibraltarian.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We don't take orders from banned users. Let me make three points to you. First, <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a> is clear on your "perfectly valid and good edits": "All edits by a banned user made since their ban, <b>regardless of their merits</b>, may be reverted by any user. As the banned user is not authorised to make those edits, there is no need to discuss them prior to reversion." Second, you've destroyed your own case by continually committing acts of vandalism from numerous anonymous IP addresses over the past few months. Vandalism and evading blocks are serious offences in their own right - if you hadn't already been banned, you would have been blocked for a substantial period for those abuses. Good conduct is normally a prerequisite for <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parole.html" title="Parole">parole</a>, and your conduct has been anything but good. Third, your abuses have been so continuous and your "plea" so blatantly unrepentent that I suspect you've probably entered a category mentioned under <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAN_eb66.html#Decision_to_ban" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN#Decision to ban</a>: "Some editors are so odious that not one of the administrators on Wikipedia would ever want to unblock them." You've done absolutely nothing to demonstrate that you've had a change of heart since you were blocked. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 00:30, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only "odious" thing here "Chris" has been your behaviour, AND WP's apparent support for a bigoted racist. If my unjustifiable ban had not been implemented in the first place, none of the rest would have ensued. WP has itself to blame for this........by allowing Ecemaml's racism to prevail. Making valid posts is NOT vandalism. It is NOT acceptable to label an edit "vandalism" simply because Ecemaml or another disagrees with it's content. I am NOT requesting "parole" as the original ban was totally and completely unjustifiable, and I have been forced to revert to extreme measures to at least get people to take the issue seriously. The original ban should and MUST be revoked. Parole is not necessary when one was innocent of the original charge. Gibraltarian.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A situation</span></h2>
<p>Some users, usually less experienced ones (anons, newbies), seem to be making a confusion: since becoming a Bureaucrat, I keep receiving e-mails of people requesting me to perform <a href="../../../o/v/e/Wikipedia%7EOversight_b3cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Oversight">oversight</a> actions (usually they don't call it that, but they ask me if I, as a Bureaucrat, could do something about something that, usually accidentally, got on Wikipedia and that they feel might disclose their identity). Granted, from what they write, about 60-70% of the requests, maybe more, are not suited for oversight intervention. In any case, I just keep referring them to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Special%7EListusers_oversight_04e9.html" title="Special:Listusers/oversight">Special:Listusers/oversight</a>, so that they can contact a user with oversight rights, which I do not have.

<dd>Voice of All has just informed me of a set of criteria about which I didn't know. I don't really have a problem with it, but I would still like the ArbCom to consider the factual reality I've mentioned. It may be because Bureaucratship is still far more visible than....hummm..."oversightship" (did I just make up a new word??). Maybe users are confusing the Rename tool with the ability to affect a user's edit history. But my experience in the almost two months as a [active] Bureaucrat is that I keep getting those requests. If the ArbCom would prefer to maintain the present criteria of assigning oversight only to users with CheckUser rights and members of the ArbCom itself, I'll just keep referring people to the list, it's not a problem, although maybe an inconvenient.

<p>Would this logic apply to all Bureaucrats? ie should all Bureaucrats receive oversight rights? My preference would be for this, but to add other constraints to reduce accidental damage like a requirement for two authorised people to effect a change.

<dd>Thank you, but that's not really an issue for all users to debate, at least not in this thread. Right now, under our current policy, the ArbCom decides about Oversight status. Voice of All mentioned to me that, <i>initially</i>, the ArbCom had decided to grant the tool to users who already had CheckUser and members and former members of the ArbCom itself. By Raul's latest comment here, perhaps the CheckUser thing was more of a practical coincidence, rather than an active option to give the tool to all users with CheckUser. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 23:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC) <i>P.S.: (edit conflict): written before Voice of All's latest post.</i>

<dd>Whenever someone asks me about a situation where they believe sensitive information might have been exposed, I look at any diffs provided, or the rationale given, and in my response I explain about oversight (as I said, very few people know it exists), and how what they are asking could only be achieved by means of this tool, as well as that Bureaucrats do not have this access automatically. I then explain that not all situations will warrant such a measure, and that, dependind on the situation, they should not expect to have their requests fulfilled — currently, I do refrain from saying "yes" or "no" to any request specifically, since I don't have the tool. Then I explain to them that they need to contact a user with Oversight rights, and explain where they can get a complete list os those users.<br />
All of this is to say that, as long as people are asking, even though I'm not using the tool itself, I'm already doing work related to those requests. If I had the tool, I would be able to either grant or deny the request at once, instead of all the explaining I'm doing currently. In other words, the deed is [being] done, at least as far as me doing extra work related to Oversight. If I got the tool, the only thing that would be different is that <i>part of that work</i> (that related to whatever requests can be granted) would change inasmuch as I would be able to carry out the request, instead of sending people over to the list to contact someone else — since when denying a request (which is in itself also something that would be new) I would still do the explaining as to "why not". <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 04:26, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The catch here is that so far any method of contacting an arbcom member should work at the moment, as arbcom hasn't clarified the process yet (and in a case like requesting oversight, you'd think the people who needed to have the permission would know one of the arbcom people personally anyway) so I haven't clarified the page yet. It's still all quite new, and when they decide on how to proceed, assuming I find out, I'll update <a href="../../../o/v/e/WP%7EOVER_de86.html" title="WP:OVER">WP:OVER</a>.

<dd>The main issue is that we don't have an established, formal format for requesting (yet?). What is clear is that you need to ask the ArbCom. In theory, you could email an ArbCom member and ask him/her to forward the request to the mailing list. For transparency reasons, I would say that the preferred format would be to request here, on this talk page. <i>If necessary</i>, you might email a couple of ArbCom members to let them know you've posted here requesting something. The ArbCom will likely take a couple of days to see if there would be any objection to granting the tool to the requestor. After that, if approved, someone from the ArbCom will go to Meta and post at the local Requests for Permissions (then the question becomes finding a Steward online to carry out the request). This seems to be the better, more transparent way of requesting the tool, at least until, as Kylu has said, the ArbCom decides to specify a format for requesting. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 17:29, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Would ArbCom deliberate first, or could an individual arbitor simply state "No"? Does approval work "majority rule" or in similar means as cases, or would granting require a unanimous decision?

"Flag", "bit"... those names don't really describe the work and the responsibility that one takes on by being given a new level of access.

<p>I'm a little concerned with our forum for public requests for CheckUser. Used to be that Mackensen and Essjay were sharing the bulk of the work there, but with Essjay temporarily inactive, Mackensen is doing most of the work alone (with occasional help from UninvitedCompany). I would urge that some of the users with CheckUser access (most of them are arbitrators, hence my post here) start visiting that forum every now and then. Alternatively, I would urge the ArbCom to appoint more CheckUsers. Maybe VoA and Thatcher, the more active clerks, could provide us with a more accurate scenario, but IMHO, it is never advisible to have 90% of the work (sometimes 100%) on the shoulders of just one user (or even two, when Essjay returns). <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 23:48, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since checkuser is not, nor should be, a large group, its unlikely for the page to be managed with checkusers just passing by. We need more "regulars", a group of people, who as a whole, can manage to fit in some time every day or two to run some checks. Most checkuser are often busy with other tasks, often ArbCom related, as that tends to be quite a "time suck". Even for two regulars, it can still be a lot of work, and recently, Essjay has been away. Now that Mackensen is also away around Labor Day, there is no one left to man the page. It only takes about three "regulars" to comfortable run the page, or even two given that enough other checkusers will chime in from time to time. Given that, I think we should focus on a) getting another user checkuser to focus on RFCU, and b) encourage all people with the tool to, if they have the time, occasionally chime in and check up on it, even if only to do one of the simplier cases. If there really is not the time for this, then perhaps another CU can be appointed, though en Wikipedia already has quite a handfull of them.<b><a href="../../../v/o/i/User_talk%7EVoice_of_All_cf88.html" title="User talk:Voice of All"><font color="blue">Voice</font><font color="darkblue">-of-</font><font color="black">All</font></a></b> 02:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Problem is, of the 14 users with CheckUser access, only three have used the tool to answer public requests with some degree of regularity: Essjay, Mackensen and UninvitedCompany. And of these, only the first two were indeed regulars on RCU. Then it was one, and now, as it seems, there are no regulars there. As Voice of All said, people who are already involved with time-consuming tasks, such as the Arbitrators, are less likely to get involved in yet another "dog work" (as Cecropia might put it) such as RCU, but Arbitrators are the majority of the users with access to the tool at this point, so it could be difficult to get someone to become a regular on RCU. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 04:29, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think ArbCom members know enough people who can be trusted that they can invite them to apply for CU. Not everyone invited will want to do this sort of unpleasant work, of course. If ArbCom doesn't act, then at some point dissatisfied users will start making requests directly on the talk pages of ArbCom members. Sooner or later it will get taken care of, it's just a question of how proactive ArbCom will be about this issue. If people see this as a major issue, it may be perfectly appropriate to ask candidates in the next ArbCom election about how much attention they will devote to CU, and base their votes in part on the answers they get. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 01:36, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a> has abused her Admin Privileges</span></h2>
<p>Please note first of all that I am writing on behalf of <a href="../../../r/u/e/User%7ERueben_lys_c4ed.html" title="User:Rueben lys">User:rueben_lys</a> who is blocked from editing, and who I personally know. This user name is not a sock puppet.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/u/e/User%7ERueben_lys_c4ed.html" title="User:Rueben lys">User:rueben_lys</a> was blocked for ten hours by <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a> while creating the article <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raid_on_Jaffna_University_7197.html" title="Raid on Jaffna University">Raid on Jaffna University</a>. User Zoey insisted on placing a tag stating that the article lacked context while the article was being developed (see User talk pages under heading Raid on Jaffna University). User rueben_lys insisted that the taster to the article was short but clear and the introduction that he was writing at the time would place it in context. He removed the tag at the time and proceeded to carry on expanding on the article. User Zoey however, reverted to re-instate the tag and engaged in a revert edit war with user rueben_lys. She reverted the page three times (in violation, rueben_lys believes, of the three revert rule) to include the tag which rueben_lys had removed while building on what he believed was adequate introduction, and proceeded to caution rueben_lys that any further removal would lead to Zoey blocking rueben_lys. Rueben_lys removed the tag at this time since an adequate introduction had already been made. However, Zoey blocked the editor for ten hours.</p>
<p>Rueben_lys observes that Zoey</p>
<ul>
<li>Has herself violated the three revert rule.</li>
<li>Has blocked an editor who was not vandalising the page but attempting to contribute.</li>
<li>Did not invite a discussion on adequacy of the introduction "<i><b>before blocking</b></i>" the editor.</li>
<li>Has essentially <i><b>enforced her personal views</b></i> as to wether the introduction is or is not adequate.</li>
<li>Has blocked rueben_lys to essentially gain advantage in an edit war, when an appropriate course of action would have been to protect the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>rueben_lys has made extensive contributions to wikipedia since his entry a few months ago, and believes that Zoey's actions are an abuse of her admin privileges (if any) . He therefore requests that Zoey be disciplined and measures be taken to ensure that she does not repeat such actions in the future. rueben_lys would also recommend to the Arbitration Committee that Zoey's admin priviledges be revoked.N Watson 00:55, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not think this was malicious but a big mistake. The article had context but not in a fully understandable manner unless you read the news. The LTTE is quite infamous for its activities, especially recently. Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam, and the IPKF, Indian Peace Keeping Force, are very much real things. I think Zoe just made an honest mistake and hopefully everyone can move on from here in a positive way, this was a real battle and Rueben did a wonderful job creating the article because there is much content to be added and hopefully he will expand it to create an article on Operation Pawan in its entirety. So in closing Zoe could have googled LTTE, but the article didnt say who LTTE is (I fixed this) or who the IPKF were, so it may have not been clear, the context that is. Just my 2 and a half cents. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 17:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On second thought, the background section was already down apparently when Zoe added the context tag, the background specified it was about the IPKF, LTTE (listed as Tamils) and Sri Lanka and listed all that in Wikilinks. I still think it was an honest mistake though, but the block was obviously not warranted and should be noted in the users block log as such as context was apparent. Just my 3 cents. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 17:27, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know what you were looking at I seen the dif's and that is why I changed what I was saying. The background section points out <i>Indo-Sri-Lankan accord</i>, <i>Sri Lankan Civil War</i>, <i>Tamil rebels</i> and Wikilinks all of them except Tamil but does wikilink <i>Operation Poomalai</i> and <i>IPKF</i>. I am just saying you obviously made a mistake as the background section says quite a bit and mentions plenty and provides wikilinks for further information. Considering they were still adding sources, also which you could have checked, and information during the time you aded the first and last tag, its obvious the context was there and it was all just a mistake. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 21:03, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It wsn't a mistake.

<dd>I am not sure where the lack of clarity is, it says the Tamil rebels fought the IPKF breaking the Indo-Sri-Lankan Accord during the Sri Lankan Civil War and that the raid on the school was part of the Operation Pawan ... I mean the information was there, I am starting to worry now that you cannot even admit to being wrong. The article was being worked on by the editor and the background provided plenty of information, enough so for me to google Operation Pawan and easily find information to add. LTTE and IPKF could have been defined, but LTTE is so common now in media and was wikilinked ... --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 01:17, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The first sentence needs to clearly say what it is. We don't even have an article on Operation Pawan, so without an explanation as to what that is, the first sentence, the topic sentence, which is supposed to explain what we're talking about, tells us nothing. It is not the reader's responsibility to dig through the article, the links and anything else the editor may think doesn't need to be explained, to understand an article. It is the editor's responsibility to be crystal clear. And you don't do that by removing a context header.

<dd>I am not going to sit here and argue with you, <i>The Raid on Jaffna University was the first of the operations launched by the IPKF aimed at disarming the LTTE by force and securing the town of Jaffna in the opening stages of Operation Pawan</i> seems pretty informative. The article is about a raid on the school by the IPKF to disarm the LTTE at the beginning of Operation Pawan. Yes there is no operation Pawan article, however the user was still editing and the intro sentence isnt responcible for defining everything, it doesnt say who the IPKF or LTTE are either. The War on Terrorism article doesnt explain who NATO is and what 9/11 was other then an attack. That is the purpose of the rest of the article, to go into more detail. As I keep saying, you should have just waited and it seems to be more of an issue of you not know who these groups were then it lacking context as you even thought they were fictional. Your ability to gauge context when you refuse to click a wikilink is kind of disingenuous. Like me putting the same tag on the WOT article stating the sentence lacks context because the opening sentence doesnt say who NATO is or what happened in this "September 11 attacks" --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 02:24, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Scarlet Letter</span></h2>
<p>I would like some help in understanding the position of Arbcom and my ability to respond to a situation. I was put under an Arbcom ruling under a previous username, zer0faults, which stated I edited articles tenditiously. Since then I have been the subject of much animosity and often instead of discussing counter points, people have taken to responding solely by stating my Arbcom ruling, as some means of pacifying my points, or possibly arguing that my points are not valid. I have taken this to AN/I numerous times about a specific editor however the admins simply state we "both need to cool it". I have expressed that I feel this is being done primarily to bait me, and secondary to harass me. I have some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can see Derex made a vote on an AfD. I asked them if they felt google hits was a good enough reason and if they would include youtube.com videos then. They responded by citing my Arbcom ruling. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Votergate&amp;diff=84817645&amp;oldid=84815822" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Votergate&amp;diff=84817645&amp;oldid=84815822" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>

<li>I am not even sure what to call this other then harrassment.

<p>I know this is not what Arbcom intended, or at least I hope its not. However if its not, then what is my possible recourse for this? I feel as though this users actions are constant attempts to bait me, and others users are simply ignoring me because of the ruling. I am not a disruptive editor and I have written 5 articles for Wikipedia so far, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Matos_025f.html" title="John Matos">John Matos</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimberly_Osorio_41ef.html" title="Kimberly Osorio">Kimberly Osorio</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jaysh_Muhammad_7aa1.html" title="Jaysh Muhammad">Jaysh Muhammad</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Abud_Network_7abd.html" title="Al-Abud Network">Al-Abud Network</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Sinbad_2222.html" title="Operation Sinbad">Operation Sinbad</a>, and have participated in improving numerous other articles. So I ask Arbcom what can I do about this, and is this really the intended purpose of an Arbcom ruling, as some brand of stigma? --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 13:11, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a bit late a reply, sorry. I think you'd do better to request clarification of the ruling at <a href="../../../r/f/a/Wp%7Erfar.html#Requests_for_clarification" title="Wp:rfar">Wp:rfar#Requests_for_clarification</a>, that way you can have the opinion from the horse's mouth.

Arbitration Committee beta logo</div>
</div>

<p>Hi! I am TrackerTV. I once was a backstander figure in an RfAR that closed 2 months ago. I tried to develop a logo for the Arbitration Committee. My idea's not up yet, but here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wide, blue kerned text saying WIKIPEDIA at the top.</li>
<li>A Venn diagram style circle overlap, one showing part of an A and the other showing a part of a C. Where the circles overlap, the letter W is on top of the letter P.</li>
<li>Two lines of wide, grey kerned text saying ARBITRATION on one line and COMMITTEE on the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will upload this logo soon. Happy arbitrating!</p>

<dd>Well, I can't guarantee the accuracy of my answer, but since Tranche Gamma's terms expire December 31, 2006, I'd guess that the new arbitrators start either the same day (if the switch isn't at midnight) or the next day (if the switch is at midnight.) <a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPicaroon9288_6280.html" title="User talk:Picaroon9288">Þicaroon</a> 21:15, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
