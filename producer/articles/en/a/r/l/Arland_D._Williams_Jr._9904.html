<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_13.html" title="January 13">January 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, during an extraordinary period of freezing weather, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Florida_Flight_90_c728.html" title="Air Florida Flight 90">Air Florida Flight 90</a> took off from nearby <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport_b7c3.html" title="Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport">Washington National Airport</a>, failed to gain altitude, and crashed into the bridge, where it hit six cars and a truck on the bridge, killing four motorists.</p>
<p>After the devastating crash on the bridge, the plane then continued forward and plunged into the freezing <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potomac_River_3eff.html" title="Potomac River">Potomac River</a>. Soon only the tail section which had broken off remained afloat. Only six of the airliner's 79 occupants (74 passengers and 5 crew members) were able to escape the sinking plane in the middle of the ice-choked river.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/l/Arland_D._Williams_Jr._9904.html" title="Edit section: Passing the lifeline">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Passing the lifeline</span></h2>
<p>News cameramen watched helplessly from the bridge, recording the disaster for the rest of the world to see. There appeared to be no way to reach the survivors in the water. Bystanders helped fellow passerby <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Olian_7fad.html" title="Roger Olian">Roger Olian</a> with a makeshift rope began an attempt to rescue them. Then, hope arrived at approximately 4:20 p.m. EST when <i>Eagle 1</i>, a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Park_Police_72dc.html" title="United States Park Police">United States Park Police</a> helicopter based at <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anacostia_Park_e3cd.html" title="Anacostia Park">Anacostia Park</a> in Washington DC and manned by <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviator.html" title="Aviator">pilot</a> <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_W._Usher_a9cf.html" title="Donald W. Usher">Donald W. Usher</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramedic.html" title="Paramedic">paramedic</a> <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melvin_E._Windsor_0d5e.html" title="Melvin E. Windsor">Melvin E. (Gene) Windsor</a>, arrived and assisted with the rescue operation at great risk to themselves. At one point in the operation the helicopter was so close to the ice-clogged river that the skids went beneath the surface of the water.</p>
<p>According to the other five survivors, one passenger was pinned to the fuselage of the plane, but continued to help the others reach the rescue ropes being dropped by the hovering helicopter, repeatedly passing the line to others instead of using it himself. After lifting and towing two badly injured passengers to shore one at a time, an attempt was made to use two lines to haul three more, but as the tow to shore was underway, two of the three fell back into the icy water.</p>
<p>As fatigue set in, one of the survivors was too weak to grab the line again, so another bystander, a government office assistant <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenny_Skutnik_bb75.html" title="Lenny Skutnik">Lenny Skutnik</a>, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water, and swam out to assist her. The helicopter then proceeded to where the other had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor dropped from the safety of the helicopter into the water to attach a line to her. While the other five were being taken to shore by the helicopter, the tail section of the wrecked Boeing 737 shifted and sank further into the water, dragging Arland D. Williams Jr. under the water with it.</p>
<p>The next day, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Washington_Post_5b91.html" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> described his heroism:</p>
<dl>
<dd>He was about 50 years old, one of half a dozen survivors clinging to twisted wreckage bobbing in the icy Potomac when the first helicopter arrived. To the copter's two-man Park Police crew he seemed the most alert. Life vests were dropped, then a flotation ball. The man passed them to the others. On two occasions, the crew recalled last night, he handed away a life line from the hovering machine that could have dragged him to safety. The helicopter crew - who rescued five people, the only persons who survived from the jetliner - lifted a woman to the riverbank, then dragged three more persons across the ice to safety. Then the life line saved a woman who was trying to swim away from the sinking wreckage, and the helicopter pilot, Donald W. Usher, returned to the scene, but the man was gone.</dd>

<p>The passenger who had survived the crash and had repeatedly given up the rescue lines to other survivors before drowning was later identified as a forty-six-year-old bank examiner from the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_Bank_b425.html" title="Federal Reserve Bank">Federal Reserve Bank</a> of <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta%2C_Georgia_4e3e.html" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta</a>, <b>Arland D.

<p>The four other heroes of the Air Florida rescue who also risked their lives but survived were honored shortly after the disaster.</p>
<p>It took some time to investigate and establish without any doubt Williams' identity and extraordinarily heroic and selfless behavior. His actions caused him to stand out even among the other four outstanding heroes of that tragic day.</p>
