	    <p>I have cleaned this article up a bit, but I think it needs more on the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did Aral have any family apart from his parents? I remember a reference to an older brother but not his name or what happened to him.</li>
<li>IIRC, he had an affair with Ges Vorrutyer, and possibly other homosexual relationships?</li>
<li>Are you sure that there was more than one incident of Aral killing a subordinate for disobedience? Cordelia tells her mother that she knows of only three people Aral killed that weren't in the line of duty, presumably his wife's lovers and the one who ordered the execution of the 200 Komarran leaders.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EAral_Vorkosigan_dae0.html" title="Edit section: Answering a couple of Ekaterin's questions, adding a few of my own">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Answering a couple of Ekaterin's questions, adding a few of my own</span></h2>
<p>-- Yes, Aral had an older brother, although we don't know how much older he was and we don't know what his name was. This is confirmed in "Barrayar" where Aral has a vicious verbal fight with his father and lashes Piotr with the bald statement, "MY firstborn will live!". If both of Piotr's sons were named according to the usual Barrayaran pattern, we can deduce that Aral's older brother was named (something) Xav Vorkosigan, since his maternal grandfather was Prince Xav Vorbarra. Barrayaran naming conventions decree that the firstborn son receives the first name of his paternal grandfather as his first name, and the first name of his maternal grandfather as his middle name; the second son receives the middle name of his maternal grandfather as his first name and the middle name of his paternal grandfather as his middle name. By working backwards, we can also deduce that Prince Xav Vorbarra had the middle name "Aral".</p>
<p>It works like this:</p>
<p>Aral and Cordelia have two sons. Aral's father is Piotr Pierre Vorkosigan. (P1 = Piotr, P2 = Pierre). Cordelia Naismith's father is Miles Mark Naismith (M1 = Miles, M2= Mark.) A point of contention in the book "Barrayar" is that Aral and Cordelia's firstborn son is supposed to be named "Piotr Miles" (P1 M1), but Piotr Vorkosigan refuses to allow his name to be given to their "mutant" child. In "Brothers in Arms" Miles tells his younger clone-brother that his Barrayaran name would be "Mark Pierre" (M2 P2).</p>
<p>We only know the name of one of Aral's grandfathers, and that's his maternal grandfather Prince Xav Vorbarra. So, Aral's older brother would have been (P1 M1), (something) Xav, and Aral himself is (M2 P2), Aral (something), since we haven't been told Aral's middle name.</p>
<p>However, we also know that this practice isn't universally followed, or Gregor Vorbarra would not be "Gregor", he'd be "Ezar (something)". But it may be that this practice is not followed in the Imperial family as it might create too much confusion about who exactly is the Emperor.</p>
<p><br />
Now for my questions:</p>
<p>-- Where does the information that Piotr wasn't killed at the same time as Princess Olivia and Aral's older brother, but was subject to a separate assassination attempt, come from? This seems to contradict what Aral says when he tells Cordelia, in "Barrayar," that he can't imagine why Yuri thought it would be all right to "kill my mother and leave my father alive." It is stated quite plainly that Mad Emperor Yuri only set out to murder members of his own family, those who might have a claim on the Imperial throne and be a threat to him; Piotr Vorkosigan had no such claim and was therefore not targeted by Yuri. This was a major miscalculation on Yuri's part, because it inspired Piotr to go to Ezar and throw his substantial military ability and resources behind Ezar in order to permanently remove Yuri and put Ezar on the Imperial throne in Yuri's stead. The only reason Aral survived the attack that killed his mother and older brother is that "Yuri's goons" left Aral for last, and Piotr's guards arrived in time to save Aral from the attackers.</p>
<p><br />
-- Yes, Aral and Ges Vorrutyer were lovers after the death of Aral's first wife. Cordelia confirms this in "Barrayar" when she talks about their relationship, and speculates that Ges Vorrutyer's obsession with Aral contributed to his violent and sadistic insanity. She also finds sketches Aral did of Ges, including, it is strongly implied, at least one nude. Furthermore, Sargeant Bothari has a memory flash of witnessing Ges Vorrutyer pushing Aral to the war and kissing him aggressively during the lead up to the disastrous Escobaran war.</p>
<p>-- As a side note to the death of Aral's first wife, listed as a suicide: Aral apparently harbors some doubts about this verdict. He says to Miles in "A Civil Campaign" that Aral himself was widely suspected of having killed his first wife for her infidelity. He did not do so, but he says he was never completely sure that his father, Piotr, who arranged the marriage, did not kill his first wife to avenge the family honor. Miles acknowledges that he can see his notably bloody-handed grandfather possibly setting something like that up, and asks Aral if he ever asked Piotr whether or not he did it. Aral says he did not, because: "...What would I have done if he had said 'yes'?"</p>
<p>-- As part of Aral's military career on Barrayar, he spent some time (perhaps as long as a few years) as the commander of "Camp Permafrost" on Kyril Island. ("During the time my career was in eclipse," as Aral puts it to his son.) This is the same place Miles was assigned to as the Weather Officer at the start of "The Vor Game". Aral spent most of his time there drunk. Kyril Island is also where the meddling Alexi Vormoncrief ends up assigned as the end of "A Civil Campaign."</p>
<p>-- Aral's crew aboard the "General Vorkraft" weren't elite. They were the dregs of the service, and the Vorkraft was nicknamed "Vorkosigan's Leper Colony" by the rest of the Barrayaran military.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EAral_Vorkosigan_dae0.html" title="Edit section: Answering the &quot;was there more than one incident of killing a subordinate&quot; question">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Answering the "was there more than one incident of killing a subordinate" question</span></h3>
<p>I've just been rereading the early novels (Shards of Honor and Barrayar). It's pretty explicit that there <i>weren't</i> other incidents. As well as the passage in <i>Shards of Honor</i> that Ekaterin highlights, there was one in <i>Barrayar</i>, just before the attack of the soltoxin gas grenade: that he has "...committed three sheer murders and but for the grace of God and Sergeant Bothari would have comitted a fourth".</p>
<p>-Murder 1: Wife's lover No. 1 (who died with a joke on his lips) in the first duel. -Murder 2: Wife's lover No. 2 (who wouldn't fight) in the second duel. -Murder 3: The Political Officer at Komarr</p>
<p>-Near-murder: Ges Vorrutyer.</p>
<p>Obviously, he counts strangling subordinates as murder - and he's only done it once (unless he is lying to Cordelia, who is demonstrably the only person in the Universe with whom he is completely honest.</p>
<p>I propose deletion of "He murdered a fair number of people to avenge his honor, which gave him a reputation of being a cold-blooded killer." in the second paragraph of the introduction and "Throughout Vorkosigan's quick rise to the top, there were many incidents between Aral and his subordinates. If a subordinate disobeyed a direct order, and the consequences majorly offended Aral's honor, Aral simply killed the man with his bare hands. He did not tolerate people who dishonored him. As previously stated, this gave Aral Vorkosigan a very brutal reputation." in the second paragraph of the "Imperial Service" bit. In the following sentence, "One such incident ..." to be edited to "The near-bloodless victory was marred by an incident ..."</p>
<p>I'm hesitant to just dive in and do it myself as I'm new here and don't want to overstep the mark.</p>
