<p>This list is an open list, there may be words missing in the letters I have already finished with. There are also many words which are of debated origin and many words with arab etymologies ,which are not mentioned in the RAE. An example of this may be "zorra": Zorra means fox but also prostitute. The "léxico de Julio Casares" of 1966 associates this term to "Surriya" (concubine) in Arabic. A case, of one word with 2 meanings and 2 etymologies: The mammal from Portuguese and the prostitute from Arabic. This seems to be quite common in Spanish.--<a href="../../../g/u/z/User%7EGuzman_ramirez_1638.html" title="User:Guzman ramirez">Guzman ramirez</a> 12:44, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It would save us a lot of time and effort if we do not include a definition for each word. Just the derivation would be good enough. But if it easy to add the definion, then I see no problem, I just think that there is a lot of work to do on this page, so we should focus on the etymology. --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 14:46, 16 June 2006 (UTC) <a href="http://www.sgci.mec.es/be/media/pdfs/articulos/Mosaico083.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.sgci.mec.es/be/media/pdfs/articulos/Mosaico083.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgci.mec.es/be/media/pdfs/articulos/Mosaico083.pdf</a></p>

<p>Please adhere to the following format when making additions to the list (it would save us a lot of time and effort):</p>
<ol>
<li><b>word</b>: translation. From <i>word</i> "translation."</li>
</ol>
<p>#'''word''': translation. From ''word'' "translation."</p>
<p>For example</p>
<ol>
<li><b>aceite</b>: oil. From Arabic <i>az-zeit</i> "oil."</li>
</ol>
<p>If a Spanish word has more than one translation, then separate each with a semicolon.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>abalorio</b>: cheap jewelery; jewelery beads. From Andalusi Arabic <i>al ballúri</i> "made of glass."</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Arabic word has the same meaning as the Spanish word, then add "of the same meaning"</p>
<p>For example</p>
<ol>
<li><b>albaquía</b>: the remainder. From <i>al-baqeya</i> of the same meaning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also don't capitalize the first letter of the description unless it is a name. For example</p>
<ol>
<li><b>abalorio</b>: cheap jewelery; jewelery beads. From Andalusi Arabic <i>al ballúri</i>: "Made of glass."</li>

<li>azufre</li>
<li>baldosa, from my point of view, the same origin as balda. Both are cosidered by Spanish Academy from uncertain origin. First time I realized the origin was that, reading a dictionary of Arabic, I felt excited, thinking that I was the first to discover it, (what here is called Original Research) reading in the DRAE that uncertain origin. I was going to write to the Academy when I saw it in an old ethymological dictionary. So it is known, but the Academy doesn´t accept it, I don´t know why. It is a charming story: The "Vía de la Plata" ("Silver Way") hasn´t nothing to do with silver, but with Blata, or Balta (vowels move frequently in Arabic), that means pavimented. Arabs saw the Roman Road, that conserved its paviment, and as it was almost the only way that was like that, they called it "The Pavimented". From Balta, Blata and Plata. So Balda, that has a relationed meaning comes from Balta, and Baldosa is another form of transformation, that conserved more exactly its original meaning. Does anybody have an opinion about this?</li>

<p>As for 'azufre', 'sulfur' or 'sulpur' existed in Latin; on the other hand, the Spanish word's prefix 'a-' does suggest that an Arabic form replaced the native form of Latin origin. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 13:56, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why are the Toponyms of Portugal in here? Isn't it about the Spanish Language? Should be only about Spain.</p>
<p>Yeah well there was no distinction between Spain and Portugal during the Al-Andalus period so I thought that toponyms should be those of Iberia generally. Maybe we should change the title to "Toponyms of Iberia"- that way the British colony of Gibraltar could also be included.--<a href="../../../g/u/z/User%7EGuzman_ramirez_1638.html" title="User:Guzman ramirez">Guzman ramirez</a> 22:08, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Lisboa (Lisbon). Capital of Portugal. Derived from original Arabic name: al-'Ishbūnah in Arabic Ulishbona.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, there was no distinction, but the toponims should be only of Spain and not of Portugal. Otherwise you would have to add the Portuguese words of Arabic origin if you want to use the fact that there was no distinction between Spain and Portugal during the Al-Andalus period.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Lisboa (Lisbon). Capital of Portugal. Derived from original Arabic name: al-'Ishbūnah in Arabic ."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is wrong, Lisboa derived from the name the Suevi or the Wisigoth gave: Ulishbona. The Arabs came much later and arabised the name. Check the wikipedia page <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hist%C3%B3ria_de_Lisboa" class="external free" title="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hist%C3%B3ria_de_Lisboa" rel="nofollow">http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hist%C3%B3ria_de_Lisboa</a></dd>

<p>Ok I will check that and delete Lisbon. Although it seems the name is not of visigothic but of Phoenician origin -Alis Usbo (Safe port).--<a href="../../../g/u/z/User%7EGuzman_ramirez_1638.html" title="User:Guzman ramirez">Guzman ramirez</a> 22:52, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The rule is an elastic one, as explained. When they are obvious derivations they must not be included. The word cifra in Spanish means "number" and for Spanish speakers it is quite obvious and straightforward that descifrar is a derivation of cifra.--<a href="../../../g/u/z/User%7EGuzman_ramirez_1638.html" title="User:Guzman ramirez">Guzman ramirez</a> 20:00, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The old title, "Spanish words of Arabic origin" was inaccurate because some Arabic words are themselves loanwords (from Persian, Greek, Latin, Aramaic, etc.). Recently, the title was changed to "Arabic influence on the Spanish language", which is correct, but a little vague if vocabulary's all that's in question. Now, if we were to eventually expand the article to encompass influence on grammar and/or pronunciation, then the current title would be very fortunate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while my suggestion undergoes consideration, I have made corresponding changes in the body of the text. These are not disruptive, unlike renaming a page. I also updated the category labels at the bottom of the article to use the current article title. Finally, I updated the internal link to the English vocabulary page, since I have just totally edited it AND changed its title.</p>
<p>I don't intend to change the title of this article -- I leave that to the people who have built this article, in case they come to agree with me.&#160;:) <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 17:24, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just removed baño. A few others are doubtful: droga, dado, to judge by the etymologies in some leading English language dictionaries at dictionary.reference.com. Beware of overenthusiasm. But by the same dictionaries, the claims for droga and dado are plausible. Could it be that the English language dictionaries need to consult etymological scholarship from Spain more than they have? <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 07:07, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No overenthusiasm here, Hurmata. Go to www.rae.es the royal academy of the Spanish language to find the etymology of these words. --<a href="../../../g/u/z/User%7EGuzman_ramirez_1638.html" title="User:Guzman ramirez">Guzman ramirez</a> 16:19, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm. But RAE does agree that baño is from Latin. And as for dado, they say *quizá* del ár. clás. a'dad.</p>
<p>Thanks for referring me to the dictionary at the RAE Website. I must add its etymologies to the list of Arabic loanwords in English.

<p>Yes but baño in the sense of prison is also of latin etymology and we are not talking in the sense of bath or bathroom. hmmm... this is a difficult one because I clearly remember reading the arabic root of the term baño although i dont remember the meaning of the word which is not of common usage in Spanish. I dont have the hard copy of the RAE where I read it on me at the moment but ill add the etymology and meaning as soon as i get my hands of it. www.rae.es gives 16 definitions of baño... There is also the possibility that the word has been eliminated from the dictionary by the RAE as an anachronism.--<a href="../../../g/u/z/User%7EGuzman_ramirez_1638.html" title="User:Guzman ramirez">Guzman ramirez</a> 18:57, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The list of words is getting too large. I highly recommend a table like the one I just did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arabic_influence_on_the_Spanish_language&amp;diff=94406530&amp;oldid=94119108" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arabic_influence_on_the_Spanish_language&amp;diff=94406530&amp;oldid=94119108" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In my opinion it eases a lot the navigation. The table has the following format:</p>
<table class="wikitable">

<th>Arabic root</th>
<th>Description</th>

<td>column 1</td>
<td>column 2</td>

</pre>
<p>To enter a new entry to the table you have to add this:</p>

<p>Just an outsider's comment ... ,,, There is, of course, Wikipedia's general preference against "list pages" but this page seems to be trying to be something more than that with the lists as simply supporting information. IMHO the article should focus more in the direction of an intellectually meaningful discussion of these influences. Specifically</p>
<ul>
<li>There needs to be more formal discussion on how the influences occurred. I.e. briefly summarize when the main borrowing happened, discuss Mozarabic as an intermediary for the borrowing, discuss what kinds of borrowings were most common, what were the effects on grammar and phonology apart from vocabulary, etc.</li>
<li>Any lists should be essentially an "Appendix" at the end of the article.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Yes. I myself am especially interested in the chronology. But my preliminary literature search led me to suspect that there has been little published in English about the history of Arabic loanwords in Spanish, OR in English, and also to suspect that the Spanish language literature is held at hardly any university libraries here in the USA. In this article, I have listed several books by Spaniards that are devoted to the topic -- and there's been a lot of new scholarship since 1980. We need some Spaniards to acudir a unas universidades españolas y distill the contents of these books and add the information to the article.</dd>

<p>Well I agree with both of you.

<p>Not a loan word, but an unusual contraction formed under pressure of the Arabic "ustath" (don't know spelling). If the article is on influence, and not just loan words, that looks like a fairly major omission. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 22:36, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is much which is missing in this article and the influences of arabic are many and are not restricted to loanwords... I agree that Usted must be at least partially influenced by arabic ustaadh and many sources support this idea. The question is whether we should focus on completing the vast loanword section first before moving onto other influences or whether we should work on everything at the same time opening new sections now.</p>
<p>Another very visible influence is the use of the suffix -í e.g. Ceutí, Marbellí etc...</p>

<p>No I dont think so, but perhaps it would be preferable to start doing some research on other influences and posting findings here and once we have something substantial we can work on how to organize it into sections on the article.

<p>Maybe I'm wrong but the description of "he" seems to be totally off. It is not an adverb at all but a verb, "haber" used in the same place as "have" in the perfect tenses of English. "He" is the 1st person singular present form of this verb. Therefore in the example reworked below, "he" corresponds to "have", "lo" to "it". Te lo <b>he</b> dicho meaning I <b>have</b> told you it</p>
<p>Te lo he dicho you it (I) have told</p>
<p>That's just my 2 cents, I haven't actually edited the article because I am not a native speaker of Spanish- if anyone reading this is please let me know if this correction would be valid or not.

<dd>Jesus Fucking Christ, "he" an adverb? OK "Guzman Ramirez", how do you explain "te lo hemos/han/hubiera/etc. dicho"?

<dd>A couple of things. Hurmata, please read <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>. This is not the way to conduct discussion. I have to say that Guzman Ramirez seems to me to be very balanced, and does not seem motivated by proving or disproving Arabic influence on Spanish, just listing the evidence. But the point here is not an editor's bias, but how to improve wikipedia. On the issue (Te lo he dicho) I think the removal was correct. But there was another usage (with which I am not familiar) 'he aqui', which was also deleted: can someone provide a reference for that. As for 'hasta', it's the first time I've heard of a Latin origin for this, but at least a reference was provided (can't connect to the site right now, though). <a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 05:36, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>He aquí translates idiomatically as "behold!", "well get a load of this", and such like. For example, see it used several times in a passage from the Gospel of Matthew, <a href="http://spanish.about.com/library/weekly/aa041700a.htm" class="external free" title="http://spanish.about.com/library/weekly/aa041700a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://spanish.about.com/library/weekly/aa041700a.htm</a>. "I have here" is obviously well suited to be a metaphor for "I vehemently call your attention to something that is already PREsent to you or that I am about to preSENT to you". The same Web site has another page where it lists "he aquí" in a list of idioms based on the verb "haber" (Google "he aqui").</dd>

<p>The claim I deleted about "te lo he dicho" is such an affront to common sense, and such an affront to the intelligence of anyone who has even a modest proficiency in Romance languages, that it is an act of intellectual vandalism.

<p>How is Drmaik's latest post misleading? Because it is formatted so that it mooshes together comments on two events in such a way that he seems to be talking about one; and because even in his/her preceding posts he does not make clear what he's referring to. Other persons would have to scrutinize keenly the last few hours of posts AND of contributions to the *article* to realize what all is going on.</p>
<p>Specifically, I edited the entry *in the article* for 'hasta' and cited www.rae.es. Drmaik has now within the last half day written two posts in which he/she argues I misinterpreted what RAE says. But my charge of intellectual vandalism (made within the last half day) WAS NOT directed in particular at any previous version of the entry for 'hasta'!

<p>In this usage, 'he aquí' can be translated variously as '*so*, ...', 'there you have it', 'so you *see*, ...". Obviously this is an extension of 'he aquí' meaning 'behold!'. 'Behold!' means "I insistently draw your attention to something you can see or hear", whereas in this polemic, it means "I insistently draw you attention to a conclusion I draw from the argument I am making." I have noted above that 'behold!' in turn is a natural extension of the plain meaning of 'he aquí', which is "I have here". By the way, that is of course the *usual* meaning, as in "I have here a copy of the new X". <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 15:59, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thankyou for your support Drmaik. I am surprised at this sudden attack:-). I hope it signals that more people are willing to contribute to the article though.</p>
<p>Hurmata, to answer your questions, yes I am a native speaker of Spanish, and no Islam is not my religion neither of choice nor of birth. I have chosen to edit this article because I have knowledge of Arabic and an interest in etymology.</p>
<p>In any case, if you have any doubts or questions regarding the Spanish language, you can ask me, I will be glad to respond.</p>
<p>Indeed I was surprised myself at my own edit regarding "he". I had exactly the same thought myself. How can he be of Arabic origin if it is used in the sense of haber? Certainly it is not Arabic in that sense. I just left it that way because the www.rae.es gives an Arabic etymology for <i>he</i> in all its uses (including what I commonly felt and still feel to be a conjugation of haber). I thought it might be cleared up later on with some other source, and I certainly did not intend to commit "intelectual vandalism". In anycase the word should be mantained at least in the sense of "he aquí". As for your discussions regarding "hasta" I havent read them yet so I will post my opinion now in the section below. --<a href="../../../g/u/z/User%7EGuzman_ramirez_1638.html" title="User:Guzman ramirez">Guzman ramirez</a> 00:07, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Several hours ago, I edited the entry for this word, citing the entry for this word in the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy (RAE). Drmaik, as he/she announced within the preceding subheading deleted my edit arguing I had misinterpreted what RAE has to say. Drmaik has just repeated this argument, writing: "I can see how the entry at www.rae.es could be misunderstood in the way that was previously recorded." (By the way, the use of "recorded" is misleading because Drmaik never specified why h/s concluded I had misunderstood, h/s just asserted that I misunderstood.) I reply now that I did not misunderstand RAE. RAE says (in Spanish of course),</p>
<p>'hasta'. From Hispanic Arabic hatta, [which was] influenced by Latin 'ad ista', [meaning] 'to that'.</p>
<p>What nuance the RAE is proposing by saying "influenced by" rather than "from", I don't know what that nuance is. Nevertheless, I assert that it is logical to say that the Hispanic Arabic word comes from a Latin phrase, and that therefore it is Drmaik who misunderstands. Drmaik needs to explain to us how it is that he has correctly understood and I have incorrectly misunderstood. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurmata_87b9.html" title="User:Hurmata">Hurmata</a> 15:59, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I was requested to explain myself, I'll just say that Guzman has already explained it. The form 'hasta' was influenced by Latin. I'd always assumed the s appeared because of the affricate realisation (ts) that t sometimes has in <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moroccan_Arabic_fe40.html" title="Moroccan Arabic">Moroccan Arabic</a>, but that was an assumption, and that might be a recent phenomenon not found in Andalusi, and I don't think any other words have shown a similar influence. So the www.rae.es expalanation for hatta -&gt; hasta seems very reasonable. hatta is a classical Arabic word, for which no Latin origin is purported. <a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 05:54, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well the RAE is clear enough. The word is of Arabic origin. It is also influenced by the Latin ad ista. What is the problem?</p>
<p>It is not the Andalusi Arabic word Hatta which has been influenced by Latin but its later transformation into <i>Hasta</i> which has been influenced by Latin. Hatta is also used in classical arabic.</p>
<p>There is no nuance to understand. If you are saying what I think you are saying, you are mistaken.--<a href="../../../g/u/z/User%7EGuzman_ramirez_1638.html" title="User:Guzman ramirez">Guzman ramirez</a> 00:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have noted complaints by Hurmata regarding my insistence on temporarily mantaining the word <i>baño</i> in the list until I could find the source giving support to an Arabic etymology.</p>
<p>I have finally found it and it is my hard back copy of the 21st edition of the RAE Dicionario de la Lengua Española. Under the entry baño it says the following:</p>
<p><b>Baño</b>: (De or. inc.; cf. árabe bunayya <i>edificio</i>) Especie de corral grande o patio con aposentillos o chozas alrededor, en el cual los moros tenían encerrados a los cautivos.</p>
<p>So it is used in the sense of a prison. The question is whether RAE's proposed definition is correct... I am not so sure of it, since the proposed origin given in wikipedia entry "<a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagnio.html" title="Bagnio">bagnio</a>" seems equally plausible. Any opinions?</p>
