<p><a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurrians.html" title="Hurrians">Hurrians</a> were an <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian.html" title="Armenian">Armenian</a> tribe which migrated west from their homeland around the 3rd millennium BC. Haran was the capital of the Hurrians. "Har"-minni is the alternative way of saying "Ar"mani, which the "H" is silent and its pronounced as "Ar"mani. To this day Persians call Armenians by "Armani" from the 2300 BC Akkadian inscriptions referring to them as Armani. The land of Ararat or the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Highland_cca5.html" title="Armenian Highland">Armenian Highland</a> is the home of the "<a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a>"(<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Europeans_8f7a.html" title="Indo-Europeans">Indo-Europeans</a>) people. Armenians refer to themselves as "Aryaee" (Aryan) in their language. The root word "Ar" meaning Sun, Light, Fire (the same as the word "Hurri/Hur") which is used in a lot of words such as Ararat, Aratta, Armenia, Armeni, Armen, Arev, etc etc. The root word which in Semitic form is "Ur". Also, language changes over course of 1000 year time periods and when moving to different lands. Even today Armenians have different sounds with words like "H" and "Kh" = "X" (example of the word Hurri/Khurri). Arevmdahye's are South-Western Armenians and Arevelahye's are Eastern Armenians in Iran and modern Armenia. Since ancient times words were pronounced slightly different but yet same meanings and same ethnic peoples. So the words Hurrian and Aryan are pronounced different but yet remain the same word and meaning.</p>
<p>Tigran the Great's crown (look here <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenians.html" title="Armenians">Armenians</a> for his image) is exactly of the "Hurri"-Mitanni seal with the 2 eagles and sun with the 8 (number of eternity) rays. Hurri-Mitanni kings names like Artatama translates to "most righteous", which the first part of the word Arta which is righteous is in Armenian. Tusratta translates to "ten chariots", and Tus is Ten in Armenian. Hurri/Hur the very word used now in Armenian, was the same word and meaning in <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitanni.html" title="Mitanni">"Hurri"-Mitanni</a> and <a href="../../../u/r/a/Urartu.html" title="Urartu">"Hurro"-Urartu</a> times. The Phrygians, Armenian tribes from the Hittites, mixed with the Armenians later in their history, that is why people refer to them with the term Indo-"European". Armenians refer to themselves as "Aryan" people. The Indo and Persian Aryans seperated from them during 900 or 800 BC. That is why a little later the Persians established there empire in 500 BC.</p>
<p>The Armenian legacy of Sumer-Hurrian-Hyksos heritage in the second millennium B.C. had already developed a rich architectural style. This in turn spread and influenced the nearby cultures of ancient Near East. Building techniques and architecture as such reached a high degree of development during the period of the Araratian (Urartian) Kingdom of Van (XIIIth -VIth centuries BC).</p>
<p>The great Armenian civilization of Sumer was inherited and continued to progress under the powerful Armenian kingdoms of Hurri-Mitanni and Haiasa (ethnically and linguistically tied to their Indo-European kinsmen -- the Hittites) in the Second Millennium B.C.</p>
<p>We think that much before the Achaemenians, in the times of Hurri-Mitanni, the name Mihr was already known to the people, particularly to those living in the regions of Hurri-Mitanni or Armani-Subari (and later Arme-Subria) where Sasun is located, in the form of Mitra (or perhaps even as Mher). Otherwise, it would not have been so readily accepted by the people during the Achaemenian period or later.</p>
<p>The word Ar-ma-ni is a compound noun, where the first component Ar is none other than the name of the natioanal sun-god of the Armens,-AR- and the second component -ma-(me a varient) ssignifies 'build, make, beget, offspring, son'. Ma, with this meaning, was known to many peoples of the Ner East in antiquity. The goddess of birth and fertility, so well known in Asia Minor, was called by this very same name-Ma.(Ma also occurs in its reduplicated from -Mama or Mami in Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions). This root-word (and also its variant -me) is found also in Sumerian language with the same meaning. It results that Ar-ma (and its variant Ar-me) means 'built by Ar, born of Ar', or 'Ar's offspring', 'Ar's/Ara's son' ('the son of the sun', Arevvordi). The ending -ni (the plural-forming or toponymic suffix-ni is found in Subarian-Hurrian-Nairian place and tribal na We find the plural form ni also in Armenian.</p>
<p>Hurri is the Sun with the wings the very Hurri-Mitanni symbol. Hurri/Hur/Har = Fire, Sun, Light just like "Ar" to this very day in Armenian.</p>
<p>To clarify the issue since there is a lot of confusion, dividing "Aryan" people like the Indo-Aryans only being Hurrian-Aryan is misunderstood. Its not only Indo but "Aryan" is from the Armenian highlands, the Aryan peoples spread across to Persia and India etc. The "Indo" Aryans and Persian Aryans migrated south from Armenians (Aryans) around 800 BC to their lands.</p>
<p>There is no question that the Hurrian and Urartian languages were very similar, and some have used this evidence that the Hurrian Armenian tribes had origins in the Urartu area in and around Lake Van before migrating to South-Western Armenia. The Hurrian timeframe in Syria (South-Western historic Armenia), the area that the Hurri-Mitanni kingdom of Armenia was present (c. 2300-1200 BC) predates the timeframe of Urartu in Eastern Armenia (c. 1000-585), it is more often considered likely that the Armenians of Urartu had origins there, and fled from the South-Western Armenian Highlands into the Eastern part of Armenia after the Hittites and Assyrians conquered the region. Chronologically, the Urartian language seems to be a continuation of Hurrian dialects, and not the other way around.</p>

<p>Last point is that those who wrote the inscriptions were the elite. The common people didnt understand all of it at that time. There are even Armenian words today that are not understood, because of writers using difficult words.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Extra info</span></h2>
<p>Map showing "Nairi" near Lake Van part of Hurri-Mitanni and (K)Hayasa is there also <a href="http://satrapa1.com/articulos/antiguedad/oriente/IIIperiodo/mitanni.jpg" class="external free" title="http://satrapa1.com/articulos/antiguedad/oriente/IIIperiodo/mitanni.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://satrapa1.com/articulos/antiguedad/oriente/IIIperiodo/mitanni.jpg</a></p>
<p>This clearly shows at the time of King Bartarna 1450 BC the beginnings of Hurri-Mitanni, that they already had the area around Lake Van. That was there to begin with and then they stretched further west.</p>
<p>Egyptian sources apply the term 'nhr', Naharina or Nairi (from the Assyro-Akkadian word for 'river' or 'land of rivers' Tigris Euphrates and Armenian Highlands) referring to Hurri-Mitanni with Naharina (Nairi).</p>

<p>"The Hurrians had a history of their own. Assyrian and Sumerian sources dating from the end of the third millenium B.C. supply our first information about this nation, people, and the land of Hurri, South of Caucasus. We also know that they come from the region of Lake Van in Eastern Anatolia, and are referred to as Horrittes by the Bible. Still, later in the ninth-seventh centuries N.C. the highland of Armenia were inhabited by a people who were related to the Hurrians and whose country bore the name Urartu, the Biblical Ararat"</p>
<p>"Queen Nefertiti of Egypt was a native of Mitanni. The Mittani Kingdom of Armenia was an off-shoot of the Hurrian kingdom. The Hurri and the Mittani in turn were the contemporaries the Hittites and the Hykos, within whom they shared many cultural and political aspects. Today, all these aforementioned nations are considered to be, in varying degrees, proto-Armenians, that is, we modern day Armenians are direct descendants of the remnants of those ancient tribes."</p>
