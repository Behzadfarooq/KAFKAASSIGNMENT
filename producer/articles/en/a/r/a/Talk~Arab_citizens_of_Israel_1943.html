<h2><span class="mw-headline">Occupied or reunified?</span></h2>
<p>To state that Israel ""reunified" Jerusalem in 1967 is not a neutral statement, but partisan and POV. The very fact that only supporters of Israel's actions use this term, while supporters of the Palestinian case reject it, should be enough to establish that it clearly reflects just one point of view.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The fact is that the city was reunified. It was divided in 1949 and reunified in 1967. If pro-Palestinians don't like facts, which seems to be a pattern, that's just there problem. Writing "Occupied" is also POV.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
In any case, as anyone who has lived in Jerusalem will know, it is misleading in the extreme to describe the city as "unified". The division -- social, cultural, economic, and political -- is all too evident. Although there are ongoing efforts to erase the geographical evidence of this division, even this is only partial, as a short walk from West to East Jerusalem will confirm.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes and you can say the same about the Haredi parts of the city vs the non-Haredi parts. So I guess also that New York for example is not an unified city, because you can see the division (social, cultural, economic, and political) when you go from Manhattan to the black ghettos, the Haredi quarters, China Town etc... By the way, "East-Jerusalem" means nothing. If you knew Jerusalem as you claim, you would know than there is no such entity - only different Arab quarters (in the North, South, and East, with not even territorial continuity nor any common identity and history as a single city. The historical "East Jerusalem" is in fact the most integrated Arab quarter of the city, the one were all the "divisions" are not so evident.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The term "occupied", on the other hand, is a neutral and objective description of the events of June 1967. I would prefer to describe it as "unilaterally annexed", which is also objectively true; but this might be seen as deliberately provocative by some (just as others see the use of the term "reunified"). Let's try to stick to a neutral and objective term; and let's discuss any changes here before revert-warring in the main article. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 22:04, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not a native English speaker, but I am sure the English language can offer a term, other than "occupied" or "unified", that would be accurate and acceptable.

<dd>On June 4, 1967 Jerusalem was divided between two authorities. On June 12, 1967 it came under full control of one of these authorities. The trigger to that was a war. We choose to leave out the legitimacy issue. I suppose "capture" should do to cover it all. Any objections? <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrork_a20a.html" title="User:Drork">drork</a> 21:09, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Captured seems ok, because that states only the fact and leaves the disputed status of Jerusalem out of the sentence. --<a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagabund_aa69.html" title="User:Magabund">Magabund</a> 22:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't understand why Benjil finds the term "occupied" offensive; to me it is a simple, neutral, factual statement of the situation. It is used not only by Palestinians, but by Israeli peace and anti-occupation groups, by the mainstream Israeli media, by the UN and most other governments. But if he thinks that the term "reunified", which is certainly rejected by Palestinians, as well as by neutral observers and many Israelis, is non-POV, then we have a very different understanding of what constitutes a point of view. As I wrote above, the very fact that the term is used by pro-Israel propagandists, but rejected by Palestinians, should be sufficient to establish that it is indeed a contentious, and therefore unacceptable, POV.</dd>
<dd>But Benjil's statement that if pro-Palestinians don't like it, it's their problem, is certainly offensive, and I urge hoim to withdraw this comment.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile, although I don't like the term "captured", it is certainly better than the current "reunified", so I will act on the developing consensus, and amend the article accordingly. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 22:53, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The term "occupied" to speak about Jerusalem is not used by the mainstream Israeli media, but only by some fringe extremists groups on the far left that represent more or less nothing in Israel. "Occupied" is the *most* offensive term you could use, as you take a clear stand on the status of the city and implicitely negate the link between Israel and its capital. I can understand that "reunified" is perceived as not neutral even if it is just a fact, so let's go with "captured". <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 06:32, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that some of you may have jumped to conclusions. The word has nothing to do with POV. By saying they annexed or whatever East Jerusalem it would infer that they annexed that city. The reason is that they did not, it is not considered separate. They did not annex a separate city. They literally made it one again with its western half. By that it is <b>re' <i>-</i></b> <i>uni</i>fied.</p>

<dd>That is your own point of view; I do not share it. It also borders on original research.

<dd>Perhaps the term "occupied" used to be neutral, but it's not anymore, and the proof is that it is used by political organization as a political statement (the UN is a political organization too). As far as the West Bank is concerned, you could say it is occupied by Israel, since Israel controls the territory using martial law, in a way that is supposed to be in line with the Fourth Geneva Convention (at least in theory). However, the eastern part of Jerusalem is subject to the Israeli law. Whether one regards it as the desired state of affairs or not, it is not occupation in the plain simple sense of the word. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrork_a20a.html" title="User:Drork">drork</a> 07:37, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>here's a suggestion: "during the 1967 war israel <b>engaged</b> eastern jerusalem, city of david, into it's sovreincy" ... i actually havn't seen the body text, but i figure the word engaged is probably as neutral as it gets in a situation where one side takes control and no one agrees on ownership.. and i really think the name "city of david" is important to the debate to remind everyone that all sources agree that david (daud in Islam) took jerusalem by divine right in the name of the israelites... personal thought: kinda sad though that the PLO renounce the prophet daud like that just because of political reasons.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">indigenous</span></h2>
<p>Hello, About the dispute on the word "indigenous". The source<a href="http://abs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/49/8/1085" class="external autonumber" title="http://abs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/49/8/1085" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> clearly uses the word " indigenous/minority groups'" to describe the Palestinian youth. The article is also categorized under "<i>indigenous groups</i>". It's sourced, to an RS. What's the problem?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that the word indigenous is a POV. (try it with "non-indigenous" and it will become perfectly clear to you.) If a RS makes a POV claim, it needs to be presented as such (i.e- a claim by a partisan, not a fact), with balancing, opposing POVs. What I suggest, is that instead of turning this single sentence into yet another 'he said she said' argument, we leave the word "minority", which is undisputed, and the sentence still makes the same point. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 17:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If it makes the same point , why are you so desperate to change it? There is ample evidence that Palestinians are indigenous beyond its mention in this particular Israeli academic study. The UN regularly refers to Palestinians as indigneous (See: <a href="http://209.85.129.104/search?q=cache:lEeJzVis7d8J:www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/jointngo3.pdf+indigenous+palestinians+UN&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=30&amp;gl=ca" class="external autonumber" title="http://209.85.129.104/search?q=cache:lEeJzVis7d8J:www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/jointngo3.pdf+indigenous+palestinians+UN&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=30&amp;gl=ca" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.palestine-un.org/news/feb97_40.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.palestine-un.org/news/feb97_40.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

</dl>
<p>By the way, considering The Future Vision document already mentioned in another context in this article (the full version of the document itself is here:<a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=12082" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=12082" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>) I am surprised you would at all attempt to object. It begins: "We are the Palestinian Arabs in Israel, the indigenous peoples, the residents of the States of Israel, and an integral part of the Palestinian People and the Arab and Muslim and human Nation.</p>
<p>The war of 1948 resulted in the establishment of the Israeli state on a 78 percent of historical Palestine. We found ourselves, those who have remained in their homeland (approximately 160,000) within the borders of the Jewish state. Such reality has isolated us from the rest of the Palestinian People and the Arab world and we were forced to become citizens of Israel. This has transformed us into a minority living in our historic homeland."</p>
<p>In other words, there is ample proof that Arab citizens of Israel are defining themselves as an "indigenous minority" and identity is largely self-defined. Though it certainly doesn't hurt that the UN, the organization that mediates relations between peoples and nations, concurs, repeatedly describing Palestinians as a people indigenous to historic Palestine, part of which Israel took to establish itself on. And your argument is what again exactly? <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 21:05, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no doubt that the Palestinians see themselves as "indigenous", but so do the Jews. Describing the relationships between Jews and Arabs as between an "indigenous" minority and a (implicitly non indigenous) majority implies that we are in a colonial situation where the Jews are outsiders who took the land from the original owners.

<dd>Actually, after much reflection on ths issue, I have to say that its unfair and nonneutral to deny that fact and hide this information from readers. The only major opposition I have seen to this term is from Zionists, who have a specific interest in denying that it is true, because they believe that only Jews are entitled to a special connection to the land of Palestine/Israel. Well, too bad. It is true. The people we are talking about were there before Israel was created and they are still there even after a colonizing government force came in and set up shop here. They identify as indigenous. A DNA study cited above specifically does say they are indigenous: "According to historical records part, or perhaps the majority, of the Moslem Arabs in this country descended from local inhabitants, mainly Christians and Jews, who had converted after the Islamic conquest in the seventh century AD (Shaban 1971; Mc Graw Donner 1981). These local inhabitants, in turn, were descendants of the core population that had lived in the area for several centuries,</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

</dl>
<p>some even since prehistorical times (Gil 1992)." Note the DNA study cites historians that make the same claim based on historical records. The UN says so.

Not one source has been provided backing your assertions, outside of the sadly discredited non-scholar, plaigarist Joan Peters. We have provided many. This time, it's not gonna fly. If you want to add a footnote mentioning that a minority made up largely of pro-Israel advocates denies that this is true, I am all for it.

Nobody says that the Israeli Arabs should not be allowed to say they are indigenous, and nobody even argue that they are not, that's not even the point. The point is to say that's how they view themselves, and not state it the way the sentence is written, implying that the majority is not indigenous.

<dd>Well - exactly the contrary. Nobody even started arguing that the Palestinians are not indigenous. Nobody but you and Tiamut spoke about that. This is not the point. The point is that the simple fact of stressing that they are indigenous is saying that the Jews are not - and that is precisely what Tiamut wants to say here. If not, why do you even stress that they are indigenous&#160;? In an article about the Druze minority in Lebanon, would you write about "the indigenous minority" and the muslim majority&#160;? Of course not. In fact, we should remove completely any reference to this subject as this is totally irrelevant and POV pushing as you say (just read Tiamut before me, this is pretty clear). <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 08:02, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the majority ruling authorities part bothers you, I am not against removing it, but I fail to see how stating that Arabs are indigenous undermines Jewish indigineity. As pointed out above, DNA studies that support Arab indiginiety also support Jewish indiegineity proving those two are not mutually exclusive. I really don't understand the problem here. My last edit included the minority viewpoint that Arabs are not indigenous. Why keep changing it to make it seem that Arab are the only ones who think so, when that is patently false?

There are a number of problems here. First of all, the acedemic source cited calls this population "indigenous" , not a minority.

They are participants in the UN working group on indigenous peoples. <a href="http://209.85.129.104/search?q=cache:mFoBm1Zr69MJ:www.danadeclaration.org/capacitybuildingreport.pdf+%22indigenous+peoples%22+palestine+participants&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;gl=ca" class="external autonumber" title="http://209.85.129.104/search?q=cache:mFoBm1Zr69MJ:www.danadeclaration.org/capacitybuildingreport.pdf+%22indigenous+peoples%22+palestine+participants&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;gl=ca" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. I don't think that people who only think of themselves as indigenous qualify for that. Again, you have provided no sources for your view that Palestinians are not indigenous, outside the discredited Joan Peters book. I think my formulation above therefore fairly represents the evidence we currently have available. I ask you to self-revert.

<p>Jose Martinez-Cobo, the Special Rapporteur to the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities,4 whose definition of an indigenous people is to date the most accepted and well known. Martinez-Cobo’s main parameters are: priority in time; voluntary perpetuation of their cultural distinctiveness; self-identification as indigenous; and experience of subjugation, marginalization, dispossession, exclusion, and discrimination by the dominant society. Furthermore, an accepted notion in the treatment of indigenous communities is that indigeneity establishes conditionality between the existence of a group of people and their bond to a specific place." <a href="http://www.adalah.org/newsletter/eng/apr05/ar2.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adalah.org/newsletter/eng/apr05/ar2.pdf" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Additionally, the criteria to establish indigeneity at Wikipedia is as follows: "an indigenous people may be identified as such, where notable independent reference(s) can be found that the group's indigenous identity is either asserted or recognised as being indigenous, or some other cognate term, by either: some government, regulatory body, law or protocol, which may be either sub-national, national or trans-national; and/or some body, NGO or other organisation, involved with indigenous affairs and recognised as an accredited participant, intermediary or representative in some legal, negotiative, national or international regulatory or rights-based process; and/or some academic and peer-reviewed literature or publication; and/or some representative body of the indigenous society itself, where that representation is made in respect of a claim or issue to a government or governmentally-supported organisation (eg the UN, African Union)." Now, thus far, I have provided a citation to UN woking group on indigenous peoples which included representatives from Palestine. I provided two academic citations that speak directly to indigeneity, I provided the document where Palestinians in Israel declare themselves indigenous, I have provided DNA studies that ocnclude that "Arab-Israelis" are indigenous. And I now provide this: <a href="http://www.adalah.org/eng/events.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adalah.org/eng/events.php" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, an example of a Palestinian legal group in Israel that held a working table on indigenous land rights. All of this goes far past the criteria necessary to establish indigeneity. Please, for once, couldn't all you Zionists just fairly concede the point. I added the opposite POV, even though it is minority view.

<dd>Tiamut, I find your remark directed towards, "you zionists" inappropriate since I know you consider it to be a huge insult--there is no need for insults here. What you are describing and giving undue weight to is a politically driven attempt to describe Jews as foreigners and colonizers. By the the UN standards you cite here, Jews are indigenous to Israel. Priority in time--3000 years should be enough; voluntary perpetuation of cultural distinctiveness, ok I think Jews have that since we've held onto our culture for 3K years+; self-identification as indigenous--we have considered Jerusalem our homeland since the Babylonian Exhile--please pick up any prayerbook etc from any time in history and read through the am prayers for a quick example, and the experience of subjugation, marginalization, dispossession, exclusion, and discrimination by the dominant society--we have that in spades. Please see www.jimena.org for some information about how the Jews who stayed in the Middle East after the original exhiles were treated. Many peoples have a homeland in the middle east--not just Arabs. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">Elizmr</a> 17:13, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ahhh, Elizmr. Your sophistry is compelling but not good enough. The criteria for inclusion of a group in the indigenous category is clearly enunciated on that page. I quoted it here above. I found the sources required. You have not to support your claims regarding Jewish indigeneity. If you do, please, by all means add Jews to the indigneous peoples category pages and mention it in the Israel article. But otherwise, your ranting is really rather irrelevant. And Zionist, my friend, is not an insult. Its a descriptive term for your (and others) POVs here.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More on Palestinians as indigenous</span></h2>
<p>The early Zionist writer <a href="../../../a/h/a/Ahad_Haam_9f14.html" title="Ahad Haam">Ahad Ha'Am</a> famously wrote several articles describing the situation of the Arabs resident in Palestine at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. The most important of these, "The Truth from Eretz Israel", written after his first visit to Palestine in 1891, is not easily available in English. I've just downloaded it in Hebrew, and will read it carefully over the next few days. While I can state with certaintity that the word "indigenous" does not appear (since he wrote in Hebrew), it is clear that even then, several years before <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herzl.html" title="Herzl">Herzl</a> called the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Zionist_Congress_9fea.html" title="First Zionist Congress">First Zionist Congress</a>, Ahad Ha'Am was aware of the existence of a settled Arab community in Palestine who would not accept being supplanted by European settlers, whatever ideology they professed and however justified they felt their enterprise to be. In <i>The Origins of Zionism</i> (Oxford University Press, 1980), Israeli political scientist David Vital quotes from the essay, presumably in his own translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"particularly the town dwellers among them, do see and understand what we are about, but they keep their own counsel and pretend to innocence because they see no future danger to themselves in anything we do; on the contrary, they exploit us, as best they can, try to extract the greatest possible profit from the new guests, and laugh at us behind our backs. The peasants are glad enough to have Jewish settlements set up among them because they are well paid for their labour and, as experience shows, prosper steadily from year to year. The great landlords are equally glad to have us because we pay them prices they had never dreamt of for stony and sandy soil. But if there ever comes a time when we have developed our life in Eretz-Israel to the point where we shall be encroaching upon them in a greater or lesser degree, [then we should not expect them] to yield their place easily". (Vital, pp195-6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is not a description of an indigenous community, with social stratification and a strong attachment to the land, then I don't know what is.</p>
<p>In 2006, the <i>Yale Israel Journal</i> published a paper by Joshua Krug, "Image and Encounter:The Zionists and the Arabs between 1882 and 1908"<a href="http://www.yaleisraeljournal.com/summ2006/krug.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yaleisraeljournal.com/summ2006/krug.php" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. Krug, reportedly <a href="http://www.insidehighereducation.com/news/2006/03/31/yale" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.insidehighereducation.com/news/2006/03/31/yale" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> a leader of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Hillel%7E_The_Foundation_for_Jewish_Campus_Life_8307.html" title="Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life">Hillel group</a> at Yale, and from the evidence of the paper a follower of Ahad Ha'Am, clearly sees the indigenous status of Palestinians, at the beginning of the twentieth century, as axiomatic; He writes: "it is necessary to examine those crucial, first encounters between Zionist settlers and indigenous Palestinian Arabs. Between the years of 882 and 1908, how did Jewish newcomers perceive the indigenous population of Palestine and how did the indigenous population perceive the Zionists?". Sub-headings in the paper include "Early Interactions between Zionist Immigrants and Indigenous Arabs" and "Zionist Perceptions of the ndigenous Arabs". In all, the word "indigenous" appears 14 times in the article, in relation to Palestinians in Palestine 100 years ago.</p>

<dd>No one is questioning the existance of Arab communities in Palestine in the late 19c or early 20th C. But you are confused (as is, apparently, Mr. Krug) about the meanign of "Indigenous". The Arabs are not "Indigenous" to this region, they conquered it and settled it. They did this many many years ago, but that does not make them "Indigenous". And if we're going to go by what Ehad Ha'am saw back in 1891, surely we could make just as strong a case for Jews being indigenous, unless we are going to selectievly edit out his comments on the Jewish communities of Jerusalem, Zefat and Tiberias. <a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarig_bbf7.html" title="User:Isarig">Isarig</a> 02:11, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The people of Palestine are gentically the same people of old, see their DNA, they are the "people of the sea" "the red people". these r facts not myths, genes dont lie. European Jews are not gentically the natives of this land.

<dd>Well you are all wrong. First there is no "race". Then, as already proven and explained here, most Jews share a common origin. Jews and Arabs are related but Sefaradi and Oriental Jews are not Arabs - they just lived in Arab countries - and are genetically closer to Ashkenazi Jews than to Arabs. The Palestinians, of course, are not the descendant of the Sea People and other people living here in the antiquity, but a mix of several Arab people who arrived at different times. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 07:51, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

European Jews share a common origin with all the rest of Europe. African Jews have a genetic line, much stronger which goes back to Israel. see <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemba.html" title="Lemba">Lemba</a>. I dont how many Arabs left Arabia that could have populated so much of the Middle East and North Africa, off course they mixed, everyone is mixed. How are European Jews white people, if they didnt mix God knows how long ago? The term Arab is the issue. Today Arab is a collective term, thus Arab as a race is meaningless. So Palestinian people are today called Arab, but they are the natural people of the land since antiquity, or are you telling me all the original people went to Russia &amp; Germany? NExt the British will reinvade Africa and claim their African gentic right to Africa.i have noticed how fiction becomes facts to justify human want, we would find ways to be legally from Antartica if it suited our interest. --<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halqh حَلَقَة הלכהሐላቃህ</a> 00:34, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are obviously very confused. You mix ethnicity, citizenship, religion etc... Jews are a people - mainly because that is how they define themselves. In fact, that is the *only* definition of a people: a community that sees itself as such. The fact is that Jews share a common ancestry (as genetic studies prove it) but that is not even important. Regarding the actual Palestinians, they are mostly descendants of all kind of people who immigrated in the last centuries. Some families may have older roots to the land. It is of course also of no importance. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 08:09, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

Still what happened to the native people of Israel, did they blow into the sea? Genetic study shows that teh Lemba of Southern Africa have more Jewish genes than any European or Arab Jew, so i think in summing the Palestinian people are natives to that land, have been in that land as long as Biblical times. Its like the White South African telling the Bantu, u r not native to this land, you came from another place. It is critical to the crisis, and it is critical to this article, native people of Palestine are the Palestinian people. European jews are settlers in Israel, just like the settlers in America and South Africa. see reserach below.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halqh حَلَقَة הלכהሐላቃህ</a> 11:29, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are no "Jewish genes". The Lemba have a lot of "Cohen genes" - and this concept is widely criticized. What happened to the native people of Israel&#160;? Well these are the Jews, just read a book about Jewish history. I remind you that the "Palestinian people" is a creation of the last decades. Nobody ever heard of a "Palestinian people" before 1948 (or even before 1967) - in particular because there was no "Palestine" and never has been. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 11:47, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you guys serious? We put "Palestinian" on the page of Edward Said even though he's an American citizen. That doesn't mean that Edward is only Palestinian, it means it is one facet of his identity. Here, more than half of Arab citizens identify as Palestinians and you're going deny them the right to be associated with that entire category of people because some of them do not? The reservations are explained in the article. I don't think anyone will be confused by the category being there if the article is well-written regarding the subject (currently it could use some work).

That this article is categorised in "Israel" and "Arab Israelis" is entirely logical since these are inherently true according to the entry's thesis. If "more than half of Arab citizens identify as Palestinians" then we say as much in the text, but we don't then label the other half as also identifying in such a manner. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 18:43, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Threeafterthree,</dd>
<dd>Unfortunately, your observation about conflict carrying over is often true, though WP generally lets us sort more out than not in the end. As for your compromise, I'm afraid it is has the same problem, since the same <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Israeli_8deb.html" title="Arab Israeli">Arab Israelis</a> that don't identify as <i>Palestinians</i>, don't identify as <i>Palestinian people</i>. It would be like labelling the population of N. Ireland <i>Catholic</i> or <i>Protestant</i> - neither fits both. That some Arab Israelis identify as <i>Palestinian</i> is represented in the text, but such a disputed description should not be applied across the board as a category (per <a href="../../../c/a/t/WP%7ECategory_9dbc.html#Category_naming" title="WP:Category">policy</a>). Cheers, and thanks for your help in any event. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 19:06, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The policy say: "A category is probably inappropriate if the answer to the following questions is "no": Is it possible to write a few paragraphs or more on the subject of a category, explaining it? If you go to the article from the category, will it be obvious why it's there? Is the category subject prominently discussed in the article? An article will often be in several categories. Restraint should be used, however — categories become less effective the more there are on a given article." Further, it notes that cetgories are used to help people find articles on subjects they are interested in. Now, placing hte category Palestinians at the bottom of this page, certainly does not imply that all Arab citizens of Israel are Palestinian (this fact is explicitly noted in the text a number of times). However, someone looking for information on Palestinians in Israel, would definitely benefit from having this article listed int the category Palestinians, since it would help them to find it. If you find this suggestion objectionable, perhaps we need a separate article entitled "Palestinians in Israel". Because continuing to disqualify all things Palestinian simply because some Arab citizens don't identify as such, isn't very NPOV, fair or informative. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 19:21, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course the category should go in. Pretty much any general work I can think of on modern Palestinian society, culture, etc, (apart from those confining their scope to the Occupied Territories) covers the Arab citizens of Israel. The comparison with the religious affiliation of people in Northern Ireland is bizarre. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 19:23, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Certain Arab citizens of Israel (like Bedouins and Druze) don't identify as Palestinians at all. For others, some do, some don't. When some members of a group actively reject a categorization, it doesn't make sense to add that category to all of them. Some Jews identify as "Palestinians" as well, but we don't stick the "Palestinian" cat on the Jew article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:30, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, that's interesting. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> writes above "When some members of a group actively reject a categorization, it doesn't make sense to add that category to all of them". Yet he has been among the editors insisting on adding the category "Antisemitism" to the article on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a>. Most, if not all, anti-Zionists actively reject this categorisation; why does the same logic not hold there?</dd>
<dd>I will concede that <i>some</i> anti-Zionists are anrtisemitic; indeed, I have written as much in some articles about them. But, so long as it is understood that the label does not refer to <b>all</b> anti-Zionists, I am prepared to allow the label to remain. Similarly here. No-one is claiming here that all Arab citizens of Israel identify as Palestinians (though some of us may claim politically that objectively, they actually all are indeed such). The intention of including the category is not to advance some such claim in an underhand way. It is simply, as Tiamut suggests above, that this is a helpful -- indeed, encyclopaedic -- indication to people seeking further information.</dd>
<dd>But if we are to accept Jayjg's logic above, then surely we have to remove the category "Ancient peoples" from the article <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>; after all, we're not <b>all</b> ancient! --<a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 20:19, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do all Israeli Druze identify as Arab citizens of Israel? And by the way, I think you will also find some people in the various "antisemitism" categories who do not self-identify as anti-Semites, by the way. Perhaps you should look into that! I do not think, either, that Jewish self-identification as Palestinian is quite as common as it is among Israeli Arabs, though I have not read widely on this particular subject and am open to correction.</dd>
<dd>The point, though, is that reliable sources dealing with the Palestinian people generally include coverage of the Arab citizens of Israel as such. For example, such a major work as Kimmerling and Migdal's <i>The Palestinian People: A history</i> includes a full chapter (out of six covering the post-Nakba period) devoted entirely to Arabs in Israel. This being the case, the category regarding the Palestinian people would be incomplete without the inclusion of this article in it. The question of the identification of Arab citizens of Israel as Palestinians, or not, is addressed in the article itself, as it should be. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 21:37, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that there are no explanations attached to categories.

<dl>
<dd>I don't believe that that principle is generally agreed. For example, the Arbitration Committee ruled that it would be appropriate to include the not uncontroversial categories "Geography of Israel" and "Geography of Syria" on the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golan_Heights_4b58.html" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a> page. I think it is also fairly clear that the category <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_people.html" title="Palestinian people">Palestinian people</a> would be rather incomplete if a population widely regarded, and studied, as one of the main elements of the Palestinian people, was left out of it. There's no real need to be concerned about there being no explanations attached to categories, as the category tags are attached to pages and this page, which precedes the category tag, explains the issue in detail. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 23:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is enough that a large part of this population are Palestinians by their own and most people's reckoning. The portion of the policy quoted above by Tiamut makes it clear, I think.

<dd>No it isn't enough. "Palestinian" is an identity that is not synonymous with being an Arab Israeli. Being an Arab Israeli (to address the point raised above) rests not on identification, but on a legal status. According to the logic that <i>Any article which contains a substantial amount of material relevent [sic] to the topic of Palestinians belongs in the Palestinians</i>, we would put half the Middle East and Israeli related articles in the category, and categorisation would cease to have any function. I'm not sure what the case on "antizionism" is, but if it is indeed as you've described above, then I would be inclined to agree with your position. The Golan Heights example refers to reconciling two competing legal definitions, and thus is not analogous. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 21:07, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The answer is a clear no; Arab citizens of Israel are not Palestinian people.

<p>According to wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn, a reliable source, a “Palestinian” is a “a descendant of the Arabs who inhabited Palestine”. “Palestine” is a “a former British mandate on the east coast of the Mediterranean” or “an ancient country in southwestern Asia on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea; a place of pilgrimage for Christianity and Islam and Judaism”.</p>

<p>There are plenty of examples of Arab citizens of Israel, and their organisations, referring to themselves as Palestinians. For instance, Adalah -- The Legal Centre for Arab Citizens of Israel, which has <a href="http://www.adalah.org/eng/backgroundhistory.php" class="external text" title="http://www.adalah.org/eng/backgroundhistory.php" rel="nofollow">a whole section on its website</a> entitled " History of the Palestinians in Israel", which starts "Today, Palestinian citizens of Israel comprise close to 20% of the total population of the country, numbering over 1,000,000." Or the Arab Association for Human Rights, which was "founded in 1988 to promote and protect the political, civil, economic, and cultural rights of the Palestinian Arab minority in Israel and to further the domestic implementation of international human rights principles"<a href="http://www.arabhra.org/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arabhra.org/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>. Then there's Balad -- The National Democratic Assembly, which notes that "The state of Israel is composed of two national groups; Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jewish. The Palestinian Arab minority is an integral part of the Palestinian people as a whole, numbering around one million people, 20% of the total population of Israel" <a href="http://tajamoa.org/article_details.aspx?TopID=67&amp;catid=43" class="external autonumber" title="http://tajamoa.org/article_details.aspx?TopID=67&amp;catid=43" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. Balad is a legal political party in Israel, with two (Palestinian) members of the Knesset. And what about I'lam -- The Media Center for Arab Palestinians in Israel <a href="http://www.ilamcenter.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ilamcenter.org/" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. Or "Harakat Abnaa elBalad (Sons of the Land Movement) ... a Palestinian Progressive Patriotic movement active within the areas that are occupied by Israel since 1948" <a href="http://www.abnaa-elbalad.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.abnaa-elbalad.org/" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Then there's "The Mossawa Center, The Advocacy Center for Arab Citizens in Israel, ... a non-profit, non-governmental organization that works to promote equality for the Arab/Palestinian citizens of Israel" <a href="http://www.mossawacenter.org/default.php?lng=3&amp;dp=2&amp;fl=1&amp;pg=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mossawacenter.org/default.php?lng=3&amp;dp=2&amp;fl=1&amp;pg=1" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>. As noted in the article, the The National Committee for the Heads of the Arab Local Authorities in Israel (possibly the most representative body of Arabs in Israel) recently published its ground-breaking report "The Future Vision of the Palestinian Arabs in Israel" <a href="http://www.mossawacenter.org/files/files/File/Reports/2006/Future%20Vision%20%28English%29.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mossawacenter.org/files/files/File/Reports/2006/Future%20Vision%20%28English%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. The fact is that most Arabs in Israel, and certainly the orhganisations which represent them, do indeed identify as Palestinian, and as an integral part of the Palestinian people. Some editors here may not like this, may even deny their right to do so, but they cannot deny the fact that they do indeed so identify.</p>

<p>There are significant tensions between Arab citizens and their Jewish counterparts. A 2006 poll commissioned by the Arab advocacy group, The Center for the Struggle Against Racism, found that: 63% of Jews believe Arabs are a security threat; 68% of Jews would refuse to live in the same building as an Arab; 34% of Jews believe that Arab culture is inferior to Israeli culture. Additionally, support for segregation between Jewish and Arab citizens was found to be higher among Jews of Middle Eastern origin than those of European origin.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Though many point to such attitudes as evidence of racism in Israeli society, other counter that these attitudes are attributable to the security situation, as there have been some cases where Arabs inside Israel have been arrested for aiding terrorists.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Several Arab citizens of Israel have been convicted of espionage for <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Arab citizens have also played a role in some attacks, assisting Palestinian suicide bombers reach cities in Israel.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1st.html" title="March 1st">March 1st</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, for example, 3 Israeli citizens, 2 of them Arabs, were convicted of manslaughter for smuggling the suicide bomber of the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July.html" title="July">July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> attack in <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netanya.html" title="Netanya">Netanya</a> that killed five and wounded 30 from the West Bank into Israel.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> The first and only suicide bombing physically carried out by an Arab citizen of Israel was on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, against soldiers and civilians disembarking from a train in the <a href="../../../n/a/h/Nahariya.html" title="Nahariya">Nahariya</a> station, killing 3 and wounded 90.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> Most earlier examples of Arab violence against Jews resulting in fatalities took place during the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_Arab-Israeli_war_a425.html" title="1948 Arab-Israeli war">1948 Arab-Israeli war</a>, with the exception of one case on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a> when seven armed Arab citizens attacked and killed a nineteen year-old girl in her home in Jerusalem.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>‘’See also: List of massacres committed in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war’’</p>
<p>Arab citizens have also been subject to violence resulting in fatalities at the hands of their Jewish counterparts. The most notable example outside of attacks that took place during the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_Arab-Israeli_war_a425.html" title="1948 Arab-Israeli war">1948 Arab-Israeli war</a> was the <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_4.html" title="August 4">August 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a href="../../../e/d/e/Eden_Nathan-Zadah_aaa7.html#The_Shfar.27am_attack" title="Eden Nathan-Zadah">The Shfar'am attack</a>, when four Arab citizens were shot dead on a bus by an 18-year old AWOL <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Defense_Force_7039.html" title="Israel Defense Force">IDF</a> soldier.</p>
<p>Unlike their fellow Jewish citizens, who are rarely if ever subject to fatal shootings by Israeli police or security forces, Arab citizens have sustained a number of such fatalities. Events in which multiple casualties were sustained at the hands of Isralei police and seucirty forces include the October 1956 <a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafr_Qasim_massacre_d071.html" title="Kafr Qasim massacre">Kafr Qasim massacre</a> (48 dead), the March 1976 <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_Day_44fb.html" title="Land Day">Land Day</a> demonstrations (6 dead), and the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2000_events.html" title="October 2000 events">October 2000 events</a> in which 12 Arab citizens and one Palestinian from Gaza were killed.</p>
<p>Arab citizens have also been victims of Palestinian, Arab, or Islamist attacks on Israel and Israelis.

<dd>I don't quite follow the reasoning behind what appears to be censorship on criticism/causes for poverty in the Arab-Israeli society. there's allready been 3 obvious reverts which simply removed info rather than make an attempt to include/edit the material for a more acceptable version. both involved editors should consider the material for what it is, a pro-arab(!), <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-governmental_organization.html" title="Non-governmental organization">non geovernmental organization</a> (NGO) headed by Mr. Yasser Awad, an Arab Israeli... I'd like to hear a proper reasoning for this censorship but i'd much rather have a normative editing pattern.</dd>

<p>The idea that we'll cite seemingly random surveys of information from partisan sources hardly seems like a good way to build an encyclopaedia. Can't we do better? <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 20:46, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I follow why you call this a "partizan survey", if anything, it's a pro-Arab report by a fairly respected organization that uses official statics released by Israel's main statistics bureau. So, I doubt the criticism they apply on Arab society has reason to be censored. Jaakobou 12:17, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
