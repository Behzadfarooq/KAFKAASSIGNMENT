<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporean_76fe.html" title="Edit section: Hadrami immigration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hadrami immigration</span></h3>
<p>One distinctive characteristic of Hadrami immigration into Singapore was that it was re-immigration from <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, rather than direct migration from <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadramawt.html" title="Hadramawt">Hadramawt</a>. The early settlers came to Singapore with wealth made in Indonesia and being already familiar with local customs, were easily accepted by the Malays. The Arabs in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South-East_Asia_f869.html" title="South-East Asia">South-East Asia</a>, by the time they came to Singapore, already enjoyed respect as religious scholars who brought <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> to the Malays. The Sayyids from Hadramaut are not natives of Hadramaut, but were friendly migrants from the northern areas (Iraq and Hejaz). Original Hadhrami people are Arabs who surnames starts with Ba (Baobed, Bajrai, etc.) and Matar, Abdat (some Ba Abdat) etc. These are descendants of Qahtan Arab Al Aribah. The Sayyids are Arabised Arabs Al mustaribah Adnan (Muhammdad descendants).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporean_76fe.html" title="Edit section: Arab role in trade">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arab role in trade</span></h3>
<p>The Arabs had played a dominant role in South East Asian trade since the <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifteenth_century.html" title="Fifteenth century">fifteenth century</a> and when Sir Stamford Raffles founded Singapore in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1819.html" title="1819">1819</a>, he attracted the Arab traders to his new city. By <a href="../../../1/8/2/1824.html" title="1824">1824</a>, there were 15 Arabs out of a population of 10,683 and Raffles anticipated a rapid growth in Arab immigration. His blueprint for Singapore included plans for an Arab district. In instructions to a Singapore housing committee in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1822.html" title="1822">1822</a>, he stated, "The Arab population would require every consideration No situation will be more appropriate for them than the vicinity of the Sultan’s residence."<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The first Arabs to arrive in Singapore in 1819 were two wealthy merchants from <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palembang.html" title="Palembang">Palembang</a> in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumatra.html" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>. Their numbers gradually increased and by <a href="../../../1/8/4/1846.html" title="1846">1846</a>, there were five important Arab merchant houses. The al-Juneid [al-junaid] الجنيد family in Singapore grew to be a rich and influential as did the al-Kaffs [al-kāf] الكاف and the al-Saggoffs [al-saqqāf] السقاف. There are numerous streets and a town council named after them.</p>
<p>The al-Saggoffs were spice traders and became influential by marrying into a <a href="../../../s/u/l/Sultan.html" title="Sultan">Sultanic</a> family from the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebes.html" title="Celebes">Celebes</a> and acquired many properties, like the other Arab families, including the "Perseverance Estate" where they grew <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemon_grass.html" title="Lemon grass">lemon grass</a>. The estate is now considered the heart of the Muslim community in Singapore. As well as being successful merchants and land owners, the family became involved in civic affairs and family members held civic office on and off from the <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870s.html" title="1870s">1870s</a> until independence. The al-Kaff family arrived in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1852.html" title="1852">1852</a>. All these families lived in mansions of considerable opulence. The al-Kaff house is now a restaurant called the al-Kaff Mansion, as a gesture to preserve the name, but has no other Hadrami connection, either in architectural style or ownership.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporean_76fe.html" title="Edit section: Arab business domination">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arab business domination</span></h3>
<p>The Arabs dominated the businesses in Singapore, principally in oil and trade, during the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_colonial_period.html" title="British colonial period">British colonial period</a>. Arabic culture had a strong influence on the local Malay culture through its religion. This is seen in the architecture of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mosques.html" title="Mosques">mosques</a> in <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kampong_Glam_bb4c.html" title="Kampong Glam">Kampong Glam</a>.</p>
<p>Many Arabs in Singapore came from <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadramawt.html" title="Hadramawt">Hadramawt</a>, which is now part of the republic of <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>. In the heyday of Arab prosperity, the Arabs of Singapore maintained close links with <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadramawt.html" title="Hadramawt">Hadramawt</a> and large amounts of money were sent back to the homeland. The rich built themselves splendid houses, the most magnificent being the al-Kaff palaces. They also sent their sons back to Hadramawt for periods of time to enhance their identity as Hadramis. This custom maintained their language and Hadrami culture and even resulted in some Malay being incorporated in the spoken Arabic of Hadramawt (see <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadhrami_Arabic_5b64.html" title="Hadhrami Arabic">Hadhrami Arabic</a>). Hadramawt was regarded as a cultural training ground and the time spent there the final preparation for manhood. Upon their return to Singapore, these youths would take their place in the family businesses.</p>

<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> it was impossible to travel, but the practice was resumed thereafter. However, after the Rent Control Act came into effect, Hadrami incomes were frozen and it became clear that the wakaf (trust) incomes would not be sufficient for the next generation. Then the families took a keener interest in the education of their children; the richer families sent their children to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> to study and the children of others spent time working in <a href="../../../a/d/e/Aden.html" title="Aden">Aden</a> rather than just going to Hadramawt. The cultural and linguistic links were more or less maintained. But the family incomes continued to decline.</p>

<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> came a major change. The independence of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Yemen_9863.html" title="South Yemen">South Yemen</a> with a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> government in power put an end to the Singapore Hadramis returning home. At the same time, the economic developments in Singapore made the importance of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> and of obtaining an education even more essential. The new Arab generation has grown up without Arabic and has lost both its identity and its affiliation with Hadramawt. Some families, in the oil boom of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, tried sending their sons to the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_06b2.html" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabia_53d2.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, where there were first generation Hadrami immigrants already and the young men returned with their Hadrami ties and their Arabic enhanced, but it was not a success. The young men did not like living in Saudi Arabia and their prospects in Singapore were better than on the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_peninsula.html" title="Arabian peninsula">Arabian peninsula</a>.</p>

<p>The Hadrami community in Singapore is now facing an identity crisis. The younger generation does not speak Arabic and has lost its affiliation with Hadramawt, partly because Hadramis have stopped sending their children back there. The Arab community recognises the lack of knowledge of Arabic is a major problem and an Arabic language centre has been set up. It is hoped that the younger generation will learn both the language and about their culture and heritage. The challenge facing the community is to ensure that the new generation maintains its identity. The link with Hadramawt needs to be re-established and travel to Hadramawt needs to be encouraged.</p>

<p>Singapore is a cosmopolitan city state made up of various races. The 1990 census shows the Chinese as the majority with around 74% of the population, the indigenous Malays with 14%, the Indians at less than 10% and the balance placed in the category of "others". This "others" category includes Filipinos, Eurasians, Vietnamese, Arabs and all other "others". The census shows Arabs to be around 7,000, but unofficial estimates place the number of Arabs at 10,000. The difference is due to a large number of the Arab community being classified as Malays in official statistics. The Arab community is almost all of Hadrami origin.</p>

<p>The Singapore Hadramis were major landlords, the large families having substantial properties held in wakafs (trusts), which ranged from private family trusts to public charitable trusts. Most of the land in today’s central business district of Singapore was once owned by Hadrami wakafs. These wakafs, bearing the family names, whether private or charitable, gave considerable prestige to the Arab community among the Muslims in Singapore.</p>
<p>In recent years, four factors have affected the wakafs and undermined the status of the community. The first three factors have been a direct result of government policies.</p>
<p><a name="First_factor" id="First_factor"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporean_76fe.html" title="Edit section: First factor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First factor</span></h4>
<p>The first was the enactment of the Administration of Muslim Law Act 1968. The Singapore Islamic Council is the corporate body now empowered to oversee the administration of charitable wakafs in Singapore. The Arab trustees were in total control of their wakafs prior to the Act. With the transfer of the wakafs’ administration to the Council, the Arabs’ authority over them was considerably undermined. The association of wakafs with Arabs and the reputation of Arabs as benefactors diminished as their connection with the charitable functions of the wakafs became invisible to the public.</p>
<p><a name="Second_factor" id="Second_factor"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporean_76fe.html" title="Edit section: Second factor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second factor</span></h4>
<p>The second factor was the Rent Control Act 1947. The rents of pre-war properties were controlled and, in effect, frozen. As the Arab wakafs were mostly pre-war properties, the income of the Arab families correspondingly diminished. The decline of income from the wakafs resulted in Arab economic influence diminishing. The Arabs were also, unfortunately, not prepared for such a drastic drop in income; they had not given their children a Western education. Many Arabs went to madrasahs (Arab schools) and some families never sent their children for any formal education at all. The development in Singapore since the 1960s has made it difficult for the Arabs to compete.</p>
<p><a name="Third_factor" id="Third_factor"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporean_76fe.html" title="Edit section: Third factor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Third factor</span></h4>
<p>The third factor was the Land Acquisition Act. Land is scarce in Singapore and it is government policy to have complete control over land usage. The Land Acquisition Act empowered the government to acquire land required for urban renewal and compensation is paid on a predetermined formula. The compensation amounts were significantly lower than the prevailing market value. The government embarked on a major acquisition campaign in the 1970s and 1980s. Pre-war properties were the major target for acquisition as Singapore underwent a modernisation programme. These pre-war properties were subject to rent control and had tenants that could not be removed.</p>
<p>The wakafs were not in a position to develop these properties. Significant properties owned by Arab wakafs were acquired and minimal compensation paid. This eroded Arab wealth and influence. It also diminished the Arab identity as substantial landlords.</p>
<p>The Sheikh Salem Talib Family settlement, for example, used to have more than three pages in its audited accounts listing the properties held, but the current accounts have less than one page. More than half of the properties were acquired by the government. The al-Saggoff Perseverance Estate was acquired in 1962 for urban renewal. Another 10-acre plot of land in a prime area was donated by the al-Juneid family to the Muslim Trust Fund (a wakaf created by the al-Saggoffs) to be developed so that the income could be used for welfare projects. The Trust wanted to build a mosque and a madrasah, but building permission was not granted by the government. That piece of land was acquired in 1985. In present-day Singapore, the Arabs are no longer considered as the main landowners. Many Singapore Arabs regard the land acquisition policy as the main reason for both their loss of status and identity.</p>
<p><a name="Forth_factor" id="Forth_factor"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Singaporean_76fe.html" title="Edit section: Forth factor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Forth factor</span></h4>
<p>The fourth factor is the use of professional trustees to manage the wakafs instead of family members. Most of the large private family trusts had problems of mismanagement or breaches of trust and legal disputes. In many cases a professional trustee was then appointed, which had a similar effect to the Administration of Muslim Law Act: the management of the wakafs became impersonal and the Arab families lost the social status of being associated with them.</p>
