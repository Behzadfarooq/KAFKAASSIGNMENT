<p>Could anyone tell me what the official language or languages of the Arab League are? Obviously, one must be Arabic (a specific dialect?), but given the range of mutually unintelligible dialects, I thought English or some other language might also conceivably be used. I didn't get a response from the official website in answer to this question. - <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrettz9_d368.html" title="User:Brettz9">Brettz9</a> 00:53 Mar 27, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Arabic is <i>the</i> official language. Every Arab nation has its own slang and accent, but formal arabic is the language used in the meetings. Even if slang arabic is spoken, other arabs will comprehend it easily. -- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostafa_Hussein_2d0e.html" title="User:Mostafa Hussein">Mostafa Hussein</a></p>

<dd>Excellent. Thank you. A few things further, however, if you don't mind...Would you know if there is a webpage source I could cite which says that Arabic is the official language (preferably an official website)? Is formal Arabic quite a bit different I assume than classical Arabic? Also, I could swear reading in a linguistics course that although some dialects can be mutually understood (especially by speakers in nearby countries), that the "dialects" (at least when spoken) are so different at the extremes (like maybe between Iraq and Morocco), that they could not be mutually understood. If the latter is the case, I am curious whether the differences are mostly just pronunciation, or whether the grammar, vocabulary, etc. is varied to the degree that the speakers couldn't understand the written language of each other as well. Thanks! - <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrettz9_d368.html" title="User:Brettz9">Brettz9</a> 15:39 Mar 27, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, ... formal/proper arabic is tied with lots and lots of grammar.Its also very rich in vocabulary. Its used in written documents. It is funny to speak in formal/proper arabic with my friends, but if I am giving a speech, it is the other way round. Well, in algeria and morroco they speak very fast, but if they speak a bit slowly, all arabs can understand them. Almost all dialects are derived from formal arabic. The differences are mostly the accent and a little vocubulary that deals with very intellectualy low stuff, like food, dress and household objects. Casual arabic is just an easy way to speak with others, to avoid lots of grammatical stuff. Illiterates might have a problem comprehending formal/proper arabic.--<a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostafa_Hussein_2d0e.html" title="User:Mostafa Hussein">Mostafa Hussein</a></dd>

<p>Thanks very much for your help...But do you know an official source I could cite which stated that Arabic was, as you say, the only official language? I would like to include this information on a webpage, and it would help to have an official source. Thanks!</p>

<dd>Nope, sorry&#160;:( --<a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostafa_Hussein_2d0e.html" title="User:Mostafa Hussein">Mostafa Hussein</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>One website you could use would be the official site of the Arab League, www.arableagueonline.org. Though it doesn't say anywhere that the official language is Arabic, the entire site is in Arabic and there is no other language available for it to be translated into, so that should give you some clue as to the languages used.

<p>Since members are forbidden to attack each other, should we mention the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war? Seems to me that Iraq's attack on Iran would be a violation of the Arab League charter.

<dd>Iran was never in the Arab League; among other things, they are of the hated despicable Persian race and speak Farsi even (OK, I'm exaggerating a little&#160;:-) ), so they're not in any sense Arab. Indeed, note in the article a mention of support for Iraq against Iran in 1987.

<dd>No, it's not a contentious issue at all lol. Iran is as Arab as Ireland is Slavic. The Arab pop in Iran is probably smaller than in France, a country about the same size. Note that Arabs often refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arab Gulf. It's also got the highest percentage of Shia Muslims in the world which further sets it apart. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 16:33, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the following a Wikipedian opinion, or an advocate's opinion, or what?</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is similar to the Organization of American States, the Council of Europe or the former Organization for African Unity, in that its aims are primarily political; <b>all of these organizations can be considered to be regional versions of the United Nations</b> [emphasis added by Ed Poor]</dd>
</dl>
<p>What is a "regional version of the United Nations" supposed to mean? Is it intended to suggest (a) that the UN is neutral and objective; and thus (b) that the Arab League is neutral and objective?</p>
<p>My assumption is that the League of Arab Nations exists SOLELY to advance Arab interests, and probably <i>at the expense of other countries like Israel</i>. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 14:30, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And why would the Arab states form an organization to advance the cause of someone else? Did any organization ever? Was the OAS formed to benefit the bushmen in Africa, or the EU to help Zimbabwi? Even the UN was formed to further the interests of the 5 permanent Security Council members. As for Israel, it is not the Arabs fault that Zionists choose, freely, to colonize an Arab land and turn the area into hell for its natives.<a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.Khalil_a8d8.html" title="User:A.Khalil">A.Khalil</a> 03:10, Mar 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And by the way, it is "The League of Arab <b>States</b>" and not the "League of Arab <b>Nations</b>."<a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.Khalil_a8d8.html" title="User:A.Khalil">A.Khalil</a> 19:40, Mar 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Maybe a mention should be made of the rather 'tumulteous' atmosphere of some Arab League meetings? For instance, the one before the second Gulf war <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php?content_id=20300" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php?content_id=20300" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<dd>For your information <a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.Khalil_a8d8.html" title="User:A.Khalil">A.Khalil</a>, you are just thinking like most mainstream Arabs, brainwashed by the media. The Jews (Zionist is a derogatory term) did <b>not</b> colonise <b>any</b> Arab land. The British Mandate of Palestine was <b>divided</b> into two by the <b>British</b>, <b>not</b> colonised. Many other previous colonies were also divided in various ways. As the current rulers of the land after the Ottoman Empire collapsed, the British have the right to give the land to whoever they want. Get that right please, and don't be racist towards Jews. "Giving them hell" is your opinion and is not a fact. For your information, it was members Arab League who incited the war (and therefore, the tension) immediately after the creation of Israel, and not the other way round. Arab <b>leaders</b> at that time were racist and didn't want a new race of people in the area.

<p>For the last time people. Libya is an arab nation. Twice it has threatened to leave the Arab League in protest. The first time it made the announcement on the 24th of October 2002 and it would have been effective one year later (i.e. the 24th of October 2003) but this decision was cancelled on the 16th of January 2003. The second time Libya threatened with withdrawl was on the 3rd of April 2003, but again was cancelled. This time it was cancelled on the 25th of May again before the one year deadline.

<p>I think the timeline should be improved, to drop some lessor points, and add bigger ones. For instance, in 1967 it mentions South Yemen joining (already stated in article), but says nothing of what the League did regarding the war. Without turning this into a "conflict timeline", I think some improvements could be made, by those familiar with the role of the League in the different wars. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 20:05, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>From <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> <i>Demographics and languages</i>: "As early as the seventh century, indigenous Cushitic peoples began to mingle with Arab and Persian traders who had settled along the coast. Interaction over the centuries led to the emergence of a Somali culture bound by common traditions, a single language, and the Islamic faith." In other words, Quintucket, Somalians are viewed in much the same way as North Africans; they may not be entirely <i>Arab</i>, but they have been assimilated into the greater Arab nation. --(<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMingus_ah_um_497a.html" title="User:Mingus ah um">Mingus ah um</a> 20:15, 28 April 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>The question is a good one, since the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somali_people.html" title="Somali people">Somali</a> people are not predominantly Arab in ancestry and still speak non-<a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic.html" title="Semitic">Semitic</a> languages, and is one best posed to the Somalis themselves.

<p>In reviewing (briefly) various Islamic and Arab intergovernmental organizations, I've noticed an absence of judicial organs. Neither the OIC, the Arab League or the Gulf Cooperation Council seem to possess a sitting body to mediate or adjudicate disputes among member governments.

<p>I dont think the per Capita GDP of the Arab League is 28,100 dollars. This is simply not possible. Germany's GDP for example is 2.504 trillion dollars and its population only 82 million and its per capita is 30 thousand dollars. So how an area with a LOWER GDP and 300 million people have roughly the same per capita? This would put the League on par with the EU which is illogical as the Arab League is dominated by developing and lower-income states. Simply Divide the total GDP by the population anf you get 4 thousand dollars which sounds more reasonable, so Im changing it, it must have been a typo or something. --<a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDoge120_c29f.html" title="User:Doge120">Doge120</a> 15:31, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recently noticed that Israel is included as part of the Arab League. I can understand it being included as the Arab League likely considers it part of Palestine, but i'd imagine that Israelis would not consider themselves a part of it for obvious reasons. I dont have any sort of axe to grind, but i think that the map should either be changed to reflect Israel not being a part of the Arab League, or Israel highlighted in a different colour to denote it as disputed.</p>

<p>Actually, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> was likely not intended to be depicted as an Arab League Member, but it is small enough to begin with and very narrow to boot that it blends in imperceptibly into the included map, which is a small map of a quite extensive area. The best solution would be to use a map large enough to distinctly show Israel as present and a non-member.---Heff01 04:59, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
