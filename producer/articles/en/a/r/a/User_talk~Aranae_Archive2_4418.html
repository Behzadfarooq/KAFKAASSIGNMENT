<p>Hello, fellow biologist (I presume). I've seen your comment on the Canines category , when I went there to leave the same comment&#160;:) and I added a reply to yours instead. Unfortunately it seems nobody is interested in correcting that, since it's been a long time since you left that comment and nobody reacted. Maybe we could do something about it if you are still interested? Create a voting somewhere, or something? I also see you are active on many zoology based articles, so if you need some other help regarding that, I'd be glad to do it. Although zoology isn't quite my branch, I'm more into physiology and molecular genetics, I'm still interested in it, not much of an expert though. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArny_0c17.html" title="User:Arny">Arny</a> 16:56, 28 February 2006 (UTC) P.S. I've seen the same naming problem as with <i>Canines</i> exists with <i>Felines</i>.</p>

<p>I have merged the Nesophontes and the West Indies shrew articles as you have suggested.

<p>Do you know that there are two additional species of <i>Fallomus</i>? See Marivaux, L. &amp; Welcomme, J.-L. 2003. New diatomyid and baluchimyine rodents from the Oligocene of Pakistan (Bugti Hills, Balochistan): Systematic and paleobiogeographic implications. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 23:420-434. (I can send a PDF if you want)</p>
<p>Furthermore, <i>Diatomys</i> apparently also occurs in North Africa (see Marivaux &amp; Welcome, again). By the way, what's your reference for its supposed occurrence in Japan? I can't find that one. The Pakistan records seem to represent some more undescribed species. <a href="../../../u/c/u/User%7EUcucha_a337.html" title="User:Ucucha">Ucucha</a> <a href="../../../u/c/u/User_talk%7EUcucha_976e.html" title="User talk:Ucucha"><small>(talk)</small></a> 14:51, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The occurence in Japan is based on the Dawson et al. (2006) article that prompted the whole thing. I couldn't track down what their reference was, just that it was on the map. North Africa's quite significant biogeographically, I wonder how Dawson et al. missed it. I checked your list and found the other <i>Fallomus</i>. Thanks.</dd>
<dd>In other news, have you seen the paper on Phillipine murines in the latest Systematic Biology? --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 15:57, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>I looked over your edits last night and I think you do good work. I see no reason you wouldn't make a fine admin if you wanted this position. There may be some opposition based on having too few edits in the Wiki namespace...but I don't know if that would result in a failing admin nomination or not. The whole admin thing is no big deal, all you get is the ability to easily rollback vandalism, protect pages, and block vandals from editing. If you are interested, I recommend you read through <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Wikipedia:Administrators</a> and the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_how-to_guide_237e.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' how-to guide">Wikipedia:Administrators' how-to guide</a> and lastly, the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_reading_list_6f0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list">Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list</a>....all of this stuff is pretty dry so if you prefer to just edit and not get caught up in the red tape, then I wouldn't worry about it. But we are always looking for a few good folks to help us deal with all the junk and all the jerks, so just let me know if you decide you want to be an admin.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 05:11, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, so it does; I concede the point (a redirect from Epigaulus would thus be useful as well).

<dd>According to Hopkins 2005 (cited on both the wikipedia pages in question), they all had horns and only these had horns (although there was a bit of prelude to horns in related genera).

<dd>I see, and I take your point. Note that Hopkins herself used the term "horned gopher" in the paper, by the way; I feel that it would be more immediately comprehensible to the reader brought there by the "Random Article" function. Also note, for the sake of accuracy, that the four Cerato are <i>not</i> the only known horned fossorials; Hopkins mentions the horned fossorial <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenarthran.html" title="Xenarthran">xenarthran</a> <i>Peltiphilus</i> (saying that the co-occurence of horns and fossoriality is so rare, it is only known in the four fossil Cerato, and one fossil xenarthran). <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 15:15, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is truly no hard and fast rule. It can get really annoying. I've had some really active pages switch around every few weeks from scientific name to common name in lowercase to upper case common name to a different common name and back. I tend to title pages by capitalized common name since they seem to be most stable there. I'm not sure that really indicates a consensus toward that decision, just that the more pushy editors tend to hold that opinion.

<p>Thanks for your feedback - I have been adding common names wherever a species list occurs, whether thats in the taxobox or the main text, but of course I take your point. Do you not think, however, that duplicating the species list looks a little untidy - maybe just putting it in the text and adding a "see text" note in the taxobox would look better.

<dd>I would argue that the taxobox serves to highlight the taxonomic rank that the article deals with (such as genus), provide a quick link to page for the immediate rank above (i.e. subfamily) and to the main ranks above (family, order, class, etc.) and a quick link to the ranks below. The list in the text would ideally include some phylogenetic information beyond the taxonomy (such as clustering species into established clades), phylogenetic ranks that no one would suspect would warrant an article (i.e. subgenera, and species groups), ranks below the listed taxa (subspecies) if they are few enough, common names, and perhaps basic geographic distribution. This is, of course, my opinion only. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 18:08, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re User:82.0.150.205 it seems he has added categories to several hundred animals. My biology is 20 years out of date, but it seemed like vandalism, so I started reverting them all.

<dd>Almost all of it seemed to be in good faith. There were two main problems. The first is applying the category to articles such as vole and hamster which are broad pages that pertain to many species at once. There are several species of vole in Pakistan, but many more that aren't there. The category should just be used on species-level pages. The second problem I have is that the category Fauna of Pakistan and Mammals of Pakistan were used at the same time on many pages. If Mammals of Pakistan applies, it should be the only one used. My answer in most cases would be no, don't revert everything. The edits are largely valid; there are just some that are problematic. Nothing I've seen is erroneous, though. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 05:12, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll try to get a closer look at it. My first impression is that it deals quite a bit with continuous characters such as measurements. It's very rare that tree reconstruction is performed using continuous characters. Some ways have been proposed, but those are difficult to implement and controversial. The vast majority of morphological analyses concern only discrete characters. Usually these are coded as binary characters (Does it have a backbone? no=0, yes=1; Does it have an amniotic egg? no=0, yes=1; Does it have mammary glands? no=0 yes=1). There are some instances where more than one option is possible (How many eyes does it have? none=0, two=1, five=3), but these still aren't continuous characters (2.764 eyes aren't an option). Computational phylogenetics was really developed on the basis of these coded discrete characters. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranae_c7be.html" title="User:Aranae">Aranae</a> 08:11, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you're right. It seems to me, as someone not terribly familiar with the method, that continuous characters require more explanation; it's fairly easy to see how you classify organisms into 'backbone', 'no backbone', but not so easy to see why you'd pick 'no tail', 'tail &lt;=x inches', 'x&lt;tail&lt;y inches', 'tail &gt;= y inches' for some seemingly arbitrary values of x and y. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 09:22, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
