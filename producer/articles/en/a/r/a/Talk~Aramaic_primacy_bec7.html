<li>Someone might explain to these editors that 1. Greek was not simply the language of mainland Greece in the 1st century, and 2. that the Aramaic-speaking inner circle of Jesus are not often confused with the Greek-speaking authors of the books of the New Testament by many educated readers and 3. that the New Testament is a library of books with various histories, not one book. Scarcely worth discussing as it stands. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 05:00, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>We have three Semitic utterances of Jesus. Indeed there are Aramaic words in them, but that is not enough to conclude for Aramaic as the language of Jesus. Why? Because the used forms of the verbs speek for normal Hebrew. The form 'koum' (in Talitha koum) is equal in Hebrew and in Aramaic and is not decisive.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. But then again, it could also be Arabic.&#160;:-) However, <i>talitha</i> the word that preceeds it, is the Aramaic form for "little girl" or "maiden." --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">Steve Caruso</a> 14:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The form 'sabachtani' (in Eloï Eloï lama sabachtani) is definitely Hebrew. In normal Aramaic and in Hebrew we would expect here 'sebachtani'. Without suffix the form is in Aramaic 'sebachta' and in Hebrew 'sabachta'. It is this Hebrew form that we recognize in 'sabachtani'. So we have here a less correct Hebrew form, but Hebrew anyway. Interesting is that the Aramaic word 'sebach' is used in the Mishna (Hebrew) instead of the old Hebrew word 'azab'. So the Aramaic 'sebach' was definitely a loanword in Hebrew in Jesus' days.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The word is <i>shvaqtani</i>/<i>shbaqthani</i> which is directly transliterated from Aramaic, not Hebrew. The <i>shin</i> became a <i>sigma</i> (as Greek does not have an "sh" sound), the <i>beth</i> became a <i>beta</i>. The <i>qof</i> became a <i>kappa</i>. The <i>tau</i> became a <i>theta</i>, the <i>noon</i> a <i>nu</i>, and the final <i>yodh</i> an <i>iota</i>. Vowels are liquid in Greek transliteration, especially between manuscript types. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">Steve Caruso</a> 14:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Than, last but not least: Effatha (Become open). In Aramaic this would be (two possibilities): Effetha (etpe'el) or Effattha (etpa'al). Comparing with Effatha we see in the first case 'e' instead of 'a', and in the second case 'double t' instead of 'one t'. The Hebrew form is 'Hiffatha', but in the Greek transliteration of the Greek New Testament and the Septuaginta (the old Greek translation of the Old Testament) 'Hi' becomes 'E'. And so the Hebrew Hiffatha becomes Effatha in Greek transliteration. The same is to see in the word 'Geënna' (place of the dead) which is in Hebrew 'Gehinna' (hi becomes ë). There are more examples to give for this phenomenon in Hebrew: Ezekia, Ennom, Ellel, Eddekel, etc.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The word could also be <i>ethfathakh</i> which is Aramaic. <i>Alap</i>, <i>ayin</i>, <i>khet</i>, and <i>he</i> were all pronounced similarly (like <i>he</i>) in Galilean Aramaic (or so claims the Mishnah). I can see that one could argue that it's too close to call between them, but not that it's exclusively Hebrew. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">Steve Caruso</a> 14:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The conclusion is the simple fact that Jesus used Aramaic loanwords when he spoke sometimes Hebrew. It is not possible to conclude from the Semitic utterances of Jesus that Aramaic was daily life language in Israel in the first century. Archaeological findings are neither conclusive for this standpoint. What is the meaning of this all? 1. The widespread idea that Jesus spoke Aramaic is a myth.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's a mighty large claim to make without the qualification of evidence to support it. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">Steve Caruso</a> 14:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. Hebrew and Greek were the two languages of the people in Jerusalem in Jesus time as we can learn from the two groups of Christians in the Jerusalem church: a Greek speaking and a Hebrew speaking group. Greek representing the lower social class and Hebrew representing the upper class. (Acts 6:1-2)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Describing that group as Hebrew-speaking is up to much debate. To make a truth claim either way concerning it would ignore all of the research that has been done on the subject. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">Steve Caruso</a> 14:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>3. As Jesus spoke in public to the lost sheep of Israel he spoke surely Greek (to the lower social class).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, there's very little evidence (given where he came from (Galilee), and the semitic-speaking cities he visited) that he knew much Greek at all. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">Steve Caruso</a> 14:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. During the second temple Jews spoke Hebrew in Judea to keep the knowledge of the Old Testament (Hebrew) alive.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Taking a look at the Dead Sea Scrolls, we can see that Hebrew was no longer the vernacular language. For example, the Great Isaiah Scroll is riddled with Aramaic words, spellings, and grammar, as if the scribes spoke in Aramaic and knew Hebrew as an academic language. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">Steve Caruso</a> 14:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>5. At home Jesus learned also Hebrew and he used it selectively, to people who had learned Hebrew at home, for instance to the daughter of the overseer of the synagogue in Kafarnaüm to raise her from the dead.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This assumes too much to be a strong argument (ex: That Hebrew was a spoken language, that Jesus learned Hebrew at home, that he used it selectively, that other people at the time learned Hebrew at home, that <i>talitha koum</i> is exclusively Hebrew, etc.). --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">Steve Caruso</a> 14:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>6. The teachings of Jesus in the gospels are not translations from Aramaic and even not of Hebrew. So we meet the original words of Jesus in the Greek New Testament.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly suggest that you read up on the Aramaic phenomena of Jesus' discourse as well as the narrative elements in the Gospels. There was at least one Aramaic <i>source</i> employed in writing each of the Gospels as well as Paul's letters, regardless of what language they ended up in&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">Steve Caruso</a> 14:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>7. The final conclusion is that Christians possess the original words of Jesus, the founder of their faith, in contrast with the opinion of both liberal and orthodox theologians that Christians don't have the authentic words of Jesus (ipsissima verba) at all.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No one has the "original words of Jesus." We don't know of any scribe that sat down and wrote out what he talked about verbatim, nor do we have any works from his own pen. To say that any one group has the "authentic words of Jesus" is misguided, in my humble opinion. It would be like us saying that we have the original words of Socrates. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman">Steve Caruso</a> 14:12, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How can the Peshitta be the original version of the New Testament when the Peshitta didn't exist until centuries after the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diatessaron.html" title="Diatessaron">Diatessaron</a> -- and since the Pehsitta was written in <i>EASTERN</i> Aramaic (i.e. Syriac), while Jesus spoke a form of <i>WESTERN</i> Aramaic? Also, mention should be made that the consensus of mainstream New Testament scholars is that there might possibly have been an original Aramaic "sayings document" (i.e. an unadorned list of quotations of Jesus) which influenced several of the Gospels, but no book of the New Testament as we have it today was translated directly from Aramaic or Hebrew to Greek... <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>As counter-intuitive as it seems, there are many Aramaic Primacists (exclusively from the Peshitta Primacy persuasion) who believe that the Diatessaron was harmonized <i>from</i> the Peshitta. It's positions like this that make a mockery out of the genuine field of Aramaic source criticism within the New Testament. Since the internet movement is popular, and the majority of seasoned Aramaic scholars are not that computer- and/or internet-savvy (poor Bruce Chilton), it's difficult to combat. <small><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Thadman_6354.html" title="User talk:The Thadman">אמר</a></small> <tt><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman"><font color="#0033CC">Steve Caruso</font></a></b></tt> <sub><b><font color="#000000">(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Desk_b02b.html" title="User:The Thadman/Desk">desk</a>/<a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a>)</font></b></sub> 04:44, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"claimed the Aramaic Peshitta was the original-language New Testament."</p>
<p>This is clumsy. I tried to fix it and then was reverted on interpretative grounds. Fine. But then interpret it for me: what on earth is this odd sentence supposed to mean? If you do know, please fix it. The last part is ambiguous and contains confusing grammar. Isn't there a connector missing beween "language" and "New Testament"?

<dl>
<dd>"Peshitta" is the name of the extant version of the New Testament in the Aramaic language. All adherents of the theory of Aramaic primacy are making a claim about the original-language text of the New Testament. (I don't really see how you can come up with a much less awkwared phrasing, because the whole point is that there's a disagreement about what the original language <i>is</i>.) Anyway, while most believers in Aramaic primacy consider the New Testament "original" to be some Aramaic version, now lost, older than the Peshitta, there are a few who are willing to say, no, the Peshitta, the version we actually possess and which mainstream scholars consider to be a translation into Aramaic, is in fact the original version of the New Testament, from which all others derive, albeit usually indirectly. I hope that provides the necessary clarification; I am not ambitious enough to attempt a better formulation myself. As far as why your reverted edit was a misconstrual, the key point to understand here is that the sentence in question does not refer to a claim about the original language of the New Testament; rather, within the large group of those who believe that that language was Aramaic, the sentence refers to a minority sub-group, who believe that one particular Aramaic version (the Peshitta, as opposed to a conjectured older Aramaic version) is the original. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 17:35, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I flagged the statement that most academics regard Lamsa's version as a bad translation with the {{fact}} tag, fully assuming that the statement was true and that references could and would be produced. The references that have been added, however, are unscholarly and do not sustain the statement about "most academics." First of all, they are not references to the published works of academics! Rather, we have (1) the pastor John Juedes<a href="http://empirenet.com/~messiah7/" class="external autonumber" title="http://empirenet.com/~messiah7/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, (2) a webpage by some person who writes poorly ("on account of many reasons") and who uses Juedes as his only source<a href="http://www.bibletopics.com/biblestudy/166.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bibletopics.com/biblestudy/166.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, (3) an article on "Syriac computing" in which I find a dismissal of Aramaic primacy, i.e. the soundness of Lamsa's agenda, but not a criticism of the quality of his translation work, and (4) an online bibliography of Syriac Orthodox Resources (not attributed by name to any scholar) that makes the offhand, unsupported comment that there is a better translation of the Peshitta.</p>
<p>I still believe that it would probably be easy to find support for the statement, but this is a travesty of what real support would look like. The obvious place to look is in reviews of Lamsa's translation, published in reputable scholarly journals in the fields of Biblical research and philology. So I'm removing the claim and the footnote. I will welcome the return of the statement with proper citations to reliable scholarly sources. Such citations can be found by Google, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22holy+bible+from+ancient+eastern+manuscripts%22+site%3Ajstor.org" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22holy+bible+from+ancient+eastern+manuscripts%22+site%3Ajstor.org" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the Google search you need, not the one that produced sources whose quality was the very opposite of the Cambridge University Press reference sitting next to them in the next footnote! <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 16:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I was in a hurry (<a href="http://www.intute.ac.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.intute.ac.uk" rel="nofollow">Intute</a> has nothing on Lamsa, so I had to rely on Google Scholar to find anyone who bothers with it!). George Kiraz's comment is worth keeping though, that's why I put that one first — he is certainly a Syriac scholar. Working in the academic field of Syriac studies and having read Lamsa's translation, I know that I and my colleagues, here and elsewhere, think it is increadibly poor stuff. He doesn't refer to the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diatessaron.html" title="Diatessaron">Diatessaron</a> or the Old Syriac versions (Peshitta primacy?), and translates the standard <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshitta.html" title="Peshitta">Peshitta</a> with a little help from the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a>. Lamsa's translation technique (speaking as one who translates Syriac as a day job) is simply poor — straightforward passages are given bizarre twists without any explanation, unusual passages in the Syriac are replaced by their KJV equivalent (he obviously couldn't work it out). Part of the problem of finding references is that Aramaic primacists have a reasonable web presence, whereas the academic community hardly ever feels that the subject is worth the effort, whether on the web or in print. I'll add the JSTOR article you referenced though. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 17:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an academic who works in ancient languages (not Syriac!) myself, I am sympathetic to the problem of having to correct misleading Wikipedia articles that fly in the face of scholarly <a href="../../../c/k/_/WP%7ECK_9def.html" title="WP:CK">common knowledge</a>. On the other hand, this is a controversial topic, and I'm glad the article now cites actual views from academia—thanks for that. When it comes to things that have been considered not to merit much scholarly attention, I'd propose the guidelines (1) correct any impression given by the article that unscholarly ideas issue from academic sources, (2) make the negative point that the ideas have not been recognized as worthwhile in any of the major scholarly journals, etc. (in my opinion, in this case the burden is on other editors to produce a counterexample).</dd>
<dd>I believe the statements in the lead could stand further improvement. Really, the <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">lead</a> is not the most appropriate place for arguing them, and it would be nice to see them developed in the body. I wish you would take your expertise (and knowledge of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to cite) and make the needed points in the sections "Peshitta Primacy" etc. below. Do they adequately present the reasons why the Peshitta should not be regarded as an independent witness to (even the Syriac) text? Is the mention of Geza Vermes as a "Critical Aramaic primacist" presented with enough nuance?

<dd>Peshitta primacy was seriously considered at an earlier stage of Syriac NT scholarship (Gwiliam is the chief proponent of this). Because of the slight witnesses to the other forms of Syriac NT tradition — Diatessaron and Old Syriac — the exact history of Syriac NT versions is a difficult business. All forms, however, show influence from the Greek NT, which is generally regarded as translation from Greek to Syriac. This is the opposite of Aramaic primacy — thus putting the Peshitta first is a complete reversal of the best reconstructed textual history. What the article refers to as 'critical Aramaic primacists' is rather odd. Black, Casey and Vermes do have their fair share of controversy, but are mainstream academics. They work on finding Aramaic undercurrents to the NT in the belief that it came out of an Aramaic milieu. In varying degrees, they recognise that the NT was severally composed in Greek, but that parts of it draw on Aramaic sources that may have been written down (that stray quote of Papias that keeps popping up!). I'm not sure that all of them would be happy with the label 'Aramaic primacist' (maybe I'll ask one of them!). They've worked on the Aramaic milieu of first-century Galilee and Palestine, but I don't think they are this dogmatic. It looks like their Aramaic-positive approach is being tagged onto the more extreme approach to lend creadence to it. I think it may be this that has led to a growing Aramaic-negative approach, emphasizing the continuing place of Hebrew. It's the usual academic swings and roundabouts, but they never swing out as far as this Lamsa/Younan stuff. Perhaps, as you say, the lead should be more descriptive and less argumentative. I think that your suggestions for dealing with fringe theories that have the appearance of academic acceptibility are good ones. I took that lead on my last edit to the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Younan_9bf5.html" title="Paul Younan">Paul Younan</a> article. Any other suggestions? — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 23:30, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quote from Papias was what first brought me into this article (at the time it was included in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> article). I went to the Greek and tried to give a fairer account of what Papias actually says (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aramaic_primacy&amp;diff=75153817&amp;oldid=74800196" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aramaic_primacy&amp;diff=75153817&amp;oldid=74800196" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). I also added the Hengel quote (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aramaic_primacy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83842988" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aramaic_primacy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=83842988" rel="nofollow">diff</a>), so that readers would see a standard and bland account of what a mainstream scholar supposes the impact of the "Aramaic milieu" is on the NT. From what you say, I'd think another good contribution you could consider would be a short account, with references, of the standard view of the textual history of the various ancient versions in question—arguments about their Greek Vorlagen would obviously be particularly worth reporting. I am not in a position to undertake any of this; if I were, Googling would lead me to try to mine <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fkRn3OIjdTEC" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=fkRn3OIjdTEC" rel="nofollow">Peter John Williams, <i>Early Syriac Translation Technique And The Textual Criticism Of The Greek Gospels</i></a> and <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0021-9231(199921)118%3A1%3C176%3ACEOTSG%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23" class="external text" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0021-9231(199921)118%3A1%3C176%3ACEOTSG%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23" rel="nofollow">Peterson's <i>JBL</i> review of Kiraz, <i>Comparative Edition of the Syriac Gospels</i></a> for something useful. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 01:19, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
