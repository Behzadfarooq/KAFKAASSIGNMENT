<p>This is a pretty good article, but it doesn't have any references. It has lots of external links though. If someone could add inline references (like <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_example_style_760b.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources/example style">this</a>), it would improve the article a lot. – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">random</a>)</sup> 20:45, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article wrongly states that the word 'Algebra' was taken from English, when it is in fact the opposite.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> The references have been organized, and I added one. Awhile back I added some stuff about Arabic Grammar, and the article looks pretty good now.

<p>Why were my edits over-written. Its a fact that when listing the languages of the world by the number of nations that claim them as official or national, then Arabic comes in third after English and French. Also, when talking about Palestine, all the arab countries recognize a Palestinian state under occupation. In the spirit of unbiased, free thinking Palestine should be refered to as Palestine (one and complete), not as Gaza and the "Palestine region". So as not to be accused of dillusion I had left Israel as is when I corrected the mishandling of Palestine. Having said all this I think that this website is very through, I appreciated the last comment on how collequial Yemeni Arabic is very similar to Classical Arabic. Up until that point I was getting frustrated with all the allegations that MSA is markedly different from the Classical. The fact is that I have a fourth-grade education in Arabic, however, when I read the Holly Quran I have little difficulties because most of the words used are familiar to me and if not to me then to my "illiterate" parents.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but in reality Palestine is split into two -- The Western bank and the Gaza strip. That's a fact, although I really hope it were so that Palestine would be a recognized state, not two vague entities. --Thorri 18:28, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You seem to be misssing the point Thorri. My whole point was that Palestine (as a state, under occupation yes, but never the less a whole nation) IS recognized by all the arab state as well as many african and asian nations. The only countries that seem to think that palestine must ask for its statehood from the unwilling Israel are those of Europe and my own USA. Now if the peace process does, by some stroke of luck, reach its ultimate goal of "two states for two peoples" then yes the Palestinian nation's land will occupy two seperated pieces of land. But even when that occurs it will be known as PALESTINE and not "Gaza and the Palestine region". See my point&#160;:)</p>
<p>I agree with anon, Thorri. We are talking about an official language of a nation or state and not a territory. It doesn't matter if it is split.

<p>Please reduce the amount of information in the infobox as soon as possible. It's supposed to be a quick summary, not a complete list. The huge list of language codes is especially pointless.

<dd>no; "Esperanto" is different, since that is actually the name of a language. "Latin" and "Arabic" are national or geographic adjectives. If we decide to redirect them to the language articles, that's fine, but it is still proper to have the titles "Arabic language" (al-lughatu-l-`arabiyyatu), "Latin language" (lingua latina). The dab page is at <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Latin (disambiguation)">Latin (disambiguation)</a> for purely practical reasons, the adjective 'Latin' still has a variety of meanings, referring to <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latins.html" title="Latins">Latins</a> just as much as to their language, and even to <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latino.html" title="Latino">Latinos</a>. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 12:32, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Arabic" is a noun that can only refer to the language. Look it up in a dictionary. That it also happens to be an adjective that occasionally alternates with "Arab" (as in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_world.html" title="Arab world">Arab world</a>) is irrelevant. Adjectives are not supposed to have entries in an encyclopedia. Using "Arabic language" in the lead is a perfect example of hypercorrectness. Just look at how its used in the rest of prose. I don't know what would be most proper in Arabic, but the one that should be chosen is the term that is used in Arabic dictionaries, not direct translations of decidedly hoaky English usage.</dd>

<dd>The case for moving this article to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> is a strong as that made for <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> (<a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> always means the language unless modified otherwise). The noun/adjective argument doesn't work too well here: in English, <i>Arabic</i> is both an adjective and a noun. English often makes no differentiation between many noun/adjective pairs. In Arabic itself, <i>al-`arabī</i> is used informally as a noun, even though it is formally an adjective. However, it is English grammar that is important in the choice of title. The <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28languages%29_8df0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (languages)">naming conventions</a> are clear that the form 'X language' is only adopted in the case that 'X' by itself doesn't reasonably refer to the language in first instant. Even though we can talk of the Arabic world or Arabic music, when the word is used by itself in English it means the language, just as with <i>Latin</i>. If someone want to move this page, I suggest they go to <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> and start the process. Getting onto the other subject here, I am the culprit who put all those varieties in the infobox. This was initially in line with the style taken from <a href="../../../s/i/l/SIL_International_dd72.html" title="SIL International">SIL</a>'s sense of a <i>macrolanguage</i>. This works well for many of these so-called macrolanguages:the infobox gives direct access to the various coding possibilities and links to articles about them. However, in the case of Arabic and <a href="../../../n/a/h/Nahuatl_language.html" title="Nahuatl language">Nahuatl</a>, the number of varieties gets a little out of hand. It might be better to find a third option, that of noting that there are other coding possibilities, and a link to them. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 18:17, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with everything you said.

<p>The Numbers in this article are out of date... "206 million (Ethnologue, native speakers of all dialects 1998 est.); 286 million (population of Arab countries, CIA World Factbook 2004 est.), excluding Arab minorities in other countries and bilingual speakers"</p>
<p>Firstly the "Ethnologue" number is way off (why is it still there?). Plus I just looked up the CIA World Factbook 2005 (latest available edition) and calculated Arabic speakers to be about 293 Million (although that's just a rough estimate). Also the 2006 edition of CIA World Factbook will be out soon so when it comes out someone should get the latest figures and add them here. (as it will likely have increased significantly again). <a href="../../../h/i/b/User%7EHibernian_671b.html" title="User:Hibernian">Hibernian</a></p>

<dd>why is the 206 number "way off"? You would expect the number of native speakers to be smaller than the number of total speakers.

<dd>I have seen it translated as "In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Merciful," because the root of <i>raHmaan</i> and <i>raHiim</i> (<i>rHm</i>) are the same. The first indicates one who is full of the attribute while the second is an adjective of regular intensity. If one wants to be accurate. A better transliteration would be "<i>bismi-llaahi-rrahmaani-rraheem</i>" - it is pronounced as if one word, basically, thanks to <i>waSlah</i>, and such a transliteration preserves the grammatical vowel marks at the end of each word. bi + [ismun -&gt; definite = ismu] = bismi ([i] of "bi" dropped to be replaced by opening vowel of "ismu", [u] (nominative) -&gt; [i] (objective); bismi + allaahu (iZaafah) = bismi-llaahi ([u] (nominative) -&gt; [i] (objective), [a] dropped because of waSlah, replaced by grammatical objective ending of previous word); bismi-llaahi + [al + raHmaanun = ar-raHmaanu ([l] dropped as tashdeed is added to [r] as [r] is a sun letter] (iZaafah) = bismi-llaahi-rraHmaani ([u] (nominative) -&gt; [i] (objective), [a] dropped because of waSlah, replaced by grammatical objective ending of previous word); bismi-llaahi-rraHmaani + [al + raHmiimun = ar-raHiimu ([l] dropped as tashdeed is added to [r] as [r] is a sun letter] (iZaafah)] = bismi-llaahi-rraHmaani-rraHiimi ([u] (nominative) -&gt; [i] (objective), [a] dropped because of waSlah, replaced by grammatical objective ending of previous word; the final [i] is not pronounced as it is at the end of a phrase). <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitabparast_98b3.html" title="User:Kitabparast">Kitabparast</a> 03:36, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hey guys, this probably isn't the best place to ask, but I need help from someone who knows Arabic. I just finished a stub for <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Iraq_4496.html" title="Persian Iraq">Persian Iraq</a> to help out with the <a href="../../../1/9/1/Wikipedia%7E1911_Encyclopedia_topics_f926.html" title="Wikipedia:1911 Encyclopedia topics">missing articles project</a>. Apparently the English transliteration for the region's name is 'Iraq 'ajami (or something similar). Ideally I would also like to include the name in its original Arabic script form, but I can't read Arabic or write with Arabic script, so I'm pretty lost. I somehow managed to figure out the Cyrillic version of <a href="../../../z/a/y/Zaysan_%28town%29.html" title="Zaysan (town)">Zaysan</a>, but I think I'm beyond my element on this one. Anyone want to help me out on this little scavenger hunt? BTW, I'm not sure if 'Iraq 'ajami is actually Arabic or Persian/Farsi. Maybe you guys could tell me. Supposedly it means "foreign Iraq", so maybe that's a clue that it's actually Arabic (since they are calling Persia "foreign"). Really I have no clue. Sorry if I'm totally barking up the wrong tree&#160;:) If you have any hints for me, please send them to my talk page.

<dd>'Iraq 'Ajami is Arabic, better al-'Iraq al-'Ajami; 'Ajami was a phrase applied to Persia/Persians, and does mean "foreign" - actually more like 'barbarian' in the old Greek sense of "those guys who don't talk like us" - non-Arab in other words. I don't know the phrase is a correct, it doesn't ring a bell but I'm not a Persia/Iraq guy.

<p>Shouldn't it be mentioned? or at least referred to it bears a lot of words borrowed from arabic.

<dd>Yes, the 206 million figure is too small by at least 100 million, partly because it's 10 years out of date, partly because it was too small to begin with.

<dd>Thanks that was a fast reply. I also noticed that the article says that Arabic is "slightly before Portuguese and Bengali". The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers.html" title="List of languages by number of native speakers">Language ranking</a> puts Arabic above both Bengali and Portuguese, but it is below Indonesian. (It's a single language??) Maybe the articles should say "approximately 300 million" or something, putting it above all 3 of those languages?

<dd>I just tallied up figures from the CIA factbook, which does indeed give 323 million (July 2006 estimate, how prescient!) as the population of the Arab world. I then used generous estimates (partially based on ethnologue) for numbers of <i>mother-tongue</i> Arab speakers, included below, and find a total of just over 270 mil. This includes Arabic in Chad and Iran. You could add another mill for France, but remember that not all North Africans are Arabic speakers: many (50%?) in France are Kabyle or Sous. So how about changing to 270 mil? --<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 06:10, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm glad to see other westerners wish to learn Arabic, and as much as this discussion is off topic, I too would love to learn the beutiful Arabic language. I'm learning Chinese first though.

You can try the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arabic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arabic" rel="nofollow">Arabic Wikibook</a>.

<dd>A few days ago i got an arabic audio language course on cd. I've been listening to it for several hours each day for the last few days. One thing that needs to be considered here is that many, maybe all, arab countries have their own dialects of arabic. Another thing that needs to be considered is that arabic is written and read from right to left, instead of left to right like english is. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGringo300_19ab.html" title="User:Gringo300">Gringo300</a> 04:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The influence of Arabic has been most profound in those countries dominated by Islam or Islamic power.(...)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is somewhat contradictory, since the Iberian peninsula was in fact "dominated by Islam" for some centuries, and yet Spanish and Portuguese appear earlier on this section alongside Italian (which was less influenced by Arabic and only marginally touched by Islam). I propose the following: a) to mention, in a separate sentence, all major European languages or dialects in which the influence of Arabic was considerable and the result of Islamic rule (notice that the current sentence structure places that mention as merely an addendum to the information on Arabic words in English). Then you would have: Mozarabic (most obviously), Spanish, Portuguese, Astur-Leonese, Aragonese, Catalan and Sicilian. b) and then change the reference "those countries dominated by Islam or Islamic power" to something like "regions with long-standing and permanent contact with Islam and culturally or politically affected by Islamic power, such as..." (not yet the ideal phrasing, to be sure, but a start...) 201.21.200.147 05:40, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for the fascinating mix of Tunisian Arabic and German, whoever that was. I followed the link to the vote page and found nothing about this proposal. Just for the record, I <b>oppose</b> a transliterated version of Arabic as a new language for Wikipedia. Here are my reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no universally accepted standard way of transliterating Arabic in Latin characters. However, there is only one way of spelling Arabic words in the Arabic script.</li>
<li>Many of the characters used in the various transliteration schemes do not display on modern web browsers such as Internet Explorer 6.0.</li>
<li>The Arabic alphabet is particularly well suited to the representation of the sounds of Arabic, without the use of digraphs.</li>
<li>If you want to appreciate the beauty of the language, learning the actual alphabet will serve you well. The script is alphabetic (a so-called "impure" <a href="../../../a/b/j/Abjad.html" title="Abjad">abjad</a>) with only 28 basic symbols - a far smaller burden on the memory than many other scripts. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECbdorsett_98d9.html" title="User:Cbdorsett">Cbdorsett</a> 05:42, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would like to correct a typo but don't know how to do so. The adjective form of "Maghreb" is "Maghrebi," hence on the list of dialectal forms it should say "Maghrebi Arabic" not "Maghreb Arabic"</p>

<p>I think the following things need to be fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sounds:Vowels</b>: The short vowel /a/ does not differ in quality from the long vowel /ā/. If we are talking about either Modern Standard Arabic or Fusha, it is <i>incorrect</i> to state that the short vowel should be rendered as "[ɛ̈] (open e as in English bed, but centralised)". Doubtless this is true of some dialect somewhere. Maybe the author is trying to approximate the Tunisian /a/, which falls precisely on the dividing line between American English /a/ as in "bad" and /e/ as in "bed". <b>Recommendation:</b> change to "[æ]" as in "bad", except after /r/, where it is pronounced [ɑ], as the "o" in American English "hot".</li>
<li><b>Sounds:Syllable structure</b>: It is not correct to assert that Arabic has CVVC and CVCC syllable structures, at least, not on a par with CV, CVV and CVC. CVVC and CVCC can <i>only</i> occur when the final vowel of a word is trimmed off due to the regular practice at the end of a sentence or phrase. This process has a name, which I can't remember. Again, this article deals with Modern Standard Arabic, not any of the dialects, where those identified syllable structures CAN be found, along with CCV, CCVV (where VV represents a long vowel) and CCVCC.</li>
<li><b>Sounds:Consonants</b>: "deemed" this really should be "termed"</li>
<li><b>Sounds:Consonants</b>: about the velarization of the /l/, this is sometimes found in grammar books, but in actual practice and in modern dialects, an unvelarized /l/ is often heard in the word <i>Allāh</i>. The phrase "when the word follows" should be "when the /l/ follows"</li>
<li><b>Sounds:Stress</b>:
<ul>
<li>"Only the last three syllables may be stressed" should be written "Stress falls on one of the last three syllables."
<ul>
<li>Stress never falls on the grammatical markers -u, -a, -i, -un, -an, -in (noun suffixes)</li>
<li>Stress never falls on the grammatical markers -tu, -ta, -ti, -a, -nā, -tum, -ū (verb suffixes (perfect) ) or -u, -a (verb suffixes (imperfect) ).</li>
<li>Stress always falls on the last syllable of grammatical markers -ā, -atā and -tumā (verb suffixes (dual perfect) )</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead of "Given this restriction, the last "heavy" syllable (containing a long vowel or followed by two consonants) is stressed", it should be "The second-to-last syllable takes the stress if it is a "long" syllable (CVC or CVV, where VV represents a long vowel).</li>
<li>If the second-to-last syllable is a short syllable (CV), stress falls on the third-to-last syllable.</li>
<li>Dropping of the grammatical endings at the end of a sentence or phrase <b>sometimes</b> causes the stress to shift. /jā<b>mi'</b>atun/ -&gt; /<b>jā</b>mi'a/</li>
<li>The occurrences of the word <i>heavy</i> should be replaced with <i>long</i></li>
<li>The last paragraph deals exclusively with dialectal variants, and so should be moved to the section <b>Dialectal variations</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Dialectal variations</b>:
<ul>
<li>/q/ is rendered as /ɡ/ in Southern Tunisia, though not in Northern Tunisia</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>actually that should be /g/ in rural dialects, and /q/ in urban.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>/ʤ/ is rendered as /ʒ/ in Tunisia</li>
<li>Some varieties of Levantine Arabic render /ay/ as /e/ and /aw/ as /o/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Grammar</b>: I object to the use of <b>[</b> to represent either 'ain or alif in the examples of triconsonantal roots.</li>
<li><b>Writing system</b>: This lead paragraph needs some language cleanup.</li>
<li><b>Writing system:Calligraphy</b>: Calligraphy has NOT fallen out of use in the Western world. I also question the reference to two 'modern' masters of the art form. Isn't this like a commercial plug?</li>
<li><b>Transliteration</b>: As far as I know, there is not a single 'standard' for transliteration of Arabic into Latin characters. There are many systems, but none of them are standard. Correct me if I'm wrong; otherwise, these terms should be changed in the article.</li>

<p>Why don't you just go ahead and fix these things? As for dialect variations, I personally think this article should discuss both MSA and dialects in each section, while clearly distinguishing the two. After all, the dialects are much more used in actual speech than MSA, and focusing only on MSA in an article called "Arabic" is quite disingenuous. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 07:26, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the vote of confidence. I will, in a while, after people have a reasonable chance to sound off. I don't think this article should be used as a dumping ground for details about all the dialects; each dialect can have its own page for such things.

<dd>I believe that after reading this article, one can safely respond to this, that Arabic has three vowel with two lenghts, and a few diphthongs even. /a/, /i/, /u/, /a:/, /i:/, /u:/, /ai/, and /au/. Writing generally does not include short vowels, but long vowels are written, as is the later part of the diphthong. (Leaving some ambiguity if you're new to the language, if an I, or U in arabic is actually a diphthong, or a long vowel.) I don't believe any further comment on this is necessary. --<a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuellanivis_b7b1.html" title="User:Puellanivis">Puellanivis</a> 22:31, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
