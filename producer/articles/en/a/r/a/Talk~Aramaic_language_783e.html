<p>Jesus spoke a western Aramaic dialect? Leaving aside the occasionally raised question of whether he was a real person at all rather than an allegorical figure or suchlike, are we sure? That's an awfully confident assertion considering he left no writings or, um, audio recordings.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be contentious, it just seems to me there's, if not an NPOV issue, at least a question of evidence here. I'm not saying we (archaeologists as a group, Biblical scholars as a group, the West, whoever) aren't as certain as one can be about this sort of thing, but the way it's worded now the reader has to take it, as it were, on faith.</p>
<p>Would "Jesus is believed to have spoken...." or "Jesus most likely spoke...." be too weak or offensive or non-neutral? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalieber_db73.html" title="User:Calieber">Calieber</a> 12:48, 25 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In fact, we do know that Jesus spoke a form of Aramaic; the gospels, though written in Greek, give several quotes from him in Aramaic specifically, most famously "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" (My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?) and "Abba" (Father) and "Talitha cumi" (Arise, girl.) So the original statement was justified. - Mustafa</dd>

<p>However, the "Aramaic" on Cyprus is in fact an Arabic dialect, and has no place in the article - Mustafa</p>

<p>Garzo, much has changed since the scholarship of the early half of the last century. Now Hebrew linguists believe Hebrew was a spoken language during the Roman Period of Israel. For example: "The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church that once said in 1958 in its first edition, Hebrew 'ceased to be a spoken language around the fourth century BC', now says in 1997 in its third edition, <b>Hebrew 'continued to be used as a spoken</b> and written <b>language in the New Testament period'</b>". Hebrew was a spoken language during Jesus's lifetime. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHaldrik_30ef.html" title="User:Haldrik">Haldrik</a> 02:25, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Obviously right. I reverted to an earlier version - the recent changes were to the worse of the article. Not only the obvious POV of a greek cyrus nationalist, also the addition about <i>language of Jesus</i> are at least bad formatted. As I have no real knowledge about this language I choosed the last version which look obviously good - but maybe I removed some valid information by that, so feel free to look into the history and re-add what I deleted too much. <a href="../../../a/h/o/User%7EAhoerstemeier_88c8.html" title="User:Ahoerstemeier">andy</a></dd>

<p>The current article does not make the relation between different Aramaic languages very clear. Unfortunately, it is often the case that 'Jesus Aramaic' can take over (perhaps it needs a separate section or page), and the breadth and history of the language is lost.</p>
<p>I reckon that Ma'lula Aramaic is quite clearly a Modern Western Aramaic, but I often see it described as 'Syriac' or 'Eastern'.</p>
<p>I hope nobody minds if I attempt to put some more structure and scope into this article over the next couple of days. Of course, all feedback is welcome.</p>

<p>I think we shall need to rewrite a family of related articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles on <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_languages.html" title="Aramaic languages">Aramaic languages</a> (e.g. <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandaic_language.html" title="Mandaic language">Mandaic language</a>).</li>
<li>Broader themes in Aramaic, like:
<ul>
<li>Biblical Aramaic, referring to the Aramaic of the Hebrew Bible only.</li>
<li>The 'Aramaic of Jesus', dealing with various, difficult issues about his language and Aramaic words and phrases found in the New Testament.</li>
<li>An article titled 'Jewish Aramaic', or some such, to deal with the Aramaic of Targum, Midrash and Talmud.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel that it would be more helpful to have a single article on Aramaic that deals with the broad historical and linguistic details, and then have these seperate articles for more information on specific areas of interest.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Are there any good suggestions for the names for 'Aramaic of Jesus' and 'Jewish Aramaic'?</p>

<p>I've uploaded a completely new article for 'Aramaic language'. I'm sorry that I deleted most of the content from the previous version, but I felt that it didn't have enough structure to it.

<li><i>especially those influenced by the pronunciation of Western dialect <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Hebrew_bc92.html" title="Modern Hebrew">Modern Hebrew</a></i>&#160;: I'm not sure what you're saying here.</li>
<li><i>Dental/sibilant shifting — This is a process that has been going on for millennia. Dental consonants (</i>t<i>,</i> d<i>,</i> θ<i>,</i> ð<i>) shift into sibilants (</i>s<i>,</i> z <i>and</i> sh<i>) and back again.</i> surely this is three unrelated sound changes: the decay of PSem th, dh, followed by the rise and fall of the spirant allophones of plosives? - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 13:36, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Good call, Mustafaa! I was trying to fill out that section off the top of my head. I wanted to say something about the loss of emphatics, but wasn't quite sure (hence the vague comment). I also wanted to point out the Proto-semitic fricative correspondence to sibilants in Hebrew and dental stops/fricatives in Aramaic, and tie it in with a shift to sibilants in Neo-aramaic. It was all a bit of a muddle: thank you for clearing it up.</p>
<p>Do you think the vowel-change section could be expanded? I just thought it was too big to deal with in the article.</p>
<p>I notice that the article is very long now. Do you think some of the material here could be shifted into sub-pages? I was thinking along the lines of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Aramaic_deab.html" title="Biblical Aramaic">Biblical Aramaic</a>, the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_of_Jesus_ecb6.html" title="Aramaic of Jesus">Aramaic of Jesus</a> (which I've made a rough start on), 'Jewish Aramaic', and something on the Neo-aramaic languages.</p>

<p>The vowel-change section? Man, if we just did the Tiberian vowels for Biblical Aramaic that would be an article in itself! But other dialects might be easier to summarize. Such a section could start from the vowels of Proto-Semitic and work forward... Certainly some material could be shifted to subpages; Neo-Aramaic, for instance, could easily be expanded into an article in its own right, and as you said, the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_of_Jesus_ecb6.html" title="Aramaic of Jesus">Aramaic of Jesus</a> could be shifted into that article.

<p>I don't feel that the addition of this template is useful to an already overlong article focused on linguistic and historical matters. I have suggested a page on 'Jewish Aramaic' (or something like that) to go into the place of the language in Jewish religion and culture. My suggestion has been made on various related talk pages. I know that the removal of someone's work isn't to be done lightly, but I do feel that this addition is really unnecessary. I suggest that appropriate text could link to appropriate articles on Jewish Aramaic, or a new one to cover that subject. Please feel free to air thoughts on this matter here.</p>

<p>The latest edit was the addition of the Lord's Prayer, the text is below. I'm not happy with it for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The article is already very long: new material has to be worth it.</li>
<li>No explanation of the text is included.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshitta.html" title="Peshitta">Peshitta</a> is in Syriac, and Jesus is presumed to have spoken Old Galilean Aramaic.</li>
<li>The text here is given in <i>square script</i>: the Peshitta is written in the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_alphabet.html" title="Syriac alphabet">Syriac alphabet</a>.</li>
<li>The Peshitta version is based on Greek texts.</li>
<li>The English translation is over simplistic (particularly in the translation of Syriac tenses).</li>
<li>Matthew or Luke?</li>
</ol>
<p>In its present state, this addition is misleading. All sorts of things are claimed about Aramaic, particularly by ill-informed Christians. This makes it important that the linguistic facts are presented clearly, and not in such a confused manner. A possible solution would be to include the text in a more relevant article (<a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_Prayer_8f51.html" title="Lord's Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/s/Peshitta.html" title="Peshitta">Peshitta</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramaic_of_Jesus_ecb6.html" title="Aramaic of Jesus">Aramaic of Jesus</a>), use Syriac script and either a standard English translation of the Lord's Prayer or an accurate one. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 14:18, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry about that, Zappaz. I can get a little shirty where Aramaic is concerned. A certain film has made Aramaic popular, and I believe that it's important to get as much good, factual information about on the web. You must have put in a good deal of time with the unicode. If you're interested, the Syriac unicode escape code values start in the 800s.

<p>I really don't like the two edits that have been made to the lead section: they are simply bad English. I want to keep the lead section as a good bit of prose, and these edits tear into it in some search for a hidden bit of neutrality. The lead section originally read:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I think that is fine and good. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZZyXx_7492.html" title="User:ZZyXx">ZZyXx</a> changed it to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Aramaic</b> is a <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic_language.html" title="Semitic language">Semitic language</a> with a 3,000-year history.

<p>The change is obvious: the simple word <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> is replaced by the list of <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>. Whether Jewish, Christian or other, most readers will understand what is meant by <i>Bible</i>. I did not use the phrase <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_Bible_28e7.html" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> because of the clash that comes when the meaning is openned up: some parts of the Bible written in Hebrew were written in Aramaic. <i>Tanakh</i> is really just an acronym for the same thing, and is understood by few non-Jewish readers. I felt that <i>Bible</i> was the right word, as we're talking about the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Daniel_27ba.html" title="Book of Daniel">Book of Daniel</a> and the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ezra_c059.html" title="Book of Ezra">Book of Ezra</a>, really. Those books are in the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible, so why split hairs?</p>
<p>The compromise revision by <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The term Tanakh is used again, and we have made <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a></i> visible. I think that this is worse.

<p>I hope I don't get accused of being anti-Jewish: I wouldn't appreciate that at all. I am trying to write a good encyclopaedia article on the Aramaic language.

<dd>I can live with "some parts of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>"; my concern is that it actually gives too much weight to the "New Testament in Aramaic" theory. The part about the Talmud was wrong, though; most of it is written Aramaic, but a lot is in Hebrew, particularly in the Jerusalem Talmud. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:40, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The body of the article does make it clear that the Talmud is in Aramaic, and actually goes into the different layers of Aramaic that are built into it, with some pieces of Hebrew. I still think it's fair to say that the Talmud is in Aramaic: it is its main language, and the language of its architecture. Hebrew is only used in Biblical quotations, and some of these are from Targum, and some older midrashic material. Perhaps it would be easier if we say what we mean: "It is the original language of a large section of the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Daniel_27ba.html" title="Book of Daniel">Book of Daniel</a> and the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Ezra_c059.html" title="Book of Ezra">Book of Ezra</a>" and "It is the main language of the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>".

<p>I know this is controversial, but it is also important. When I completed the timeline, at the end of February, I included an event in 1915 marked <i>Turkish persecution</i>. Having set up the articles on various Neo-Aramaic dialects, I realised just how important this event was. It is part of the controversial <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_genocide.html" title="Armenian genocide">Armenian genocide</a>. This reference was recently removed as "propaganda". Feeling that the used hadn't properly addressed the issue enough to warrant the deletion of the event, I reinserted it with the slightly less controversial title <i>Persecution in Turkey</i>. I am not anti-Turkish, in fact I am going to be in eastern Turkey this August, but I do feel that controversial issues should not simply be deleted. Can we reach a consensus? --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 15:22, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course we can reach consensuses? (consensi? I don't know&#160;:) There is no mention of the "persecution" in the article text, it is all I object to. If it was a landmark event in the development and/or extinction of Aramaic, you have all the reasons in the world to include it in the timeline. But this also begs the question, why isn't there a mention in the article text if it was "an important event"? On another note, what most people fail to realize is the land was not called "Turkey" then. It was "the Ottoman Empire". This is in no way to deny or ignore the wrongdoings of the Empire, but we as Turkish citizens (attention: not "Turks"), at least the more educated ones, try to distance ourselves from the wrongdoings and misdeeds of a monarchist/feudal regime that was toppled by Ataturk and the nation. Turks are the majority of Turkish Citizens, which also includes Kurds (nearly 20% of population of Turkey), Armenians, Levantines, Greeks and Arabs. For all practical intents, we can assume Turkey was founded on October 29, 1923, with the declaration of the Republic, whereas the abovementioned peoples were already mixed and lived in harmony for centuries, and continue to do so up to this day.

<p>I recently had the opportunity to discuss with several Lakota (aka Sioux -- but try to say Lakota) their shock and surprise that for certain parts of the Aramaic dialogue in the film <i><b>Passion of the Christ</b></i> they did not have to look at the subtitles in order to understand.</p>
<p>They addressed this to their local council, and they, in turn, contacted Icon, Mel Gibson's production company. The reply was also very surprised in tone, as the filmmakers had not at all looked at Lakota language, but instead to scholars, linguists and modern Aramaic-speakers in order to as accurately as possible present the language as spoken at the birth of the Common Era.</p>
<p>Any chance of someone looking into this further, and possibly adding something to the main article?</p>

<dd>I thought it was fair to point out that this article uses Beyer's classification system: the article says so, and the references give the source. However, that is different from saying that the article's content is based on Beyer. I used Beyer to start with because his system of dividing Old/Middle/Modern Aramaic is clearly based on whether the language is no longer used, an extinct literary language or a modern spoken tongue. There are other classification systems, but they all use quite odd choices for the division between Old and Middle dialects. Beyer is generally disliked for placing the end of Old Aramaic's period later than other classifications. I feel that stating which system is being used is sufficient: the article doesn't need to be clogged with all the rival ideas.

<p>Shouldn't it be noted that present day Levantine "Arabic" is an offshoot of Aramaic? Or would this discomfort the many pan-Arabists who only see it as a "dialect" of Arabic? The relationship between Aramaic and the Levant language has even been pointed out in the article on Lebanese Arabic, so it might make the page on Aramaic a little more complete and interesting if it mentions that a form of Aramaic is actually still spoken by several million people.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it is an interesting point, but Levantine Arabic is still Arabic. I've bumped into a few Aramaic words in Levantine Arabic, but this is all one would expect for an Arabic dialect that displaced widely-spoken Aramaic. The influence of Syriac-speaking Maronites probably enhanced this feature in Lebanese Arabic. However, it stretches the point to call these dialects 'forms of Aramaic': the bulk of their grammar and vocabulary are still very securely Arabic. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 08:51, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I disagree with both articles. The Wikipedia article is flagged as needing attention. It is obvious that Lebanese Arabic is different from classical and standard Arabic: enough to say that they are different languages. However, that doesn't mean that Lebanese is not Arabic: many colloquial Arabics differ more from the standard. It is absolutely wrong to say that Lebanese is Aramaic: the only features of Aramaic grammar that can be seen are those shared with Arabic anyway. However, it is reasonable to point out the importance of Aramaic in the formation of Labanese dialect of Arabic. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 18:26, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Arameans themselves never held an empire. So why did their language become the lingua franca of the Ancient Near East? Or were the Assyrians ethnically Arameans? It would be helpful to have information about this in the article. <a href="../../../r/c/s/User%7ERCSB_30e1.html" title="User:RCSB">RCSB</a> 14:51, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aramaic reached what could be called <i>lingua franca</i> status in the 8th century BC. The total domination of the Assyrian Empire over Aram/Syria was in the reign of <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiglath-pileser_III_b5a0.html" title="Tiglath-pileser III">Tiglath-pileser III</a>, but parts of the region were under Assyrian control before his time. It is very unhelpful to introduce comments about ethnicity into this picture: ethnicity is a rather subjective feature after all. Assyrians spoke <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkadian_language.html" title="Akkadian language">Akkadian</a>, which, although it is a <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic_language.html" title="Semitic language">Semitic language</a> like Aramaic, is completely incomprehensible from it. Inscriptions from Gozan indicate that, perhaps from the 11th century, eastern Aramaic had developed a powerful, flexible phonetic orthography. The versatile language of the majority of the population of the Assyrian Empire led to Aramaic's use as a lingua franca, and the eventual relegation of Akkadian cuneiform. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 16:40, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>I'm just wondering - is there any language, anywhere, at any time, that hasn't been a language of divine worship? This is poetic for the lead paragraph, to be sure, but superfluous. And to say <i><b>the</b> language...</i> gives kind of short shrift to all that non-Judeo-Christian worship out there.

<dd>The numbers game for Aramaic is a difficult one. Modern Aramaic has splintered into many mainly mutually unitelligible dialects spoken by small communities in remote places and throughout a diverse diaspora. Also, many people use various Middle Aramaic dialects for religious purposes: religiously educated Jews, Syriac Christians and Mandaeans often could be described as fluent in these effectively extinct dialects. The Amarauna site above is completely misleading as it only deals with Christian Neo-Aramaic, and it does not give sources. The other estimate, even though it is only mentioned in passing, is given by Yona Sabar, who is in a good positon to give a fair estimate. I would support his estimate, which is more likely accurate than adding the various figures on Ethnologue. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 12:26, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That paragraph mentions that this is a twelfth-century-BCE settlement of people identified as Aramaeans in the area that is today occupied by Syria, Iraq and eastern Turkey.

<p>If a language is spoken by hundreds of thousands of people how could it be considered endangered? I can only come up with the explanation the number of speakers is rapidly dropping: the large majority of speakers are <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilingual.html" title="Bilingual">bilingual</a> and don’t rise their children in that language. How is the situation of Aramaic?</p>

<dd>Hi Lena. A few hundred-thousand speakers does make a language endagered, especially when Modern Aramaic is really a group of related languages rather than a single, monolithic one. The various Jewish varieties, Modern Mandaic and Western Neo-Aramaic are seriously endagered. The Christian varieties are faring slightly better, but the effect of diaspora is making some negative impact on the language. — <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 14:58, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Appearantly, the word ”Aramic” standrs for a group of three languages: Mandaic, Neo-Aramic and Christian Aramic. How many speakers does the three languages have? Are their numbers rapidly dropping for the reason I mentioned? If a language has hundreds of thousadns of speakers and the number is relatively stable it is NOT endangered. You may as well claim that <a href="../../../i/c/e/Icelandic.html" title="Icelandic">Icelandic</a> is ”endangered” since it has 300,000 speakers. The Icelanders are wery protective of their language and their number have probably never been higher. Consequently, you don't have to fear the extintion of Icelandic.</p>

<p><a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Shortz_8d1f.html" title="Will Shortz">Will Shortz</a> made an error yesterday (2006-12-17) on <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Public_Radio_8b7c.html" title="National Public Radio">NPR's</a> Weekend Edition/Sunday's puzzle segment yesterday. For the two-word phrase "dead languages," Will gave the clue "Latin or Aramaic." This article shows that Aramaic is a language family, and it is endangered but not extinct.

<dd>Aramaic is a group of closely related dialects that could be, and often is, considered to be a single language. You are correct that it is not quite dead. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 16:11, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>not only that Aramic isnt dead, many words and terms in Hebrew are in pure Aramic, and some people in isreal (more then you would think) can read and talk this language perfectly, (just wanted to mantion) Omer.</p>
