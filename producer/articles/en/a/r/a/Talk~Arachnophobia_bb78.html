<p>I say the following as a complete outsider, as an experienced Wikipedian who has never participated in the discussion here but who has been silently watching it for several months now: For goodness' sakes, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">User:Mikkalai</a>, your interpretation of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_is_not_censored.html" title="Wikipedia is not censored">Wikipedia is not censored</a> is so asinine that it borders on <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WikiLawyering</a>!

<p>So here's my sudden thought: why don't we replace the photo with one which somehow depicts the phobia itself? Perhaps a cartoon of some kind would work — although I'm not an arachnophobe myself, I would guess that drawn renditions are usually not quite as frightening as realistic photos (but do correct me if I'm wrong). I seem to recall at least one other article with tries this trick (of using a drawing to depict something sort of abstract) for a different reason, but I can't recall which one.</p>
<p>The other specific possibility I can think of right now (feel free to ponder along similar lines) would be an image from a film such as <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_0d33.html" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></i>, in which (<i>spoiler alert</i>) the character Ron must confront his arachnophobia by facing down enormous spiders called <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Harry_Potter_Beasts_06c0.html#Acromantula" title="Minor Harry Potter Beasts">Acromantulas</a>. If one such frame were used (without violating copyright rules of course), it wouldn't even need to include an image of one of the spiders themselves at all, just that of Harry and a terrified Ron behind the windshield of that car (if I remember the movie correctly).</p>
<p>An obvious objection would be that such depictions tend to be exaggerated and therefore possibly offensive to arachnophobes (consider that comedy, rather than sympathy, is drawn from Ron's phobia in the film). That said, you'll be hard-pressed to find a depiction which <i>doesn't</i> seem "out-of-wack" to some achranophobes, since each one experiences the fear in a different way. Even supposing that the fear were confronted and captured with permission on a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candid_camera.html" title="Candid camera">candid camera</a>, it probably <i>still</i> wouldn't seem "right".</p>
<p>Such, sadly, is the nature of irrational fears (irrational in the sense that they persist even when actual dangers are absent, not in the sense that there isn't any basis for the fear in the first place): It's basically "all in your head", and models like computer images can only approximate, but never match, them. (It would seem to require some sort of science-fiction device to produce an image that would instantly make non-arachnophobes understand the fear without simultaneously causing that fear in arachnophobes.) Yeah, it's a doozy, all right.</p>
<p>All that aside, I'm still in favor of my own idea, and and very willing to do the searching/uploading necessary to find such an image if others support it. --<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenoxus_9f29.html" title="User:Lenoxus">Lenoxus</a> 02:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All right, so having taken closer attention to the other text on this page (even the stuff which isn't split into paragraphs, at which point my eyes usually kinda blur, sorroy) I see that this idea has indeed been raised by two users: <a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETaggedJC_afd1.html" title="User:TaggedJC">TaggedJC</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGilgamesh_f381.html" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>. The former suggests something similar to my cartoon notion, instead regarding a picture with a toy, while the latter suggests something entiely different from either of us: A diagram indicating the more frightening parts of spiders and how this correlates with , perhaps in such a way as would midigate the fear-inducing qualities of such a picture. I would support either of these notions, although I naturally have a slightly less vague sense of the first. --<a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenoxus_9f29.html" title="User:Lenoxus">Lenoxus</a> 03:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another suggested cause of arachnophobia is that it is a disorder of <a href="../../../f/a/c/Face_perception.html" title="Face perception">face perception</a> in the affected individuals. In this theory, a person's brain is accustomed to the facial and body features of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">humans</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertebrate.html" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a>, including the abstract positions, shapes and numbers of eyes, nostrils, mouth, and the face of the wider recognizable body as a whole. In non-vertebrates, and particularly so with spiders, the functions of eyes, mouth and legs may be recognized, but as they appear in the "wrong" shapes, sizes, amounts, locations, etc., the sight of a spider can trigger the brain to perceive a scary and disturbing image, triggering the release of <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hormone.html" title="Hormone">hormones</a> that produce an immediate and compelling <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight-or-flight_response.html" title="Fight-or-flight response">fight-or-flight response</a>. As most sufferers of arachnophobia come from parts of the world where spiders are rare, then this theory reasons that young children who frequently encounter spiders are less likely to associate them as scary or disturbing sights, and are less likely to develop arachnophobia.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p><a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">User:Mikkalai</a> has requested that all communications to him be addressed on the talk pages of the articles that he edits. Accordingly, I would like to make a point of order regarding his manner of editing on this page.</p>
<p>Mikkalai, I've noticed that, during the course of this little edit war, you have continuously reverted any deletions or modifications of the spider image and have noted each reversion as being a "<a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_edit.html" title="Minor edit">minor edit</a>" (as signified by the <b>m</b> that accompanies each reversion). I simply wanted to ensure that you are aware of the policy regarding the labeling of edits as "minor". Specifically, minor edits are those that are noncontroversial and which involve only superficial changes to the articles, such as, in the words of the policy, "typo corrections, formatting and presentational changes, rearranging of text without modifying content, etc." A minor edit is supposed to be one that "the editor believes requires no review and could never be the subject of a dispute."</p>
<p>However, it is blatantly obvious that all of these "minor" edits have been the source of considerable dispute, to the point where an all-out edit war has ensued here (an edit war that, as others have pointed out, is now listed among the lamest edit wars in Wikipedia history on <a href="../../../l/a/m/WP%7ELAME_0afb.html" title="WP:LAME">WP:LAME</a>). There is simply no way that you are unaware that your "minor" edits are a source of dispute. Therefore, you're labeling your edits as "minor" when you are clearly aware that they are a source of dispute. Knowingly or unknowingly, you are violating the policy on the labeling of edits as "minor."</p>
<p>I ask first of all that you do all that you can to put an end to this edit war. I tried to stop this edit war by changing the controversial spider image to a noncontroversial one. However, you reverted that (and labeled the edit as "minor"). If, however, you choose to continue this war (in violation of the spirit of cooperation that Wikipedia has), please stop labeling all your edits as "minor" unless they truly are minor. Thank you very much. --<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 00:24, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In all honesty, I support your picture as an interim compromise. First of all, I would strongly question the need for a picture of a spider on this page at all. (Is there an image staring over a precarious cliff at "<a href="../../../a/c/r/Acrophobia.html" title="Acrophobia">acrophobia</a>"?). However, in the interests of compromise, and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, I think an anatomical illustration, as the one you have put forth, is an excellent choice - there is no need for the illustration to be overtly threatening, at all. I am not willing to perpetuate this edit war over this, so I will instead urge others to voice their consideration for what needs to be done. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 09:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I liked the 'anatomical illustration' far better, personally. There's just no <b>need</b> for anything more. A simple illustration of what a spider is <i>already</i> is more than enough for this page. It's just that an image of a spider alone does <i>not</i> aide in one's ability to understand arachnaphobia - okay, so they now know what a spider looks like... but that's what following the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider.html" title="Spider">spider</a> link is for. I don't expect to find a huge picture of the anus on the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">Human</a> page just because it's part of our anatomy. That belongs on the <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anus.html" title="Anus">anus</a> page (and that one had a bit of a kerfuffle some time back, iirc, for having an image that helped in understanding the anus, considering how difficult it is to see one's own, where I was on the other side - fighting for the image to stay). As you can see, I don't want to censor wikipedia either - nobody who truly cares about the project would. However, I also don't want unnecessary and <i>purposefully disturbing or frightening</i> content. Leave the scary spider pictures on the spider page, but feel free to put in an image you think <i>adequately illustrates arachnaphobia to someone who doesn't know anything about arachnaphobia itself</i>. No, a scary spider picture doesn't suffice - if someone doesn't understand arachnaphobia, they won't see anything scary about a spider, and it just puzzles them more. &#160;:P I've ranted enough. -<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETaggedJC_afd1.html" title="User:TaggedJC">JC</a> 11:05, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, I prefer the analogy with <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acrophobia.html" title="Acrophobia">acrophobia</a>. Should, say, <a href="http://www.ianai.net/jokes/EmpireAntenna.jpeg" class="external text" title="http://www.ianai.net/jokes/EmpireAntenna.jpeg" rel="nofollow">|this</a> picture be in the article? If I added that picture, would it be censorship to remove it? Of course not, on both counts. I think it's really telling that if you review the prior edits which added a spider picture to this page, before around this August, they were almost uniformly intended as either a joke, or vandalism. It was only after this silly censorship argument got pulled up that people seriously began arguing that it should stay. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 18:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with everything that's been said here. Frankly, I think a major problem here is that, as was pointed out above in the "Lame edit war" section, certain users are essentially claiming ownership over this article. They haven't explicitly said, "I own this article," but they're exercising fierce control over it. However, they don't own this article and it's time that they realize that. I think it's fairly obvious that the "scary" spider picture serves no useful purpose on this page and that it's high time we put an end to this. I'm sure it was fun while it lasted, but back to business. I'll leave the anatomical spider picture in place for now as a placeholder for a picture depicting arachnophobia (e.g. someone freaking out at the sight of a rubber spider). But, for all intents and purposes, consider this a forcible cease-fire in this hysterically lame edit war. --<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 18:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This flurry of activity aimed at deletion of a pic but adding nothing useful to the article is pretty much qualified as trolling, and I see no reason to subdue. Like you said, until you find a picture of a person who actually freaks out at the sight of a spider, there is no valid reason to replace the image. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 20:19, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Until you explain how a picture of a <i>spider</i> contributes to understanding arachnaphobia, there is no valid reason to <i>include</i> the image. I say it has to go, and later be replaced with a picture or illustration that <i>will</i> contribute. That picture up there when talking about acrophobia <i>doesn't</i> illustrate it well. Those people look quite pleased, or at least not experiencing acrophobia. It'd just be "high places, like this one, frighten acrophobic people" but that's a bit pointless. As a plus, you mentioned that it gave you vertigo; the page specifically states that vertigo is <i>not</i> acrophobia, but is commonly mistaken to be a synonym. So it would actually detract from the page, as people would associate that vertigo feeling they'd get from looking at that picture (mostly caused by perspective, actually) with "acrophobia". -<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETaggedJC_afd1.html" title="User:TaggedJC">JC</a> 21:04, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Please choose your words carefully. The definition of "trolling" is to make posts or comments solely for the purpose of inciting a conflict. In other words, by accusing all of us of trolling, you are accusing us of removing the spider image for the sole purpose of provoking you just to see you get angry.

<p>First of all, <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">User:Mikkalai</a>, I have no idea what you mean when you talk about replacing "countless images." All we're talking about is not including a picture on this page that clearly doesn't belong there. More than that, though, I think your latest responses, in combination with your previous behavior on this talk page, are evidence that you do not intend to behave cooperatively. You seem to have assumed "ownership" of this page and are not willing to relinquish this. Even after you have been warned not to engage in edit wars, you continue to do so. You provide no valid reasons for your position. You simply do not want to, in your words, "subdue." I must urge you to stop doing this immediately. You don't own this page. What will go on this page will be what the consensus is, not just what you want. And the consensus is clear from the discussion here and in the archived pages: the spider image has got to go. --<a href="../../../h/n/s/User%7EHnsampat_5fec.html" title="User:Hnsampat">Hnsampat</a> 22:14, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I never said either of those things, and it is not exactly <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> to infer that I did. However, it is not a "bug" - the system is working exactly as intended. However, you are misusing it. Though the preferences which you have set up - which are not the default ones - mark all your edits as "minor", that is no excuse for not removing the "minor" checkbox when you are making a non-minor edit. In using the minor checkbox in the manner you have been using it in contravenes the guidelines for editing, and makes it very difficult for other editors to keep track of the article. A non-trivial revision, over which there is a decided discussion on the talk page is <b>not</b> a minor edit - and you should abide by the guidelines and uncheck the "minor" box accordingly.

<dd>You, as a Wikipedia editor, choose to mark your edits as Minor or not. If you're using a "rollback" feature, that's part of some outside program which I am <b>sure</b> has settings for whether you set them as minor or not. Reverting <i>vandalism</i> is considered minor, as it would be undispited, but anything else <i>should</i> be left as non-minor. If whatever program you're using is functioning improperly, don't tell <b>us</b> to file a bug report, do it yourself - you're the one using the program, of course.<br />
If you're using Wikipedia itself, then, as stated, it shows you when you write up your edit summary whether you're making your edit a minor one or not, and you can easily uncheck it if it is indeed checked by default (which you would set up in your preferences).<br />
I think your attitude has been severely breaching <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civil</a> for some time, but I've been keeping my nose out of it in hopes of avoiding trouble. However, I find my tolerance slipping and I'm at a loss as to what to do about it; fortunately you've stopped acting in a vigilante manner about the article itself, as otherwise I'd look to <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a> for immediate help on this matter - yet I know we've already done a lot to get conflicts out of the way, but it appears to be a one-sided struggle. <b>Please</b> consider ending this. Wikipedia is not a place for personal attacks; I know we all want to make Wikipedia better, but it's extremely important to be polite, courteous, and typing in a well-thought-out manner. This includes marking edits as minor or not <i>appropriately</i>, regardless of any "automatic" function - instead of getting upset at someone else for pointing out the errors and attempting to pass the blame onto another, it would have been better to simply say "Oh, thank you, I didn't notice it was automatically making them minor. I apologize for the mistake and will be careful to set the edit type correctly in the future." -<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETaggedJC_afd1.html" title="User:TaggedJC">JC</a> 09:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't really know what you're saying here - the point is that the acrophobia picture adds nothing to the article.
