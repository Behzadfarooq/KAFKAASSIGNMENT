<h2><span class="mw-headline">"bizarrely in the latter case"?</span></h2>
<p>"bizarrely in the latter case" - is that really NPOV?</p>
<p>Actually, I suspect I was wrong. I vaguely remember seeing some book treat them as separate, but I can't find any corroboration, and it would be a very strange thing to do. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 16:04, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mahmoud Darwish</span></h2>
<p>Is it really acceptable to call Mahmoud Darwish an "Israeli Arab"? I doubt if he would accept the term. The term "Palestinian citizen of Israel" is not a political circumlocution any more than "Native American" - it's simply the term used by most sensitive observers in this field because many of the people in question reject the first term. cf:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, some terms are in common usage but are commonly regarded as offensive to large groups of people (Eskimo and Mormon Church, for example). In those cases use widely known alternatives (Inuit and Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). When in doubt, check a mainstream reference work.</p>
</blockquote>

<dl>
<dd>Did you notice the whole topic of the article? It's an obvious circumlocution in order to make some political point. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:44, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not a political point, the term "Israeli Arab" is rejected by many Palestinian citizens of Israel. If you can find any source where Mahmoud Darwish descibes himself as an Israeli I'll be more than happy to go along with you.<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> 10:00, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And the term is accepted by others. The article outlines this, and regardless Darwish fits the definition. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:54, 17 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps in that case it would be better to address the issue, if you feel that way, by indicating in the article that the term 'Israeli Arab' is controversial and is not used by most organisations representing the people in question.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The issue is addressed, though I'm not sure why the term is all that controversial. "Israeli Arabs" gets almost 90,000 Google hits, including some fairly pro-Palestinian Human Rights organizations like <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a> <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/document.do?id=4DAA92607A275EA9802570180052ABC7" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/document.do?id=4DAA92607A275EA9802570180052ABC7" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, reasonably neutral media sources like <i><a href="../../../m/s/n/MSNBC_69dc.html" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a></i> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7349701" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7349701" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, fairly pro-Palestinian media sources like <i><a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuters.html" title="Reuters">Reuters</a></i> <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L01677753.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L01677753.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <i><a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a></i> <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--movingtoisrael0712jul12,0,6082428.story?coll=ny-region-apnewyork" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--movingtoisrael0712jul12,0,6082428.story?coll=ny-region-apnewyork" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, and actively anti-Israeli media sources like <i><a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Jazeera_27e8.html" title="Al Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a></i> <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/3D4F81BB-D9A4-4085-B7D3-658B6D0D9FE3.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/3D4F81BB-D9A4-4085-B7D3-658B6D0D9FE3.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:56, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pro-Palestinian sources like AP? Hmmm... In any case, Darwish wasn't in fact a citizen of Israel (as I had initially written): see <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4428829,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4428829,00.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for one citation. Neither was he born in Israel, so he certainly wasn't "originally" an Israeli Arab.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">One big POV</span></h2>
<p>It seems that this whole article was placed here for the section about discrimination.</p>
<p>Isn't there anything else to say about israeli Arabs except a brief introduction and dive itno examples of discrimination&#160;?</p>
<p>Maybe it is the whole identity of the Israeli arabs that is defined by their wish to be described as victims&#160;? I don't think so. There is much more aspects of their lives that are not mentioned here. See the African Americans article and you will start to get an idea how a NPOV article should look like.</p>

I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say "the facts it includes may be inconvenient to the promotion of certain points of view" - it seems deliberately vague, yet insinuates something rather negative and conspiratorial at the same time. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 18:39, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it is "overweighting one aspect of a complex situation", may I suggest that the best way of dealing with that would be to introduce adequate coverage of the other aspects?

<dd>Well, Druze are arguable, as are Bedouins.

<dd>I don't see on what basis you argue that the Druze or Bedouin aren't Palestinian Arabs. They are Arabs from Palestine, which seems an adequate reason for using the term. Could you please elaborate? As for the discussion that follows, it is about self-identication, which is a somewhat different issue, and if we can't describe them as Palestinian Arabs on that basis, it would seem equally dubious to call them Israeli Arabs. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 14:09, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You could read this article itself, or the related articles. Bedouin are a distinct ethnic group from other Arabs, as are Druze, and self-identify as such. Israeli-Arab is simply a statement of citizenship, Arabs who are citizens of Israel; Palestinian, on the other hand, is a statement of self-identity. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="Dark Green">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 01:01, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

If you do that you will find that they are not as discriminated as you think. Usually in Israel a 23 year old Arab that gets married (after finishing university) live in his own single family home fully paid ofr (no morgate) An israeli in the same age is just finishing his military service and if in 5 years he will own his own apartment (80% morgatge) he will be lucky <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 14:42, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zeq, the information you took out appeared to be accurate and from a reliable source, and highly salient to the topic. Discrimination is one of the main features of the life of Palestinian citizens of Israel. If you have an equally reliable source for information about discrimination in favour of Palestinian Israelis, or something else that you feel would balance the article, by all means balance the article by adding that in, not by taking things out. An anonymous user above suggested that the Hebrew article would be a good source of additional information. Why don't you look there (I presume you have Hebrew?) and if they were right and there is useful stuff there, make a rough translation of it and post it here? Then we can work on adding it into the article (provided of course that it is accurate, NPOV and verifiable). <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 14:54, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ok, cleaning up after being bold</span></h2>
<p>Ok: I have inserted some comments "hidden" in the the text. And I have some suggestions: The "Current situation"-section is simply too big -I think it should be split in several smaller sections. That way we could also get rid of "double" information, that is the same inf. which appear in several places. One (the first?) of these smaller sections could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Population and population grouth" (merge it with the "Population grouth" -section.) Also: now the inf. is contradictory: in the beginning of the article it says that the Arab is 15%, later ist says that it is 19% ---&gt;Not good!!</li>
<li>"Location/geography" -section: where do they live?</li>
<li>"Education"-section, -now that inf. is a bit here and a bit there -</li>
<li>"Health"- section.</li>
<li>"Legal and Political Status"-section. (The prominent Arab Israeli judges mentioned should come in here, perhaps with a link to other politicians, such as Azmi Bishara.)</li>
<li>a "Triva"-section? I´m tempted to throw miss Israel there&#160;;-) <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 17:59, 16 October 2005 (UTC) PS: more for the "Trivia"-section: wasn´t there an Israeli Arab who won the Israeli version of "Big Brother"? Or was it "Idol"?</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
......lets try to get some sense of order to this article before we add anything more, shall we? And the spelling! Groan! We can start with "Population grouth" (yes: I also cut &amp; paste..) And Zeq: I removed some of the text you inserted under "Discrimination Against Israeli Arabs" because the exact same text was already in the article (further down) (yepp: somebody else had "cut &amp; pasted" before you&#160;:-) ). There was only one sentence (in that paragraph) that wasn´t in the article already, and I appended that at the end of the original "cut and paste") And I rewrote the intro. sentence so I could insert your other paragraph into the list. <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 19:53, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have created the above sections (except "Trivia") and moved the appropriate inf. there. Internally these sections (esp. the "population etc") are very messy at the moment, and must be reorganised and slimmed down. And they must be linked. As for the 3 sections:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Current situation</li>
<li>Pluralism and Sectoral Identity</li>
<li>Development<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>I´m not quite sure that the present division is the best -and some of the info. in "Developement" should probably go into their appropriate new sections ("Education", "Location"). <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 03:13, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I have created a "Work and Economic situation" and moved the relevant inf. into it. I have also moved all inf. from "Current Situation" and "Developement" into the appropriate sections. I have "blocked out" (=made invincible) inf. which I consider irrelevant or is contradictory to other inf. on Wikipedia, or both. I think the division into different sections is now OK? However, the situation inside each section is still a complete mess....I will <b>strongly</b> ask the other editors here <b>not</b> to bring <i>any</i> <i>new</i> material into the article <b>before we have "cleaned up" and "wikified" what is already there!</b> Please show <i>some</i> consideration....

<dd>I have just minorly edited the article, cleaning up some (but not all) misspellings, etc, and I could not help noticing that many of the articles containing facts could be removed, as they are either irrelevant or could be moved to separate pages to reduce the article size (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_size_0593.html" title="Wikipedia:Article size">Wikipedia:Article size</a>). Other sections are related and ould be amalgamated and then removed to separate pages. Just a suggestion, as this article is to big to effectively clean up anyway. Any thoughts?</dd>

<p>Under Population....:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the percentage of Arabs in Israel? In the material you have added it says both 15% and 19%.</li>
<li>The text you added states:
<ul>
<li>"The number of Muslim residents in Israel at the start of 2003 stands at around 1,037,000, about 15% of Israel’s population" and:</li>
<li>"In 2001, 1.2 million Arabic people populated the area" [=Israel]...soooo: what is the correct number??</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The text you added states:
<ul>
<li>"the proportion of Arabs increases 3.4% each year" and:</li>
<li>"The Muslim population’s average natural rate of increase over the past few years is[]: 3.6%" I assume that you in both cases refer to what is commonly known in English as "Population Growth Rate". If so, we should perhaps change all the different expressions into that one. AND: find what is the correct number; 3.4 or 3.6?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the text you added states: "This rate of increase is one of the highest in the world, even higher than in neighboring Arab countries". Well, my "Bible" (read: Lonely Planet, 2000 ed.) tells me that both Syria and Jordan have a "Population Growth Rate" =3.4% .....and, to my knowledge, neither country has improved (lowered) the growth rate since 2000. (To my knowledge: only Egypt ...&amp; Lebanon (of the countries in the region) has managed to do something about it).

<dl>
<dd>I find it a bit, well, scary that the first major item mentioned about the Israeli Arabs is their rate of population growth. Anyway, there is an obvious problem in consistency here talking about the dirtribution of the Arab population and of the Muslim population, and this needs to be either fixed or explained. It seems odd that Nazareth, with its large Christian population, gets a mention primarily as a centre of Muslim population.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As regards Tel-Aviv-Yaffo, is it not a thing that the Palestinian population is concentrated in Jaffa (which is the historic Palestinian town), and should the article perhaps be amended to reflect this?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In relation to population growth, I think the figures quoted for Syria at least are too high, and I'm going to check them out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any case, any discussion of population growth should be careful not to draw a facile equivalence between a population with very specific socio-economic characteristics and the general population of that or any other country.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, the section on "Pluralism and Sectoral Identity" seems extremely POV. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 15:03, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I definitely agree with you on comparing/not comparing statistics with other countries. Reference to all other countries should just be cut out. After all, this is not done anywhere else on WP. (Can you imagine, eg. giving the statistical data for Canada, and then, for each number given, you would also write how much better/worse it was compared with the USA??). The only other data that are relevant are those data pertaining to the Jewish population of Israel. After all, if both groups are "equal citizens", then those numbers should be compared.</dd>
<dd>And as I have said elsewhere: the different sections are a complete mess internally (except the "Location", which has become reasonable decent) And some POV-stuff need to be weeded out. But do we agree about the division into sections? <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 15:37, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In relation to comparisons, I think it's also an important point that Palestinian Israelis are an economically disadvantaged sector, and such sectors very often have higher fertility rates than the population at large. It would be more reasonable to compare them with sociologiocally similar (as far as possible) elements in the Jewish population. There's a hint of underlying hysteria about outbreeding in the way this issue often gets dealt with (well OK, often it's much more than a hint).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for sections, I agree with what's there at the minute, but I also think we need a section on history and also perhaps one on internally displaced persons and unrecognised villages. Then more information specifically on the Bedouin. Also perhaps a section on politics - I've added to what's there, but there's a lot more readily accessible info on this. I might be able to do something on this. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 15:49, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

As for the "Population" section: I think we should start with the situation in 1948 (and certainly not start with the Birth Rate.)</dd>
<dd>Work for <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a>: Now the article states "The researchers predict that by 2020, the Arab population in Israel will have increased to 2 million people and will comprise somewhere between 21% to 24% of Israel's population. According to forecasts, the Muslim population will rise to over 2,000,000 people, or 24-26% of the population within the next 15 years." (And you have copied both sentences into the article) Now, either the number of Muslims is much higher than the number of Arabs (??????) -or one of these sentences should be cut out.</dd>
<dd>Also for <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a>: In the article: "On average, the proportion of Arabs increases 3.4% each year. The Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics reported that Israeli Muslims have a average natural rate of increase over the past few years that is double that of the Jewish population: 3.6% compared to 1.8%." -see Palmiros question (hidden in the text); I suspect that one of these sentences should be cut out, Regards, <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 00:26, 19 October 2005 (UTC) PS: ahem: doen´t you guys like my "hidden" questions /comments...?</dd>

<p>I wonder if you read any of our messages for you? I have asked you <b>PLEASE</b> to help "clean-up" all that information -much of it contradictory- you copied into this article. This you have not done. Istead you leave this job to your co-editors (mainly Palmiro and me). If you were not on WP; well, then it could have been understandable. But you <i>are</i> here, editing. And not only editing: you are inserting edits in a very contested manner, indeed, I will not hesitate to call it pure POV-pushing. And this, while the article is mostly a <i>complete</i> mess with all the information you copied into it. I do not know how many hours I have spend on this article, trying to get it readable by:</p>
<ul>
<li>deviding it into categories,</li>
<li>finding and moving info. into their correct category,</li>
<li>removing information when exactly the same was/is beeing said three or four times,</li>
<li>pointing out to you in which cases you had given contradictary information,</li>
<li>adding links and correcting spelling</li>
</ul>
<p>And what do you do?? I had at least expected you to find out what is correct when you have given contradictary inf. given: eg.: is the Arab/(Muslim?) population estimated to become between 21% to 24% of Israel's population in 2020, OR is it estimated to become 24-26%?? Now, both are "true", courtesy of you. Is the birth rate 3.4%, or 3.6%? Again, now, both are also "true", courtesy of you. The only section which is reasonabe readable now is the "Location"-section, and that is totally thanks to Palmiro and me. (You can thank Palmiro for managing to interpret your wrongly spelled names of cities (e.g.: Ramalah -&gt;Ramleh). Organizing, editing and wikifying text is rarely a very exciting thing to do. I can quite understand that it is much more interesting to insert inf. which suits ones view. I would like to spend my time here doing the same, but quite simply: I´m not selfish enough. And I would like to see WP become fine encyclopedia. Now: this is what I´m going to do: I will revert the "intro section" to the <i>Revision as of 15:53, 16 October 2005</i>. This was the edit before all these edit-wars over this section started. I believe it is reasonbly neutral version (i.e. nobody is <i>perfectly</i> happy with it.....). <b>And:</b> if you edit the least bit of this intro: well, then I´m out of this article. <i>You</i> can clean up your mess, <i>all</i> by yourself (If you don´t get Palmiro ..or others to help you.) But you can rest assured: if you as much as move/remove <i>a single letter</i> of the " Discrimination Against Israeli Arabs"-section, <i>or</i> the "Modifications to Citizenship and Entry law" <i>or</i> "See also" and "External links": then expect it to be reverted. I will not sit by and idly watch you destroy perfectly wellwritten/wellsourced information. And if nothing more is done on this article: well; it will be as if you had not brought the info here at all: it is so confused and contradictory that people will ignore it. (And then go <i>directly</i> to the part that is <i>crystal clear</i>: the "Discrimination"-part. If that is the way you want it; well, so be it.

Please see my answer your talk page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problems, another suggestion for Zeq</span></h2>
<p>ZEQ: we have a couple of problems here.</p>
<ul>
<li>You deleted some of my additions to the introduction which were grounded on facts which are not only widely known but are cited <b>in this article</b>. When I pointed this out to you and reinserted them, you deleted them again without justifying this. Please don't do this sort of thing.</li>
<li><b>Your data is inconsistent</b>. That is why we have been deleting or commenting out bits of it.</li>
<li><b>Your presentation of the data is confusing</b>. You mix up references to Arabs and to Muslims, which obviously aren't the same thing.</li>
<li><b>You don't seem to have provided any source</b> for some of your data. That means that <b>we can't check back on it and sort out the problems</b> of consistency etc. ourselves. If you have an English (or Arabic, or French) source available for your data on the internet or in a readily available publication, please let us know. That way we could far more easily collaborate on presenting it in a logical, coherent and comprehensible way.</li>
<li>Even if your sources are in a language nobody here understands, such as (I imagine) Roma, you should still cite them. Also, while you've said that soome date comes from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, you should really provide a link to the webpage(s) it's from or a page citation from a publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apologies for the bolding, I am trying to point out where our problems lie and how we can try and fix them. One other suggestion: clearly English isn't your native language and you may find the additional effort of trying to write accurate English while at the same time dealing with fairly complicated issues frustrating. If your sources are in Hebrew or some other language none of the editors here understands, you might be able to find someone elsewhere on wikipedia to help you with it.

<p>Yes, Palmiro also brought to my attention that I made a mistake, saying the 'most Bedouins are not Muslim', but I still think it's wrong to say Bedouin = Muslim. In my real-life interaction with Bedouins, I have not yet enountered one who claimed to be Muslim. The traditionalist Bedouins follow their own culture, which involves a religion, that isn't Muslim and can in fact be counter-Muslim. But since I'm in the minority, feel free to add that part back. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> 15:49, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zeq has asked me to provide a single example of a non-Muslim Bedouin, and for instance <a href="http://kcm.co.kr/bethany_eng/p_code/956.html" class="external text" title="http://kcm.co.kr/bethany_eng/p_code/956.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> mentions that there are 24 'known' Christian ones in Israel. Because the page says that nearly all are Muslim (which is a real revelation), maybe the part should be added back, but it should still not say that Bedouin = Muslim, as this is an incorrect assertion. Also, I appeal to Zeq to be less rude... if you are reading this. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> 16:49, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're the one who asked for <b>one</b> non-Muslim, not 1000. Your exact words were: <i>Rev. Bedouins IN ISRAEL IN OUR TIMES are ALL muslims. If you found One refernce to One bedouin who is not muslim we will change it. There is no such person</i>. That page says there are 24 Christians and for all we know, there could be 10,000 seculars. I found it via Google by the way. Can you cite a source that says otherwise? The source that Ramallite provided states that Bedouins are Muslims, and I accept that as proof of the vast majority being Muslim, but it doesn't mean they all are. That's like saying all Persians are Muslim because Iran is an Islamic Republic. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> 18:03, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a tricky matter, evidently. The 1997 article about the Christian bedouin is actually about a guy from Madaba, a mixed Muslim-Christian town in Jordan. This guy is apparently being a little over-dramatic, since I doubt most people in Madaba refer to themselves as "bedouin" although they almost all <i>are</i> of bedouin ancestry (which is what the priest is evidently referring to). Many nomadic tribes (few of them Christian, most of them not) historically travelled in the Middle East region before settling in areas where they are today. As such, there is no reason to believe that nomadic tribes or bedouins that exist today are exclusively Muslim; however, unless there is an actual census done on the Bedouin tribes of the Negev, it is impossible to be sure. I'm not aware of such a census, but am not aware of proof that they are exclusively Muslim either.

<p>This contained the highly dubious assertion that " Israel remains one of the few countries in the Middle East where women enjoy equality in rights and personal freedoms, including the right to vote and be elected to local and national office." To the best of my knowledge, all Israel's Arab neighbours as well as Iran and Turkey grant women the right to vote and be elected to political offices. Iraq had a female minister as early as 1958 or 59 (Naziha al-Dulaimi), Syria has had several, including Boutheine Shaaban at the moment; Egypt has had at least one (Mervat Tallawi). So I think that statement was of little value, if not downright misleading, and so have removed it.</p>
<p>I have also added in some info from a previously-reverted version of the introduction section.</p>

<p>The article mentions the Circassian communities a couple of times. These people are not ethnically Arab in the generally recognised sense (they're Circassian!), although they could be considered Palestinian (whether they think of themselves as such is another question, I suspect not), but they are Muslim. Are they considered to be Arab in the Israeli government's view of things, among Israeli or Israeli Arab society in general, by themselves?

<dd>From Ramallite's earlier link, I think we can derive that they're not considered Arab by the Israeli MFA. I don't think they consider themselves Palestinian because, like the Druze, they requested to be part of the IDF. The full paragraph from the MFA is:</dd>
<dd><i>The Circassians, comprising some 3,000 people concentrated in two northern villages, are Sunni Muslims, although they share neither the Arab origin nor the cultural background of the larger Islamic community. While maintaining a distinct ethnic identity, they participate in Israel's economic and national affairs without assimilating either into Jewish society or into the Muslim community.</i></dd>

<dd>At the risk of starting a row, I think we absolutely cannot rely on the Israei MFA as a reliable source on issues such as the status of Israeli Arabs, discrimination against them, etc, or as a source of NPOV phrasing regarding their place in Israeli life. The MFA's job is to represent Israel abroad, and that includes making it look good. By contrast, Palestinian-Israeli orgnisations, international reports and many serious books all report that Palestinian citizens of Israel have many causes for complaint against the Israeli government. I think we would be naive to assume that we can take the word of the Israeli foreign ministry as a full and balanced portrayal of these issues.</dd>

<dd>I agree of course that sources other than the MFA have to be included for a balanced article. I was simply making the point that, while the MFA might omit Arab-Israeli complaints etc., I don't think it will outright lie about any of these things. Then, the parts that were omitted from the MFA can be put in from other sources. Palestinian and Arab-Israeli organizations have a fair place in this article, especially in terms of complaints. However, it's not even a certain fact that most Arab-Israelis identify themselves as Palestinians. The Bedouins and Druze sure don't, but with the others, it heavily varies from place to place. I was taught basic Arabic by a woman from Taibe who doesn't even want to hear the word 'Palestinian', and for example, the Arab beauty contest winner (I think she is mentioned in this article) claims to be a 'proud Israeli'. On the other hand, many resident of villages close to the Palestinian territories, like Baka al-Gharbiyya, say they are Palestinian and not Israeli. I'll try to find a link, but I've read somewhere on the internet that when polled with a question 'Would you go to live in a Palestinian state if one was created?', only about 30% of polled Israeli Arabs answered 'yes'. Granted, this may be out of economic and other considerations, rather than simple identification, but it still indicated that many Israeli Arabs do not want to have much to do with 'Falastin'. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> 16:36, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yikes! this is a difficult issue, and not the one I meant to start discussing, but here goes anyway: many Israeli Arabs dislike the term "Israeli Arabs", which they see as a term used by the Israeli state and, for many, denying their Palestinian identity. Most (but not all) of the Druze don't seem to consider themselves to have a Palestinian identity, and in fact don't necessarily identify themselves as arabs either. Whether Arab citizens of Israel regard themselves as Palestinians or not is unlikely to be the main element in their decision-making as to which putative future state they would like to live in (and particularly unlikely to motivate them to want to leave their homes, as implied in the poll question above if that was indeed how it was phrased).</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Origins and history section added, wikipedia messup footnote snarlup</span></h2>
<p>I have added a new section on "origins and history', which covers much badly-needed ground and is indispensable for an understanding of the subject. However, my footnotes got lost due to one of those increasingly common wikifreezes. Hopefully they are still on a back-up file in the internet cafe i was doing it in. I will head there tomorrow and try to sort it out. In the meantime, I request forbearance. When I recover or (hopefully not) recreate them, I'll also make some remarks here about these edits and their sources. Apologies for the unideal nature of this. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 23:39, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sources are now added at the bottom of the article. All the orphaned footnotes refer to these sources. The Feron book is by a journalist, written in a journalistic style, <u>but referenced to academic sources</u>, and the tone is clearly sympathetic to the Palestinians/Israeli Arabs. About half the book deals with Israeli Arabs. Kodmani-Darwish is an academic, and the book of an academic standard, but it only contains one short chapter on the Palestinians of Israel. Neither of these are ideal sources to base an article on this topic on, but I don't have anything else available to me at the moment and they include plenty of factual material which coincides with what I've read elsewhere. On the plus side, it is an improvement on the level of citation seen in the article to date. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 00:13, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's good of you to have added an origins section, but it's very highly POV. I'll try to edit it to the best of my ability tomorrow, although since I don't have any books on Israeli Arabs, it will be more difficult to provide sources. But for instance, I'm pretty sure the 'expropriation of land' is talking about passing over privately owned land to the state, which applied not only to Israeli Arabs but also to Jews, after a law was declared that all land in Isarel is state-owned. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> 00:30, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the fact is that land which had been used by Israeli Arabs ended up being used by Jews. I'm not 100% sure of all the legal details, but in relation to this issue they are readily available on the internet I suspect. Here is another version, from Adalah, an Israeli-Arab civil rights organisation:
<dl>
<dd>Prior to 1948, the Jewish community owned just 6-7% of the land. During the next four decades, 80% of lands owned by Palestinians living in Israel were confiscated and placed at the exclusive disposal of Jewish citizens. Today, 93% of all land in Israel is under direct state control.<a href="http://www.adalah.org/eng/backgroundhistory.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adalah.org/eng/backgroundhistory.php" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Note that this is an organisation which is primarily concerned with taking cases in the Israeli courts system in favour of the rights of Israeli Arabs, and frequently wins them, which suggests that it is both credible and has an interest in maintaining its credibility.</dd>
<dd>I would really hope that we can establish the citation of sources (and if necessary, description of them as I have done here) as standard practice on this article. Given that this section is pretty fully referenced, I don't think it would be good to make dramatic changes for POV (unless it is a question of POV phrasing, which is another matter) without citing sources. I don;t plan to make edits to other sections without citing sources either (although I may of course turn out to be a hypocrite). <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 00:39, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding "Prior to 1948, the Jewish community owned just 6-7% of the land." -- this doesn't mean that the rest was owned by Palestinian Arabs. I don't have the numbers handy right now (they're easy to find, but not from Adalah &amp; Co.), but most of the land was govt-owned, i.e. by the Ottomans and then by the Mandate. After Israel's disengagement from Gaza, Abbas mentioned that the Jewish settlements there took as much as 3% of private Palestinian land. So much for "land grab".</dd>
<dd>I agree that the newly added material needs NPOVifying. Also I don't understand the reason behind the removal of Dr. Wahid Abd Al-Magid's sourced quote. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> 01:04, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the state-owned land was a significant percentage, but I suspect you will find it was largely in Palestinian use, and isn't any more. How much state-owned land in Israel now is in Palestinian use?</dd>
<dd>The sourced quote was speculation by an Egyptian which seemed to be added to provide an insinuation that the population growth of Palestinian israelis was a direct threat to the state and perhaps part of a dire plot against it.

<p>In fact, Jews owned 8% of the land, Arabs (both local and non-resident) owned about 21% of the land, and over 70% was state owned. After the war, the Arabs who were left owned 3% of the land. State-owned land was not transferred to private ownership. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 01:21, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The 70% figure is misleading as it includes land held in common by villages rather than individuals and land occupied by individuals under an Ottoman perpetual lease system. Also grazing land used by bedouin. And while you are correct that state-owned land was not transferred to private ownership, it was preferentially made available to Jews. A very large amount was sold to the JNF for the sole use of Jews. Btw, you need a better source. The "Survey of Palestine" report it claims as a source does not contain these numbers. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 10:00, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for the article: I agree that information about the "absentees" should go into the Nakba-article (where these "absentees" reside outside Israel). However, information about the socalled "present absentees" most certainly belong in <b>this</b> article. People who had their land taken from them under the "present absentees" laws were, to my knowledge, always Israeli Arabs (both Muslim and Christian). The "Nakba"-article is only about the 1948 refugees, and the consequences for those refugees. If you regards <b>facts</b> as "anti_Israel propeganda": well, then....

<dd>The history is needed but it should not just be a propeganda article. Subjects such as Nakba are described elsewhere and we will not duplicate. I suggest you work through this in the Wikipedia way... i.e. discuss what you want to add. If you will continue to do revert wars we will not get very far even if you will try to out number me. I am sure other editors will notice in what you are trying to do in taking over this article and will revert you as well. At some point this revert war will end (most likely when Ba'atists in Syria will be running from the new regime) until then I have enough time on my hands to revert the propeganda. Notice that I did not touched a well researched paragraph on discrimination. I am (even if it does not look to you) a person of reason. As long as you keep to a NPOV, as should the wkipedai guidelines your edits will be accepted.

<dd>This is not an answer as not one argued anything about the Plamach. This is an article about Israeli Arabs. Any one who think that Wikipedia is a place for articles with such words as <b>"The Israeli Arab community continues to grow in confidence." or "This was the direct result of the expropriation of Palestinian-owned land"</b> is simply wrong. Every documented fact is welcome. But I will continue to delete "Cherrypicking" of propeganda information. Trying to argue that the only result of the 1948 war is the Palestinian exodus is ridiculos. This article is <b>not</b> the place to deal with such subject . There are other articles that deal with the Palestinian exodus. As a result I will again delete the irelevant sections. This article can not turn to yet another anti-Israel propeganda article. Wikipedia is <b>not</b> the place for POV.

<p>I'm not sure that "martial law" is a legally correct term for the regime to which Israel Arabs were subjected until 1966.

<p>"The Druze, who follow the Druze religion", is tautological: the community is religiously defined, although may be seen as some as being something in the line of an ethnic community as well (I'll come up with a quote soon). Is it perhaps worth mentioning here that the Druze don't necessarily identify with the Israeli-Arab community?</p>
<p>Not all Mizrahi Jews were persecuted, and not all of them fled. This should be reflected. Equally, the phrasing seemed to refer only to those members of the Mizrahi communities born in Arab countries and not to those born in Israel and elsewhere to families previously resident in those countries. Unless this is in fact desired, it should be rephrased.<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 16:17, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, it's probably best to mention that many Druze do not consider themselves Arabs, but with the way the intro is organized now, I think it would be cramped if we added that. Maybe we need a section for different sub-groups of Israeli Arabs (i.e. Druze, Bedouins, etc.), where it would outline the distinct qualities of each. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || [[User talk:Ynhockey|Talk]] 16:46, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the Druze and the Bedouin could certainly do with more detailed coverage, how exactly to organise that I'm not sure. A more detailed and referenced discussion of political and ethnic identity among Israeli Arabs is also something we could do with. Currently we have a bland statement that some think of themselves as Israelis, some as Palestinians, and some as both.

<p>Jayjg, is it really the case that all the Mixrahi Jews fled or were expelled following persecution? I'm pretty certain that isn't the case for the Syrian ones, for example. I suspect there are also some from Lebanese origin to whom it certainly wouldn't apply. Many may well also be immigrants from third countries. "Using parallel language as for Palestinian refugees" is a very poor basis on which to phrase it, as the two phenomena were far from being mirror images. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 19:59, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>(edit conflict) I've re-worded the disputed section <i>previously resident in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_countries.html" title="Arab countries">Arab countries</a> who immigrated to <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> mostly after 1948 being <a href="../../../m/i/z/Mizrahi_Jews_9e90.html#Post_1948_Dispersal" title="Mizrahi Jews">persecuted</a> in their countries of origin</i> to <i>who <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_lands_7cd1.html" title="Jewish exodus from Arab lands">fled or were expelled from Arab countries</a>, mostly after 1948, or who are the descendants of those <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugee.html" title="Refugee">refugees</a>.</i> - this language is more concise and now parallels that of the description of Palestinians who left Israel. Also, I've commented out the statement <i>, which would brings the percentage of Arabs in Israel to 21.5%</i> We shouldn't speculate based on these estimates of illegal immigrants, since it is unclear how accurate this number is, how many other illegal immigrants Israel has, and this doesn't include several hundred thousand non-Arab guest workers. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:02, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've changed this to "emigrated or were expelled", which closely follows the wording in the article linked to - <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_lands_7cd1.html" title="Jewish exodus from Arab lands">Jewish exodus from Arab lands</a>. That article would seem a more logical place to seek wording than a treatment of Nakba: to suggest that the same sort of wording should be used for two different events without any rationale is a bit peculiar. However, it's clearly true that many of these Jews did "flee". Perhaps there is some better way of phrasing it, without sacrificing accuracy. I agree with the commenting out of the speculative sentences about illegal immigrants. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 14:45, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've restored the "flee" wording; perhaps you missed the section in the linked article titled "Jews flee Arab lands". The events had many similarities, though the exodus of the Arabs was compressed in time and much of it happened during a war. The vast majority of these Jews certainly felt they were fleeing intolerable oppression, persecution, or at least danger in their countries of birth. Highlighting one narrative and downplaying the other is hardly NPOV. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 15:43, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>this is rather poor reasoning, for two reasons: first of all, the article isn't about the Jewish exodus from Arab states, which is only mentioned in passing because the Mizrahi Jews are mentioned in order to clarify that they are not considered Israeli Arab, so it is not a question of giving equal weight to "two narratives"; secondly, the question is not one of balance but one of accuracy. If your edit is correct, why is it not reflected in the text of the article referred to? I used the phrasing from the intro there; it looks like you have edited on that article without changing it. The sections on Morocco, Tunisia, Yemen, for example, would hardly lead a neutral reader to think "that sounds like they all fled".<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 16:05, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, this article doesn't spend much time at all discussing the Jews who fled Arab lands, so the focus and weight given is correct. However, the narratives of each community must be presented fairly and accurately, even if one is only dealt with in a sentence. Regarding the article you mention, I again point out that it uses the title "Jews flee Arab lands", so your point about it saying "emigrate" makes little sense.

<dd>The introduction to the article reads "The Jewish exodus from Arab lands is the 20th century emigration, and sometimes expulsion, of Jews..." I think it's generally better practice to quote from the text of an article than from section titles or subheadings.

<dd>I have no particular detailed knowledge of the subject, so took wording from that article. I hardly think that was an unreasonable course of action.

Your justification for your wording was that it paralleled the wording used in this article to describe a completely different phenomenon. That is a bizarre rationale. I can't see that a basic description of the events under discussion, which is good enough for the article about them, shouldn't be used here.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Origin and history changes</span></h2>
<p>Jayjg, why did you revert the changes? I agree they might've been not quite as well worded as the original, but they certainly make the text more relevant. I mean, the entire paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>From 1947 to 1949 armed conflict took place between Jewish forces, Palestinian and other Arab irregulars and, at a later stage, the armies of neighbouring Arab states (see main article 1948 Arab-Israeli War). This resulted in the flight or expulsion of as many as 700,000 Palestinians from what became the State of Israel (see main article: Palestinian Exodus).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>actually has nothing to do with Israeli Arabs in its current state. It basically states that 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled - how is this relevant to an article on <b>Israeli</b> Arabs? In other words, those who stayed? I think I made it more relevant by making the paragraph flow into the next (relevant) one; I'll highlight the 'connection words' - as a result of the war, territory fell under Israeli control, <b>from which</b> as many as 700,000 Arabs fled or were expelled. <b>However</b>, 150,000 stayed, were granted citizenship and became known as Israeli Arabs.<br />
Something like that anyway. Why do you feel it's worse than this version? -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || [[User talk:Ynhockey|Talk]] 01:00, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Ethnic_cleansing" id="Ethnic_cleansing"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ethnic cleansing</span></h2>
<p>80% of the population was ethnically cleansed, and that's not relevant to the remaining 20%? Of course it is. How long to you think you can talk about the Jewish communities of Europe without mentioning the Holocaust?</p>
<p>Also, the passive-voice attribution of agency to "armed conflict" or "the war" softpedals the Israeli conquest and ethnic cleansing of Palestine. Palestinians didn't leave because of "armed conflict." They left because Jews were executing noncombatants, expelling villagers, and blowing up the villages after them.</p>
<p>Try this: Israeli "clearing operations," including mass killings, direct expulsions and pyschological warfare (threats of rape, etc.) resulted in the flight or expulsion of as many as 700,000 Palestinians from what became the State of Israel.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About the rubbish in this article</span></h2>
<p>I suggest everyone take a good look at the edit summary here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=28491090&amp;oldid=28489053" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=28491090&amp;oldid=28489053" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=28491090&amp;oldid=28489053</a></p>
<p>The same argument apply to the revent section in this article.</p>
<p>It can be both ways</p>
<p>If this article will turn into the "Nakba and discrimination" article we will also have to inculde symetriacl info in other articles. If we go into "roots and origin" as a top section we will inculde not only events in 1948 but also in 1938 (association with the Nazis) etc...</p>
<p>To Sum up: There ARE already articles about various subjects in wkipedia. If you will push your POV into each and every article on the conflict the whole set of articles will become un readable. So I apeal again to people like Jayjg who care about wikipedia: Either you interduce order into this blatent POV pushing (which is not supported btw, none of it) or you will have chaos not just on this article. The same editing methjods will be used all over the Israel Palestinian conflict.</p>

<li>Quit your bullying, you have no right to say things like "will be deleted". You have worked on very few articles on WP, and every single one in which you contributed more than 1-2 edits has been involved in edit warring, so try to be more civil. You do not own Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Accusing other editors of "adding BS", is a personal attack, and doing so repeatedly makes you disruptive and uncivil, and you may end up getting blocked by a neutral admin.</li>
<li>As for your most recent POV tag about the sentence starting with "Israel is not a melting pot"... that sentence is lifted straight from the Israeli government <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/facts%20about%20israel/people/society-%20minority%20communities" class="external text" title="http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/facts%20about%20israel/people/society-%20minority%20communities" rel="nofollow">website</a> at the bottom of the page.

<li>So try to be less disruptive, and instead of being aggressive just point out <i>nicely</i> the sentences that you think are POV and everybody can work on them together.</li>

<dd>Zeq, actually I am a current member of the arbitration committee, and the way to deal with the POV issues of this article is to insist on proper citation from reliable sources, and on attribution, or bringing counterviews, rather than simply deleting the material.

<dd>The sections Zeq objects to contain a level of citation which is quite unusual on Wikipedia, and similar to the levels found in academic works. They are also to reasonable books rather than to advocacy sites that lift their material off the Israeli Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

<dd>In this case I definitely agree with both Ramallite and Jayjg.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Marxist analysis passed off as fact?</span></h2>
<p>It appears that much of the information being inserted (e.g. about Economic development) is a Marxist analysis being passed off as fact. I'm also concerned that the two sources being used are written in French, making fact checking difficult. I strongly suggest that more mainstream encyclopedic sources be used for this material, as this appears to be a non-verifiable extreme minority opinion. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:00, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think either of these are extreme minority opinions. My impression from reading the two books is that they are quite mainstream. Unlike many Wikipedia editors, I have not only cited my sources but described them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is meant to be an open project, and as such should be open to good faith contributions even from people living in countries where English-language academic books are practically unavailable. I can hardly be the only contributor with access to books in French, either.</dd>

<dd>Hi, Jayjg asked me to comment here on the use of French-language sources. There's no policy against using them if nothing else is available, but English-language sources should be prioritized. When a non-English source must be used (because, for example, the same information isn't available from an English source), a translation of the relevant section should be supplied, together with the original language. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Sources_in_languages_other_than_English" title="WP:V">WP:V#Sources_in_languages_other_than_English</a>, which is policy. In this case, that would mean quoting the sources in English, and supplying the French alongside it so that readers could decide whether the translation was accurate.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm wondering if the first source is worth the trouble, as she's a journalist, and therefore not someone who can be quoted to support an economic analysis. Also, the Marxist language is a bit off-putting. Does that come from the sources or from the editor who inserted it? "It has been suggested ...": did one of the sources suggest this, and if so, which one, and what did s/he say exactly? I'd also say it makes more sense in a passage like this to say: "According to journalist X or historian Y, rather than to use footnotes, which the reader has to hunt for, and even then isn't told who the sources are, or exactly which part of the paragraph is being attributed to them. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:31, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The writer is a journalist specialising in the Middle East, and the text quoted is from a book about the Palestinians in Israel and the diaspora. The specific element Jayjg objects to is itself referenced to a work by Raja Khalidi, <i>Les Palestiens de l'Interieur</i>, and is not the original idea of Feron. I have added to it information from the Kodjani source (which is where the reference to a Palestinian bourgeoisie came from).</dd>

The level of citation is also more than a lot of articles have. (By the way, I have never seen an academic book that references every single sentence. It's quite normal to reference a single argument from one source with one citation). This being the case, I find the hectoring and unpleasant response I've got particularly depressing.</dd>

<dd>As far as the verifiability argument goes, having read the link you pointed me to SV, I'm not sure about your interpretation. What I've done is used a book as a source and cited it. I haven't given a quote, which is what what you mention seems to apply to (i.e. provision of both languages). Providing the original material verbatim where a source in English is used doesn't seem to be common practice in WP when English books are referred to, and my reading of the policy doesn't lead me to think that it is required here - forgive me if I'm getting muddled. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 23:59, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That part of the policy seems to have recently been changed slightly, Palmiro, which has made it less clear. The point of it is that information must be verifiable by English-language speakers. My problem with your edit is: (1) it's not clear what each of the sources is saying, (2) it's not clear what the WP editor is stating as fact, (3) the sources aren't in English, and (4) it's not clear, of at least one of them, that they're appropriate sources. We can't use reporters to provide an economic analysis, unless perhaps the writer specializes in economics, but even then it would be very borderline. If this is a mainstream view, there must be academic, English-language sources who say the same thing.</dd>

I find it rather unpleasant the way I am being put through the wars here after a good faith attempt at editing and improving this page, and especially when lots of articles in this area are edited with nowhere near this degree of care, including in fact this one which includes a lot of very duboius material whose source has not been explained by the editor with any clarity and yet I and others attempted to deal with that editor in a polite and reasonable way as the talk page above shows at length. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 00:55, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Druze, Christians and Muslims</span></h2>
<p>The referene to the Druze as an ethnicity seems a bit dodgy - religious group or religious community seems better, or simply say "The Druze community..."</p>
<p>Not sure if those two people are worth mentioning, unless we can have articles on them. The <a href="../../../d/r/u/Druze.html" title="Druze">Druze</a> article, in fact, quotes a serious-looking source which claims that the Druze in Israel do indeed frequently consider themselves Arab. As for the comparison between Druze prospects in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, this is bound to be tricky and I'm not sure if it's really necessary in this article.</p>
<p>I think the division between the Christians and Muslims is not necessary; it is not of the same order as that between both and the Druze and Bedouin. Even if the Christians and Muslims have different demographic characteristics and, to some extent, political differences (stronger communist support among the Christians I seem to recall, definitely presence of the Islamic movement confined to Muslims) they are really not separate communities (especially not in self-identity) the way the others are. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 01:47, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Druze are, in fact, Arabs; no one disputes that. They often to not identify themselves as [i]Palestinian[/i] Arabs, or as part of the Palestinian national movement. In fact, they are the closest thing to "Zionist Arabs" you are likely to find. Nevertheless, they are Arabs, as evidenced by the choice of a Druze village for the recent Jewish terror attack that killed four.Rsfarrell</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Sections: "bottom-up"-writing, not "top-down"</span></h2>
<p>In many ways this article suffers from some of the almost chronic "illnesses" I see in articles on WP: a lot of editors add their little (and not so little) pieces of information; and then the overall effect is a mess. In fact: articles here are written in exactly the opposite way we (eh, read: at least I&#160;;-)) normally write articles: normally we would start off with a disposition, ordering/listing sections or chapters. Then we would "fill in" the different sections/chapters. In other words: roughly a "top-down" writing (I´m borrowing the language from computer science here). I wish we could spent som time arranging -and agreeing!-about the different sections we should have in this article, before we got down to the nitty-gritty details about which sentence was adequately sourced or not. My 5-cents worth: why not take "Economic development of the Israeli Arab community" (which I now see that Palmiro has deleted) and merge it at the end of "Work and Economic situation". Likewise: why not merge "Political development and growing confidence" with "Legal and Political Status"? (possibly splitting that again in two: one section on politics and one section on law/legal matter.) But I would definitely not like to see the "Initial measures taken by the Israeli government" moved to the end of the article, (as was done earlier): that seems very illogical.</p>
<p>Also: now all of Palmiros additions are marked as "neutrality of this section is disputed." In all fairness: I think that some of the "old" (=Zeq´s additions) are just as disputed. But now they are not marked. (As if "Pluralism and Sectoral Identity" suddenly became NPOV by Palmiros additions to other parts of the article?) Should we not remove all the "local" "disputed" tags, and place one "disputed" at the start of the article?

<li>The additions of Palmiro, which are just BS maraxists propeganda was a vandalising of this article.</li>
<li>You are welcome, to dispute, to edit and we will compromise on veryfiable facts even if you or I don't "like" these facts.</li>
<li>such a clear violation of Wkipedia standrats as was in the "Palmiro additions" will not be accepted and it WILL be deleted.</li>
<li>I suggest you take a good look at my compromise suggestion (which meged into the top of the article some of the issues you and palmiro added) as a direction for the future of this article. I will not give up, even if you "gang up" on me in a revert war, so i suggest you start looking for a compromise that would make this article fit wikipedia standrds.</li>

<dd>Oh yes, Zeq: I have reverted you; not to Palmiros (or mine) old version: but to Ynhockey last version. In your revert you deleted a lot of valuable (and needed) inf. about the Druze. I´m trying to assume good faith here, but I truly cannot understand how you can make such an edit as you just did if you had read what you deleted???</dd>
<dd>Also: about "Marxist propaganda" can you PLEASE read what is written about this earlier tonight on this talk-page?? (just in case you had missed it....). Words like "proletariat" and "bourgoisie" is about as controversial to a French writer as the words "working-class" and "middle-class" would be to an American (or Israeli?). Having said that, those words should probably be changed, exactly because so many have very specific associations with them, associations which were probably not intended by the writer/author.</dd>
<dd>And if I were you I really would not speak too loud about adding "verifiable" material, as <i>nothing</i> you added was sourced (and was therefore unverifiable) Regards, <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 06:37, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have merged the info that was ommited. sorry about that. Everything I write is veryafiable and is not written in a marxist style propeganda. I again suggest that you try to compromise instead of getting to revert war. So far the only side that insist on getting it 100% POV Pushing their way is your side.

<dd>Well, in fairness, nobody has raised any doubts about the sources of Zeq's information; its source seems to be estanlished beyond doubt even if its copyright status is not entirely clear.</dd>
<dd>As regards merging sections, I think it is worthwhile having a clear indication of the history of the community, which is what I was trying to give. I'm not sure about having a historical section in each heading. But maybe that could work. As far as politics goes, there is a lot more information readily available I suspect about voting patterns etc, on the internet, but unlikely that I can access it, maybe someone else could have a look. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 12:11, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Zeq: I totally disagree with you. Ofcourse the new addition is relevant. And as I have said in my edit summaries when I have reverted you: I believe you are alone in having that opinion. Having said that, Palmiro, I do wish you had waited a bit until we got Zeqs addition into a better shape, before adding more&#160;;-) Now; it´s all a bit overwhelming.</dd>
<dd>As for Zeq´s material beeing verifiable: why was the birth rate of 3,4% cut out, while the 3,6% figure kept? Does <i>anybody</i> know? Just asking..

<dd>Actually I just thought the part including 3.6 was more coherently written so I left it.

<dl>
<dd>Ynhockey; that was very good (that you found the ref.). I just included that link as a "hidden" ref. in the article-text, as I don´t expect anybody will find it here...;-). Four issues:
<ul>
<li><u>First:</u> the 3.3 % is a ref. to "Muslims", while the number for "Arabs" is <b>3.0</b>. Isn´t that number more relevant? I mean, since this article is about "Israeli Arabs" (and not: "Israeli Muslims") I suggest we change text from "Muslims" to "<b>Arabs</b>", and change number from "3.3" to "<b>3.0</b>".</li>
<li><u>Second:</u> Actually, the ref. article say that the annual rate for Jews is <b>1.4</b>; so the rate in the article should be changed to reflect this, should it not?</li>
<li><u>Third:</u> We really should mention the year <b>(2004)</b>, that these statistics are given for.</li>
<li><u>Fourthly:</u> I would really like to see the notation follow the definitions in the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demography.html" title="Demography">Demography</a>-article, can somebody find out wether "% annual growth" is actually equal (crude) <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_rate.html" title="Birth rate">birth rate</a>? (..defined as "the number of childbirths per 1000 persons per year.") If that is the case; then we should definitely use <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_rate.html" title="Birth rate">birth rate</a> instead.

<dd>Anyway: frankly, I do not know where to start, as the article stands now. Also: I don´t know if I should bother spending much time on <i>thinking</i> about what is best..seeing that it only get reverted, anyway......</dd>
<dd>Well, I´ll try in a tiny way to attack the main issue: the sections &lt;gasp&gt;. Palmiro: to me it sound unnatural to have a "historical sections" at the beginning of the article about <i>all</i> different issues, and then writing about the <i>very same</i> issues further down, from a present day perspective. Why not, for each section: 1: start with situation in 1948, 2: then the developement; &amp; 3: how it has led to the present situation. (I agree, however, that as it stands now it is impossible: for each section: first present situation....and <i>then</i> the historical developement! )</dd>

<p><small>rezeroing indent</small> OK, well as I said I think there is room for a historical treatment per se. How do you explain the political development of the community separate from the issues of dispossession, for example? And where do you start with each issue, for example, for land, do you start in 1949? Perhaps it's time to start a redrafting exercise in the more peaceful environs of a user sub-page? I thought about that before adding my Maoist propaganda, but decided on balance not to, but maybe if there are people interested in pursuing it it might work now and it migght be easier to work collaboratively. My real objection though was indeed to the current incoherent structure of following each section with a historical section, which we both seem to agree is odd.

<p>Can such a senstce ever be proven&#160;? Is it not a marxist propeganda&#160;?:</p>
<p>"The predominant feature of the Israeli Arab community's economic development after 1949 was its transformation from a predominantly peasant farming population to, in large degree, a proletarian industrial workforce. This was the direct result of the expropriation of Palestinian-owned land."</p>
<p>It adds no value to the subject we deal with, all over the world there is industrtialization (and a move to service economy which this sentence ignore completly) it does not deal with the sepcifics of Arab economy (such as non participation of women in the work force) and how in Israel this is changing (some Arab women work).</p>
<p>This sentence about "economy" does only one thing: It talks about "expropriation of Palestinian-owned land" - which is pushing an assertion into the wrong section.</p>
<p>You want to talk about land confiscation&#160;? fine. Use the discrimination section. Bring proof. Israel is a country of laws. It is not the only country in the world in which some desrted lands go to the goverment. Source your assertion and <b>bring the other POV</b> . Only in this way we will be able to move on.

<p>Another example. This is an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>can someone say what is the encyclopidic value added by this&#160;:</p>
<p>"The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the outbreak of the first Palestinian Intifada in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were defining moments for it, helping form the identity many (but by no means all) of its members adopt as being part of the Palestinian people yet part of the Israeli state.The political face of the Israeli Arab community has continued to change"</p>

<p>I will wait for few days to any editor/admin who wish to clean up the disputed almost valueless taged sections ("the Palmiro additions" which seem like a marxist propeganda) . If no one will clean them up to Wikipedia standrds all the non-jermain, un supported parts and those that brings no value will be deleted. 06:51, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With all respect, Zeq: that is an absurd conclusion to make. To put it bluntly: one reason few edits here at the moment is because you seem to do your best to scare everybody off with your incomprehensible editing.

<dd>As for the "the Palmiro additions", as you call them: they don´t seem like "marxist propaganda" to me. (And yes; I did infact study Marx, at University (ages and ages ago...). I <i>had</i> to, when I took exams in social science....;-) ) (Having said that: some wording (like: "proletariat" and "bourgoisie") should probably change, since it gives a wrong impression to some people (e.g. Americans) (e.g. could change to "working-class" and "middle-class"?))
<dl>
<dd>Well, bourgeoisie and middle class aren't the same thing, and the distinction has been especially important in the modern history of the middle east, where at least according to some historians the segmentation of the middle class and indeed of the bourgeoisie itself has been an important feature of political and social development. e.g. the stereotypical view of Islamists gaining support from a traditional bazaar bourgeoisie while the intelligentsia supports secular political movements. But certainly proletariat can be rephrased as ""industrial working class". <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 14:28, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>ok, here they are used more interchangeable (not much of a bazaar bourgeoisie or Islamist movement here;-)) Anyway: I think the word "proletariat" is more "tainted" (ie has more associated with it) than the word "bourgoisie", anyway. <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 15:18, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Before I start reediting your sections I want to verify that what you wrote there fits the source. Can you provide a link to the source for what you claim in thse sections&#160;? We need to see if indeed the source is so "one sided" or maybe in other ssections (which you did not quote) there are other Point of views.

Please cite evidence for your edits indicating that the Druze were not part of the Arab Palestinian population remaining within the 1949 armistice lines, that immigration since 1949 is the origin for a signifiant part of the Arab population of Israel, and that Israeli Arabs family ties are more notably with the Palestinians of the occupied territories than with those exiled from their own villages, who were in many cases members of the same families.

<dd>Not true. This article was poorly written when i started with it (only had info about "discrimination") after my additions Huldra requested changes (see talk above) which were addressed. We reached some delicate balance and a failrly non POV article existed. After your addition it afagain become one sided. I suggest you review Wikipedia policy that i put on your talk page: There is no way you can eventually get this article to fit your one sided view . Only non POV article will stay. I <b>strongly</b> suggest that if you want any of your additions to stay for the long run you will:</dd>

<li>1) I also think that Arab growth rate would be more relevant to the article on the whole, but I think the figure was originally given to illustrate that Muslims are growing at a far faster rate than Jews. Whether this is necessary or not, I don't know.</li>
<li>2) Yes of course, I'll change it now. Didn't notice.</li>
<li>3) Probably, although CBS compiles yearly statistics and then publishes them in the middle of next year. So, in about summer 2006 we will just look at the 2005 CBS yearbook. But I guess someone not familiar with CBS won't know this.</li>
<li>4) I'm fairly sure that annual growth means just that - it takes the population of the previous year, as opposed to the new year, and calculates a percentage. As you can see, the Judea and Samaria growth rate is astronomical (over 5%), which is probably a result of migration. I could be wrong though. I'll look around the CBS website and see if I can find out for sure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The source can actually be found easily on the CBS website, I think there's an English version. That PDF file will not change next year, it will stay as an archive in the same URL, and new statistics for 2005 will be posted in a different URL, so a new ref will need to be added.

<p>אחרי 57 שנות קיום החליטה מדינת ישראל להכיר בכפר עין-חוד, כפר קטן בן כ-200 תושבים המצוי בפארק הכרמל. הכפר יצורף למועצה האזורית חוף הכרמל. שר הפנים: אנחנו מתקנים עוול היסטורי שר הפנים, אופיר פז-פינס, הוציא הבוקר (ג´) לפועל הבטחה ישנה שנתן ראש הממשלה המנוח יצחק רבין לתושבי הכפר הלא-מוכר עין-חוד: השר חתם על צו בו מכירה ישראל לראשונה ביישוב הקטן אשר בפארק הכרמל. מעתה ישתייך הכפר, על מאתיים תושביו, למועצה האזורית חוף הכרמל. הישוב עין חוד שעל הר הכרמל נוסד בשנת 1948 על-ידי פליטים פלסטינים שנמלטו מבתיהם באזור הכרמל. מאז הוקם הכפר ביקשו תושביו את הכרת המדינה אך לא זכו לה. יישובים אחרים שהוקמו בחטף, בלא אישורים ובלא תכניות בנייה מסודרות, היו ברי מזל יותר מעמיתיהם בעין-חוד. גם כאשר הוקם פארק הכרמל, בשנת 1971, סירבו רשויות החוק ונציגי המועצה האזורית להכיר בכפר ולא כללו אותו בתחום המוניציפלי של הפארק. לטענת מקימי הפארק, הכפר נמצא בתוך הפארק ולכן לא הסכימו להכיר בו כישות מוניציפלית נפרדת. לאחרונה הודיעה המועצה האזורית חוף הכרמל למשרד הפנים כי אין לה עוד התנגדות לצרוף עין חוד למועצה כיישוב מוכר מן המניין. כל היישובים הנמנים על המועצה הביעו גם הם נכונות להכיר בעין חוד. כתוצאה מכך, הכיר השר בעין חוד כוועד מקומי, וגבולותיו הם אלו שאושרו במנהל התכנון בדצמבר 2004. הכפרים הלא-מוכרים סובלים מתשתית תכנונית גרועה, מהיעדר שרותים מוניציפליים בסיסיים, מהיעדר כבישים סלולים ומדרכי עפר רבות. לעיתים מצטרף לכך מחסור חמור בבתי ספר וכיתות לימוד. פני מספר שבועות חתם פינס על הכרה בעיר הדרומית אום-בטין שבנגב, אליה החלו לעבור בדואים רבים מהאזור. לפני-כן, בחודש מאי, חתם השר פינס על החזרתם של 11 אלף דונם שטחי אש צה"ליים לידי ישובי ואדי ערה , לאחר שהופקעו מהם בידי המדינה בשנות ה-60´. גם החלטה זו התקבלה לראשונה בתקופת ראש הממשלה רבין. עם החתימה על הצווים והמפות אמר פינס כי "מדובר בתיקון העוול ההיסטורי שנגרם לתושבי עין חוד. אני שמח כי לאחר שנים רבות של הזנחה סוף סוף זוכים התושבים להכרה מוניציפאלית ואיתה למועצה שתדאג לצורכיהם". נוסף על ההכרה בעין-חוד צירף השר פינס לתחומי המועצה האזורית חוף הכרמל את השכונות 11 ו-13 של קיסריה, אשר היוו עד היום חלק מן החברה לפיתוח קיסריה. ההחלטה לצרף את השכונות למועצת חוף הכרמל התקבלה כבר בחודש ינואר 2004, לאחר שוועדת חקירה לגבולות מועצות האזור המליצה לעשות כן. אז הוחלט, כי שתי שכונות אלו יצורפו לחוף הכרמל, אך ימשיכו לקבל את השירותים השונים מן הרשות המנהלת את קיסריה, היא החברה לפיתוח קיסריה.</p>

<p><a name="NPOV_issue:_.22Modifications_to_Citizenship_and_Entry_Law.22" id="NPOV_issue:_.22Modifications_to_Citizenship_and_Entry_Law.22"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV issue: "Modifications to Citizenship and Entry Law"</span></h2>
<p>As a new Wikipedian, I will try to lean on the side of caution in this response regarding what is obviously a sensitive and much-revised entry. However, I would collegially urge that the following passage in the section "Modifications to Citizenship and Entry Law" is a POV which should be balanced by other POV's in the quest for NPOV:</p>
<p>"As the world's only Jewish state, (compared to many Arab, Moslem and Christian states), Israel has the natural right to adopt policies necessary to maintain its unique historic and cultural identity." For NPOV, this should be balanced by perspectives holding that Israeli Jews indeed have the right to their cultural, civil, and national identity in a democratic and binational state -- as do also the Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, as well as the refugees of the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_exodus.html" title="Palestinian exodus">Palestinian exodus</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakba.html" title="Nakba">Nakba</a> who wish to exercise the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_of_return.html" title="Right of return">Right of return</a> to their ancestral localities.</p>
<p>Since many Palestinian citizens of Israel (e.g. the National Democratic Assembly or Balad Party), as well as some Israeli Jews, favor a <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binational_solution.html" title="Binational solution">Binational solution</a> in which the equal citizenship and nationality rights of both peoples would be protected regardless of the demographic balance at a given point, this POV should surely be represented in an entry about the Palestinian citizens of Israel. For example, a useful source expressing this alternative view is As'ad Ghanem, "Toward Fulfilling the Right to Be Included: The Arabs' Future in a Binational State," a chapter in his book <i>The</i> Palestinian Arab Minority in Israel, 1948-2000: A Political Study <i>(Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 2001),</i> pp. 175-200, finding that the Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel "overwhelmingly support the establishment of a binational, Jewish-Arab state, within Israel (inside the Green Line)."</p>
<p>Again, I write this realizing that the "demographic question" in Palestine/Israel is an issue where NPOV balance can be difficult, and necessarily ties in with assorted other controversies. The portion of the article I quoted has a place as one side of the debate, and should be balanced with other viewpoints.</p>
<p>Most appreciatively,</p>
<p>Margo 05:23, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I thought the bi-national solution lost all of its support ages ago. Everyone now knows it's not viable, and neither the Palestinian nor the Israeli side want it. Some Arab-Israelis might, but I wouldn't say an 'overwhelming majority', not to mention not all Arab-Israelis consider themselves Palestinian, therefore I think Asad Ghanem's book should be taken with a grain of salt. Having said that, you can add whatever you want to the article, as long as it's accurate information, relevant to the articly, and doesn't have a clear POV tone. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 07:00, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The issue here are the policies (laws) of israel about Israel arabs. Not the possible solution to the Israeli-palestinian conflict. so I don't think we need to add more into an already packed article. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 11:53, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">npov added</span></h2>
<p>The article as it stands now is, IMO, outrageously bad. The basic facts and figures are not in place, while a lot of what I would not hesitate to call POV-pushing is. I´ll start working (again) on the article in a day or three: in the meantime I´ve added a npov tag. (Who removed it, in the first place?) Regards, <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 11:12, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>E.g: what on earth is the paragraph about Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews doing in this article? And in the introduction! Has anybody, inside or outside Israel, ever mixed them up with Israeli arabs? Is such a mix-up a common problem??</p>
<p>.....also: the sentences telling us that Israeli arabs are "full citizens" of the "State of Israel" always makes me wonder: does the State of Israel have any "half" citizens?? 3/4 citizens, perhaps? Does <i>any</i> state have anything but "full citizens"? Then why mention the word "full"? To me, it sounds as if we are stating that a circle is round (suprise, suprise!)

<dd>While I agree that the NPOV (or rather, POV) tag should be added, your examples aren't really the reason. I don't know how many would confused Mizrahi Jews with Arabs, but I don't see a reason why there shouldn't be a sentence of clarification - after all, those who would confuse the two do exist, at least within Israel. Notably, there is a sizable amount of old Ashkenazi Jews who refer to Mizrahi Jews as Arabs. As for the second example, maybe it should be re-worded, but I think the person who added it (Zeq?) meant that they are citizens as opposed to 'premanent residents', which is the same only you can't vote or be elected - the status which many Arabs in East Jerusalem have. -- <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> 13:52, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>On a side note, who removed the part that 'they are not to be confused with Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip'? I've personally talked to dozens of people who confused the two, and it was still removed... It's actually a very common misconception.

<p>When Hamas apeal to the Israeli arab: "You strive to destroy Israel from the inside, we will never forget you and won't stop until we raise the Palestinian flag above the iisraeli cities of Acre, Haifa etc.. (where there is a large Palestinian (israeli Arab population) this is a quote that is important to anyone who want to understand the delicate situation in which Israeli Arabs are in. The world is not black and white. There is not just one side. The Israeli arab population is not made off of more than one view and is subject to many types of manipulation, some of it by hamas retorics and operations.

<dd>For once I actually agree with Zeq about the section - it's important to mention the Israeli Arab position in relation to terrorism in this article.

<dd>I agree that it is an important topic, but Zeq is not trying to present it. He is trying to portray Israeli Arabs as Hamas supporters without the least attempt at balance.

<p>Zero, in his sarcastic way asked a fair question:</p>
<p>"Can I list all the individual crimes committed by Jews on <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a>?"</p>
<p>He deserve an answer:</p>
<p>We are talking in this article about a group of people many people don't know that they even exist:</p>
<p>They are palestinians, Arabs who are citizens or resident of Israel. This group is in a bind of dual loyalty: To their people or their country.</p>
<p>Some of them, choose to use their citizenship to help their people against their country. They do it in growing numbers.</p>
<p>Let us look at it from a different prepective:</p>
<p>Say a jew drafts into the american army - no news. A jew drafts into the Israeli army - no news. An arab drfats into the israeli army and want to be a pilot: <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3198013,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3198013,00.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> - news&#160;!</p>
<p>So yes national origin, in some context is worthy of being mentioned in such article.</p>
<p>Let's say a jew was rejected by the israeli air force - would you mention this on Jew&#160;? No.</p>
<p>so it is not the individual act that counts but the context. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 09:21, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_al-Mawasi_massacre_7a43.html" title="Arab al-Mawasi massacre">Arab al-Mawasi massacre</a> (Nov. 1948)&#160;: 14 dead<br />
<a href="../../../k/a/f/Kafr_Qasim_massacre_d071.html" title="Kafr Qasim massacre">Kafr Qasim massacre</a> (Oct. 1956): 48 dead<br />
Oh, yeas: and to keep things to the same detailed level as this section is now, then of course we will have to mention the names and age of <i>each and every Israeli Arab woman and child killed</i>....and the punishment/sentence (if any!) against the perpretators.</p>
<p>Oh boy, this will become one looooooooong article. Regards, <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 06:36, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ps: I suggest we cut out all, except perhaps: "israeli security sources said they [still] consider Israeli Arab involvement with terrorism to be the exception rather than the rule. The rule is that the vast majority of Israeli Arabs, regardless of their political viewpoints, see terrorism as the red line." Something like that. And if you want to put the rest in <i>a separate</i> article: go ahead.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Huldra, In the last 5 years there hundreds of cases of involvment of Israeli Arab against their (jewish) fellow citizens. I have the Hebrew list and never bothered to tarnslate it (it is too long and too painfull for me. Most horific terror acts (almost all) have traced to Israeli Arabs who assisted the bombers once inside Israel. This is the tip of the Iceberg of anti Israeli feelings among Arabs . Many in Israel (not including my self) see such acts as high trason and even demand death penalty for "assiting the enemy in time of war". This is all part of the reality. You want too add few historical events from the 50s - go right ahead and add it to relevant historical sections but need to discuss in the article the reality that is shaping up in Israel in reagrds to the muslims in the country and their alligence. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 07:20, 26 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Zeq: firstly: this article is about (as I understand it) Israeli Arabs <i>since</i> 1948. It is not only (or should not be!) a "snap-shot" of the situation today. Therefore: any killings committed since 1948 are equally relevant. And oh, there are a lot after 1950´s too. Just for a start: the 6 killed in 1976 <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_Day_44fb.html" title="Land Day">Land Day</a> demonstration, + 4(?) killed in demonstrations at the start of the 2nd Intifada. I want <i>all</i> their names here! And their age! And the punishment for their killers! (=none).</dd>
<dd>It is really quite fantastic: you quote the Israeli security sources that Israeli Arab involvement with terrorism <b>is the exception</b>, rather that the rule. Still, you insist on mentioning/bringing into this article, <i>in great detail</i>, examples of these "exceptions"!</dd>
<dd>I´m not denying the facts of these "exceptions" took place; what I´m against is filling up this article with examples of it. And as I said above: if you want to start a separate article with the examples, fine: do that. Then copy all examples from here into that new article, say: Participation of Israeli Arabs in terror acts against Israeli citizens. And you can translate all the examples from Hebrew, just as you like. But I <i>am</i> going to cut out the examples from this article, if you don´t. <b>This is not an article for listing "exceptions".</b> Regards, <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 22:57, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is "the excpetion" in the sense that not all of the 100% of arab Israelis do it. But under this we will not listed discrmination as well (not 100% suffer from it). It is a phenomena that is worth mentionaing for anyone who want to understand how Jews and Arabs see each other. I am also agaianst "filling" the article with the hundreds of such examples. 4-5 is enough. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 04:34, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>I'm starting to agree with Zeq more and more as this discussion page progresses. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exceptions by nature take more space and effort to note, because the general rule is always straight-forward. In an article about English verbs and their transformation to past (for example), you'll always note that there are irregular verbs (and maybe list them), even though they're a tiny fraction of the overall amount of English verbs. In the same sense, Israeli Arab participation in terrorist acts, while an exception, is important to note. It's also important to note that it's an exception though, which I'm sure Zeq can do, providing the appropriate source.</li>
<li>Zeq didn't list the names of each victim. What are you talking about?</li>
<li>The Kfar Kassem massacre and Land Day are probably worth talking about, but only in short because each already has its own article. The article <i>Israeli Arab</i> isn't on its own, but like all Wikipedia articles, is part of a larger network, where you can access more detailed info by going into more detailed articles. Subjects which don't have more detailed articles can be talked about in the main article. In principle, I support making a separate article about Israeli Arab participation in terrorist acts, but I'm not sure we have enough information (unless Zeq can provide it) to write a decent one.</li>
<li>The title <b>Participation of Israeli Arabs in terror acts against Israeli citizens</b> does not imply that Arabs aren't Israeli citizens, but that the acts of terror were against Israeli citizens in general (and not necessarily Jews). While I don't know each act of terror that Israeli Arabs were involved in, I'm sure that some of them hurt Israeli Arabs too. If you can suggest a better title that will reflect the content in a good way, please do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, as I said before, the whole section should possibly be re-worded into a more encyclopedically-written one, but the content should stay because it's an important subject involving Israeli Arabs. Ignoring it would be like not writing about Israel's major wars in the <i>Israel</i> article, because after all, they only lasted a few years combined, and are therefore an exception. -- <font face="wingdings">Y</font> <a href="../../../y/n/h/User%7EYnhockey_4e03.html" title="User:Ynhockey">Ynhockey</a> || <a href="../../../y/n/h/User_talk%7EYnhockey_bbc3.html" title="User talk:Ynhockey">Talk</a> <font face="wingdings">Y</font> 11:23, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fine. Let us have some balance here, shall we?
<ul>
<li>first, there are a lot of killings of Arab Israelis that do not have their own article on Wikipedia (yet) Some do, (in addition to the ones I have mentioned: <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2000_riots_%28Israel%29_8855.html" title="October 2000 riots (Israel)">October 2000 riots (Israel)</a>: 13 killed). ) But a lot do not: eg: another 18 killed in various incidents 2000-2005 +4 killed in an attack in Shefamr in August 2005. In short, as far as I know: <b>a lot more Israeli Arabs have been killed by (Jewish) Israeli citizens than opposite....and are not (yet) mentioned on WP</b>. I can to some extent agree with the importance of the exceptions, BUT: if we are to mention the the attacs <i>by</i> Israeli Arabs, we also have to mention the attacs <i>on</i> them.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I absolutly agree with you. We can add a section about "hate crimes against arabs in Israel" and the attack in shefram would qualify into that section. I think it is the only one but if I am wrong add more. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 18:50, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>...and could you please explain to me the difference between "hate crimes" and "terror acts"? <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 23:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>And if we are to keep a representative view, then this latter section will be much, much, much larger that the "Participation of Israeli Arabs in terror acts against Israeli citizen" section (in order to reflect the numbers). I repeat what I have said above: this will be a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooong article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I would of course prefer to list the name of the perpetrators (like Zeq has done)...the problem with that is that they, in the case of attacks on Israeli Arabs, are almost always unknown (to the general public, that is). A typical example is the 13 killed in the <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2000_riots_%28Israel%29_8855.html" title="October 2000 riots (Israel)">October 2000 riots (Israel)</a>. To my knowledge, both "The Or Commission" (2003) and "The Lapid Committee," (2004) recommended that there should be investigations into which police-officers were responsible for the killings...but such investigation has never(?) been done (again, this is as far as I know; if you have more updated information please inform me.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We have an article on the 2000 riots and the orr comission&#160;? if not off course we should have. This is an important aspect (much more than all the anciant history palmiro brought to this article) <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 18:50, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

As for "ancient history": as I have said before: this article is for the <i>whole</i> history of Israeli Arabs since 1948. In other words: what happened between, say, 1950-1955 is <i>just as relevant and important</i> as what happened between, say, 2000-2005. Editors taking the effort to bring that "ancient history" into the article should be thanked, (IMO), not critizised.

<li>I again suggest that you cut this out, and put it into a new article, say: Israeli Arabs and terror attacs in Israel? (I´m not sure that is NPOV, though; the words "terror" and "terrorism" are very difficult to use NPOV, in my experience. But I would´t personally object to such a title.) (And there are many much smaller articles on Wikipedia than what this would be.). I hope you do: that will save me from a lot of work!&#160;;-D ....digging up names/dates/references to, for a <i>start</i>, the 20++ Israeli Arabs killed 2000-2005....then <i>all</i> from 1948 to 2000.....I suspect it will run into hundreds.....Regards, <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 15:09, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think the section as it now stand is fine and not too big. As I told you I have the complete list in Hebrew and trust me there are hundreds of incidents in which israel arabs (including many from east jerusalem) have participated in terror. This is becoming a critical aspect in Jews-arabs relations in this country. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 18:50, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sure, you think it is fine: the article now only mentions crimes commited by Israeli Arabs, and not the ones committed against them!!! I repeat again (and again and again): To get a balance, to accurately reflect violence against civilians: the section on <b>attacs on Israeli Arabs</b> will be <b>much, much larger</b> than the "Participation of Israeli Arabs in terror ..etc" section. <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 23:54, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Ps: the copying of sources in the article is now quite twisted, indeed, <b>almost every single incident (I have checked) is wrongly represented in the article as it stands now</b> (quotes from the article in <i>italics</i>, my pointing out in <b>bold</b>):
<ul>
<li>Eg.:<i>"Several Israeli Arabs have been convicted of espionage for Hezbollah."</i>...and then listing references which clearly states that people have only been <b>arrested or charged</b>, NOT <b>convicted</b>, or listing Haaretz articles which have already disappeared: <a href="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=5082" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=5082" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. (Also: using references which say <i>"Two Israeli Arabs have been arrested for helping the terrorist swine who murdered five people "</i> sounds just.... just ever so slightly unencyclopedic?) "Charged":<a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3157274,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3157274,00.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> "Not found": <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/error404.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haaretz.com/error404.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, "Not found": <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=280844&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=4&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=280844&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=4&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, Not found: <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=636473" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/PrintArticleEn.jhtml?itemNo=636473" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></li>

<dl>
<dd>If it sais charged we should say charged (not convicted). Haaretz remove articles within few days so we lost the source. So if you think when I interduced it I was not saying the truth then we will have to remove it (and I will find other examples from the hundreds that occur).</dd>

<ul>
<li>Eg.:<i>" according to unofficial figures based on sources in the defence establishment, at least 110 Israeli Arabs were detained last year on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities – a record high, and about three times the number in the previous year."</i> <a href="http://www.ajn.com.au/pages/archives/intifada/0028-intifada-02.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ajn.com.au/pages/archives/intifada/0028-intifada-02.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> becomes "In 2001, at least 110 Israeli Arabs were detained last year [sic!] on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities – a record high, and about three times the number in the previous year." Nothing about <b>"unofficial figures"</b>, really, is that unimportant? Also: again: note the word "detained"....while what is really relevant is "convicted". (I woun´t even mention the word "copy violation"..)</li>
<li><i>"..first Israeli Arab suicide bomber detonated in the Nahariyya train station in Israel killing <b>5</b> people and wounding 62."</i> ..but in the ref. given, it says: "<b>Three</b> people were killed and at least ninety wounded when an Israeli Arab committed a suicide bombing attack on a group of soldiers and civilians disembarking a train in the Nahariya station."</li>

<p>Also; when Israelis stress the importance of some fellow (Jewish) citizens beeing attacked by Israeli Arabs, and how those "exceptions" form/influence the general attitude in Israel towards Israeli Arabs: yes, I can to some extent understand this. I have no difficulty understanding that even a single attack would lead to increased suspicion towards the the whole community of Israeli Arabs.</p>
<p>But: the attacs/killings the "other way around" have been <i>at least</i> 10 times as many! (To my knowledge). Now, I ask this from you: try for once to put yourself in the shoes of an Israeli Arab: what kind of trust would <i>you</i> have in the Jewish population, seeing <b>again and again and again</b> your fellow Arab Israelis killed?? (...and of course; nobody punished for it, or only symbolically punished.). Think about it.

<dd>I think you should add any relevant fact that you can source inan NPOV manner. If you have a record of an Israeli arab killed in 2002 and there is a police report claiming he was in the middle of shooting on cars in the gallilee you should mention that claim. <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">Zeq</a> 06:29, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Enough with the abuse please</span></h2>
<p>I have been very tolrent but enough is enough. This woman (the terrorist) was convicted. The new paper link no longer exist.So I provided a link in English to the day she was charged and two links in Hebrew to the fact she was convicted. Isn't it enough.

<dd>AH, now you are changing the story: your edit-line said: "22:05, 17 February 2006 Zeq (Huldra. Read the text carefully. It is there. If you still have doubts use talk.)" ....and I did indeed read the text <i>very</i> carefully. And the info which you inserted simply was NOT there in the English links. Zeq; when you make a false statements in such a controversial area as this; then I really think it is way, way, WAY over the line to talk about "abuse" when you are reverted! (Or do you think I read hebrew??) <a href="../../../h/u/l/User%7EHuldra_dadc.html" title="User:Huldra">Huldra</a> 08:55, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Huldra, sources don't have to be in English. They should be, whenever possible, but if the only source on an issue worth including is in another language, it's permitted. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If you have your doubts, perhaps you could ask someone you know speaks Hebrew to translate, or find someone on the Hebrew Wikipedia. But I can't imagine Zeq would simply invent the conviction. <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:17, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Delete</span></h2>
<p>This entire article should be deleted and rewritten. Not only is it lacking in facts, is highly biased and doesn't define this group of people and its history accurately, but it's also a mishmash of info from opinions to sources no reputable writer would ever cite.</p>
<p>Wikipedia IS NOT the editorial section of a newspaper. It's an encyclopedia. There are lots of facts in the Hebrew section that are not included in this article. The question is, WHY? If any of you out there THINK for a second that your writing is up to par with journalistic standards, think again. This isn't meant as an attack, but is merely constructive criticism.</p>
<p>Articles on Wiki should be balanced, well researched and accurate. Citing some Joe Shmoe's website as a source, who's credibility is questionable, and then claiming that info to be a FACT is ludicrous. Don't kid yourselves and don't insult other people's intelligence with that B.S..</p>
<p><a name="Bias" id="Bias"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bias</span></h2>
<p>It seems that when anti jewish facts come up the person claiming them is asked for sources. I have no problem with that. Any claim should be supported with well founded and well researched facts. BUT there are lots of inaccuracies and false claims in the article AGAINST Israeli Arabs that are absolute lies. Now, I ask you, where are your sources for those claims? Don't you think ZEQ that your credibility is reaching a new low everytime you pull this stunt? If you are SO concerned with the truth then why don't you remove these false claims?</p>
<p><a name="Zeq.2C" id="Zeq.2C"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zeq,</span></h2>
<p>Just a reminder that you DON'T own wikipedia. I don't know why you weren't advised to let this article be the minute you ripped that info from the Israeli MFA in clear violation of their copyright laws. You have constantly attacked other members of this forum so you probably wouldn't mind if you were treated the same way, would you? What's fair is fair, right? So here goes it:</p>
<p>You have NO concept of the definition of good writing. No concept of what constitutes a valid argument. No concept of civility or respect for fellow Wikipedians. No concept of neutrality.</p>
<p>I still don't know what qualifications you have to be writing this article, let alone contribute to it to this extent. I use "contribute" loosly, because anyone can cut and paste. If you DO represent the Israeli MFA in any shape or form or if you ARE an employee of the MFA then perhaps you should consider giving this "crusade" of yours a rest. Because, it ain't working and your arguemnts, personal attacks and bias all smell like government propaganda.-Preceding unsigned comment was written by User:Cyclopath</p>
<p><br />
Yea and cyclopath clearly is interested in wikipedia policy. Why can't we all be as convincing writers as him. I especially like his coherant argument in the Baruch Goldstein article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baruch_Goldstein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45234725" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baruch_Goldstein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=45234725" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 09:10, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
What does what I wrote on here have to do with the Baruch Goldstein article? The fact of the matter is that you're resorting to discrediting my credibility instead of debating this current issue in THIS article. It's one of the oldest tricks in the book. Do you have anything intelligent and refreshing to say? This article has been plagued with nothing but personal point of views from the very start and blatant cut and paste copyright violations from Israeli government sources. As if the state of Israel which calls itself over and over a JEWISH state is going to put it's 20% Arab minority in a positive light. WHY do you keep posting lies upon lies upon lies? If you want an article to be neutral then use neutral words. What I've been seeing over and over again is the use of emotionally and politically charged words to describe anti Arab views and THAT is a fact! -Cyclo-</p>
