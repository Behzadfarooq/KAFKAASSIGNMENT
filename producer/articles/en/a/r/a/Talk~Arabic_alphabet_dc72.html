<p>I interpret the second key on map to indicates countries where arabic script and adapted script, may be used (even if not official - eg- India and China are shown light green on map). The accompanying paragraph to map refers to Indonesia and Malaysia, but both omitted as light green on map. Article on Jawi script also says South Philippines, Sth Thailand, Brunei &amp; Singapore may use this script. Jawi is official script in Brunei. ````</p>

<p>In experimenting with the localization features of Windows XP, I see that there isn't a single "Arabic keyboard". For example, the "Arabic - Iraq" keyboard has ذ ّ in the key to the left of the Qwerty '1'/'!', while "Arabic - Saudi Arabia" has &lt; &gt;. There are other more important changes between those two such as the location of vowel marks (I don't know the right terminology) in the position of the uppercase Qwerty keys X C V.</p>
<p>I haven't experimented with the other keyboard layouts beside Iraq, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to see how many other national variants exist.</p>
<p>I'm not at all sure how to reflect that in the article. I made a small note in the article, but it deserves to be explained in more detail.</p>

<p>This is a terrible article on what is arguably a very important subject. Its structure and language are both dense and pedantic, and concepts that require special clarification are inadequately developed. Too many subjects are discussed in tandem - there should be a much clearer demarcation of each example. As well, the arabic glyphs are currently in a format much too small to be comprehended. It is at present nearly opaque to the linguistic non-specialist, which is hardly appropriate for Wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The above comment, I have to say, still seems extremely cogent to me. On the principal of Boldness, I've rewritten the introductory paragraphs, which I hope are now less repetitive-- but yes, the rest of the article could benefit from some work as well.

<dd>Seems to have been one of the practical reasons. Latin alphabet easier to learn etc. But there were also political reasons, orientation more toward europe and secularization.

<dd>Due to the lack of notation for vowels (only 3 distinct vowels in arabic, see below) and the fact that short vowels are normally not noted, the arabic alphabet and conventions are not too well suited for languages where vowels play a more important role than in Arabic. (My 0.02 cents.) That may be one of the main non-political reasons. --<a href="../../../f/v/d/User%7EFvdP_984c.html" title="User:FvdP">FvdP</a></dd>

<p><b>::: I should say that arabic is not restricted to the three vowels ( A,o,I) as many people would think, there are (Tashkeel) which is a vital element in the language (Dhamma, fat'haa, Kasrah), basically, arabic is easily adapted to any other language, especially, that there are new (not commonly used) letters, for instance, P can be written in arabic like the second letter in the arabic alphabet (Baa') except with three dots beneath instead of one. I disagree with the statement, that arabic is a difficult language, and isn't flexible. Once you cross the pronounciation barrier, then it is matter of some vocabulary and grammar, and you can speak the language fluently, it is just like any other language really, but to completely master the language,it'll require a lifetime, but we don't need to master a language in order to speak it, do we&#160;??</b></p>

<dd>Sort of, but the objection was spurious insofar as that could easily be remedied: look at its adaptation to <a href="../../../u/i/g/Uighur.html" title="Uighur">Uighur</a> or <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish.html" title="Kurdish">Kurdish</a>! - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:29, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I addition to the possibility of modifying the orthography (as Mustafa mentioned), if a language really requires diacritics then they should be made obligatory for that language&#160;:) I think Greek ideally requires extensive use of diacritical marks, which are often omitted. No? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlef01_4b1a.html" title="User:Alef01">Alif</a> 18:27, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Modern Greek only requires an accent mark, and a diaresis to indicate diphthongs. I don't believe they're normally left out, except maybe in newspaper headlines. In Classical Greek, diacritics indicated aspiration and pitch accent. I'm not sure how good an analogy this is to Arabic vowels, though it's on the right track: you might create more confusion by mixing up Arabic vowels than mixing up Greek accent. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 01:08, 2005 July 14 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have started a merge of the Arabic examples from the German Wikipedia <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a></p>
<p>From the German version (crudely translated):</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>There are only three vowels: A, i and u. Long vowels are indicated by <i>Alif</i>, Ya and <i>Waw</i>. Short vowels marked by <i>Fatha</i> (A - diagonal line over the letter), <i>Kasra</i> (i - diagonal line under the letter) and <i>Damma</i> (u - a kind of small 9 over the letter). If no vowel follows, a <i>Sukun</i> (a small circle over the letter) is set.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is this correct? <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarada_595b.html" title="User:Karada">Karada</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, however, this follows German pronounciation. a is spoken like in "thus", in most modern dialects more like "action" or the German "ä", i "this", u "look" or "roof", in dialect it resembles more an "o". Maybe confusing for English readers. --<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElian_23dc.html" title="User:Elian">Elian</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but short vowels and sukun are normally not marked at all. <a href="../../../f/v/d/User%7EFvdP_984c.html" title="User:FvdP">FvdP</a></dd>

<p>When the moors ruled Spain they ruled Spain and Portugal and there was no spanish language. People spoke Latin in several variations, possibly dialectal, all called "Vulgar Latin". The emergence and separation of the national languages in the Iberian Peninsula happened for the most part in the last 1000 years. --213.22.166.118 03:13, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Never mind that. The language spoken in Granada was <b>not</b> spanish in the current understanding of the concept, i.e., the language that developped in the kingdom of Castille, was later influenced by arabic when Castille expanded south and then spread to vast territories throughout the world. The languages spoken in Granada, and before that in the rest of the iberian territories under arabic rule, was in part arabic, especially in administration and religious issues, but mostly a romance language, very influenced by arabic, called "mozarabic". That is (was) a language on its own, different from all the languages currently spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. 212.113.164.100 04:27, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozarabic_language.html" title="Mozarabic language">Mozarabic language</a> was certainly used - but are you sure Spanish wasn't used as well towards the end? For instance, <a href="http://www.arabic-islamic.org/biblioteca/aljamiado/aljamiado.html" class="external text" title="http://www.arabic-islamic.org/biblioteca/aljamiado/aljamiado.html" rel="nofollow">Arabic-Islamic.org</a> describes Aljamiado as "lengua castellana escrita con grafía árabe" (in 1462, that is). - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 01:39, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hum... I forgot about <i>aljamia</i>. <i>Aljamia</i> was a rather marginal use of the arabic script to write not only castillan (and not spanish, mind you - it's the same thing nowdays, but the term is more recent than the <i>aljamias</i>), but also catalan/aragonese and portuguese amongst the moorish communities that remained in the iberian territories conquered by the christian kingdoms. So, OK, you could say that the arabic script was used to write castillan, but in that case the list is misleading: Not only the usage of the script to write mozarabic was far more important, but also there are other aljamias, not only the castillan one. Furthemore, it wasn't used "when the moors ruled Spain", but by the moors that remeined when they no longer ruled Spain, precisely the other way around (remember that the last moorish communities were expelled from the Peninsula (or converted by force, together with the jews) only in early XVII century). I still think it should be changed. --212.113.164.98 17:25, 8 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've changed the entry to reflect this discussion. Let me know what you think. Were there any Portuguese aljamiado manuscripts? - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 23:46, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, to tell the truth I'm not sure, since different authors have different understandings of what are exactly aljamiado texts. I know that most of what's known as portuguese aljamía is written in safi, not in portuguese. I'm not sure about the existence or not of aljamia in portuguese. In any case, there's a book that might answer that question (Lopes, David - Textos de Aljamía Portuguesa, Imprensa Nacional, Lisboa, 1897), but I do not have access to a copy. The title translates as "Texts of Portuguese Aljamía", BTW.</dd>
<dd>Regarding the entry, you could add aragonese to spanish. Unlike portuguese, aragonese was definitely aljamiado... in fact, the earliest example of aljamía known is written in aragonese, according to what I've found. Other than that, it's fine. --212.113.164.97 01:34, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks! What was Safi? By the way, you know anyone can edit here - why not get a user account and start writing some articles yourself?

<dd>Argh! What did I write above? I should have been sleeping! I totally misread my sources!</dd>
<dd>Safi is not a language - it's a town in western Morocco that was under portuguese rule for a time (until 1541). That (the place and the time) is where the examples of portuguese aljamía come from.</dd>
<dd>It is true, though, that different authors have different understandings of what aljamía really is and that it leads to some discussions about the validity of calling aljamiado to these texts. They really were written in portuguese, though. --212.113.164.98 15:21, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--- Persian, Dari, Farsi are all the names for one language i.e. <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian language</a>.

<p>Persian and Farsi may mean the same thing, but Dari is NOT the same language as Farsi.</p>
<p>Aljamía was and still is in essence, the language of the Moorish descendants of Al Andalus, and thus it remains our language, the language of the Muslim mudejáres and moriscos!</p>

<p>The Romanization I see most often in Internet use, uses digits in addition to letters, for example 3 for `ayn and 7 for Haa', based on visual similarity of the characters. I'd like information on it.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't just change them to hexadecimal; what I was primarily doing was changing letters that had combining diacritics after them with single characters that included the diacritics. The combining diacritics looked like a mess in the browser I was using, some crooked, some not "combining" at all, so I thought, for example, using "H with dot below" was better than "H" followed by "dot below."</dd>
<dd>I only used the hexadecimal because that's what I had (U+<i>nnnn</i> entities) on the Unicode chart I was using at the time. I didn't know there were still some browsers unable to handle the hex entities so I didn't take the time to convert them to decimal.</dd>
<dd>I wonder if it would be a good idea for the MediaWiki code itself to decimalize entities either on input to the database (might confuse editors as what they typed in isn't what they got back) or at the very least upon output when the Wiki markup is parsed to HTML.</dd>

<dd>I also rewrote the paragraphs about transliteration so that they are clearer. I disagree that the DIN standard should be used above all others in this article, as its symbols do not show up on Internet Explorer 6.0 (Microsoft's latest) and are not as accessible to readers who do not know the Arabic alphabet. <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECbdorsett_98d9.html" title="User:Cbdorsett">Cbdorsett</a> 09:35, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since the digit representations are widely used and standardized, they should go back in the table or text. The table currently has as many as 4 transliterations per Arabic letter, some of which are used much less frequently than the digits. Also, the digits are used online where it is not obvious how to find a guide to their meaning, unlike printed academic works which usually include notes about the transliteration they use, if there is any doubt that readers will understand. --<a href="../../../j/w/b/User%7EJWB_e997.html" title="User:JWB">JWB</a> 21:13, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>The above is complete bullshit. "Alif maqsura" is a grammatical concept in the Arabic language; it is not a letter form. It can be represented by either a dotless ya (ى) or an alif. Furthermore, the dotless ya does not always mean "alif maqsura". The dotless ya is used in Arabic in all four forms. The problem, which can be traced to the stupidity of Unicode, is that a) "character" is not so obvious; and b) letterform shape is distinct from context. E.g. a so-called "initial form" can be used in the middle of a word: قائل for example.</b></p>
<p>[Well I can't say anything about where if came from or what it meant originally, but I can tell you that the alif letterform serves numerous functions *in the Arabic* writing system; other systems that use Arabic letterforms may do things differently. More to the point, it is *not* a consonant in modern Arabic (or in any Arabic so far as I can tell). Why not ask the locals? They will tell you that, where alif seems to indicate a long vowel, in fact it indicates the doubling of a short vowel, which is not quite the same thing. In other words, alif has *no primary phonological value* whatsoever, ever.]</p>

<p>In the section "Vowels" is the following paragraph:<br />
"Note that when the acute-shaped fatḥa which denotes a short a is added on top of a geminated consonnant (i.e. after a šadda), the fatha accent takes a vertical shape to make the composition more distinctable from the tanwiin vowel sign fatḥatan (which marks a /-an/ ending with indeterminate nunation in fully vocalized texts, see below). For an example, see the encoded ligature for ʻAllah above."<br />
Which is unfortunately, incorrect. A šadda may be accompanied by fatḥa, damma or kasra(written below the šadda or below the letter) of which all may be single or tanwiin(nunated). A single fatḥa above a šadda is not written in a vertical shape. This "vertical shape" is the alif ḫanjariyyah or "dagger alif" which indicates an unwritten alif, as found in allāh or ar-raḥmān where the alif in both of these words is denoted with a ḫanjar rather than a full alif character). 86.136.191.158 21:36, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Could this be briefly clarified here too? 80.235.60.55 21:55, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>O is sometimes used in transliterations for damma instead of u: Mohammad, Muhammad. U follows academic transliteration styles (Encyclopedia of Islam, MELA, etc.), o follows how it sounds in some vernaculars.</p>

<p>Just made a couple edits (cells misaligned, non-IPA diacritics in the IPA column, etc.). Also a couple alternate transcriptions. Since the under-dot diacritic doesn't work for all browsers, I added the unicode letters with the under-dot as a second variant. Some people have complained about one and some about the other in the comments above, so hopefully by offering both, at least one version will work for everybody. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 21:21, 2005 May 24 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the Persian Alphabet article should not be redirected here, and requireds a dedicated article, since the Persian alphabet has additional letters and different sounds. Likewise, there should be a note in the article indicating that Geem is the Egyptian pronounciation for Jeem, as it is known in the rest of the Arab world, and in Fusha and Classical Arabic. <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigiBullet_0ceb.html" title="User:DigiBullet">DigiBullet</a> 19:14, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are lots of adaptations of the Arabic alphabet, so it's nice to have them all grouped together here for easy reference. But you're right, lots of languages using the Latin alphabet have their own alphabet pages. I imagine it's just that no one's gotten around to making a special page for Persian.

<p>First of all, is خ really a fricative-trill combination? I thought it was a pure uvular fricative.</p>
<p>Second, ɢ for ق is simply not within the recorded variability of MSA; in modern Arabic, it's q or g, though in <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibawayh.html" title="Sibawayh">Sibawayh</a>'s time it <i>may</i> have been ɢ.</p>
<p>Third, I've never heard of غ being realized as ɣ, but maybe that's just me. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 21:03, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The IPA Handbook, which uses al-Shaam Arabic (one speaker from Safad/Beirut/Damascus) as a sample language, says "/x/ is accompanied by uvular trill", but treats it as a fricative. It looks like the research was done at the University of Kuwait. We should probably list other realizations of this phoneme (in Cairo, isn't it just [x]?), but al-Shaam is a prestige dialect, so I think we should keep it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for غ, the symbol is supposed to be a gamma: is it the wrong symbol, or are you saying that غ sould be an approximant, as <i>g</i> in Spanish? (I thought I'd always heard a fricative.)

<dd>I'd always just assumed they were both velar because they don't affect vowels the way the uvular <i>qof</i> does (at least not in Cairene). It's pretty common for all uvulars to have such an effect - Yup'ik, for example, though that's hardly confirmation. The Handbook just lists the <i>ghayn</i> as velar in the chart, and never mentions it again, which suggests by omission that there's nothing special about it. And the <i>xaa</i> has uvular accompaniment. Another possibility is that they're velar, but further back than English velars. Such sounds are very often called "uvular" in the literature even when they don't involve the uvula. A lot of "uvulars" in the American Pacific Northwest are actually back velars, for example. But of course in other dialects they may very well be true uvulars. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 19:50, 2005 Jun 6 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We might want to confirm, but that's good reason to suspect that the frics are uvular in Maghrebi Arabic. I'd say put them in as alternate pronunciations if you're comfortable with it.

<dd>They do so too in some Khaliji and Iraqi accents, specially where the madd (long vowel a) is made to sound like how Farsi speakers would pronounce the long vowl in 'Iran'; slightly to the O. Does this only occure in Arabic when a long vowel a is follows the xaa or ghayn? What are your examples, Mustafa?

<p>also, some of the IPA renderings of the letters were wrong or strange. most obviously was /x/; trying to represent a "uvular trill offglide" that may be peculiar to one particular dialect, but is certainly not representative, is strange, at best. also, ayn is glottalized only in Iraq and Kuwait.</p>

<dd>Ayn is not 'glottalized' but a glottal in the al-Shaam standard, at least according to the IPA handbook. In Cairene it sounds glottal to my ear, but I don't know for sure. It doesn't seem to be a pharyngeal approximant, however (and certainly not a fricative!). As for the 'strange' /x/, that wasn't an offglide. The IPA tie bar means that the sounds are pronounced simultaneously. See the discussion above. As is, there is an odd and probably artificial assymmetry between <i>kh</i> and <i>gh</i>. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 07:22, 2005 July 11 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>you are right, "offglide" isn't right. i did see the discussion above but i didn't look quite closely enough. however, no authorities i can find indicate that there is an accompanying trill, so i don't think this belongs unless we can show that it is *widespread* not just in one particular dialect, "prestige" or not. [the authorities disagree on whether it's velar or uvular and indicate it may vary dialectally.]</p>
<p>"glottalization" is not wrong as it can mean "glottal accompaniment" [see wikipedia article]. as for ayn, i've heard quite a lot of egyptian and moroccan arabic, and there is no glottal accompaniment in it. if there were, it would be obvious -- you'd hear a closure. what you're probably hearing is creaky voice. cf. Anatole V. Lyovin "An Introduction to the Languages of the World": "[ayn] is phonetically a creaky-voice, pharyngealized resonant (there does not seem to be much air friction if there is any at all) that mimics the following vowel, or if such does not exist, the preceding one". actual glottal closure occurs only in Iraqi and Kuwaiti Arabic. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 21:46, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, might want to add an under-trema to the notation then. Your explanation of the glottalization sounds reasonable. However, in the Handbook description, it was not glottal accompaniment, but pharyngeal accompaniment - equivalent to the emphatic consonants. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a>

<p>The abjad order doesn't really "preserve" the older Phoenician/Hebrew/Aramaic alphabet order, since the Abjad order was pretty much created after the Arabic alphabet had already been expanded to 28 letters, by matching each Aramaic letter with a corresponding letter of the fully consonant-dotted Arabic alphabet (with six Arabic letters left over at the end). If the Abjad order PRESERVED the older order, then there would be no Arabic letter corresponding to the Aramaic letter semkat (samekh) in the Aramaic alphabet ordering (i.e. 15th position), since no Arabic letter is derived from Aramaic samekh. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 01:01, 6 September 2005 (UTC) 05:01, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know about p and v, but "g" is not a foreign sound in Arabic - it's quite common, and is represented by the 5th letter of the alphabet - geem. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 03:07, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The [v] sound is sometimes written with the letter fa, but with three dots over it, rather than one. I think that using the Persian [p] letter (ba with three dots under it, rather than one) is rarer. As for a [g] sound, [g] is the ordinary pronunciation of the letter jim among Egyptians (but the standard Arabic pronunciation of this same letter is with a "j", and a common Syrian pronunciation is with a "zh"). Non-Egyptian Arabs occasionally use a letter jim with three dots under it to transcribe a [g], but I'm not sure how widely that would be understood (the Persian use of this same symbol is to transcribe a "ch" or "tsh" sound). <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 15:15, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>beh with three dots below is pretty much automatically understood to mean P. feh with three dots above is equally understood to mean V. G is transliterated using standard geem in Egypt, and ghayn in the sham. geem with three dots inside indicates a zh voice in Egypt and sometimes called a zheem (e.g. as in garage = geem - reh - aleph - zheem)</dd>

<p>This is a question for native English speakers: Does the opening sentence&#160;»The Arabic alphabet is the script used for writing in the Arabic language.«&#160;make sense in English? Can an <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphabet.html" title="Alphabet">alphabet</a> be a script, or are these two different terms? Judging on the use in my native Slovenian, I would call&#160;»a script«&#160;a set of defined symbols used to write a language, and&#160;»an alphabet«&#160;a common, or defined, <i>order</i> of these symbols. Consistent with this, we are talking about <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_script.html" title="Latin script">Latin script</a>, but about <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_alphabet.html" title="English alphabet">English alphabet</a>, and, for instance, about different positions of letters Ä and Ö in <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_alphabet.html" title="German alphabet">German</a> and <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish_alphabet.html" title="Swedish alphabet">Swedish alphabets</a>. Judging from the usage in Wikipedia, though, I would say that the terms&#160;»alphabet«&#160;and&#160;»alphabetic writing system«&#160;are used more loosely and perhaps interchangeably in English.

<dd>Well actually this isn't an alphabet. An alphabet represents vowel sounds while an abjad only represents the consonants. This isn't a pure abjad, but that's how it would be best described. I'm not sure why this is under Arabic alphabet. It should be moved. --<a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakeHMM_45b4.html" title="User:LakeHMM">LakeHMM</a> 03:53, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>regarding the original question, "script" is used synonymously with "<a href="../../../w/r/i/Writing_system.html" title="Writing system">writing system</a>", and alphabets are a subset of these. The Chinese <i>script</i> isn't an "alphabet", being ideo-/logographical, that's not an issue here. If the Arabic alphabet isn't considered an "alphabet" in the strict technical sense, that's still what it is commonly called. Yes, it is an <a href="../../../a/b/j/Abjad.html" title="Abjad">abjad</a>, but we won't move the article to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_abjad.html" title="Arabic abjad">Arabic abjad</a> or Arabic consonantal alphabet because of that. An abjad is, in common usage, considered an alphabet, because it maps phonemes to symbols. In contexts where pedantry is required, it can be identified as an abjad, or if that term is considered too opaque, a consonantal alphabet. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:53, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your help. I realize, however, that my question probably wasn't clear enough, since no answer actually answered what I hoped I had asked. So I will try to rephrase it. I believe I understand the difference between an <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphabet.html" title="Alphabet">alphabet</a>, an <a href="../../../a/b/j/Abjad.html" title="Abjad">abjad</a> and an <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abugida.html" title="Abugida">abugida</a>, and I also know that Arabic is an abjad, even though professor Daniels considers it shouldn't be called an abjad, since it actually has characters for some vowels (alif, for instance). My question was not, however, whether the article should be renamed from <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_alphabet.html" title="Arabic alphabet">Arabic alphabet</a> to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_abjad.html" title="Arabic abjad">Arabic abjad</a> or even Arabic impure abjad, but whether <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_script.html" title="Arabic script">Arabic script</a> would be a more appropriate term for it. Wikipedia applies this term to Indic scripts, e.g., <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarati_script.html" title="Gujarati script">Gujarati script</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurmukhi_script.html" title="Gurmukhi script">Gurmukhi script</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam_script.html" title="Malayalam script">Malayalam script</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_script.html" title="Tamil script">Tamil script</a> or <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu_script.html" title="Telugu script">Telugu script</a>, to name a few. The titles <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarati_alphabet.html" title="Gujarati alphabet">Gujarati alphabet</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurmukhi_alphabet.html" title="Gurmukhi alphabet">Gurmukhi alphabet</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayalam_alphabet.html" title="Malayalam alphabet">Malayalam alphabet</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_alphabet.html" title="Tamil alphabet">Tamil alphabet</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu_alphabet.html" title="Telugu alphabet">Telugu alphabet</a> exist as redirections for the above mentioned articles.

<dd>but the question whether the Arabic script is an alphabet is related to your question. We seem to use "script" for abugidas, and we seem to allow "alphabet" for abjads. That makes sense, since abjads are traditionally called alphabets. The difference between "abjad" and "alphabet" would be difficult to translate into Arabic, since I understand "abjad" is simply the Arabic generic term for "alphabet" (<a href="../../../../ar/%D8%A3/%D8%A8/%D8%AC/%D8%A3%D8%A8%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9.html" class="extiw" title="ar:أبجدية">ar:أبجدية</a> -- is there a difference between <i>abjad</i>, <i>abjadi</i> and <i>abjadiyyah</i>?). It wouldn't be <i>false</i> to move the article to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_script.html" title="Arabic script">Arabic script</a>, but clearly the same would then apply for <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_script.html" title="Hebrew script">Hebrew script</a>, Nabatean script, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac_script.html" title="Syriac script">Syriac script</a>, Proto-Canaanite script etc. These are all commonly called "alphabets", and by MoS I argue that this is where we should keep them. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 11:25, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_Modern_Written_Arabic_4b83.html" title="Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic">Arabic dictionary</a> translates Abjad as "alphabet". Abjadi is the adjective form "alphabetical". Abjadiya is the feminine singular (and inanimate plural) form of the adjective, which could theoretically be used as an abstract noun (though I'm not sure what this abstract noun would mean). <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 19:03, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>yes, the point is that the ar-wiki article on "Alphabet" is on "abjadiyyah", and not on "abjad", so I wonder whether "abjad" is even in use anymore... <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:48, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>With the browser I was using (Mozilla Firefox 1.0.7) the two sets of lines demonstrating the Abjadi orders in Arabic and roman letters were misaligned, so I decided to put them in tables. It turned out Firefox was also being too clever and rendering them right to left, which put them in the wrong order. So these are now both in the right order and properly aligned.</p>
<p>I may have inadvertently introduced some errors into the order (I am not familiar with Arabic myself). I would appreciate it if someone who knows what they're doing would check this over.</p>

<p>This strikes me as a bit odd:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unlike Arabic alphabetic characters, Arabic numerals are written from left to right.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Isn't this sort of a matter of perspective? We think of reading a number from left to right starting with the highest digit because that's our experience as English speakers and that's how our language works, but in older days they used constructions like "four-and-twenty blackbirds" (this is still used in German as <i>vierundzwanzig</i>) and so "42" might have been quite a natural way to write "twenty-four" in English had things happened differently.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we could say that Arabic numerals <i>are</i> read from right-to-left, by reading the ones-place first (e.g. 316 is "6 and 10 and 300"), and it's the European languages which had things backwards. I guess this only makes sense if the way numbers are spoken in Arabic sounds somewhat like "four-and-twenty", though. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 02:32, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree.

<dd>JWB is right about the order. But in any case, Arabs do generally write numbers from left to right; it's not a matter of perspective, if they're writing ٧٤٦٥٨ they start with the ٧! So for example if you are writing a telephone number in Arabic and the number is 092 353484, you'll begin on the left with the zero, just like in the Latin alphabet. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 20:10, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One can also argue that the Latin letters J, C, X can be pronounced differently according to the language. But nevertheless in the Arabic script there are even more issues on the vowel sounds and what they represent- e/a in Arabic is ae in Farsi and a in Urdu; i in Arabic and Urdu is e in Persian, etc. Also, there are articles about each specific version of the Arabic alphabet, like <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_alphabet.html" title="Persian alphabet">Persian alphabet</a> and <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu_alphabet.html" title="Urdu alphabet">Urdu alphabet</a>, so I'd think its safe to focus on Arabic in this article. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasawala_1ef6.html" title="User:Basawala"><font color="forestgreen"><b>Mar de Sin</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBasawala_bd91.html" title="User talk:Basawala"><font color="navy"><sup><b>Talk to me!</b></sup></font></a> 18:45, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that writing Arabic words without ligatures and joining letters will make reading Arabic text much easier. Why do not perform this reform at least in home? Example:</p>
<p>الله - word Allah (A LL<sup><b>A</b></sup>H) written with joining - difficult to read, appears optically as three separate symbols - A and <b>A</b> are separated, but L, L, and H are joined into one symbol.</p>
<p>ا ل ل <sub>ّ</sub> ه - word Allah (A L L <b>A</b> H) written without joining - easy to read, appears optically as five separate symbols - A, L, L, <b>A</b> and H are fully separated.</p>
<dl>
<dd>But writing that way would be like writing Japanese text in hiragana only. It's technically easier to read for learners, but you'll not find any authentic text written that way, except in various books written for those learning to read the language. The conventional way has always been natural Arabic script (ie with ligatures) plus a romanisation. <a href="../../../r/h/i/User%7ERhialto_3647.html" title="User:Rhialto">Rhialto</a> 00:34, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know Arabic is said to be displayed "right-to-left" though is technically bidirectional because, I think, some string are displayed LTR (ie numbers).

<p>It's right-to-left by character and word, except for numbers. That is, if the sentences "I am 42. He is 18." were written in "Arabic" order, it would be ".18 si eH. 42 ma I" Hope this helps! Herbivore 04:24, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it's worth noting that as we borrowed the numerals from Arabic and not the other way around, in actuality <i>we</i> are the ones that use bi-directional text. This is why when you justify numbers, you must do so on a right margin instead of on the left, as would be expected with the left-to-right ordering of our script:</p>
<pre>
10234
  321
   41
</pre>
<p>One might make an argument against this by saying that we read numbers in the order they're written, but this is hardly universally true in European languages -- German, for example, reads 27 as "7 and 20", and this was common enough in English that in older texts instances of it can still be found. Granted, no one says 7 and 20 and 100, but still, it's worth thinking about. 70.132.3.92 01:02, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Convert all of the ArabDIN 31635 characters representing alif and ‘ain so that they render correctly in common browsers such as Internet Explorer 6.0.</li>
<li>Combine the two alphabet tables into a single table. This should be done as a text exercise, not cutting and pasting images from the large graphic that came from the German Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Combine the two explanations of the four letter forms into a single explanation.</li>
<li>Briefly explain the usage of <a href="../../../a/b/j/Abjad.html" title="Abjad">abjad</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alphabet.html" title="Alphabet">alphabet</a> in the head section.</li>

<li>Increase the size of the characters displayed in the collation order section.</li>
<li>Move the "modified letters" section to the pages for Arabic Alphabet and Persian alphabet, and correct the IPA rendition of ta’ marbuta.</li>
<li>Move the long description of diacritics to Arabic alphabet, with a very short summary section and an appropriate {{main|}} tag.</li>
<li>Delete the section on numerals, but leave a link at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>Fix the map entitled "Worldwide use of the Arabic alphabet" - it should indicate Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pilipinas, Pattani and Singapore. Maybe it could also mark the countries where the alphabet was used in the past?</li>
<li>The section <b>Computers and the Arabic Alphabet</b> should be shorter summaries, with references to the appropriate main articles where the topics are fleshed out in full.</li>
<li>PLEASE find a better text to illustrate the script. Fi'l-funduq ("in the hotel") is just too prosaic. I'll check my own photos to see if any are suitable.</li>
<li>We should have a <b>References</b> section for all the footnotes to appear in. We have a lot of unsupported assertions now, and this situation should be remedied ASAP.</li>
<li>Add an appropriate reference to [[Category:Arabic-derived alphabets]]</li>

<dd>Oh, I went over the talkpage looking for this topic and somehow missed that. Still, the fact that "alphabet" is technically (and perhaps politically) incorrect is a well enough reason to change the wording to "script." Its definition as an "alphabet" seems a bit elementary.

<dd>I'm sorry, but alphabet wasn't "incorrect" until one person started inventing new terms ("abugida") and rather arbitrarily and whimsically changing the meaning of old words ("abjad") rather less than 20 years ago. It's nice that linguists recently have some shiny new terminology to play around with, but that doesn't all of a sudden make the meaning of the word "alphabet" -- as it has been used for many centuries -- somehow now allegedly "incorrect"[sic]. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 08:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The creation of new terms and new meaning for existing terms is a feature of language evolution that has been going on for quite a long while, not just the last 20 years, and not just the last few centuries. Daniels's coopting of "abjad" for a new use and coining "abugida" was neither arbitrary nor whimsical - it served a definite purpose, and since the introduction of these innovations, linguists have apparently found the distinction to be useful. I suggested changing the title of this article to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_script.html" title="Arabic script">Arabic script</a> because all the titles of all the other writing system articles use the term "script" instead of "alphabet." Where the term "alphabet" is used, the articles relate to the adaptation of a particular script to a particular language. <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECbdorsett_98d9.html" title="User:Cbdorsett">Cbdorsett</a> 08:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm with <a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECbdorsett_98d9.html" title="User:Cbdorsett">Cbdorsett</a> on this one: <i>Arabic script</i> is probably more used in any case: it gets around 805,000 hits on <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Arabic+script%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=|" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Arabic+script%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=|" rel="nofollow">Google</a> whereas Arabic alphabet gets <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Arabic+alphabet%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8|" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22Arabic+alphabet%22&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8|" rel="nofollow">around 288,000</a>. It's more generic, and cannot be accused of being incorrect. <a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 13:56, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
