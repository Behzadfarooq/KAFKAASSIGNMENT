<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranho__Titanic_Book__Collection_200d.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The history dates back all the way to spring 2006 when <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranho_c62f.html" title="User:Aranho">Aran</a> was in Primary 6. Aran was sitting beside his two classmate, Brandon and Wei Xiong, during class. The lesson was so boring which made Wei Xiong to draw comics. After he created a few more comics, Aran then have a idea for his comic.</p>
<p>Aran went home after school has ended and he then started to write a script for the to-be comic, Titanic 2. The script was then finished and he brought it to school the next day to show it to his partners. Wei Xiong, after he saw something "insulting" about him on the script, tore up the part one of the script. Most of the piece of the script was recovered fortunately and Aran then re-write part one of the script once he reach home after school.</p>
<p>The script was done and, instead of making a comic, Aran make a book out of it. The finished book was then bought to school. However, when he was showing it to his partner, his form teacher confiscated the book as the mid-year examinations was around the corner. After the mid-year examinations, his form teacher returned the book back before the June school holidays.</p>
<p>After the books were returned, Derek, Aran's classmates, ask Aran what did the teacher gave him. Aran then told Derek what it was and Derek ask whether he could read it. Aran then passed him the books to let him read it.</p>
<p>In less then a week, Aran's book has spread around the whole class and his books became popular. A third book was then created in May 2005. During the June school holiday, a total of seven books have been created, the highest record so far.</p>
<p>After the June school holiday has ended, the "Titanic Book" collection became secretive and by September, the whole class has probably forgotten about it. To bring the "popularity" back, Aran decided to bring the whole "Titanic Book" collection to school after the end-year examination and before the December school holiday. The popularity of the book began to rise again and some of the classmates wanted to read it.</p>
<p>The first positive comment Aran has received about the books is from Nicholas Ho, Aran's classmate. He said that, "This story is nice." referring to the book <i><a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranho_Haunted_School_741e.html" title="User:Aranho/Haunted School">Haunted School</a></i>. On the last week of school in 2005, the lyric of the Coca Cola Lime song, from the famous advertisement about the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-Cola_with_Lime_84a2.html" title="Coca-Cola with Lime">Coca-Cola with Lime</a>, made an appearance in the 19th book, The Day After Tomorrow 2 Part 2. The lyrics was seen by those who read that particular book and some of these people who had read it wanted the lyric from Aran. The lyrics was then given out to the people who wanted it on the last day of school in 2005. By the end of 2005, a total of 22 books were made.</p>
<p>In 2006 however, a major crisis had began. The Lack of Creativity period was started as the creativity had started to fade away. More and more proposed book were cancelled which slowed down the number of books that were released. By the end of 2006, eight books were only released, the lowest record so far. Despite the crisis that was going on, some of the classmate from 2005 still remembered about the collection and this almost caused the popularity to increase.</p>
<p>In 2007, no new books have been released so far. Two books are currently in writing.</p>
