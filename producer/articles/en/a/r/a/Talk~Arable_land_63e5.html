<p>I'm deleting the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The closest thing to a natural habitat that human beings have is the large river valleys of the world. The temperature is comfortable there, and it has plenty of fresh water, food, fish, and thirsty wild animals attracted to the water. This is why all the great ancient civilizations began on the banks of great rivers. Lots of food can be grown there, feeding the largest populations.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think there's a reasonable argument that hunter-gatherers are more "natural" than agriculturists...</p>
<p>It's not clear to me what large rivers have over small ones, except in scale. Also, much of the river valleys that are now prime agriculatural land were swamps of limited agricultural potential until drained in recent times.</p>

<p>I've never seen a good definition of "arable land". This article is no exception. It distinguishes only "arable" and "unarable". The word "arable" sounds as if it should mean "land that can be farmed", not "land that can be, and is, farmed". Apparently, however, the second meaning is the one intended. So what do you call land that can be farmed but is not being farmed? I've seen the phrase "potentially arable", but that seems redundant. What, for example, is the difference being "breakable" and "potentially breakable"? But I'm not just splitting hairs. I really and truly do not know what is meant when they say "arable land". What about land from which forest must be removed, but otherwise is fertile? Is this "arable" or what? Too, presumably, any land that is being farmed can be farmed, so why say "can be, and is, farmed"? Just say "is farmed". If that is the case, why not just say "farmland"? Or are fallow lands what makes the difference?</p>
<p>For example, Brazil has 7% arable land. Does that mean that 7% is cultivated land, even though there may be much more that could be cultivated? Or does that mean that's all there is, and that it's all being worked.</p>
<p>Thomas Keyes May 18, 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, the term could probably be re-defined in the article, but do you not have a dictionary? <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=define" rel="nofollow">Google on define:arable</a>:
<ul>
<li>Land that is fit for cultivation;</li>
<li>(1) Suitable or used for the growing of crops. (2) Land that is so suitable or so used;</li>
<li>Land suitable for farming.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Also, from <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#2097" class="external text" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#2097" rel="nofollow">CIA Worldfactbook</a>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Land use -- This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for three different types of land use: <b>arable land</b> - land cultivated for crops like wheat, maize, and rice that are replanted after each harvest; <b>permanent crops</b> - land cultivated for crops like citrus, coffee, and rubber that are not replanted after each harvest; includes land under flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines, but excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber; <b>other</b> - any land not arable or under permanent crops; includes permanent meadows and pastures, forests and woodlands, built-on areas, roads, barren land, etc.</i></p>

</dl>
<p>MORE QUESTIONS</p>
<p>Of course I have dictionaries, but the definitions always leave me with the same questions. What are permanent meadows and pastures? Is there anything that prevents a "permanent" meadow or pasture from being cultivated? And what about land like Arizona? In those parts of Arizona where irrigation has been developed, as along the Colorado River, crops do just fine. Presumably they could do well elsewhere too, with more agricultural water. Are these hitherto uncultivated lands classified as arable? The second part of your second bullet says "so suitable" or "so used", but these are not one and the same thing. In Africa and probably elsewhere, there are lands suitable for cultivation which are not actually cultivated. To me, it sounds as if the choice of an adjective ending in "-able" is very inappropriate, if we are talking only about land already farmed and omitting land that might be farmed with varying degrees of ease or difficulty. I'm not trying to be argumentative. I'm trying to make sure I understand what is meant.</p>

<dl>
<dd>All good points -- I guess the point (the above is actually 4 different sources) is that its not a perfectly defined word/concept. If I planted crops last year but not this year, is that land still "arable"? And at at the accuracy and magnitude of figures cited (i.e. country/region/world sized) it doesn't matter all that much -- I don't believe anyone talks about e.g. 3 arable acres (I could be wrong, but it'd be easier to give specific characteristics of a few specific acres). BTW, an easy way to sign your posts is with 4 tidles: ~~~~. <a href="../../../e/w/l/User%7EEwlyahoocom_d1b9.html" title="User:Ewlyahoocom">Ewlyahoocom</a> 20:38, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I came accross this article while doing some research, and while the introductory article does define the term well, much of the article reads like a collage of snippets inserted here and there. It moves back and forth from a college reading level,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> to a fourth-grade reading level.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Also, many places seem to have undue weight on issues like deforestization,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and starvation (don't get me wrong, this is very relevant, but it reads like someone was scartering hints about world poverty levels, possibly eco-politically oriented. It just isn't worked into the article well, sounds like it was pasted in by someone with an agenda). Also, there are many unsourced claims, which I have added <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags to. —Two-Bit Sprite 13:28, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. I would go ahead and insert the sources myself, but I am a bit uneducated on the issue and wouldn't know where to find good primary sources. Also, in terms of the prose of the article, it's a bit too messy for me to be able to tackle without a full re-write, which I do not have time to do. —Two-Bit Sprite 13:57, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
