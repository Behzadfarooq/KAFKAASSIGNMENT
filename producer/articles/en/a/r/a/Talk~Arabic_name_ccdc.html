<p>I added an "Other names" section describing some aspects of Arabic names, as I understand them. I'm not sure if what I have is entirely correct, so if anyone knows anything about this, please correct it and flesh out some of the details.</p>
<p>One particular question about the "Abu" thing: Is this actually used in the literal "Father of" sense, or is it more of a nickname, or descriptive aspect, sort of like the Roman <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognomen.html" title="Cognomen">cognomen</a>? I ask because the two "Abu" names that come to mind when I think of this are <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi_3468.html" title="Abu Musab al-Zarqawi">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Nidal_1481.html" title="Abu Nidal">Abu Nidal</a>, and these are both actually aliases that those people adopted. I don't know what "Musab" means, but "Abu Nidal" means the "Father of the Struggle," as the Wiki article points out.</p>
<p>So, is "Father of <i>x</i>" just some sort of common alias technique Arabs use, or is it also used in a literal sense sometimes?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Abu</i> is commonly used among Arabs in everyday usage. First of all, you can of course use it to say that X is the father of Y. However, when it is used generally, it is used as a kind of way to talk to a person respectfully. Even people with no sons will be sometimes called "Abu something"; this something is their father name (If my father is Abdulaziz, and someone does not know my son's name or the name I would choose for my son if I had one, he'll just call me Abu Abdulaziz). Sometimes it is out of similarity to others; for instance, a known Arabic figure (Say Ali Bin Abu Talib) had a Son called Hassan, so if your name is Ali, people would start calling you Hassan.</dd>
<dd>When the person actually has a son, the eldest son's name (And in rare cases, the eldest daughter's name) is used. I do not know a similar usage to it in English, or the roman cognomen you're refering to, but you can say it is some sort of a nickname used to avoid using the actual name, which is, when people are not close enough, might not be considered very respectful.</dd>
<dd>Just an interesting thing to note; women also have such naming convention, and it is used as much as it is used with men. You'd find my mother, for instance, referred to as Um Khalid (or mother of Khalid).</dd>
<dd>I hope that was meaningful; I find it hard to explain concepts I usually take for granted. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhalid_8c47.html" title="User:Khalid">Khalid</a> 16:44, Sep 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Re the contention that <i>Abdul</i> by itself just means "servant of...", and is not a complete name, I understand that sometimes the actual name being referred to is the general Semitic name <b>Abdel</b>, which is <i>abd</i>+<i>el</i>, "servant of God". As such it is identical with the Old Testament <b>Obadiah</b>=<i>obed</i>+<i>yah</i>.</dd>

<p>I've edited a few things in this article; most of my edits were slight changes to make the information more accurate. However, I think I need to explain my edits to the last section:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dropping "bin" prefix issue is very true, but it is not only present in Iraq; actually I think it is more prsent in Iraq (despite Saddam Hussian's name) than in other places. It is just considered <i>old form</i> to use "bin" nowadays.</li>
<li>The "Abu" usage is not restricted to Palestians, and is in no way an indication to them. It just happens that people in groups like <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> try to use aliases rather than real names, originally for their security. Other parts of the Arab world use this kind of aliases as much as Palestians, but in less official circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As an aside, <i>bint</i> was originally a British Forces slang word for a girl, which has now passed into general English usage. The word is not obscene, merely perhaps a little reproving, and quite charmingly old-fashioned.</dd>

<dd>You can spell it either way. You can spell it <b>Hussayn Hanoon Alsaadi</b> if you want, just so long as the name isn't usually spelt in Roman lettering. The capitalised definite article looks a bit old-fashioned; then again, <b>Hanoun</b> always looks too French colonial for my taste, but it's quite standard.</dd>

<p>I'd like to start a project, and I'm not sure where, but I thought I'd bring it up here.</p>
<p>As many of you know, there is no one standard way of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliterating</a> from <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> to <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_letters.html" title="Roman letters">Roman letters</a>. So "Mohammed", "Mohammad", and "Mohamed", and "Muhammad" are all quasi-correct ways of spelling the prophet's name in English language texts. This can be quite a hassle on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>It seems to me that three things are needed.</p>
<ol>
<li>We need people to provide the names in for Arab figures. For instance, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Sayyaf_3174.html" title="Abu Sayyaf">Abu Sayyaf</a> (organization), <a href="../../../j/a/l/Jalal_al-Din_Muhammad_Rumi_6d26.html" title="Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi">Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi</a> (poet), and <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taif.html" title="Taif">Taif</a> (city) are lacking their names written out in Arabic. If I can get some volunteers, I'll try to collect a list of articles that need this.</li>
<li>We need to see if we can agree on some sort of standard spelling for Arabic articles on Wikipedia. For instance the "El" in <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohamed_ElBaradei_528f.html" title="Mohamed ElBaradei">Mohamed ElBaradei</a> and the "al" in <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Atta_al_Sayed_21d0.html" title="Mohammed Atta al Sayed">Mohammed Atta al Sayed</a> are spelled the same in Arabic letters, but are translated differently in English. Is there a reason for this? (Both people are Egyptian.) If we can agree on a standard, then we can move articles to standard names (with redirects, of course).</li>
<li>We need to make sure we have proper redirects for alternate spellings for Arabic articles. For instance, if someone looks up <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Atta_c445.html" title="Muhammad Atta">Muhammad Atta</a>, this needs to redirect to <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Atta_al_Sayed_21d0.html" title="Mohammed Atta al Sayed">Mohammed Atta al Sayed</a>. This can be confusing. Doing a little Googling, I found that the most common spellings for Mohammed are "Mohammed", "Mohammad", "Muhammad", and "Mohamed". (This applies to the Prophet as well as other people with this name.) The common spellings for Abdullah are "Abdullah", "Abdallah", and "Abdulla". Etc.</li>

<dd>None of this is necessary. You can spell any Arabic name anyway you want in English, so establishing a "right" way to spell it is counter-productive.

<p>The article says that maghrebi names are influenced by Berber and French. That is true about Berber but definitly wrong about French I have never heard of any ethnic Arab or ethnic Berber Algerian, Morrocan or Tunisian with a French sounding name. Occasionaly you can hear a French or Spanish sounding nickname. North African Jews had French sounding first names, but they have all immigrated to France or Israel, and very few are left in the Maghreb (if any at all).</p>

<p>The last section contains two major errors. One is that when an Arabic woman gets married her second (last) name is NOT changed, women keep their last names. Second is the example given where the woman's name changes to: something Abdul. Classic mistake, Abdul is not a name, it's part of a name it literally means "servant of" and must be followed by a name of God. Someone may be called Abdul-Rahman (more accurately Abd-el-Rahman). I made two adjustments, Yasmin gets to keep her name, and Abdul is renamed Adel.</p>

<p>the Tughra or Sultan's monogram was a specifically Turkish (Oghuz Turkic) invention, and was likely derived from the design of the "tamgha"s (brands) of the Oghuz (Turkmen) tribes, although it used arabic calligraphy. AFAIK the Tughra reads "al-muZaffar" not just "muZaffar"</p>

"The daughter also follows the same custom but after marriage she takes her husband's first name as her second part of her name"</p>
<p>I think there's some error here .. what I know is that women don't change their name after marriage in arabic traditions/hisory (even now in most arabic countries) ... ie she keeps her original name, this is true before and after islam .. if somebody can correct this in the original article, it would be nice .. or if it's true can some examples of famous characters be given (on the other hand, every famous woman in arabic or islamic history I am aware of, is example to support what I stated)</p>
<p>Thanks --86.16.113.121 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Your right about the fact that the woman that gets married actually keeps her name. I tried fixing that before, but apparantly someone changed it back to the old WRONG version, again if you have any issues with what is up there talk over it over here first.</p>
