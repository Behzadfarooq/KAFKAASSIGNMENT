<p>Dear Aranel,</p>
<p>I am requesting arbitration because you have removed my contribution to <a href="../../../f/a/v/Favicon.html" title="Favicon">Favicon</a> article without good reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Removal of link to useful resource which gives information which you cannot find in article.</li>
<li>2. Removal of FAQ section. Reason: "I'm sorry, but the FAQ format is not appropriate to an encyclopedia". I was unable to find this in Wikipedia guidelines.</li>
<li>3. Removal of Troubleshooting section. Reason: "this is not a technical support site, after all" but article gives code and instructions on adding favicon to website. And if favicon doesn't work - it is extremely useful to know possible reasons!</li>
<li>4. You have removed my examples of favicons with your new images which are cropped and not so easy to understand as my examples was.</li>
<li>5. Removal of link to Icon Edtitor. There is note about about icon editors in article and it's normal and useful to have link to one of the editors.</li>
</ul>
<p>All my contributions were removed by fake reasons.</p>

<p>The only research I did was to check the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anno_Domini_11cb.html" title="Anno Domini">Anno Domini</a> article... There you will see that it is either 'AD yyyy' or 'yyyy BC' or 'yyyy CE', all without the dots. Following that convention we should use 'yyyy TA', (like I started to do until you gave me a hint). But, again, if JRRT used 'T.A. yyyy' who am I to disagree.... as long as whatever we use, we use it in a consistent manner.

<p>1. (I'm unsure if you're familiar with the site or not, so I'll assume you aren't for the sake of clarity) Go to Neopets and find the search bar on the bottom left. Search "Acara" and you will come up with several results. One of them is <b>Species</b>: Acara. Click on the link. A little window will pop up describing the species - the first sentence describes how they love to "live by the sea".</p>
<p>2. I'd like to add a paragraph on colors for every pet, yes, because not every pet can be painted the same colors. And not every redraw looks the same on every pet. (A Faerie Grundo is navy blue and has a starscape pattern on its wings, while a Faerie Acara is yellow and has pink wings. The Maraquan Korbat is like a manta ray, while the Maraquan Techo looks like a creature from the Black Lagoon, and so on.) It's also helpful if you're looking to see if a particular pet is neglected, or has less (or more) colors than a pet of its popularity might normally have, or any more of a multitude of things. I feel that a brief description of a pet's available colors is appropriate, and I'm willing to write it all myself. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPremeditated_Chaos_675b.html" title="User:Premeditated Chaos">PMC</a> 19:56, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>2. That's sort of what I meant. I guess I went a little overboard on the Acara, but how about basically saying how many colors a pet has, as well as naming one or two major redraws/novelties. (Pink Lenny being a flamingo, Poogles having two plushie variants, anything else of note) And then linking to Neocolours at the very bottom. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPremeditated_Chaos_675b.html" title="User:Premeditated Chaos">PMC</a> 23:26, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yay for consensus! ^_^ Um...nah, I don't mind updating the article once a week for new colors and stuff. It takes like two minutes, and I'll remember because I'm constantly on Neopets or Neocolours anyway.

That should be in the order "foo, x, Xyzzy" but is sorted "x, Xyzzy, foo" due to capital letters coming before lowercase and the word "articles" messing it all up.

<p>I like the idea, in principle. However, it is hard to draw a line between the 'mere' enjoyment of Tolkien's works and scholarly interpretation. I know I don't know when I crossed the line, if there is one. It makes sense to have a place to get an overview of scientific literature about Tolkien. I would still like to keep an overview of the linguistic publication landscape at <a href="../../../l/a/n/Languages_of_Middle-Earth_37d8.html" title="Languages of Middle-Earth">Languages of Middle-Earth</a>, and at least a reference to the scattered "<a href="../../../e/l/f/Elfcon.html" title="Elfcon">Elfcon</a>"-publications near Tolkien's bibliography (since it's about texts written by him, after all). I don't have an overview of all the "Middle-Earth" categories on Wikipedia. Somehow they look as if the were just heaped on top of one another. So yes, I think there should be a scholarly category, but maybe there should be a wikiproject to discuss the whole structure of Tolkien related stuff on WP (or is there one, already?) As to the name, <i>middangeard</i>, <i>midgard</i> means the world inhabited by humans, between the upper and the nether worlds. In Tolkien, Middle-Earth is the inhabitable continent between the far East and the far West. Therefore, I think "Middle Earth scholarship" would be scholarship that takes place in Middle-Earth (i.e. <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pengolodh.html" title="Pengolodh">Pengolodh</a> etc.); I think "Tolkien scholarship" would be preferable for what you intend, because as soon as you begin to analyse Tolkiens work, you will of course leave the fiction and try to follow the development of Tolkiens mind, both before and after the concept of Middle-Earth had become fixed or central. Of course, scrictly speaking, "Middle-Earth" is overused already ("Middle-Earth languages" would unnaturally exclude the language of Aman, and Adunaic). "Languages of Arda" are not satisfying, either, because of JRRT's insistence that Arda <i>is</i> <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>. "Languages invented by Tolkien" is a bit prosaic, I admit, and I understand the preference to "stay inside secondary creation" as much as possible (though many aspect of Tolkien's work cannot be discussed without resorting to their "primary creation" genesis... Briefly, I may be overly pedantic, and the Category is certainly a good idea! <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 09:02, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aranel, or should I say Sarah?, I was wondering and I mean that in the truest sense of the word...because I clearly know nothing about Tolkien compared to many of you fellow wikipedians who are doing some of the most noble work on these articles...could you answer/comment on a couple of questions for me? 1. What would you recommend I read next? I've read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion. 2. in the article, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgoth.html" title="Morgoth">Morgoth</a>, I was wondering, there is a point in the Characteristics section that explains that Sauron is actually more powerful than Morgoth? Is that true? It seems contradictory to the fact(that I believe I read somewhere here on wikipedia) Illuvatar's (probably wrong spelling) most powerful creation was Morgoth... Can you comment and straighten me out on these? Thanks in advance! --<a href="../../../j/p/i/User%7EJpittman_00d7.html" title="User:Jpittman">Jpittman</a> 02:52, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>thanks 'Sarah'...now you didn't have to go all the way to revert all the changes and edits i made about 'Middle-earth', THAT PAGE DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU, i was simply trying to better what was already there, what's wrong with you?! geee i'm sorry about all this yelling...i just felt like doing that... now you may be annoyed that i just wrote on your page... actually, not only annoying but angry.... =] i apologize...and i'm sure that you'll take no time in editing this part out huh~ btw, what you wrote was not all truth...the 7 sons of Feanor did not die until late in the War of the Ring, certainly all of them have survived long enough to enjoy some peace...</p>
<p>and Melkor was NOT exiled...he was driven out and cast into the void....</p>
<p>the straight road was not 'impassable by all but the elves..' it was clearly written in the Silmarillion that SOME mortals did find the way to Valinor and looked upon the Light of the Undying Land then died.'</p>
<p>not only were the Elves to return to the west, all the rings of power ended as well. BUT THE TRUTH WAS NOT FORGOTTEN, as long as their kingdoms shall last...</p>
<p>k this ends my lil shout-out...again i apologize, but it's really annoying when i corrected a few details and improve some of the wording then you IMMEDIATELY undid almost everything...</p>

<p>Hi Sarah - I noticed you're adding some birth/death by year categories. I recently suggested to <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocu_0014.html" title="User:Docu">user:docu</a> that we start using a template for these categories, see <a href="../../../d/6/_/User_talk%7ED6_9bac.html" title="User talk:D6">user talk:d6</a>. Docu's created a template, <a href="../../../b/i/r/Template%7EBirthyr_bac5.html" title="Template:Birthyr">template:birthyr</a>, which you reference like this {{birthyr|year|decade}}, where year is the year number (e.g. 1582) and decade is the decade (e.g. 1580). I believe Docu intends to run a bot to create these categories, but I don't know if he/she intends to edit already created categories. There's a deathyr template as well, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Template%7EDeathyr_c277.html" title="Template:Deathyr">template:deathyr</a>, with slightly different usage (e.g. {{deathyr|158|2}} for <a href="../../../1/5/8/Category%7E1582_deaths.html" title="Category:1582 deaths">category:1582 deaths</a>). Before instituting massive use of these templates we should agree on the referencing syntax (and birthyr and deathyr should clearly have the SAME syntax). I think it would be possible to create similar templates for the birth/death by decade categories as well. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> 19:43, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Sarah!</p>
<p>Why have you removed link to CATCount - useful freeware program for translators: results of several months of coding in 3 seconds after it has been added? Is that was enough time to estimate its usability to users? Are you a translator yourself?</p>

<p>I've been trying to comprehend the mess that <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETranslation_4abe.html" title="Talk:Translation">Talk:translation</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/v/Talk%7EFavicon_3a07.html" title="Talk:Favicon">Talk:favicon</a>, and <a href="../../../v/i/t/User_talk%7EVitaly_a2f4.html" title="User talk:Vitaly">User_talk:Vitaly</a> have become. Vitaly's request for arbitration was rejected by arbcom. You can <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAr_9ea1.html" title="WP:RFAr">request arbitration</a> against Vitaly if you desire; it's probably the best place to turn, as arbcom decisions are binding and enforced. But I don't know if you'll be accepted. As I see it you have done everything required to ask for an arbitration; you talked to Vitaly, you brought in 3rd parties with the RfC. But I'm not an arbitrator, so I don't know. You could try <a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERfM_d120.html" title="WP:RfM">requesting medaition</a>, but this isn't an edit war - it's more of a personal disagreement and seems to be more arbitration-worthy. Read through <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution</a> for more info.</p>
<p>However, your actions on <a href="../../../f/a/v/Favicon.html" title="Favicon">Favicon</a> weren't nearly perfect; when you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Favicon&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=6884125" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Favicon&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=6884125" rel="nofollow">removed</a> the now-contentious Troubleshooting section, you masked it with a different edit summary for other edits you did. You should watch that in the future; use longer summaries or split up the edit into two steps, summarizing both.</p>
<p>I hope this helps; if you have any questions or need help with mediation or arbitration, I'll do what I can - but I'm trying not to take sides.

<dd>Sorry if it appeared I was accusing you of a cover-up; I was just trying to point out that arb or mediation could get messy. If you don't want to have a side, then just step out now; leave the articles as they are and <a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">walk away</a>. But if you feel strongly about the talk: messages then <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> is what you should do. I think the issue may be past simple discussion - if you want anything you'll have to go to DR. <a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhosyourjudas_77b8.html" title="User:Whosyourjudas">Whosyourjudas</a> <a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWhosyourjudas_2b20.html" title="User talk:Whosyourjudas">(talk)</a> 04:03, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you. Maybe you want to put in a word for some of the things removed by <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteuard_a577.html" title="User:Steuard">User:Steuard</a> a few hours later? (<i>Several changes, notably removals: speculation about speaking animals, weak Narnia parallel, unenlightening Bombadil non-connection</i>) I think none of them deserved removal, but the article would have needed rearrangement to accommodate the material comfortably. I can think of no more appropriate place to treat the ideas of Creation in Tolkien, and the "Tom Bombadil is God" idea keeps popping up, so it's useful to have Tolkien's answer to that. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 09:17, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good luck with the admin nomination. I'm sorry that I had to vote Neutral, but I wanted to assure you that it was not due to your work on the project at all, but simply a matter of timing. Keep up the good work. (Just reading <i>Return of the King</i> for the first time since I was 15, and it's an entirely different book when you've studied Medieval stuff, and particularly Anglo-Saxon. Fascinating to me that the heavily Anglo-Saxon code didn't alienate me when I was a lad.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:06, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
