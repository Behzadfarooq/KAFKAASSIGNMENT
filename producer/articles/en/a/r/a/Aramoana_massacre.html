<p>Gray's spree began when he shot his neighbour Gary Holden's dogs. Holden confronted Gray after he had done this. The argument escalated and Gray went to his house, retrieved the rifle he had used on the dogs and shot Holden. At this point Gray proceeded to enter Holden's property; he discovered Holden's daughter, Chiquita, and wounded her with a shot that entered through her shoulder and into her stomach. Chiquita fled to the home of a friend, Julie Ann Bryson, on the way discovering her father lying on the ground face down surrounded in blood. Bryson telephoned emergency services; realising her daughter Rewa, and Chiquita's sister, Jasmine were still in the Holden house, drove her van there with Chiquita in an attempt to save them. Gray shot at the van as it passed the house, which was now ablaze.</p>
<p>At this point Gray started shooting indiscriminately, first killing Vanessa Percy, as she ran down the street in terror, then killing two young boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, received severe wounds to her abdomen. Ross Percy (the children's father, who had been driving them home when he stopped to investigate the fire at the Holden house) and Alec Tali were the next to be shot and killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another local, Vic Crimp. The next victims were Jim Dickson and Chris Cole, who died later in hospital.</p>
<p>Police then arrived, in the form of <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Chalmers_97c4.html" title="Port Chalmers">Port Chalmers</a> officer Sergeant <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stewart_Graeme_Guthrie_ad15.html" title="Stewart Graeme Guthrie">Stewart Guthrie</a>. Guthrie located Gray and fired a warning shot. Gray shouted "don't shoot!", leading Guthrie to believe Gray was surrendering. However Gray suddenly opened fire, killing Guthrie instantly with a shot to the head.</p>
<p>Minutes later the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armed_Offenders_Squad_ef79.html" title="Armed Offenders Squad">Armed Offenders Squad</a> began to arrive (with the Special Tactics Group, or Anti Terrorist Squad as it was then known, arriving soon after), sealing off the town (<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Police_c55d.html#Arms" title="New Zealand Police">New Zealand's uniformed police officers do not usually carry firearms</a>). The situation was especially dangerous as Gray had a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telescopic_sight.html" title="Telescopic sight">scope</a> atop his rifle (a Norinco .223 AK derivative), making him accurate even at a long range. In the early hours of the morning of the 14th, the Special Tactics Group began to move into Aramoana, searching houses. Gray was finally located - he had entered a house and fallen asleep overnight - and <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tear_gas.html" title="Tear gas">tear gas</a> thrown into the house he occupied. Gray ran out of the house, gun blazing, shouting "Kill me, kill me, you bastards!" The police returned fire and shot Gray five times, hitting his head and chest and killing him almost instantly <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. His death has since come to be regarded as an example of <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_by_cop.html" title="Suicide by cop">suicide by cop</a> <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup>,</sup> <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Rewa Bryson and Jasmine Holden's charred bodies were found in what remained of the Holden family home. Gray had killed 13 victims, leaving the town of Aramoana devastated.</p>
<p>Due to the serious nature of the incident, and concerns that the Police may be unable to contain the situation, a contingency plan involving the activation of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Special_Air_Service_e115.html" title="New Zealand Special Air Service">SAS</a> was discussed by Police commanders, to the extent of putting the Regiment on alert. NZ law prohibits the use of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Army_e739.html" title="New Zealand Army">Army</a> for law enforcement without the express approval of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_2cf9.html" title="Prime Minister">Prime Minister</a> (who must then report to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">Parliament</a> at the earliest opportunity), and Police were able to resolve the situation before deployment became necessary. Aramoana is the only time in NZ's history that the SAS has been placed on stand-by to potentially respond to an internal incident.</p>

<p>David Gray's mental and physical state worsened in the months leading up to the attack and in retrospect it is suggested he may have been afflicted by <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizophrenia.html" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. There was some evidence of a progressive decline in his mental state before the shootings, as he alienated his few friends with paranoid accusations and became increasingly unkempt in appearance.</p>
<p>It has also been suggested that Gray was influenced by the literature he read, in particular books by American author <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Saxon_c380.html" title="Kurt Saxon">Kurt Saxon</a>. Many other books in his collection revolved around themes of <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun.html" title="Gun">guns</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivalism.html" title="Survivalism">survivalism</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence.html" title="Violence">violence</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Aramoana_massacre.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>Three days after the incident, Gray's house at 27 Muri Street was set on fire by unknown persons, and allowed to burn to the ground.</p>
<p>The incident indirectly resulted in an amendment to New Zealand's firearms regulations in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>; this was essentially a tightening of gun control in the country. Many of the officers involved in ending the siege received Gallantry Awards, Sergeant Guthrie receiving a posthumous <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cross_4a7c.html" title="George Cross">George Cross</a>. A memorial to the victims was erected in the town.</p>

<p>A movie based on the Aramoana massacre, <i><a href="../../../o/u/t/Out_of_the_Blue_%282006_film%29_0eb5.html" title="Out of the Blue (2006 film)">Out of the Blue</a></i>, directed by Robert Sarkies, premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_12.html" title="September 12">September 12</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>
<p>The production faced some opposition from the town, and as a result, little filming was done in Aramoana itself, though the community did allow some scenes to be shot in the settlement. Residents of Aramoana agreed to have the movie filmed, but only if the title of the movie was not 'Aramoana,' and if they were to see the movie beforehand.</p>
<p>The film is co-produced by Sydney-based Tim White, of Southern Light Films, and Steven O'Meagher, of Desert Road. Wellington's Graeme Tetley, who worked on the mini-series <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bread_and_Roses_%28film%29_a33a.html" title="Bread and Roses (film)">Bread and Roses</a>, is a co-writer with Sarkies.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutton_Birds_0f1b.html" title="Mutton Birds">Mutton Birds</a> refer obliquely to the Aramoana massacre in the song <i>A Thing Well Made</i> on their self-titled debut album. The song is narrated by a man who owns a sporting goods store in Christchurch. As the song closes he describes his work for the day, which involves sending "one of those AK-47s for some collector down the line." Dunedin band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chills_0bed.html" title="The Chills">The Chills</a> more directly address the Aramoana incident in the song "Strange Case" from the 1992 album <a href="../../../s/o/f/Soft_Bomb_76fe.html" title="Soft Bomb">Soft Bomb</a>.</p>
