<p>I hope the changes I've made thus far (and probably will continue to make) don't mess up any of the fine contributions others have made to this article. My dad had surgery last week for an arachnoid cyst, and the night before surgery was the first time I'd even heard the term. As a rare disease, according to <a href="http://www.rarediseases.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.rarediseases.org/" rel="nofollow">NORD</a>, it seems difficult to get credible information on the subject. With more common diseases like <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lung_cancer.html" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a>, the facts are easier for most of us to sort out from hype, hearsay and unsupported statistics. In my experience, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googling.html" title="Googling">Googling</a> results in general information and endless anecdotes that confuse or scare the reader.</p>
<p>As a result, I feel very strongly about two things with this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>We must define medical jargon</b>. It's great if a Wikipedia or Wiktionary article is available and can be linked. If not, or as a supplement, use a brief inline definition. Chances are, the readers most interested in this topic will know very little medical terminology. And chances are, the editors compiling information for the article will be summarizing text geared toward the medical community, not laypersons.</li>
<li><b>We must cite sources for <i>all</i> assertions</b>, or tag with the {{fact}} template. This is <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_Guidelines_b30f.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and Guidelines">official policy</a> (see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> for more), but Wikipedia articles containing common knowledge might simply list a few references at the end. Perhaps once this article enters a more finalized state we can simplify the references. For time being, however, facts from the <a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/arachnoid_cysts/arachnoid_cysts.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/arachnoid_cysts/arachnoid_cysts.htm" rel="nofollow">NINDS info page</a>, for instance, are commingled with various unsourced statements. I think we need nothing less than &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; tags, leading to an appropriate source, <i>for each distinct fact</i>. I don't think this will result in an inordinate amount of work. As you can see in <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Wikipedia:Footnotes</a>, citing a single article multiple times doesn't involve an excessive amount of typing. If silly-looking footnotes become the biggest problem with this page, we'll be in great shape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, feel free to critique away regarding my choice of references.&#160;;-) They aren't necessarily the best, but were authoritative sources I could find on <a href="../../../p/u/b/PubMed_05d8.html" title="PubMed">PubMed</a><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and stated in abstracts. I hope to do actual library research soon so I can provide better references, and would welcome any and all improvements/suggestions. I'll take suggestions, but I'd hope that each interested person can follow the <a href="../../../b/o/l/Wp%7Ebold.html" title="Wp:bold">wp:bold</a> guideline and apply his or her own contributions and edits.</p>
<p>I hope this rambling comment doesn't imply that I'm dictating anything here. I do have strong opinions, but wouldn't have bothered stating them here if I didn't value the feedback of others who also have opinions on the subject. My goal is to produce an excellent, informative article. If you believe there's a better way for us to make that happen, I'm open to any ideas and suggestions.</p>
<p>Here's a general outline of things I want to see from this artice:</p>
<ul>
<li>A structure that follows similar diseases. I don't entirely know what this means yet. I've reviewed several disease articles on Wikipedia and have unsurprisingly found many variations. Some diseases whose layout looked interesting: <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillain-Barr%C3%A9_syndrome_9244.html" title="Guillain-Barré syndrome">Guillain-Barré syndrome</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardiovascular_disease.html" title="Cardiovascular disease">Cardiovascular disease</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_sclerosis.html" title="Multiple sclerosis">Multiple sclerosis</a></li>
<li>A brief inline anatomy primer with some diagrams/pictures, maybe even example MRIs.</li>
<li>Treatment thoroughly fleshed out. For instance, how is the <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunt_%28medical%29.html" title="Shunt (medical)">shunt</a> implanted, and where does it drain? This seems to vary, and I want to provide information about the variations and why they might occur.</li>
<li>Break out risk factors (or causes, if known) from symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for all the contributions to the article up to this point, and thanks in advance for all the future contributions!</p>

<p>The new structure looks good. I've found a few bits about prevalence and structure but am not sure the reference format I've used is the same as yours. Feel free to change them to match yours.</p>
<p>My son has just been dagnosed with A.C.'s. I think we share a layman's interest in the subject which will help to translate the medi-jargon and produce a useful Wiki-page.</p>
<p>I'll try to contribute more.</p>

<p>Gee Dave, I've been doing research on Arachnoid Cysts for 17 years now. And I started arachnoidcyst.org<a href="http://arachnoidcyst.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://arachnoidcyst.org" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> in order to help people navigate this never ending nightmare known as an "asymptomatic" problem which is more likely an auto immune degenerative disease with not enough research going into this mess. Sorry about your son. Catherine Clay... 34 years fighting and 17 of them known. --Ceclay 01:51, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the contributions and interest, Dave! Sorry to hear about your son's diagnosis. Hopefully our contributions can help others in the future that are affected by this disease.</p>

<p>I just found <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28Medicine-related_articles%29_6a2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Medicine-related articles)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Medicine-related articles)</a>, which is an excellent guide that--surprise--was way ahead of my ideas. I was pleased to see that some things, such as avoiding medical jargon, were already emphasized, though I'm sure many others have created articles without an awareness of this guide. I'm going to do some basic work to make the headings consistent with the recommended medical article styles, but expect to take a bit before I get the content in order.</p>
<p>I'm now researching in more depth, and have buried myself in information on arachnoid cysts. I'm currently at a point of still trying to glean the facts from all this data, and expect to take some time to group these together in a way that will best flow as an article. My biggest struggle is figuring out how to give appropriate coverage to both <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intracranial.html" title="Intracranial">intracranial</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertebral_column.html" title="Vertebral column">spinal</a> arachnoid cysts. At this point they seem to be very different beasts: they are both accumulations of <a href="../../../c/e/r/Cerebrospinal_fluid.html" title="Cerebrospinal fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a> formed in pockets of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arachnoid_membrane.html" title="Arachnoid membrane">arachnoid membrane</a>, but the causes, symptoms, and treatment vary. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marfan_syndrome.html" title="Marfan syndrome">Marfan syndrome</a> is primarily/exclusively associated with spinal cysts. (Still researching this.)</li>
<li>Literature seems to mention symptoms such as depression for arachnoid cysts, yet closer examination (and common sense) indicate this symptom is exclusive to intracranial cysts. Both spinal and intracranial cysts can cause paralysis, but intracranial cysts are [obviously] associated with behavioral issues.</li>
<li>Spinal cysts seem to primarily affect the 50+ crowd, whereas intracranial cysts are more common in infants and yet affect people of all ages. (again, still working out the facts on this)</li>
<li>It seems spinal cysts are treated by draining or excision, whereas intracranial cysts are treated by draining or shunting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whew, I wasn't planning to write a research paper, but it seems that's what I'm doing... - <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintote_b2cc.html" title="User:Quintote">Quintote</a> 23:01, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Quintote: Just visited the page after a while. Mightily impressed by the work you've done. How about removing that "Clean Up" tag now? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerby_Dave_3f01.html" title="User:Derby Dave">Derby Dave</a> 18:49, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks! I'll go ahead and do that. I'm not putting the time towards this I was hoping, but I still have grand plans of adding a lot more info to this article. I'm reading through and highlighting hundreds of pages of journal articles and textbook pages, making notes. <i>-<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintote_b2cc.html" title="User:Quintote">Quintote</a> 00:26, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
