<p>The word "Arabic", pronounced "Arabi" in Arabic, comes from the extended word: "Al-Rabi" ..which means: "The Teachings" or "From Teachings", hence "Rabi" for Teacher in Hebrew.</p>

<p>I read the second paragraph and couldn't find fault with it - it is clear and lucid. What is bothering you about it?</p>
<hr />
<p>Setting up a separate page for each sound of the Arabic language seems really excessive. All the necessary information can easily be kept on a single page. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a></p>
<hr />
<p>It's going to be a fairly major project to fill in all the concepts in Islam or the Arabic culture that don't translate directly into English (now all listed).</p>
<p>Spelling deserves a note: I have used a single coherent spelling scheme here that comes all from one book. Older spellings <a href="../../../u/l/e/Ulema.html" title="Ulema">ulema</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarika.html" title="Tarika">tarika</a> (for ulama and tariqa using the new spellings) come from a book 20 years older. A native speaker of Arabic might be better to identify which spellings are more correct given the pronunciation. Rather than change them in this file, please use redirects for alternate spellings, as I am sure multiple spellings of some of these words are extant.</p>
<p>An important note: the term "Muslim" must replace "Moslem" or "Mohammedan" unless one is specifically quoting some text written by some English guy. I should probably have included "Mohammedan" as a 'just don't use it' word. I also could have (but didn't) mention that G. W. Bush made both gaffes in the speeches he made just after 9/11 - no wonder the Arabs won't join him now!!! What a moron.</p>

<p>When can one see a wikipedia in arabic language [[ar:]]&#160;??</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here <a href="../../../../ar/index.html" class="extiw" title="ar:">ar:</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>In a very popular Arabic language newspaper, there was an article today about wikipedia. The author of that article praised the extensive amount of information on this encyclopedia, but ended it by saying that its not available in Arabic. I think that this common mistake, among Arabic speaking people, can be fixed if there was a direct link from the encyclopedias homepage of www.wikipedia.org to the arabic version of ar.wikipedia.org . It might, also, help develop the number of Arabic articles, I've noticed that the Arabic articles are nowhere near as many, nor as detailed as the English version.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think "Arabic is a Semitic language, closely related to the Hebrew language. " can be abit misleading. While I concider both very beautiful languages, I think it rings abit like: "French is an indo-european language, closely related to Russian. ".<br />
Arabic and Hebrew has very different grammer, and very different phonology, for example, the one has noun case conjugations, while the later does not, tenses differ, etc</p>
<p>In fact, it's more like saying, "French is indo-european, closely related to spanish" -- while this is not particularly relevant, it's certainly correct. In fact (according to the classification of SIL, which is fairly standard, <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=3" class="external free" title="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=3</a> ), Arabic and Hebrew are both southern central semitic languages. "Central" semitic contrasts with Southern (Ethiopian, 'South Arabic' (which is *not* Arabic, viz. 'Arabic' is here a geographic, not a linguistic specifier) and with (extinct) Akkadian. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">Dbachmann</a> 11:25, 23 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>"Due to the great rift between the Colloquial and the Literary Arabic, Salman Masalha, former professor of Arab Literature Department of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, states regarding <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illiteracy.html" title="Illiteracy">illiteracy</a> in the Arab world: "I say that it is over 80%. Practically speaking, even those defined as not illiterate because they completed eight years of schooling, I consider illiterate. In this century, anyone who finishes elementary school can't really read." <a href="http://memri.org/bin/latestnews.cgi?ID=SD68804" class="external autonumber" title="http://memri.org/bin/latestnews.cgi?ID=SD68804" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>" Given that, as an Israeli citizen, there are very few Arab countries he can even visit legally, this statement lacks credibility. Nor is it supported by the CIA world factbook literacy figures, and it contradicts the evidence of my own eyes - comprehension of literary Arabic has massively increased in recent decades due to TV (including dubbed cartoons), and even small children can generally understand the standard language quite well by the age of 11, if not much earlier. I have removed it. - Mustafa, April 5 2004.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Their mutual comprehensibility is very limited. The reason behind the vast differences in spoken languages or dialects of the groups mentioned herewith is that they are mixes of many languages. Ancient languages spoken by non-Arab population of these countries continue to survive in the dialects/languages of everyday life and the roots of the older languages of the Phoenician, Aramaic, Syriac, Assyrian, Coptic...etc. are still evident. [1]" As anyone following Lebanese politics will be aware, the question of the origin of the dialects is highly political in Lebanon, where the guy quoted is based; and, while phoenicia.org contains some good historical info, it is no authority on linguistics. This should be replaced with a better quote. Oh, and "mixes of many languages" is not even controversial among linguists; it's false. Many Arabic dialects are full of words taken from other languages, but "<a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_language.html" title="Mixed language">mixed language</a>" implies considerably more than that in linguistics; the only universally agreed-upon <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_language.html" title="Mixed language">mixed language</a> seems to be <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michif.html" title="Michif">Michif</a>. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 03:41, 8 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>also, we need a transliteration scheme. over at <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Fadlan_b4e8.html" title="Ibn Fadlan">Ibn Fadlan</a>, I used standard transliteration, using the Latin Extended Additional (1e00) codepage (underdots). This page (or the grammar page) needs to explain the sounds and how they are transliterated.</p>
<p>I suggest we list the sounds in a nice table, putting arab letters, standard transliteration and ascii schemes and whatnot next to each other, so that people can be referred here if there is a transliteration issue anywhere.</p>
<p>alright, I realize such a table (using 1e00-transliteration) is at <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_alphabet.html" title="Arabic alphabet">Arabic alphabet</a> (other transliteration schemes, such as Buckwalter ascii, should be added and discussed).

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Translation doubts</span></h3>
<p>I read in the article: <i>"however, a much more significant factor for most dialects is, as among Romance languages, retention (or change of meaning) of different classical forms. Thus Iraqi aku, Levantine fiih, and North African kayen all mean "there is", and all come from Arabic (yakuun, fiihi, kaa'in respectively), but now sound very different."</i> I have some doubts about the meaning of this: 1. What do you mean about "retention" = change of meaning - is that true? 2. If retention is the change of meaning of a classical form, what were the original meaning of three words in the example? If it is the same ("there is") where are the change of meaning?</p>

<dd>Unless things changed drastically since I've been in the Arab world, I did not know that "we" called them both <i>fus'ha</i>, but rather that <i>al-Lughatu al-Arabiyyatu ul-Fus'ha</i> is the Arabic language as it was literally used in the "classical age," specifically by the people of the Hijaz and Mecca, and especially as it appears, in vocabulary and gramar, in the Quran. To my knowledge, the Modern Standard Arabic is called <i>al-Arabiyyatu al-Mubassatah</i>, that is Simplified Arabic.

<p>fwiiw, <i>English</i> distinguishes 'Quranic', 'Classical' and 'Standard' Arabic. And they <i>are</i> quite different, of course. Read the Quran. Read a newspaper.

<dd>The Arabic numerals used in the West and thoughout the modern world are not the Hindi derived numerals but are actually an Arab invention based on the concept of numbers which the Arabs acquired from Indian texts. Having said that, there are Arab numerals which are derived from Hindi and they are the ones used in Arab countries east of Libya, and the Arabs do actually refer to them as Hindi numerals. However, no one in the West will be even familiar with these.</dd>

<dd>sure, that's what we mean. The Arabs took them from the Indians, the European took them from the Arabs. (plus, their shapes changed somewhat, in the process). This is why we call them arabic numerals, while they are really (originally) indian numerals. This is just what the article is alluding to. Of course it is slightly off-topic anyway, as it's not directly about the arabic language. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 19:38, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>No. Sculpting was originally an Egyptian thing, but we cannot say that a French sculpture is Egyptian because the idea of sculpting is originally Egyptian. Similarly, the concept of using 9 digits only to represent various numbers is suppsedly Indian, and the Arabs became familiar with it when Ibn al-Muqaffa found it in Sanskrit texts when he traveled to study India on orders of the Caliph. The Arabs later developed the Hindi numerlas which are still used in the Arab east, and they refer to them as such. In the Arab west a new set of numbers were developed which have not much resemblence to the ones used in the Arab east, and are reportedly based on the number of angles used to form a numeral indicating the value of the number digit. These Arabic numerals were later adopted in the West and further stylized to give us the modern numerlas we all use today. The Zero is an Arab invention of the Abbassid era to give a visual clue to the "emtpy space" in the place value system. Before that, a number would only have empty spaces and the reader could not easily differentiate between 1, 10, 1000, or 21, 201, 2001 and so on, since the spaces depended on the specific hand writing style of the writer. A Zero, an "emtpy", was developed to fill in the gap. Again, in the Arab east this was in the form of a dot "." but in the Arab west the form of a zero was a circle since it has no angles.<a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.Khalil_a8d8.html" title="User:A.Khalil">A.Khalil</a> 19:59, Jan 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A Khalil, your account supra does not match what I have read on the issue. First, my understanding has always been the 'Maghrebine' numerals - which the West adopted as Arabic via Italo-Tunisian contacts - were the original form (themselves based off of an Indian form); the modern charqi numbers as used in the machreq were adopted seperately, again based off of but modifying Indian forms. Your account of the zero also seems off. While my understanding may be wrong, I'd like to know your sourcing, I presume Levantine.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arabic in IPA transcription</span></h2>
<p>It's good to have the phonology table in IPA. My version (1999) of the IPA handbook uses ˁ to indicate pharyngealization: I wonder if the article should follow suit. I changed the transcription of the voiced pharyngeal fricative (`ayn) to ʕ from ʔ, which seems to make more sense. However, the handbook suggests that a pharyngealized glottal stop, ʔˁ, would be a better transcription of `ayn. This simply doesn't make sense to me (you should hear me trying to pronounce it in different ways!).

<p>I'm puzzled by this statement on p.53 of the 1999 IPA handbook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/ʕ/ is a Retracted Tongue Root glottal stop. This realization is supported by Gairdner (1925), Al-Ani (1970) and Kästner (1981) as well as extensive observation of a range of speakers from different regional origins residing in Kuwait at present (1990). Nowhere have we observed a pharyngeal fricative.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">planning on rearranging arabic language articles</span></h2>
<p>the current situation is rather a mess. in particular, much of stuff just called "arabic" refers to classical arabic; that stuff doesn't distinguish modern-standard, koran, etc. the main "arabic language" article talks somewhat about all arabic varieties and somewhat about MSA. etc.</p>
<p>I propose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generic "Arabic foo" articles should be applicable to *all* varieties, both formal and colloquial.</li>
<li>Stuff relevant to all and only the formal varieties should go under "Formal Arabic ..."; stuff relevant to all and only the colloquial varieties should go under "Colloquial Arabic ..."; stuff relevant to some specific variety should go under an article of that name ("Koranic Arabic", etc.).</li>
<li>I have chosen the names Formal and Colloquial purposely. Written vs. Spoken is not very accurate: MSA is spoken quite a lot, and some "spoken" dialects (e.g. Egyptian) are written. The distinction is properly of diglossia, and hence Formal vs. Colloquial is exactly correct. In a radio interview, for example, the speakers may start out in pure spoken MSA but gradually introduce more and more elements of colloquial speech as the level of formality drops. Literary is not any more correct than Written. Fusha is not good because (1) it's a foreign-language term; (2) it is closely associated with a political (i.e. non-linguistic) view that MSA, Koranic, etc. are all exactly the same, which isn't the case; (3) there is no similar term for Colloquial Arabic. ("Darija" is Moroccan-only, for example.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to start this in a few days, barring objections. In the process of doing this, I'll rewrite/expand stuff as needed.</p>

<p>"MSA" and "Qur'anic" Arabic are of course different in some ways; no one denies that. But that misses the point - which is that they are <i>far</i> more similar to one another than either is to any of the "dialects", and are considered by their users to be little more than different stylistic registers of the language they learn at school. The idea that these are the same language is not political, it's common sense, on a par with calling King James Bible English and 20th-century media English the same language. Colloquial Arabic, dialectal Arabic, Fusha, Classical Arabic, are all fine, being widely used terms - but Formal Arabic, as a label for Fusha, strikes me as something of a neologism, descriptively accurate but not appropriate as an article title (only <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22formal+arabic%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22formal+arabic%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">642 ghits</a>.)

<dd>Contra Mustafaa, it is typical for non-Arab scholars without a religious reason to group Quranic and MSA together, not to. The attitude that they are "little more than different stylistic registers" is something of an Muslim/Arab conceit and while it should be acknowledged, equally it is not the view adopted by most scholars of the language without a religious motivation for asserting their sameness. Registering the difference is appropriatley acknowleding a serious diff. in usage and form between modern and archaic (as ironically between the archaic language of KJV and modern English usage - obviously the degree is a bit of judgement).

<p>I have read both comments written by CG above and I'm confused by them. It seems that CG wants to have his/her cake and eat it too. In the first comment CG seems to wonder why Arabic is an official language in Israel, if Israel was, apparently, not in the "sopken in" list. Then, cg seems to be offended by the notion that a language of "small minorities" should become an official language of that country. Then in the second comment CG want to delete the entire sentence regarding Arabic being a language of a minority in some countries. How very big of you cg. But wait, this seemingly progressive thougnt is followed by a call to imperialism. By which I mean CG's insistance that we change the lands of the Arabic language from the very appropiate "Arab World" to the euro-centric "Middle East". Well CG Arabic is an official language in Israel becuase the government of that country has deemed it so, if you are offended by that you should take it up with the them. I think its great that the 1.26 million Arab Israeli's have their native language as an official language.(see the CIA world fact book) Also, besides the Arab minorty (20%) some of the Jewish population does speak that language making the entire population of Arabic speakers close to 30%. As regarding your second comment of "Middle East" vs. "Arab World" its a no-brainer: the "Arab World" all the way. The "Middle East" was a term concoted by imperial Europe during its hay day to differentiate between the "far" and "near/middle" easts. What does it exactly include? Who the hell knows. Generally it the countries of the penisula and Iran (which does not include Arabic as an official language), sometimes Afghanistan and Pakistan have been thrown into the mix (and again niether of these two muslim countries have Arabic as an official language). The "Arab World" is a much viable option because it was coined by arabs (not europeans) and it includes, as its name suggests, all the countries where Arabic is perdominantly spoken. So the heading should definatly read "Arab World". If some of wikipedia'a readers are, again offended by this, then we can add "and other countries". After all there are arabs spread all over the globe thanks to the Palestinian Diaspora.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arabic status in Malta</span></h2>
<p>While the Maltese language is related to Arabic, no Maltese speaker would consider Arabic and Maltese to be the same. Arabic is taught as a <i>foreign</i> language in Maltese schools, and has zero official status within Malta. Consider also that Polish and Russian are far more closely related, yet are regarded as distinct languages. I have edited the infobox accordingly, and removed the reference to Malta. <a href="../../../r/h/i/User%7ERhialto_3647.html" title="User:Rhialto">Rhialto</a> 13:07, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems to me that you are speaking of "classical Arabic". Maltese is an Arabic dialect (<i>darja</i>) quite like Tunisian Arabic, Algerian Arabic, Moroccan Arabic and so on. The only difference lies in a political-ideological approach: the latter countries consider themselves as a part of the Arabic world and stress this link by adopting an official language which nobody speaks as a mother-tongue, while Maltese aren't concerned by this question and plainly use their dialect as an official language, without wondering about its external ties. --<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVermondo_cbd1.html" title="User:Vermondo">Vermondo</a> 12:30, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>its amazing to see Pakistan not in the list of arabic speaking comm.<br />

<li>people who have worked in middle east know arabic</li>
<li>in "madrassah's" there are always few teacher in each madrassah who knows arabic.</li>
<li>here in Pakistan we can do masters in arabic (many universities offer courses in arabic)</li>

<dd>The first point, about people who have worked in the Middle East, is the strongest although even there many foreign workers in the Gulf will not learn Arabic but instead use their native language or English. The points about the madrassahs and MA degress, while interesting with respect to the culture of Pakistan, really aren't evidence that Pakistan is an Arabic-speaking country. Just think, for each of these "few teacher [sic] in each madrassah who knows [sic] arabic [sic]" how many people are there in the surrouinding communities who do not know Arabic? The ratio is probably on the order of 1:100 or 1:1,000. The final point about being able to get a Master's degree in Arabic or another langugage tells us something about universities in Pakistan, but almost nothing about the importance of these languages. One can get an MA in Estonian in the US, Swahili in Italy, Romanian in Korea, and Coptic in Germany but in none of these cases is this evidence that the language in question is widely spoken in the respective country.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../w/i/s/User%7EWisesabre_0349.html" title="User:Wisesabre">(WiseSabre|</a>, what you should do if you want to show that Pakistan is an Arabic-speaking country is provide some independent source that shows a significant percentage of Pakistanis speak Arabic. Wikipedia tends to use the 1% mark as a cut off. You shoud find a source that makes it clear whether the numbers apply to native speakers (and almost certainly less than 1% of the Pakistani count as native speakers or Arabic) or to non-native speakers (and here you might have more than 1% for Pakistan). If you find such a source, then I'm sure this page will be changed.<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua">Interlingua</a> 15:02, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arabic official status</span></h2>
<p>Egyptian Arabic is not legally co-official in Egypt; rather, there, as in most countries, the law makes no distinction between classical and colloquial Arabic, while only the former is valid for written government documents. Mauritania's official language is Arabic; Hassaniya is officially a national language. Nor does Arabic (or any other native language) enjoy official status in Mali or Senegal; rather, it is relegated to the rather less meaningful <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_language.html" title="National language">national language</a> category. see <a href="http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/afrique/afracc.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/afrique/afracc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/afrique/afracc.htm</a> for a detailed overview for each country, usually quoting relevant laws. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 20:20, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Which Transcription System to Use?</span></h2>
<p>I'm planning on writing some articles for the Arabic Language section. However, I'm in the process of deciding which transcription convention to use. I am well aware of my options for Arabic, but I wanted to get some discussion on the subject before I arbitrarily choose one. While the IPA is wonderful for linguistic publications, I'm not sure of its usefulness for an encyclopedia; to me, it seems a bit too technical. One has to know the linguistic terminology to figure out how to pronounce the word. I don't mean we shouldn't use it at all, I just wondering if a simpler alternative would be better (and would display on the screen without the boxes). Also, I realize that someone (or people) did a lot of work in transcribing in IPA for this section. I certainly do not want to re-do someone else's work, but I want to make the encyclopedia useful for everyone.</p>

We tend to use <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a> for pronunciations, and only occassionally for transliterations.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Terminology Clarification</span></h2>
<p>I've been reading the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_Language_cce2.html#Literary_and_Modern_Standard_Arabic" title="Arabic Language">Arabic Language#Literary and Modern Standard Arabic</a> article and noticed that the editor seems to have used conflicting terminology, although I'm sure that s/he understands the concepts very clearly. However, to a general, English-speaking audience, this may sound very confusing. For example, they use the term "Literary Arabic" alongside with "Modern Standard Arabic." Their description certainly leads one to believe that LA and MSA are one and the same. Shouldn't we adopt one or the other? Taking into account that MSA can be both written and spoken (depending on the occasion), which is more appropriate?</p>
<p>Also, most linguists have termed the language of the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> as Classical Arabic, as opposed to Literary Arabic (or Modern Standard Arabic). I would think that the differences between the two would be stylistic and lexical, due to word coining for modern concepts. So, should we consider MSA "separate" from Classical Arabic, although both may be اللغة العربية الفصحى?</p>
<p>I think it's imperative that we reach a consensus on this so we can minimize confusion on the part of our readers.</p>
<p><br />
I would like to thank whoever wrote this article; they obviously spent a lot of time doing it!!</p>

<dd>You're totally right Carmen. The thing is that there's no single editor and checking edits is not an easy job unless you are really dedicating your time to a few articles.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Which is more appropriate is using MSA (see definition at <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Standard_Arabic_f172.html" title="Modern Standard Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a>) as Literary Arabic and Classical Arabic are considered much more formal. You can compare MSA with <a href="../../../f/u/s/Fusha_%28language%29.html" title="Fusha (language)">Fusha (language)</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_Arabic_579f.html" title="Literary Arabic">Literary Arabic</a>. All of them are deserve to be mentioned here though we have to be careful as per your comments.
