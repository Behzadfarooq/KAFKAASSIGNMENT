<p>Hi, just wondering why most things are transliterated instead of written in arabic? Perhaps this is useful to linguists, but for arabic learners it is somewhat backwards. Would anyone mind if I added in the Arabic versions of the words and affixes? Do you have any preferences for how I format them (eg, arabic words with transliteration in parentheses)?</p>
<p>Good article though&#160;:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As this is an English article about the grammar of Arabic, and not about orthography, it would be a good idea to keep the romanized form first. Maybe something like <i>kitāb</i> (کتاب) "book" would be a good compromise. –<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonsafari_1c8d.html" title="User:Jonsafari">jonsafari</a> 23:20, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>IMHO relevant terms should not only be written in the transliterated version but also in Arabic script as to help with understanding Arabic grammar because I find it personally confusing (as well as difficult to read) if only the transliteration is available - even in the English Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../s/o/y/User%7ESoylentyellow_0465.html" title="User:Soylentyellow">Soylentyellow</a> 20:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Roman version is more useful for the general encyclopedia user (whether a linguist or not), and should in any case be kept. Those who are learning Arabic will want something more complete and systematic than the Wikipedia article, I suspect. The Roman form also lends itself better to showing both morphological ya-fʿal-u) and phonetic (yaf-ʿa-lu) patterns. And with my fonts and on my screen at least, both the letters themselves and the vowel points (<a href="../../../h/a/r/Harakat.html" title="Harakat">harakat</a>) are hard to distinguish except at very large point sizes. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 20:45, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be a slight tendency to use comparison with IE languages where the reported typical feature is more or less a peculiarity of Germanic or even English. For example, nominal composition, though common in Germanic (and Greek and Sanskrit), is basically absent from Romance (which uses the parallel to Iḍāfa) and Slavic (predominantly "Nisba"). I don't have the time to work through the entire article, not for now at least, but it would be great if you could have an eye on this.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it's a great article, keep up the good work (my Arabic is too basic to contribute much)!</p>

<dd>thanks. but I would be grateful if you could follow the article's convention of italicizing arabic text, and using the transliteration with diacritics (you can copy-paste form the "phonology" section). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> 23:16, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This paragraph seems to say that the <i>-t</i> feminine marker was not pronounced during the 10th Hindu month of Pausha (follow the link). Am I understanding this correctly? I'm a novice to Arabic (as well as to Wikipedia, excuse me), and I've encountered some seemingly bizarre aspects of the language, but I can't believe that Arabic speakers would change their pronuncation of the feminine gender of nouns for the duration of one month of the year. I'm guessing this statement simply needs clarification or elaboration. kirez 01:35, 01 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a question (Mustafaa?): I understand there are a few nouns which have the "feminine" ta marbouta in the singular, but not in the plural, e.g. <i>riqatun</i>, <i>riqu:na</i> "cash". My question is, what about adjective and verbal agreement? does the singular take feminine adjectives and verbs, and the plural masculine ones, or is the plural only "masculine" on the surface and still takes feminine agreement? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a> 10:47, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>In Arabic, inanimate plurals always take feminine singular agreement, irrespective of the gender of their singulars. However, for an animate case - eg `umdah "governor", pl. `umad - both the singular and the plural take masculine agreement. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 18:20, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A lot of the letters signifying the Arabic alphabet and how to pronounce them is missing in my screen, all I see are little boxes, same thing for the List of Arabic names. Really annoying to try to get around this and go through all these loopholes just to find about why I see these danged Cargo-Crates that stupid Gnomes (Issues with my computer/the files) leave in front of these. Took me almost an hour just to get a small clue of what it is and I'm still confused! Have to print these out now...</p>
<p>I think that the pronouns paragraph needs more attention. What about <i>tu</i>in <i>akal-tu</i> for example?</p>

<p>I've also noticed the empty blocks for the "ayn." I totally understand that this can be very frustrating for someone who is looking for more information on Arabic. I'm proposing to use either 9 or&#160;? (probably the former) to remedy the situation, since these characters appear on almost every computer screen. What does everyone think about this? To the person who made a suggestion as to the transliteration of the "ayn," my screen just displayed an empty block and no character.</p>
<p>I have another suggestion: in order to help those who are new to the Arabic language, I'm proposing to create a phonological chart with the Arabic letter and its transliteration below it (organized by manner and place of articulation, with the terms linked to explanations in Wikipedia). I do not want to redo someone else's work (because they spent a lot of their time in writing the article in the first place); I just want to make it more clearer for non-specialists.</p>

I am well aware of the various Arabic transliteration systems; my problem appears to be with my browser, as you suggested. I have downloaded the IPA fonts, and my browser is set to UTF-8, but still I see boxes. Since you seem to be very knowleadgeable in this subject, do you have any general suggestions and/or links to other websites that would help me fix the problem? I use a PC and have the most recent version of MIE.</p>

<p>Hello, I have proposed an expansion of the article about <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_grammar.html#Inflection" title="Arabic grammar">section on Arabic case endings</a>. I created a table and included a few examples with the case endings in red for the nonspecialists.

Would you mind taking a look at it and telling me what you think? How can it be improved? Also, what are your opinions/comments/suggestions about both the presentation of the transliterated Arabic and the English translation? Should I have also included the Arabic, or is that overkill? Please feel free to edit the examples to include more or change the existing ones.</p>

<p>The current organization of the page seems a little awkward. There is a duplicate discussion of case issues in both the "syntax" section and the "noun" section. Also, what is ambiguously identified as the "infinitive" form in the "verb" section is, in the "syntax" section more correctly identified as masdar; however, it's unclear that the document is referring to the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>The verb section could crucially use a discussion of the different forms/measures (awzaan).</p>
<p>A discussion of subject/verb agreement is missing.</p>
<p>Also, since we aren't using the Arabic script for the examples, is using the root fa3ala for the verb forms really the best idea? I know it's conventional, but if you don't have enough background to read in Arabic, it seems things will be easier to grasp if we pick a consonant that English speakers will be able to relate to more easily. Maybe ktb, drs, slm. What is the consensus on this?</p>

<p>Is there a reason why the numbers are declined? Why is the term * 1 wāḥidun listed, and not * 1 wāḥid. It is in my view confusing to decline words, since they can be declined into wāḥidin and wāḥidan as well... I suggest getting rid of the -tu ending in that list.</p>

<p>Some massive editing by <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a>. It looks like the article needed it, and the new discussion is easy to read, but I think the following points are erroneous. Someone who knows Arabic better than I do should check.</p>
<ul>
<li>"MSA tends to use SVO word order and allow less word order variation"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Modern Standard Arabic still uses VSO as the default syntax, but is more flexible than classical, so SVO can sometimes be seen. This is also true of modern dialects.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"The exception is in relative clauses, where the verb is usually first"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In a relative clause, the first thing is ALWAYS the relative pronoun, where it is used at all. (Relative clauses for indefinite nouns do not use relative pronouns.) The NEXT thing is ALWAYS the verb.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Subject pronouns are normally omitted . . . when using a participle as a verb (participles are not marked for person)."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I don't understand this one. When is a participle used 'as a verb'? An example might help to clear this up.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Adjectives follow the noun they are modifying, and agree with the noun in case, gender, number, and state"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"State"? What's this?</dd>
<dd>Note that non-human plurals are ALWAYS matched up with singular feminine adjectives and verbs. This is an important point and must be made clear. Someplace in the article, there should be some mention of the use of singular verb forms with plural subjects - I don't know whether that would be considered a "syntax" issue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Subjects are marked with the nominative case, as are objects in non-verbal sentences."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, what's a 'non-verbal sentence'? Can you give an example of an <i>object</i> which appears in the nominative case? (And I don't mean nouns where the case markers are swallowed up, as in 'akala Mūsā l-kūsā.')</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"The genitive case is used for nouns that modify other nouns and for the objects of prepositions."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The 'genitive' case is used for objects of prepositions, and also for the second noun in the two-noun constructs called 'iDāfa' (pardon my non-use of the correct transliteration). Which of the two nouns 'modifies' the other?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"There is no dative case; instead, the preposition "li-" is used."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>True, but there is a whole raft of other cases known in Indo-European languages which are also inapplicable to Arabic. I would delete this sentence.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"'inna s-samaa´a zarqaa´u"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Two errors here, I think. The adjective should be indefinite, not definite (-un, not -u). I can't remember: what's the gender of sky? And isn't it usually used in the plural? (as-samawātu) Maybe a simpler example would illustrate the point better. How about <i>al-waladu saghīratun</i>?</dd>
<dd>inna wa anna wa layta wa la'alla - could we mention these here?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>""'inna", along with its "sister" terms "'anna" ("that", as in "I think that ..."), "'inna" ("that" after <i>qaala/yaquulu</i> "say"), "walakinna" "but" and "ka'anna" "as if" require that they be immediately followed by a noun or attached pronominal suffix, and a following noun must be in the accusative case."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This implies that it is correct to say, "Qultu innahu l-walada fī l-madrasati." Is that right?</dd>
<dd>walakinna -&gt; walākinna</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Deletion of discussion of masdar, Active and Passive partiples, and the different 'kinds' of sentences</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know whether these should have been taken out. Is the material covered somewhere else in the article?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>How about some references?</li>
</ul>

<p>let me make some comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>MSA and dialects allow less variation than CA because they have no case endings. (MSA is composed as if it had no case endings, and they are added later if necessary.) CA allowed many displacements of objects, prepositional phrases, etc. that would be difficult to parse without case endings. also, p. 683 of "The World's Major Languages": "Colloquial Arabic dialects are basically SVO (although I think most are, I refrain from saying 'all') and there is now convincing evidence that Modern standard Arabic has become SVO as well. D.B. Parkinson has investigated this by examining newspapers such as Al-Ahraam and Al-Akhbaar from 1970-8 and the conclusion is that this change is still in progress. There is evidence too that SVO is the more archaic word order since proverbs may still preserve this Proto-Arabic stage, e.g. 'al-jaahilu yaTlubu lmaala wal9aaqilu yaTlubu lkamaala, 'the fool seeks wealth, the wise man seeks perfection'."</li>
<li>in a relative clause, dialects do not always put the verb first, and I suspect there are examples of this in MSA, too.</li>
<li>Using a participle as a verb is common in dialects, ana maashi 'ilaa al-madrasa.</li>
<li>"State" is a common term in Arabic grammar, and comes in three types: definite, indefinite, and construct. perhaps it's not totally correct to say that adjectives must agree in state; rather, attributive adjectives agree in definiteness, but predicate adjectives occur in the indefinite state.</li>
<li>Inanimate plurals usually have feminine singular agreement in MSA. some dialects follow this, some don't. Koranic Arabic allowed for broken inanimate plurals to take broken plural adjectives (W.M. Thackston, An Introduction to Koranic and Classical Arabic, pp. 27-28), and this occasionally occurs in MSA as well (Haywood and Mahmad, A new Arabic grammar of the written language, p. 52).</li>
<li>By non-verbal sentence here i mean a sentence without a verb. al-bintu jamiilatun but al-bintu kaanat jamiilatan. "object" may be the wrong word, "complement" might be better.</li>
<li>the second noun of a construct modifies the first.</li>
<li>you're right that the comment about dative should probably go; it is left over from the old text.</li>
<li>the sentence "the sky is blue" was here before. you're right that the sentence should probably be deleted and that samaa' is masculine (but 'azraq/zarqaa' is a diptote so it won't have -n).</li>
<li>as for "Qultu innahu l-walada fī l-madrasati", i don't know whether this is correct, but it looks strange. it wasn't my intention to say that both a pronoun and a noun can follow; if you think it says this, feel free to reword it.</li>
<li>as for "deletion of discussion of masdar, Active and Passive partiples, and the different 'kinds' of sentences", i do think this should be discussed, but the previous text said nothing useful -- it just gave arabic terminology, which isn't helpful in an english-language encylopedia article.</li>
</ol>
<p>feel free to fix up the text.</p>
