	    <p><b>Aral Vorkosigan</b> is a fictitious character from <a href="../../../l/o/i/Lois_McMaster_Bujold_2095.html" title="Lois McMaster Bujold">Lois McMaster Bujold</a>'s <i><a href="../../../v/o/r/Vorkosigan_Saga_c477.html" title="Vorkosigan Saga">Vorkosigan Saga</a></i> series.</p>
<p>Viceroy Prime Minister Admiral Count Aral Vorkosigan was the youngest man to ever reach the rank of admiral in the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrayaran_Imperial_Military_Service_0d2e.html" title="Barrayaran Imperial Military Service">Barrayaran Imperial Military Service</a>. He was without a doubt the most brilliant strategist in all of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barrayar.html" title="Barrayar">Barrayar</a>, and possibly one of the best throughout the entire <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vorkosigan_Saga_c477.html" title="Vorkosigan Saga">Vorkosigan Saga</a> galaxy. In his younger years, he pursued a military career. He was stated by many military history buffs, such as Ky Tung, to have been the most brilliant admiral/strategist in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Aral is described as being below average height, stocky and not particularly handsome, but projecting an aura of power and authority. The author of the novels has likened him to the actor <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Reed_114c.html" title="Oliver Reed">Oliver Reed</a>, before he succumbed to alcohol.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Aral_Vorkosigan_5e13.html" title="Edit section: Personal life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>For the first thirteen years of Aral Vorkosigan's life, the reigning ruler of Barrayar was <a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad_Emperor_Yuri_d1d3.html" title="Mad Emperor Yuri">Mad Emperor Yuri</a>. He was a psychotic emperor, who became extremely paranoid about conspirators plotting to kill him to gain the throne. His paranoia built up, until one day he sent death squads to kill every single person who was a close heir to gaining the throne through bloodline. These persons included the then eleven-year-old Aral Vorkosigan's mother and older brother. At the time when the death squad was sent out to kill Aral's family, Aral and his mother were at an official state luncheon. Aral narrowly escaped death. Unfortunately, his mother was not so lucky. She was shot in the stomach by a sonic grenade, dying instantly. Aral was the only person to survive the encounter at the luncheon. In one of the demonstrations of his madness, Yuri did not attempt to kill Aral's father, who was not in the line of succession. <a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad_Emperor_Yuri_d1d3.html" title="Mad Emperor Yuri">Mad Emperor Yuri</a> was overthrown two years later by <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Piotr_Vorkosigan_194b.html" title="Count Piotr Vorkosigan">General Count Piotr Vorkosigan</a> and <a href="../../../e/z/a/Ezar_Vorbarra_5cc9.html" title="Ezar Vorbarra">Ezar Vorbarra</a>. Vorbarra soon took the throne as rightful heir to Emperor Yuri.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty, Aral had an arranged marriage to a girl of eighteen. While he was away on missions frequently, his wife had two affairs, and when he found out he killed both her lovers in duels to avenge his honor. It was assumed that they had killed each other; this was a fortunate thing for Aral, as dueling was forbidden, under penalty of death. His wife committed suicide by shooting herself in the face with a plasma arc - Aral wondered about his odd method of suicide and suspected his father Piotr might have killed her, since he had arranged their marriage. Aral never asked his father, out of fear Piotr would answer in the affirmative. After Aral's first wife's death, when Aral describes himself as drunken and reckless, he also had a homosexual affair with future adversary (and possibly his first wife's brother) Ges Vorrutyer, also in the military. At forty-four, he met and married Captain <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cordelia_Naismith_cbff.html" title="Cordelia Naismith">Cordelia Naismith</a> of <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta_Colony_46be.html" title="Beta Colony">Beta Colony</a> - both Ges and Cordelia herself felt that she represented an ideal mate to satisfy Aral's bisexual tendencies: a woman in the military. They had one son, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Vorkosigan_d192.html" title="Miles Vorkosigan">Miles Vorkosigan</a>, who is the main protagonist of the Vorkosigan Saga - though, technically, they have <i>two</i> sons, or at the very least, a son once removed in Miles' clone brother, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Vorkosigan_a356.html" title="Mark Vorkosigan">Lord Mark</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Aral_Vorkosigan_5e13.html" title="Edit section: Imperial Service">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Imperial Service</span></h2>
<p>Like most young <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vor_of_Barrayar_4eb5.html" title="Vor of Barrayar">Vor</a> lords, Aral decided to enlist, and went to officer's training at the Imperial Service Academy in his late teens. He quickly rose through the ranks and reached the position of admiral. As admiral, Aral Vorkosigan was forced to lead the Barrayaran conquest of Komarr. Through military genius, a fortunate situation, and use of minimal force, Aral captured the whole planet of Komarr quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The near-bloodless victory was marred by an incident called <a href="../../../k/o/m/Komarr.html#The_Solstice_Massacre" title="Komarr">The Solstice Massacre</a>, which took place when one of Aral's subordinates (a political officer) ordered the deaths of 200 captive Komarran leaders without Aral's knowledge or consent. The subordinate was quickly murdered by Vorkosigan in retribution of his honor. The Komarran massacre, and a widespread belief that Vorkosigan murdered the political officer to cover up his own implication in the massacre, earned him the nick name, "the <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butcher_of_Komarr_8777.html" title="Butcher of Komarr">Butcher of Komarr</a>".</p>
<p>He was soon demoted back to captain because of internal affairs within the Barrayaran command. It may have been in this period that he served as commander of an arctic base on Barrayar known as "Camp Permafrost", a base that his son Miles would later serve at. At this point, Aral was approximately 35. The well defined chronology picks up with Aral as captain of the warship <i>The General Vorkraft</i>; this is still a punishment, as he has apparently been given the dregs of the service, earning the nickname "Vorkosigan's leper colony". At that point in Barrayaran history, there was much upheaval within the government, including much corruption in the military and so called "political service". There were "political officers" aboard every ship, to ensure that the military was doing exactly what this service wished. One such political officer on Vorkosigan's ship attempted to mutiny, along with some other high level crew members. To do so, they attempted to assassinate Vorkosigan. This is where the first novel, <i>Shards of Honor</i>, begins. Vorkosigan successfully takes back his command.</p>
<p>Some months later Aral, promoted to the rank of Commodore, is led by the corrupt and sinister Admiral Ges Vorrutyer and Prince Serg to invade the planet of Escobar. In truth, the invasion of Escobar turns out only to be a ruse choreographed by Emperor Ezar Vorbarra to get the admiral and the prince assassinated for the sake of Barrayar's future. The emperor reasoned that if Prince Serg had inherited the throne, Barrayar would have undergone a period of political darkness and tyranny. Vorkosigan is then given back his rank of admiral, and quickly retreats all forces from Escobar.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Aral_Vorkosigan_5e13.html" title="Edit section: Political Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political Career</span></h2>
<p>At the end of the elaborate assassination, Vorkosigan was fed up with the military. He married <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cordelia_Naismith_cbff.html" title="Cordelia Naismith">Cordelia Naismith</a> of <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta_Colony_46be.html" title="Beta Colony">Beta Colony</a> and settled down to build a family. On the death of Prince Serg, his four-year-old son Prince Gregor became heir to the throne. The dying Emperor Ezar appointed Aral as Prime Minister and Regent-Elect of Barrayar until Prince Gregor was old enough to rule at age twenty. [In this scene, Vorkosigan claims that Vorlakial and Kanzian are better military strategists than he is.] There <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vorkosigan_Saga_c477.html#Shards_of_Honor" title="Vorkosigan Saga">Shards of Honor</a> ends, and the stage is set for the second book in the saga, <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vorkosigan_Saga_c477.html#Barrayar" title="Vorkosigan Saga">Barrayar</a>.</p>
<p>After serving as Regent of Barrayar, Aral Vorkosigan turned over the Imperium to Emperor Gregor Vorbarra when he reached his majority. Subsequently, Aral was appointed Prime Minister of Barrayar and thus still held a prominent role in imperial politics. He retired from this position circa <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vorkosigan_Saga_c477.html#Mirror_Dance" title="Vorkosigan Saga">Mirror Dance</a> and became the Viceroy of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergyar.html" title="Sergyar">Sergyar</a>, a newly settled world that was most recent addition to the Barrayan empire.</p>
<p>During his tenure as Regent, Aral's father, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Piotr_Vorkosigan_194b.html" title="Count Piotr Vorkosigan">Count General Piotr Vorkosigan</a> died, thus making Aral <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_Count_of_Barrayar_7929.html" title="District Count of Barrayar">Count</a> Vorkosigan. His technical title as of the end of <a href="../../../v/o/r/Vorkosigan_Saga_c477.html#Diplomatic_Immunity" title="Vorkosigan Saga">Diplomatic Immunity</a> is "Viceroy Count Admiral Vorkosigan, Former Regent and Prime Minister of Barrayar".</p>
