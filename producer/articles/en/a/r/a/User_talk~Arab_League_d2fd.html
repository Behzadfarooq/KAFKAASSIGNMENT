<p>Thank you for uploading the "Ethnic_Persians_Map.GIF". It seems allright, except for the concentration of Persians in Uzbekistan (the major cities of Uzbekistan are dominated by <a href="../../../t/a/j/Tajiks.html" title="Tajiks">Tajiks</a> (Persians), while Centra-Afghanistan is not inhabited by Persians, but by Persian-speaking <a href="../../../h/a/z/Hazaras.html" title="Hazaras">Hazaras</a>). Maybe you could correct that. That would be great.</p>
<p>I put the map into the <a href="../../../t/a/j/Tajiks.html" title="Tajiks">Tajiks</a> article, too.</p>

<dd>My response wasn't quick. I posted those a few days ago. Sorry if it seemed a little agressive. It just seemed as if you were purposely trying to aggrandize the extent of Arabs in Africa.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding Egypt's Red Sea Coast, I don't think you understand me correctly. I'm not saying all of Egypt's Red Sea coast, just the southeastern part, and all of Sudan's. It is not Arabic speaking, but <a href="../../../b/e/j/Beja_language.html" title="Beja language">Beja</a>-speaking, a <a href="../../../c/u/s/Cushitic_languages.html" title="Cushitic languages">Cushitic language</a> (or possibly an independent branch of <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Asiatic_languages_1e35.html" title="Afro-Asiatic languages">Afro-Asiatic</a>). See the maps <a href="http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=101211&amp;rog3=EG" class="external text" title="http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=101211&amp;rog3=EG" rel="nofollow">here</a> (The site doesn't show it, but those in Egypt are called <a href="../../../a/b/a/Ababda.html" title="Ababda">Ababda</a>) and <a href="http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=103626&amp;rog3=SU" class="external text" title="http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=103626&amp;rog3=SU" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In the second map, that little yellow enclave is inhabited by the Hedareb Beja from Eritrea and the <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigre_people.html" title="Tigre people">Tigre people</a> from Eritrea (related closely to the <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigray-Tigrinya_people_f43a.html" title="Tigray-Tigrinya people">Tigray-Tigrinya people</a>, but generally Muslim). So, as you can see, most of that area is not inhabited by Arabs. It's mostly desert and inhabited by various Beja groups (some near Eritrea being <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigre_language.html" title="Tigre language">Tigre</a>-speaking). Note that the territories in Eastern Sudan have been out of Sudanese control for some time due to civil war, so it can be safely said that these groups do not consider themselves Arabs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For Mauritania, you're probably right, but the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demographics_of_Mauritania_fe01.html" title="Demographics of Mauritania">Demographics of Mauritania</a> does show a substantial non-Moor population. Regarding the use of "Arab influence," I'm not sure it's even necessary, since the map is to show the distribution of Arabs as an ethnicity. Perhaps instead you should just put dots of green where Arabs live in those countries. Apparently there's a small population in Mogadishu, and I know there are a few near Eritrea's northern coast.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Saharawi.html" title="Saharawi">Saharawi</a>, the reason I point that out is because I think they don't consider themselves Arab, but they do speak <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hassaniya.html" title="Hassaniya">Hassaniya</a>, so maybe I am wrong on this.</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Arabs Praying.jpg</b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below).

<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<p><b>Thanks for your note</b> You wanted some clarification on my recent edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_world.html" title="Arab world">Arab world</a> article, I replaced your image (<a href="../../../a/r/a/Image%7EArab_World.GIF_5a1d.html" title="Image:Arab World.GIF">Image:Arab_World.GIF</a>) with <a href="../../../a/r/a/Image%7EArab_world.png_90ed.html" title="Image:Arab world.png">Image:Arab_world.png</a> because the latter highlights the subtelties of the ethnic makeup of the Arab world (e.g. black Sudan) - even this one has its problems, though, such as using the same color for Syria, Saudia Arabia, etc. and Somalia (which is hardly Arab).</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Arabism_9177.html" title="Pan-Arabism">Pan-Arabism</a>, the caption you wrote is simply untrue as far as I'm aware, and the picture that I inserted has the same strengths as mentioned above.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_League_2a91.html" title="Arab League">Arab League</a>, I re-wrote some links to avoid redirects, and when I inserted the picture with borders, it was because I was thinking of the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Union_91e5.html" title="African Union">African Union</a> article. Clearly, you are correct about the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a> picture. I suppose there is no standard, and I aesthetically prefer one with borders, but I won't object to one without.</li>
</ul>
<p>Re: the Sahara, I think that this is a fine solution. Let me also point out some inaccuracies on your part, though: you claimed that there is "no... form of independence there for it is within Moroccan borders," which is not the case; there are <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Zone_%28region%29_3f55.html" title="Free Zone (region)">areas of the Sahara not under Moroccan administration</a>, and the territory is not within Moroccan borders, as Morocco ends where <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Sahara_6e35.html" title="Western Sahara">Western Sahara</a> begins. Thank you for your efforts. As for informing people if you change their contributions, that is why you have the watchlist feature - if you watch pages, you will be told when anyone updates a page that you find important or interesting. Before I go, let me encouage you to sign you posts on talk pages by typing four tildes at the end of your post (~~~~.) -<a href="../../../k/o/a/User%7EKoavf_1790.html" title="User:Koavf">Justin (koavf)</a>·<a href="../../../k/o/a/User_talk%7EKoavf_18ee.html" title="User talk:Koavf">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Koavf_fde1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Koavf">C</a>·<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Koavf_292b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Koavf">M</a> 14:10, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Somalia and so on</b> Sure - some definitions of "Arab" include Somalis, and some don't - this is the point I was trying to make; the definition of Arab is a matter of controversy. The Arab League's original definition would exclude Somalis, for what it's worth. I am familiar with the linguistic definition of Arab (similar to "<a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanic.html" title="Hispanic">Hispanic</a>" - one who speaks Spanish, regardless of ethnic origin.) I personally have no strong feelings about Somalis being Arabs, but I am inclined to say they are not.</dd>
<dd>By the way, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Image%7EEthnic_Arabs_Map2.GIF.GIF_9cbd.html" title="Image:Ethnic Arabs Map2.GIF.GIF">this map</a> is really cool. Good work.</dd>
<dd>Let me explain what I said before about signing posts. Every article, userpage, category, portal, etc. has a talk page on it where users can discuss the content of the article. For instance, I am writing on your talk page right now. It is helpful to other users if you sign your comments, so they know who wrote them. After you get done writing, type in four tildes (~~~~) to include your signature with a timestamp. I have changed my signature at the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPreferences_a6b2.html" title="Special:Preferences">preferences page</a> to look like this:

<p>Hi Arab League! It said for me to tell you what I think, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why and how would Alaska become independent of the US</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>why would the caribians unite with the central Americans?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I doubt the Incas can become independent</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I agree that the Arabs will probably be united in a few decades.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why do the Africans join in a bunch of unions like that?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikstan, etc. are Turkic nations while Pakistan is Indian. Why would the join in a Persian alliance?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why would Japan and Korea unite?</li>
</ul>
<p>--<a href="../../../f/o/x/User%7EFox_Mccloud_1ddd.html" title="User:Fox Mccloud">Fox Mccloud</a> 17:07, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alaska - The South of the American Civil War had a much better chance of separation then Alaska does right now. If they started a civil war, they would be beaten badly</p>
<p>Caribean Community - No, many of the central American nations have a more Mayan culture and history. Many of them still speak Mayan. The Caribean islands don't have this.</p>
<p>Incan Union - That would be awesome: A rebirth of the Incan empire.&#160;:) I don't think Columbia or Venezuela would join, though they were never Incan, and have few Incans today. Paraquay would probably stay separate of Argentina, since they have a large native population.</p>
<p>Arab League - History lesson: The Arabs were not united even before WWI. They had already been divided by European empires. Before the Europeans, they were only "united" because they had been conquered by the Ottoman Empire. We are having a hard time keeping Iraq united, so are you sure unity is what the Arabs want? Also, I doubt Israel would be defeated by the Arabs. At least not as long as the US continues it's support of Israel, and is Somalia Arab? I thought their people were Somalis not Arabs?</p>
<p>Africa - Africa is unlikely to unite any time soon. African nations have so many problems, uniting would be the last thing they worry about.</p>
<p>Persian United States - How much Iranian influence is there on nations like Kazakhstan? Will they be speaking Persian in another 50 years? Furthermore, how would being American "puppets" help Pakistan and Afghanistan's relationship with Iran? Also, what would happen in Iran? Would the Islamic theocracy eventually be overthrown in a revolution, and Iran would establish a more... modern state?</p>
<p>Korea and Japan - Theres no doubt that North Korea is doomed to failure one day. I don't think they will merge with Japan though. The closest they would get is some kind of Anti-China defense agreement.</p>
<p>Sorry for taking so long to reply.--<a href="../../../f/o/x/User%7EFox_Mccloud_1ddd.html" title="User:Fox Mccloud">Fox Mccloud</a> 15:57, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Alaska - Yeah, but we wouldn't give it up that easily. It has all that oil.</p>
<p>Caribean Community and Incan Union - No further arguements here</p>
<p>Arab League - The Abbasids united the Arabs, but the Ottomans only "united" the Arabs because they conquered them. They were not Arabs themselves. Also, I doubt the Jews would merge with the Arabs even when they became a minority. They would probably be afraid of the Arabs.</p>
<p>Africa - No further arguement</p>
<p>Persian league - While i'm not trying to turn this into a political discussion, I will just say that Sharia is Islamic law, and nations enforcing it discriminate against other religions.</p>
<p>Korea and Japan - As China grows more powerful, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and maybe the Philippines will form an alliance for their protection.--<a href="../../../f/o/x/User%7EFox_Mccloud_1ddd.html" title="User:Fox Mccloud">Fox Mccloud</a> 14:15, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A tag has been placed on <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serrenia.html" title="Serrenia">Serrenia</a>, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group or service and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#G11" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">the general criteria for speedy deletion</a>, particularly item 11, as well as <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">the guidelines on spam</a>.</p>
<p>If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add <code>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}</code> on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">citations</a> from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> to ensure that the article will be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>.

<dd>In response to your answer on my talk-page: If you consider the article to be factual and neutral, please contest the speedy deletion proposal as described in the proposal box.
