<dt>Reasons for move</dt>
</dl>
<p>Frankly, I was not impressed by the so-called "overwhelming" support for this version of the page (most of them on invitation). Neither by most of the argumentation now in the archive (well, I read most of it). I support the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> being applied here. There appears no real <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28precision%29_9b4a.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (precision)</a> issue here, otherwise there should be somewhere a link to a page explaining/disambiguating the "other" meaning of Arabic numerals (as it is, it is explained in this page).</p>
<p>Note that for reading the archive, it is not always clear whether a "move" indicates moving <i>from</i> or <i>to</i> this version of the page, since the page has been swapped all throughout the discussion, and then later, during the vote. That's why I take a fresh start for this vote, on a <i>clean slate</i>. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 18:14, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b>.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. I think current title will appear if someone is searching for "Hindu-Arabic Numerals" or simply "Arabic Numerals", while we will excluding one important part of name if article is moved. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshishG_d284.html" title="User:AshishG">Ashish G</a> 06:10, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No vote</b>. I don't think this article needs more debate about the title at the present, although Wikipedia naming conventions do suggest that "Arabic numerals" is the right choice. OTOH, I would like to point out that things like this are not decided by voting, but rather by solid argumentation. The history of the numeral system (who invented it, who spread it, etc.) has nothing to do with naming of this article, and arguments based on it should be discounted. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 06:48, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>oppose</b> it was developed in India. no renaming should take place.--203.115.76.17 12:22, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> The term Arabic Numeral is as good as calling Netherlands, Holland. Its fairly accepted in Europe about the origin of the number system in India.It would be an injustice to use the same old name because it was in use. I have encountered people in Europe beliving that its of Arab origin meerly because thet know it by that name. The page with Hindu-Arabic Numeral should exsist. Others should note that the number system has originated in India and therefore be named Hindu Numerals. We however settle for an acceptable name, Hindu-Arabic. <a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERaguks_5a90.html" title="User:Raguks">~rAGU</a> 15:41, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> move to Arabic numerals in accordance with WP Naming Conventions. Votes given based on <b>arguments other than naming conventions vs precision are very inappropriate</b> here and suggest non-POV nationalistic bias. See my reply to Ben Aveling for reason. -<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrogular_c9a5.html" title="User:Frogular">Frogular</a> 00:31, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> I have to say the term Arabic numerals does seem to be the most commonly used (google). But it reflects a eurocentric viewpoint and how they came to europe vs how they really evolved. I think Hindu-Arabic (Indo-Arabic more so, though the contributors were Hindu) is more appropriate especially since it also has academic acceptability. --<a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPranathi_f5a9.html" title="User:Pranathi">Pranathi</a> 00:51, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. Agree that 'Arabic numerals' is more common usage that I have heard, but is informal and may be a regional bias. Think Enc. Brit. and scholary reference provide strong support for leaving here. --Sajendra 02:01, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b>. Arabic numericals is the commonly used term. Most of the people who've opposed the move seem to be Hindus. The article mentions that the system was invented by Hindus, so I don't think we should have a problem here. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 05:02, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Hindu-Arabic Numerals is most accurate. Enc. Britannica, Scholary refrences strongly support and use Hindu-Arabic numerals because this is logical, fair as well as most accurate. Who invented it? Answer:Hindus. Arabs agree with this?

<li><b>Oppose</b> . Hindu-Arabic is most accurate Wordcrasher 15:05, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. I would submit that even though Arabic numeral is the more common term (especially in schools in the US), the Hindu Arabic form is the one preferred by scholars, and the gain in accuracy is more important than sticking to an innacurate common name. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 15:15, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> move. per Frogular, we cannot even conclude that it's more common among scholars. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_sig_226e.html" title="User:Lethe/sig">lethe</a> <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_sig_fced.html" title="User talk:Lethe/sig"><sup>talk</sup></a> 16:08, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> move, as I agree WP conventions should fit common usage, and accuracy issues are handled thoroughly in the first line of the article. Algal 16:28, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> move, but suggest changing references in article to Hindu-Arabic (unless someone's already done this?

<li><b>Oppose</b>&#160;: Hindu-Arabic is the precise term used. The term HA was coined keeping the origin of the numerals in mind. The word <i>Arabic</i> is misleading and incomplete. We're not reinventing the wheel, we're using: 1. A more accurate term 2. A word already in existence. Please do not use google as a final arbiter as Google results are often skewed. The debate also hinges on the word "Hindu"; but there are many instances where the term is used for other purposes: eg.

<li><b>Support</b> move to "Arabic numerals", per Wikipedia naming conventions. "Arabic numerals" receives by far, more usage in English. That's how the students are taught in schools and that's what the textbooks say and math papers have; when the proponents of "Hindu-Arabic" naming refer to the "qualified mathematics books", I am curious as to see fair referencing from both sides. While recognizing the true origin and with all respect to the Indian inventors, more conventional English name must be used for the article title in Wikipedia <i>until another usage becomes prevailing</i>. Wikipedia is a reference resource and it should not be used as a vehicle for imposing language changes on native Engish speakers.

Let people decide for themselves based on the evidence provided on the separate pages. Different number systems were used in wide geographical areas at the same time.

Only a few gave what we would consider source credits and only miniscule portions have survived to the present time.

<p>Why should the word Arabic be associated with these numerals at all? Call them Indian numerals/Hindu numerals. Arabs learnt them from India and you always cite the original inventor. Example if some upstart physicist discovers e=mc^2 it does not mean einstein's name is added to this young discoverer. I fail to understand why people are supporting Arab numerals. A wrong once discovered has to be corrected.</p>

<dd>I would also like to mention that I am finding assertions that this move was for a "nationalist" cause a bit offensive. It's really depressing for me. "Arabic numerals" is highly uncommon in academic articles about the numerals, like this one is supposed to be, throughout the world. My argument is absolutely not that "Hindus should get credit, therefore the name should be Hindu-Arabic." I was afraid from the beginning that people will consider it an issue of nationalism, therefore I thought twice before proposing the change. I am just afraid that an unacademic title like "Arabic numerals" will reflect badly on the knowledgebility of the wikipedia community. My statement that this term might be misleading is not because I think it gives undue importance to Arabs (I fully appreciate Arab role in spreading these, and can understand why people at first called them Arabic numerals, a usage that continued colloquially), but because there are other uses of "Arabic numerals." <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 23:20, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Arabic numeral" is a very common colloquial term for Hindu-Arabic (so <i>appears</i> to fit one of the many criteria for naming on wikipedia (see below)), but it's not appropriate in the more formal context of the title of an encyclopedia article, which should be more rigorous in reflecting academic norms.</li>

<li>All other encyclopedias like Britannica <a href="http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9367121" class="external autonumber" title="http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9367121" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, refer to the symbols exclusively as "Hindu-Arabic" everywhere they are mentioned. Articles in research papers and other encyclopedias (that are written by professional people who are rigorous scholars, who are paid a lot of money for their work, who are held accountable for what they write, and are peer-reviewed at many levels) exclusively use the term "Hindu-Arabic numerals".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<ul>
<li>According to another article on Britannica, titled "The Hindu-Arabic system" <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-233818" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-233818" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, the numerals are "commonly spoken of as Arabic but preferably as Hindu-Arabic."</li>

No, really the "misnomer" argument has never been seen as stronger than the "common names" argument, if anything, it means that the "misnomer" is <i>commonly accepted</i> - wikipedia only falls back to the alternative when it's nearly as commonly accepted (at least "well-accepted").

<dd>"Hindu-Arabic numerals" is the most accepted name in academic writing. I cited the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misnomer.html" title="Misnomer">misnomer</a> article just as an example. My argument is absolutely not that "Hindus should get credit, therefore the name should be Hindu-Arabic." By the way, I hope you are not considering it as an issue of Hindu nationalism. I was afraid from the beginning that people will consider it an issue of nationalism. I am just afraid that an unacademic title like "Arabic numerals" will reflect badly on the knowledgebility of the wikipedia community.</dd>

<dd>"Hindu-Arabic numerals" is not all that different from "Arabic numerals", and in my opinion, recognition by people and search engines would not be that big a problem, especially because the first thing the article would say is that they are also known as Arabic numerals, and Arabic numerals is a substring of Hindu-Arabic numerals. I agree this would have been an issue if we were replacing it by an entirely different and obscure set of characters. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 00:27, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>While this belief of mine may be tagged POV, political or Hindu nationalism, I strongly feel the need to elucidate it:</p>
<p>(1) This title must, in my belief, acknowledge the role ancient India played in the synthesis of this mathematical system.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Hindu</i> is an appropriate title as the ancient Indian sciences and studies of all natures were intrinsically tied to the study of <i>shastras</i>, or bodies of knowledge. They were a mixture of science, mathematics, astronomy, religion and philosophy. You can't blame them for not complying with your modern division between religion and science, a POV which is being defended here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Still, you somehow call them "ancient <i>Indian</i> sciences". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:57, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>But <i>Indo-Arabic</i> is also quite acceptable, and perhaps more politically correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>...and almost unused. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:57, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>(3) If the call is made for <i>Arabic</i> only, it will discredit this article for not effectively acknowledging the true roots of the mathematical system. You can have all the Wikipedia conventions you like, but the main point of reference should be the birth of this system in an exchange between Indian and Arabic scholars.</p>
<p>However, I will respect the democratic verdict here.</p>
<p>Jai Sri Rama!</p>

Naming conventions would have this as "Arabic numerals", but then it would be stated <b>very clearly</b> in the opening paragraphs that the accurate scholarly term is "Hindu-Arabic numerals". The Indian contributions are not overlooked simply by having the title titled by it's common name. As stated in the naming conventions, that is a job <b>for the content</b> to correct, <b>not the title</b>. This is about naming the numerals with the most commonly used term. As I can see with Google <b>and Google Scholar</b>, it is overwhemlingly "Arabic numerals" <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrogular_c9a5.html" title="User:Frogular">Frogular</a> 00:43, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It appears that the people who use the term "hindu arabic numerals" are those who are familiar with the history of mathematics. Other academics in other related fields of math, science, psychology (symbol recognition stuff) who refer to these numerals still refer to them as "arabic numerals", accounting for the high hits for just "arabic numerals". Academics other than those expert in history of mathematics using "arabic numerals" suggests that the term "arabic numerals" is common accepted usage. -<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrogular_c9a5.html" title="User:Frogular">Frogular</a> 00:26, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Partial agreement with Frogular. If you can find a decent article <b>about</b> the numerals that calls it "Arabic Numerals", then I'll be convinced it is <i>acceptable</i> (as opposed to <i>common</i>). <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 00:36, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is not my intention to dispute acceptable vs common, sorry if I came across that way. I completely agree that "Hindu-Arabic numerals" is the proper term of these numerals. What I am saying is that "Arabic numerals" is by a rather large factor far more common even among other fields of academics (who are not versed in the history of mathematics) and constitutes a strong "common usage" argument, in reference to the debate on common name vs precision. Other than debating whether common name or precision is more appropriate in this situation, the other arguments I've read have been quite embarrassingly POV based. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrogular_c9a5.html" title="User:Frogular">Frogular</a> 00:58, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This was a tough one. I usually don't offer insight on my decision making, but due to the nature of this debate I'll elaborate a bit rather then just using the notmoved template.</p>
<p>First off, when doing this I'm going from the original state - that is assuming the article we are moving from is <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals.html" title="Arabic numerals">Arabic numerals</a>. So in order to "stay" at <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numerals_48fc.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> there would need to be a consensus, rather then the other way around.</p>
<p>Rough "vote counting" if you will offers about 60% in favor of the hindu version, which fits the absolute minimum of 60% given for <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>. However, filtering out for users with less than 100 edits you get about 56% in support, which doesn't meet the minimum for WP:RM. Due to the close result, disputes over breaking of naming conventions, and size of the debate, there is more than enough reasons to warrant it staying at the old version.</p>
<p>I encourage people to discuss this on the relevant naming guidelines and wikiproject pages before requesting another move&#160;:). There you may find people of like mind who can help you sort it out a bit.</p>

<dd>I usually don't mention whether I agree with a WP:RM vote count report, however, this time someone requested at my talk page whether I'd have a look at this. So, for clarity: I always agree with the sysop's judgement closing the vote.</dd>
<dd>Specifically for this vote, I want to add that the sysop did IMHO a fine job in analysing a very difficult ballot, seen the high amount of disturbance, possible sockpuppetry/meatpuppetry, and the like: I think the vote count report and result analysis very equilibrated. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 08:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Until WhiteNight's statement here, this was portrayed as a RM <i>from</i> here <i>to</i> Arabic numerals. WhiteNight then moved with only 38% of the vote. Under either conception of which direction this is going, a 62% vote for 'Hindu-Arabic numeral' qualifies for Hindu-Arabic, not Arabic. WhiteNight gets around that by disqualifying anyone who hasn't edited Wikipedia for a minimum decided, apparently, by WhiteNight him/her self. There is nothing at WP:RM about disqualifying editors based on experience. (Or was this an attempt to ferret out sockpuppets?) It seems to me that WhiteNight's move was questionable.</dd>

<dd>I'm not planning on reverting the move, though, at least not unless other admins feel it was unwarranted. Perhaps we should archive this whole discussion and *sigh* start again?

All Maghreb (north african nations) use 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

I also saw somewhere in this talk page or in its archive an image of an egyptian phone pad having both numerals and the comment was something like <i>these are the the Arabic numerals in contrast with European ones</i>. The question is how come contemporary Arabs use two different numerals?

<dd>In fact, this is not a vote. It looks like one, it has a lot in common with one, but it isn't a vote. It's an attempt to achieve a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus decision</a>, or failing that, to measure community feeling. (Which is why the opinions of newcomers and outsiders don't always get considered at full value - sometimes they clearly aren't representitive of the wider wikipedian community.) The raw numbers are a major part, even the major part of it, but it's not a vote.</dd>
<dd>At the moment, we seem to be repeating ourselves without making progress. To summarise, a significant minority believe that it is important to include the origin in the title, while a narrow majority believe that common usage is more important.</dd>
<dd>I'm not really sure how we can proceed. The reason for using the common name is that to do so complies with wikipedia standards. That's why Asprin is discssed at <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asprin.html" title="Asprin">Asprin</a>, the common name, rather than at 2-(acetyloxy)benzoic acid, its 'proper' name. Consider also the <a href="../../../a/m/e/America%27s_Cup_8b3b.html" title="America's Cup">America's Cup</a>. It originated in England, but the common name is America's Cup, so that's what we use. Exceptions can always be made, but we would need a good reason to do so. Given that 'accuracy' is usually overridden by 'common usage', can someone please list the reasons for this page to be different?</dd>

<dd>As far as I'm concerned this is a <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, just like any other. Whether you call it "vote" or "poll" or something else doesn't matter to me. But as <i>procedure</i> it is <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>. Which includes: following an advised page lay-out for this talk page (pretty much OK now), ferreting out sockpuppet votes (still has to happen), and the like (see instructions on the WP:RM page).</dd>
<dd>Re. "I'm not really sure how we can proceed." - follow WP:RM to start with. There has been disturbance (edit warring on article page during vote; sockpuppeteering; etc...). Extending the period that people can express their opinion about the page name in "support"/"oppose" format is one option. Normally this would happen automatically (compare WP:RM proceedings at <a href="../../../e/a/s/Talk%7EEast_Timor_98e2.html" title="Talk:East Timor">talk:East Timor</a>: never really "halted" after several months - despite the notice on top of that page -, but instead of people starting WP:RM's every few months, they just add their vote - and maybe some day there will be enough support for "Timor Leste", and the page moved - note that I don't think this an "ideal" situation, but maybe the "least bad of several evils").</dd>
<dd>Another suggestion for people not knowing how wikipedia deals with such difficult cases (be assured there have been many, many before): some <i>experience</i> on how to deal with this, described in general terms, is contained in <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conflict_12e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conflict">wikipedia:naming conflict</a>. Maybe it would be a good idea to advise voters to have a look at that before voting. Not that such page has anything near to an "instant solution" for such problems, but always good to learn from experience of others, isn't it? --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 07:32, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I take no position on the issue itself, I strongly condemned those who moved the article without seeking consensus first, while discussion was ongoing simply to impose their POV on the community because the movers were unconvinced that their POV would prevail in the discussion. As per Mikka:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The both previous moves were illegal. The moving party didn't seek consensus with broader participation. The move was done within 1-2 days of starting poll, which gave no time for other people to see the issue. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Based purely on this, I think the move should be reverted because it looks like a bad-faith move. Once reverted, the histories and talks should be merged and ordered (only admin can do it) and discussion should be allowed to continue. Once consensus emerges, the page should me moved or remain where it war. Such moves go everything against the Wikipedia spirit. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 02:39, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Being the inital "illegal mover", I'd like to point out that I have no preference in any "POV" that the title may or may not be expressing. I could care less what the numerals are referred to as, but simply moved the article from Arabic numerals to Hindu-Arabic numerals because at that time it seemed like that was the general feeling among those involved in the discussion. Remember to assume good faith, and maybe everyone getting bogged down in this unnecessarily bureaucratic mess a simple article name change has created would be better served by <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignoring all of the rules</a> and finding something better to do. I made the original move because the name Hindu-Arabic, while maybe less common in usage, seemed to be more accurate and more academic, and had the support of a number of people involved in the discussion. I have no concerns for any "POV" that might exist here (and I'm not sure how either name is pushing any POV). There is no need to pull in every person on Wikipedia to get their opinion on the matter, but apparently that is what is going to happen now. It's not a life-ending change. We're not removing content. No matter which name is chosen, the other will redirect. I think you all need to take a deep breath and realize that in the end it doesn't matter what the title is so long as it is clear to the reader what is being referred to. If all of this energy being spent arguing about the stupid title were put into the article content we'd have a featured article by now; or at the very least, Astriolok and ccssscclll or whatever might have ended their stupid revert war, which is much more damaging than either choice of title. Those of you claiming any of this is POV motivated need to review <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Neither title would be seen as Wikipedia endorsing any particular point of view. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 03:48, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The world is bigger then "west" especially with the internet. One side of the argument stems from oh this is a western wikipedia so we write what is logical from that angle. This is a head in the sand approach.</p>

<p>Mention Indian numerals/Hindu numerals and in description mention that west learnt them through Arabs. Nothing more nothing less.</p>

<div class="dablink"><i>For other uses, see <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Arabic numerals (disambiguation)">Arabic numerals (disambiguation)</a>.</i></div>
<p>What in the Western world is best known as <b>Arabic numerals</b> - or with respect to its history also <b>Hindu-Arabic</b> or <b>Indo-Arabic numerals</b> - has two main aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal.html" title="Decimal">base ten numeral system</a> with unclear origin, as it hasn't been established univocally who was the first to use a symbol for <a href="../../../0/_/%28/0_%28number%29.html" title="0 (number)">zero</a> as a <i>number in a base ten positional system, so that numerals could be composed with it</i>, neither has it been established univocally who learnt what from whom in setting up the base ten numeral system in the form it was known since the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. The present best guess regarding the origin of the base ten numeral system: somewhere in or around the <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_millennium.html" title="1st millennium">first millennium AD</a>, somewhere between <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, but, for example, as late as the end of the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a> <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Stevin_8165.html" title="Simon Stevin">Simon Stevin</a> was (re-)inventing the notation of decimal fractions (see <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Stevin_8165.html#Decimal_fractions" title="Simon Stevin">Simon Stevin#Decimal fractions</a>), that is some four centuries after the numerals had become widely spread in Europe, thanks to, among others, <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibonacci.html" title="Fibonacci">Fibonacci</a>'s <i><a href="../../../l/i/b/Liber_Abaci_158e.html" title="Liber Abaci">Liber Abaci</a>.</i></li>
<li>A set of symbols for the graphic representation of the <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numerical_digit.html" title="Numerical digit">digits</a>:

<ul>
<li><i>Western</i> notation: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 - going back to the ancient <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> representation, see <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmi_numeral.html" title="Brahmi numeral">Brahmi numerals</a>;</li>

<dd>I don't really see the problem you are mentioning - when "Arabic numerals" and "Hindu-Arabic numerals" are synonyms, either term can be used: consistency is <i>per page</i> in such cases. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 09:12, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>This is a bloody mess due to the way the vote was handled. The vote being for a move <i>to</i> Arabic numerals and the page being moved in the middle of the vote was not good practice. The best way forward is probably to concisely state the evidence for each naming option, and then treat this as a new requested move. Allow a discussion period to solidify and make very clear what the issue is and then have a consensus building period (unfortunately looks like voting) that a wider number of wikipedians can be involved in. This should probably be done in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EArabic_numerals_naming_e7bd.html" title="Talk:Arabic numerals/naming">Talk:Arabic numerals/naming</a> because it doesn't have much to do with improving the article content.

<dd>Ok the page is set up but it may need some tweaking and some additional options. For example should we have a separate article on the Arabic symbols that are shown on the keypad image like there is for <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_numerals.html" title="Indian numerals">Indian numerals</a>. Also while we are at it and can set up a well organized vote, should we have this discussion decide how the numerals are referred to in other articles as well.

<p>There is no reason to screw up the first sentence of the article with all these different names. Everyone knows what Arabic numerals are, and when they actually read the article they will learn about their origins too. Britannica would never make such a mess like this.</p>

<dd>"What are known in English as "Arabic numerals" were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs."</dd>

<p>Why was the page moved during the voting phase? From what have I observed above:</p>
<ol>
<li>More people have voted for the <i>Hindu-Arabic</i> title</li>
<li>60% is an arbitary number and I don't think 56% was too far from that number. Was it hastily moved to prevent an impending vote to keep the title?</li>
<li>Those who vote for the title "Arabic numerals" seem to be residents of Western-countries. The question remains (and I seek an answer), is this because the education system in those countries have not updated their syllabus, and have largely been indifferent to the origins of the numbers? Do school books in those countries mention the source of the numbers?</li>
<li>Brittanica uses HA numerals, and other references have been provided. Have these been taken into account?</li>
<li><u>Should we go by what is <i>common usage</i> as per Western standards?</u> We had a BIG debate on Calcutta vs Kolkatta on this same issue last year.</li>
<li>As I have noted above: The word <i>Hindu</i> does not imply religion. It has also been used in economics.</li>
<li>Arab numerals will be confused with Arabic numerals. Do we want to spread this confusion?</li>
<li>Wikipedia should aim to disseminate correct and accurate information. Sure, Calcutta is more commonly used today in most of the world, but is it accurate? Strive for accuracy, that is the only way wikipedia will move forward.</li>
<li>Those who cite: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> please note the following on that page: <i>In cases where the common name of a subject is misleading (For example: "tidal wave" would be a misleading title since these phenomena have nothing to do with tides), then it is sometimes reasonable to fall back on a well-accepted alternative (tsunami, for example).</i></li>
</ol>
<p>I would prefer the revert be undone to maintain status quo and nullify and restarting the voting.

<dd>Re point 3, since you raised it, those favouring Arabic seem to be mostly native english speakers, apparently from a range of countries. Those favouring Hindu-Arabic seem to be, well, Hindus. We don't have an article called American lightbulb or Greek Democracy even though it might show more accuratly where those things were invented, perhaps. The Hindus might have invented the numbers (except perhaps 0?) but the Arabs spread them to the west, and for whatever reason, the popular name does not happen to reflect the original origin of them. It happens. The Indian Rope Trick wasn't invented in India, but that's what the trick's called, so that's the name of the page about it. It isn't misleading or wrong to call the numbers Arabic - that's what they're called by those who use them, much the same as Kolkata is used by those who live there. I can't help but feel that for many people here the question is not accuracy but national pride?

<dd>Please read my posts carefully. As i've stated above, there is nothing religious about the word <i>Hindu</i> in this context. It has absolutely nothing to do with Hinduism.

<dd>evidently, the discussion has been marred by religious or ethnic sentiment (or, equivalently, allegation of such). Common usage is the only point that should be under discussion; however, judging from google, "Hindu-Arabic numerals", probably coined for PC reasons originally, seems to have gained enough currency to be considered common. I would therefore argue that a move there doesn't hurt, and if it makes part of our editors happy, why not move it there? Otoh, judging from <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_5a2e.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numeral system">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a>, the term can be used to refer to the <i>whole set</i> of related numerals, including Devanagari, Bangla, Tamil ones etc.; looking for a term to refer to the symbols used in the Latin alphabet since the 15th century, "Arabic numerals" may still be handy. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:46, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I created the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_5a2e.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numeral system">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a> article, and put numerals in various scripts there with the intention to emphasize that a <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numeral_system.html" title="Numeral system">numeral system</a> is not merely a set of symbols, but "a framework where a set of numbers are represented by numerals in a consistent manner." A just wanted to include all such sets of symbols that are used to work with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.

<dd>well, how about this article (Arabic numerals) being entirely about the glyphs/symbols, along the lines of <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thai_numerals.html" title="Thai numerals">Thai numerals</a>, and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numerals_48fc.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> redirecting to <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_5a2e.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numeral system">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a> to discuss the history and the numeral system. After all, the "Thai numerals" are not any more "Thai" than the "Arabic numerals" are Arabic or European: We don't have "Hindu-Thai numerals" to discuss the glyphs used in Thailand, so why should we insist on the Hindu- prefix for those used in the West? Let us just make one central article discussing evolution and spread of the numerals (symbols and system), and the "regional" articles will cover regional history (in the case of "Arabic numerals", aka "Western numerals", the period AD 1200-2000. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 16:51, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the split between <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numerals_48fc.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_5a2e.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numeral system">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a> is difficult to justify. Is the former supposed to discuss the glyphs only, and the latter the decimal positional system only? Why then, does the latter list all sort of variant glyphs, while the former has a "History" section discussing use of zero? Neither article is excessively long, and I suggest they should join forces. Also, note <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_e45e.html" title="History of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system">History of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a> which claims the earliest evidence of zero in India is from <a href="../../../8/7/0/870.html" title="870">870</a>, while this article has only the <a href="../../../6/2/8/628.html" title="628">628</a> claim, more cautiously ascribed to "Hindu literature" in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_e45e.html" title="History of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system">History of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a>.

<dd>there can also be a section or article European adoption of Arabic numerals, which can discuss the process from 1200 until 2000, how use of Roman numerals lingered on for numbers deemed "important", and finally just for years and clockfaces, an interesting topic in itself. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:26, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, would be interesting! The story about numeral/numeral system schism is this: initially, the article was meant to discuss the numeral system. In all other numeral systems (eg Roman), there is a unique symbol set. This allows for using "Roman numerals" and "Roman numeral system" interchangably. Due to very wide variations in the symbols used for the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_5a2e.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numeral system">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a>, this is not possible with this article. This led to articles, which figured on the "Numeral systems" template as "Indian", "Thai" etc. Clearly there's no "Indian numeral system" or "Thai numeral system" separate from the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. One possibility was to merge all these into one article which would be about the numeral system, and would talk a bit about all the symbols. But there was a demand (it makes sense too), that this article talk only about the symbols "0".."9". This led to the split. After that, a few editors couldn't resist adding stuff that should belong to the numeral system article (positional system, zero, etc) here as well, resulting in the current mess. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 15:43, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>let's clean up the mess, then. This is not a discussion about a move; it is a discussion about scope. Let us have exclusively Western numerals and their history at "Arabic numerals", and the article on the system at "Hindu-Arabic numerals". <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:01, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Looking at the content of all these related articles, at present, we don't have much information about the history of the numerals after, say, the 13th century.

<dd>well, it is difficult, and unnecessary, to discuss the symbols separately from the system. We can have the article at <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_5a2e.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numeral system">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a>, but I strongly recommend that <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numerals_48fc.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> redirects there, not to the article about the Western variant, precisely to avoid the confusion experienced earlier. "numeral" may refer both to the symbol (which is dependent on the system), and to the word for individual numbers in a given language (see <a href="../../../e/t/r/Etruscan_numerals.html" title="Etruscan numerals">Etruscan numerals</a>, which doesn't really fit in the "numerals" series). For purposes of the <i>system</i>, they are really all just the same, and have been since the ninth century. The Arabic/Western/Indian variants are just so many typographical / notational variants of the same symbols. Therefore, the <i>system</i> (positional notation and all that) should be discussed <i>once</i>, in a central article, and not on the article treating the Western variant. Adoption of the numerals in the West is complicated enough to fill this article. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:53, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I agree with that (split b/w glyphs and nuumeral system)! But "Hindu-Arabic numerals" <i>is</i> the Western variant, not any of the other symbol sets that use the same numeral system. An answer to why we shouldn't have "Hindu-Arabic numerals" in a way we don't have "Hindu-Thai numerals." First, to me the aim of this whole exercise is solely to make wikipedia reflect mainstream academic consensus. The reason, IMO, why things are the way they are is that the Hindu-Arabic numerals are known to have a direct common ancestor with the Nagari numerals (०, १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९), so the symbols themselves evolved from Indian numerals (this evolution of symbols is well documented), while the Thai numerals (๐,๑,๒,๓,๔,๕,๖,๗,๘,๙) are quite different. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 18:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>well, ok, so how do we refer to the system in general then?

<p>The introduction is incorrect. The numerals were not called "Arabic" by Europeans to contrast them against Greek and Roman numerals, but because the Arabs were the people that transmitted them. As it currently reads, it seems like the Europeans just picked a name out of a hat to make it different from what they already had. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 18:52, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Arabic numerals is the term usually applied to the "Western" variant of the Hindu-Arabic numerals, " is also incorrect, since there are no "variants" of the Hindu-Arabic numerals. The term refers unambiguously to the standard symbols we use. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 19:04, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>look, the symbols are equivalent to those grouped under <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_numerals.html" title="Indian numerals">Indian numerals</a>, and in this sense, variants. Unicode considers them different glyphs. What is the term to refer to the ensemble of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_numerals.html" title="Indian numerals">Indian numerals</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals.html" title="Arabic numerals">Arabic numerals</a> (geographic terms referring to variants of the same symbols, and the same system), then? Also, the numerals were called "Arabic" numerals in Europe to distinguish them from the Roman numerals. Obviously they were called "Arabic" and not "Australian" or "Martian" because they were adopted from the Arabs, but the statement that the qualifier was necessary to distinguish them from "what they already had" is still true. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 19:15, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What are formally referred as "Hindu-Arabic numerals" and colloquially as "Arabic numerals" are the exact same numerals.

<dd>I thought "Hindu-Arabic numeral system" as a term for the system was yours. If you find a better term, we can redirect "Hindu-Arabic numerals" to the Western variant, but as long as we have "Hindu-Arabic numeral system" for the entire "Indian-Persian-Arabian-European continuum", I suppose <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numerals_48fc.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> will have to be a dab page. If the Indian variants can be grouped as <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_numerals.html" title="Indian numerals">Indian numerals</a>, and the Arabian ones, per <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Arabic numerals (disambiguation)">Arabic numerals (disambiguation)</a> can be called either "Arabic" or "Arabic-Indic", it seems only logical to refer to their sum as "Hindu-Arabic" or "Arabic-Indic". The Western variant just happens to be commonly called "Arabic", but "Hindu-Arabic" is fine too; I have yet to be convinced that "Hindu-Arabic" is used for the Western numerals <i>to the exclusion</i> of Eastern variants. At the very least, it would be highly misleading if a contrast was intended between the terms "Hindu-Arabic" on one hand and "Arabic-Indic" on the other.</dd>
<dd>My entire point is this: The very reason the numerals were called <i>arqam hindiyyah</i> in Arabic, and <i>numeri Indorum</i> and later "Arabic numerals" in the West is that they <b>were</b> considered identical; it is only in the 20th/21st century as we are trying to typeset various alphabets that we consider them different "glyphs" (in Unicode etc.), depending on their style as used in conjunction with the different alphabets. Of course, this means that we can have independent articles about the "national variants" now, but <i>historically</i> they (both the system and the symbols) are a single entity. Therefore, it is clear that there should be a single article about the system itself, with various sub-articles such as this one, treating regional adoption and variation.</dd>
<dd>I maintain that "Brahmi numerals" or similar is not so good, since the <i>system</i> (including positional zero) was only complete in AD 500, or even AD 800, long after the original Brahmi numerals. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 20:39, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are absolutely correct.

I am 100% sure that the term "Hindu-Arabic numerals" excludes Eastern variants (like Arabic-Indic, Devanagari, etc) and is reserved for the "Western" variant (e.g., <a href="http://www.cenius.net/refer/articles/h/hinduarabicnumeral/hinduarabicnumeral.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cenius.net/refer/articles/h/hinduarabicnumeral/hinduarabicnumeral.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://www.wordwebonline.com/en/HINDUARABICNUMERAL" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wordwebonline.com/en/HINDUARABICNUMERAL" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://www.rhymezone.com/r/rhyme.cgi?Word=Hindu-arabic%20numeral" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rhymezone.com/r/rhyme.cgi?Word=Hindu-arabic%20numeral" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://lings.ln.man.ac.uk/More/Haas/Art%20of%20Literacy/num.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://lings.ln.man.ac.uk/More/Haas/Art%20of%20Literacy/num.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Hindu-Arabic+numeral" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Hindu-Arabic+numeral" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>,<a href="http://edtech.suhsd.k12.ca.us/curriculum/web/hunttheorigin.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://edtech.suhsd.k12.ca.us/curriculum/web/hunttheorigin.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, etc.. ). Of course, the term "Hindu-Arabic <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numeral_system.html" title="Numeral system">numeral system</a>" does not refer to the "Indian-Persian-Arabian-European" family of glyphs, but to the abstract concepts involved in manipulation of numbers (like place-value, base-10 system, zero digit, etc.) I don't think there is a formal name for this glyph family that academcians use. These variants are usually considered to be a part of the related alphabets (e.g., see articles <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_alphabet.html" title="Arabic alphabet">Arabic alphabet</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/j/Gujarati_script.html" title="Gujarati script">Gujarati script</a>, etc.) "Hindu-Arabic" and "Arabic-Indic" numerals are similar, but not similar enough to be considered variations in typesetting/font. (The difference is similar to difference between the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devanagari_script.html" title="Devanagari script">Devanagari script</a> and the <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurmukhi_script.html" title="Gurmukhi script">Gurmukhi script</a> (or the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_alphabet.html" title="Roman alphabet">Roman alphabet</a> and the <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrillic_alphabet.html" title="Cyrillic alphabet">Cyrillic alphabet</a>), comparable but not mutually intelligible without some learning.) <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 21:21, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>not to artificially prolong this debate, but I see no reason to have he article at <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numerals_%28system%29_c5f5.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numerals (system)">Hindu-Arabic numerals (system)</a> when it can be at bracket-less <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_5a2e.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numeral system">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a>. Just a minor point, of course. The "(glyphs)" addition makes much more sense at <i>this</i> article, where we want to stress that it is about the glyphs, and their adoption in Europe. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 09:59, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know I voted for Arabic numerals on the grounds of common sense, but I now suggest that this page be merged into Hindu Arabic numerals. For whatever reason, it seems that there is a strong body of opinion that a page trumpeting the historical Hindu connection <i>must</i> exist, even at the cost of having two pages about the same thing. I know the normal wikipedia guidelines say to go with common usage. But at the end of the day, they're just guidelines. For me, having a long winded title that isn't what the vast majority of the population actually uses is preferable to having two pages about what is (as far as I can tell) the same thing. It might confuse people a bit, but not as much as having two versions of the same page.

<p>I would not find two separate pages confusing. Indeed that would be much clearer since there is so much disputed territory. See my comment under the vote area for details. There is no reason why Wikipedia needs to adopt the prejudices and/or the resolutions of disagreements of the commercial encyclopedias who try to satisfy a commercial market. Online sources have room for both. And in cases where a firm determination of details cannot be made it is the way to go. The sources that mention a 9 character numerical system in India do not say there were no similar systems elsewhere. The Muslims were collecting all information at the time. It worked well for them back then. May the concept of collecting all information now work well for us too. I don't think hyphenations are useful... look at what a mess they have created for the census bureau in listing differences or origin among populations.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your comment on the vote indicates that you think there is some ambiguity regarding the origins of the numerals and/or the numeral system. There isn't any such ambiguity, and most mainstream historians have a consensus on both the history and terminology. It is important to reflect it on wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 06:44, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hindu numbers could well have had ancestral roots via Phoenicians, Sumerians or other cultures of the area. The trade routes have many numerical styles even today and idea flow is still multidirectional. Maths, being sacred, were typically kept secret requiring initiation/education so it is rare to find evidence one way or the other.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems there are no wikipages on Phoenician or Sumerian maths yet. No accident that Pythagoras was a Phoenician, son of Mnesarchus of Tyre.. His mathematikoi were very secretive and at the highest level. The wiki article on Pythagoras could use the infusion of someone more versed in math history.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sumerians had a place concept as early as the 4th millenium according to Sarton who also discusses the "secreta secretorum". I might quote Sarton - it seems appropriate here: "Dogmatic teaching, even at its best, tends to create an impression of finality which is more satisfying than stimulating."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>To hyphenate is to obfuscate giving neither term its proper precision nor attention. Separate pages gives what is known in each case which I think would be clearer to most people, including me. Or we could say Phoenician-Egyptian-Sumero-Huama-Sabean-Hindu-Arabic -Numerals.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>The aim of such a discussion on wikipedia is to arrive at a term which conforms to wikipedia policies and the most acceptable academic standards (preferred by most mainstream academicians), and we tend to keep our own points of view on whether or not we think the term is justifiable or not out of the discussion. This is purely a question of using nomenclature that is more appropiate in the formal context of an encyclopedia, and has nothing to do with which civilization contributed how much to mathematics. This is not an exercise in distributing credits to different civilizations. There is good reason why "Phoenician-Egyptian-Sumero-Huama-Sabean-" is not included in the name by any historian of mathematics even though they had a positional system (nomenclature is based on established direct descendence, which is unambiguous), but this discussion is not about discussing whether modern historians are smart enough or not. For our purposes, it is enough to know that historians (and academicians in general), who know all that we do about these numerals and much more, prefer the term Hindu-Arabic numerals. Also, please note that this article is about the glyphs and does not concern with the positional system. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 13:08, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you want to call them Hindu mumerals - do so. But most people will not find the info they are seeking if you do so without cross referencing to and from Arabic numerals. Hyphenation to denote successive origins is poor policy. That is, hyphenation paints one into a semantic corner. Arabic numerals is a valid stable term. So is Hindu numerals. But Hindu-Arabic numerals is not, no matter what the current fashion or political preference is.</dd>

<dd>Well, Hindu-Arabic numerals is the modern term. The school textbooks in many countries have changed from Arabic numerals to this term, while some haven't yet (I have learned that USA is one of those who haven't yet updated., see for example comments: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deeptrivia&amp;diff=31420853&amp;oldid=31418091" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deeptrivia&amp;diff=31420853&amp;oldid=31418091" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deeptrivia&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=31422912" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deeptrivia&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=31422912" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>) At wikipedia, our aim is to report facts the way they are, and so we have to base everything on references from elsewhere. In this sense, you can call it a "follower." This is important to prevent it from turning into a chaotic place. Of course, in many other ways, it's the leader! I hope this helps.

<dd>Hyphenation of capitalized modifiers is <b>not</b> modern usage. School textbooks are often more political than academic. If you are writing for children perhaps that is appropriate but the treatment of "Intelligent Design" makes children's texts a dubious source. As for mathematicians-- back when the Brittanica was written for adults and math articles were written by expert mathematicians the article on "Numbers" gives quite a good article of both Arabic and Indian numbers in their context and also Syriac, Phoenician, Palmyrene, Hieratic, Eastern Arabic, Devanagari, Cave Indian, Ghobar, etc. Arthur Cayley's article still is quite good in the light of modern research. Georges Ifrah uses the terms "Arabic Numerals" and "Hindi Numerals" in the modern <b>The Universal History of Numbers&#160;: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer</b>, Wiley Publishers, 1999. Wiley is a reputable publisher in the areas of maths and sciences...their editors would surely be "up-to-date" on usages. <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471375683.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471375683.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> --NorthernJudy 19:56, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>(Un)fortunately, most academicians in various fields including history and science do not bother to scan through the rulebooks of modern English usage before they coin their terms. Perhaps they don't think these rules are as important as you and I do. Once they've coined it, we can do little about it. We simply have to use it. There's absolutely no dearth of terms involving hyphenation of capitalized modifiers (eg, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryans_3ed8.html" title="Indo-Aryans">Indo-Aryans</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_language_3a39.html" title="Proto-Indo-European language">Proto-Indo-European language</a>) and you'll keep hitting them everywhere.</li>

<li>School textbooks are not "sources" here. I talked about school textbooks to put across the point that many of us who were in primary school a decade or two ago (or even now in several countries) would understandably be used-to using "Arabic numerals", since what is learnt at that age is hard to unlearn (explaining why so many editors would still oppose the change), but this has been changing lately, atleast in countries that have bothered to find some time out of "Intelligent Design" debates and updated their textbooks in other ways. Again, there's no politics associated with this naming.</li>

<dl>
<dd>"Q. In a previous Q&amp;A, a curious reader asked you to weigh in on the subject of hyphenated Americans. You responded that “CMS prefers not to hyphenate Americans of any sort, even when they appear in an adjective phrase.” Were it actually an adjectival phrase, like “apathetic Americans,” I would be inclined to agree; however, I maintain that the examples “African-American,” “Asian-American,” and even “Native-American” (or as I prefer, American-Indian) are all compound proper nouns and must be hyphenated. They are not merely Americans who happen to be African, but rather <b>African-Americans—a distinct ethnic and cultural group.</b> Irrefutable logic?"</dd>

<dd>I really appreciate your good intentions of spreading Chicago style manual (et al) rules over all the global academic community, but apparently, they have been ignoring these rules, and we are unauthorised to reject a term simply because of that. Wikipedia merely reflects the terminology that is most widely accepted to be appropriate (of course, you will always find a few exceptions). It is beyond its scope to debate this acceptance on technical grounds. That would be the scope of a research paper. So you can get one published in an academic journal, explaining all your arguments on why the term should not be used, and hopefully they will start making the change. If a few decades down the line a majority of them starts using a term that doesn't include a hyphenation (referring to the Q&amp;A above, is "Hindu Arabic numerals" what they suggest is appropriate?), we will surely make that change on wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 15:10, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The numerals are wrong for Urdu. Urdu doesnt use that 4. The Urdu 4 looks more like the heart symbol &lt;with the point downwards&gt;, chopped in half &lt;We use the left? half, can't remember been too long&gt; with a line from what was the cusp extending up. It's hard to find the symbol on the net, however when I learnt Urdu numerals, we used that instead of the Persian four. This symbol, I havent been able to find even in Unicode. Other than that Urdu writes numerals left-to-right and words right-to-left, this is a holdover from British Raj.</p>

<p>Sorry if I've missed it in the article - but when I was a kid, I read in the "how and why wonder book of mathematics" that the glyphs for "Arabic numerals" was based on the number of angles within the glyph; the following article <a href="http://arabicnumerals.tripod.com/" class="external text" title="http://arabicnumerals.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">Arabic Numerals</a> gives an illustration of this concept.</p>
<p>Is this total bunkum? I'm hoping not as I've trotted it out to many people over the years.

<dd>Are you talking about the hook at the top, or the cross? French and German speakers cross their sevens (and often their Z's), so if the cross is the funny part - there's about 150 million people doing it every day. The germans also draw big loops on the bottom of their 9's</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Perhaps people ought to try to understand each other's points here. There is nothing particularly "cute" or "funny" about the way Germans and others write certain numerals, but if these hooks and crosses are relatively modern (which I think they are), of course they cannot be invoked when explaining the origins of the glyphs.--<a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoe_b8ad.html" title="User:Noe">Niels Ø</a> 16:39, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Sure, <a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoe_b8ad.html" title="User:Noe">Niels Ø</a>. Nothing serious here. Just wanted to say that I've never seen a 7 with a horizontal line at the bottom (like shown on <a href="http://arabicnumerals.tripod.com/" class="external text" title="http://arabicnumerals.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a> tripod.com homepage referred above). I completely appreciate the importance of understanding different points of view, but notability is also one of our concerns. I personally always cross my Zs and 7s, so it's not that I'm ridiculing the Germans and French for doing that (I didn't even know that crossing is believed to be more prevelant in those countries -- we do it all the time in India.) <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 17:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So that's basically my question; is it all hooey? This <a href="http://laputan.blogspot.com/2003_06_01_laputan_archive.html" class="external text" title="http://laputan.blogspot.com/2003_06_01_laputan_archive.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> gives a "7" and a "9" that more accurately reflects what I saw written in my childhood maths book - and are more credible than the tripod link. German handwritten 9's are extremely close to this figure, and the foot on the "7" seems more believable than the admittedly peculiar constructs on the tripod link. (When posing the question, I found the tripod link for illustrative purposes - and did not read beyond "6" as "1-6" all agreed with memory - so mea culpa there.)</dd>
<dd>So I'd rather know that it is indeed all crud (conveniently reverse-engineered as <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> suggests) and never repeat it - or know that there is a grain of truth in it.</dd>
<dd>Aside/Trivia: Discussing this with someone yesterday, they said that when they grew up in Ireland/UK in the 1930s - a crossed seven were always referred to as "a French seven". <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugo_97f5.html" title="User:Dugo">Dugo</a> 13:38, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I always learnt with this angle stuff too. Anyway, even more stupid trivia for <i>cut</i> sevens: When God said "7. You shall not commit adultery.", Moses wrote it with a non-crossed seven, but someone started shouting "Cut the seven! Cut the seven!" (to remove it from the list), and so he did cut it, that's why it has this cutting stroke in the middle... Lol... 200.230.213.152 04:37, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just checked out Ifrah's book on the history of numbers, which is a 600 page comprehensive book. It contains half a dozen theories like this (including this) under a section on "Fanciful Explanations for hte origin of "Arabic" numerals" which have long been rejected. This one comes from a Spaniard Carlos Le Maur (1778). These explanations, the book says "are flawed because they are the fruit of the pseudo-scientific imaginations of men who are fooled by appearances and who jump to conclusions which completely contradict both historical facts and the results of epigraphic and palaeographic research". It's a pity that some schools still teach this angle stuff! <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 00:06, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
