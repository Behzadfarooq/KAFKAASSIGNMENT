<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal to split</span></h2>
<p>I may regret ever writing this, but I'd like to propose to separate the Views section into Positions on Arab-Israeli conflict or whetever better title we can come up with. At 70k, this is one of the longest and most controversial articles in WP. While the history section has more or less crystallized, the Views section often deteriorates and makes the whole article even more unmanageable. Couple of notes I'd like to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of attempts to separate artificially Palestinian/Arab from Israeli/Jewish views in different corners, IMHO it is better to come up with a list of grievances and then describe them as claim/counterclaim. It is wrong to leave the reader without the view from the other side.</li>
<li>Since recently, there is an effort (either conscious or not) to turn it into a clone of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</li>
<li>I think it is important that we also reflect also <i>other</i> views, preferably sourced mainstream scholars. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 12:00, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<p>"Instead of attempts to separate artificially Palestinian/Arab from Israeli/Jewish views in different corners, IMHO it is better to come up with a list of grievances and then describe them as claim/counterclaim. It is wrong to leave the reader without the view from the other side."</p>
<p>I agree with this point, and think that doing this would reduce some of the redundancy of the article... (i.e., mentioning that Israel/Jews view the Palestinian right of return as not viable because they won't live in peace... and mentioning it every time the Palestinian refugee situation is brought up... way too much).</p>
<p>I do not, however, agree that moving the "issues" section to a separate area should be done... why? Because the history section focuses largely on the past, but the issues section often discusses current issues in slightly more depth. If we do this, the history section will just expand to encompass the varying subtleties... as well, when people click on "Arab-Israeli conflict" they expect to see some degree of focus on the current conflict. When I click on "Mexican-American relations" (which may or may not exist in Wikipedia, who knows), I expect to see things primarily about NAFTA, etc, and not about the Mexican-American war and other things from 100 years ago. Anyway... obviously we need to include the background, but for this, and other, reasons I would say that we need to keep everything on the same page.</p>
<p>So, I think that reorganizing the views section into each point would be good.</p>
<p>A few points:</p>
<p>1. There is no need to, for example, present lots and lots of quotations, as is done in the quote section and as is done in the Arab aggression section... I think we all know that we could probably find many quotations from each side saying many different things... a few quotes from a few primary players is probably sufficient. I was planning to find counterbalancing quotes from ben-Gurion, etc, but, really... what's the point of having like a dozen quotes from each side? It's just too much.</p>
<p>2. The primary argument should be presented first... when I first came to this topic, and others, I found that, for example, in the Settlement argument it started off by saying something like "Isrealis do not believe that Palestians are justified in arguing against settlements because..." The position should start off with the main controversy (e.g., "The construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank is a flash point because...") AND THEN follow with the rebuttals. There are too many places, including on this page, where the rebuttal is presented first.</p>
<p>3. The issues should be presented one after another for each side... in other words, it should not be all the Israeli views and then all the Arab views, but should be presented one after another, alternating. It's important to remember that NPOV, in my opinion, also means presentation on the page.</p>
<p>So, why not go ahead and try to reorganize the views by point... It would be best if you did this without first adding any new content... i.e., lets work with the content that we have and first try on grouping things together without adding new content... adding new content will just complicate things. I suppose it is best to start doing this in that sandbox/rewrite area that Vinditas proposed. Once we have a basic grouping down, we can then replace the current article and work on removing redundancies... of which there are many on both sides.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Lokiloki, you seem to mix up Arab-Israeli conflict with Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There were no Jewish settlements of 1967 in 1948, and to promote this PLO version is to rewrite history. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 12:31, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not rewriting history as the Arab-Israeli conflict is ongoing, and, as I have argued elsewhere in this discussion page, has to do more with people versus people in its current incarnation (rather than, say, 50 years ago when it was more country versus countries or vice versa). The larger Arab-Israeli conflicted is significantly impacted by, for example, the expansion of settlements and their presentation on Arab media. As is mentioned at the beginning, much of the current Arab-Israeli conflict (for instance, Al Q., Iran, etc) base their claims on the impacts of Israel on Palestine... so, while there is certainly an israle-pal conflict, there are overlaps, particularly nowadays.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I was also going to say: Again, I think this is probably best done in the "sand pit" area without adding any new content... perhaps we could temporarily "lock" editing on the main page so people don't add new content. We could then generally agree with the composition of the page, and then replace the main article with the new composition... and then start arguing over redundancies and wording</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unless you want to make a first stab in the sandpit area, if you like, I can make the proposed mergers in the sand pit area in about 16 hours. I can only make a few minor changes at the moment because I have to do some work also.</dd>

<p>I think I would agree with locking the page until we get a lot of stuff sorted out. Also I agree with Loki that people coming to this page are expecting to see the issues of the current conflict, maybe we should move the some of the history to a "History of the Israeli-Arab conflict" article or somthing. I do however think we could move a lot of the issues to another page like the biased text books and zionism is rascism stuff as well as the counterclaims for both of those areas.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 12:46, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I very much disagree with Loki's feeling that history is unimportant here. Putting the conflict into historical perspective is one of the most important things this page can do for readers. I agree with Humus's suggestion to merge that started this section, above. I think this will be helpful for decreasing length of the article. I hope that balance can be maintained during this process. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">elizmr</a> 14:06, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think looking back when I first starting reading wikipedia I would be more inclined to read the history sections more. But since I started editing it I would concentrate more on the issue part of it since that is where the controversy and POV is, so maybe we should move a lot more of the issues than the history to the new article.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 01:05, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't agree with the decision to split. The history section could be shortened, not least because there are already different articles on every facet of the history, e.g., six-day-war, independence, first infitada, etc. It seems bizarre and unnecessary to split out views, as these are, in my ways, the crux of the issue, currently. I will point out, also, that there is no section on the current issues of this conflict. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 02:02, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think most people coming here are going to be more interested in the history section than in all of the issues and stuff, since the issues basically just represent various POV's and the average person wil probably be turned off if he has no interest in editing them.

<dd>I do not agree that the history and views can be easily teased apart. If we do this, then I will start to edit both of them to represent what are currently missing pieces of the history. For example, the current history simply iterates the wars between arab and israel... it does not spell out facts on the ground in regards to settlement activities, targeted killings, human rights violations, and other aspects which are represented in the views section: these facts should be in the history section, but I have held off on adding them there because they are pretty sufficiently represented in the Views area. Splitting the article will require me to represent these important historical considerations in the history section. Moving the history and views apart will then require addition of some of these aspects INTO the history section to better reflect the history comprehensively. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 02:21, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Humiliation" as a pretext for terrorist attacks</span></h2>
<p>Lokiloki, do you do this on intention? The Arabs attacked Israel before the settlements and before Israel supposedly "humiliating" of the Palestinians. Did you ever undergo security measures in an airport? The audience of Al-Jazeera readily believes in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2073.html" title="The Protocols of the Elders of Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a></i>, should we include it as a factor in the conflict as well? The BTselem numbers are skewed: they include both terrorists and civilians. The numbers don't belong here. No other conflict/war in the article lists the numbers. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 08:30, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Huh? If you deny the numbers, then please provide citations to suggest some different set of numbers. Those were obtained from the BBC, which I am afraid to tell you is pretty well regarded in the world. If you want to find a WorldNetNews citation saying no Palestinians were killed, well, I guess you can do that. But, for now, the statistics stay. Even Moshi, in another article, said that these statistics were well-accepted such that the mention of BTselem wasn't even necessary. And, whats the point in fighting about this: the REFERENCE that existed before the numbers were broken out was to the exact same BBC page that I linked to, and that reference differentiated between who was killed. I simply took the statistics straight from the BBC Web site that was already cited there.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You are talking about 1948 in terms of Arabs attacking Israel... okay. And that is well-represented by the multitude of photographs and prior descriptions on your page, including the POV map and POV cartoon. I am saying that the CURRENT Arab-Israeli conflict is part of a media war, of which images such as this are potent, recurring, and powerful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I think I said elsewhere, you can presumably fight all day with me on this, and you can rewrite history to present your viewpoint. But I think you will find that you will be the worse for it: people will not trust Wikipedia as a presenter of the COMPLETE facts, and they will find even more extreme interpretations than this. You should try to reflect on this and undertand that your caricatured cartoon is also POV... not that Nassar didn't want to beat Israel, but, for isntance, in the anti-Semetic caricature...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As it is, I will continue to reinsert these images, as I feel that they are essential to understanding this conflict.</dd>

<p>No, it is part of the larger Arab-Israeli conflict, as these images figure prominently into the current Arab-Israeli conflict, cited by al-Q, Egypt, Iran, Syria, etc... i.e., these countries view the images, such as this, and it impact them significantly. What is the purpose of denying this? You can clean out all images such as this, but they will still be presented on Al-Jazeera... don't you think it is better to present the facts, including images? Do you really want such a pyrrhic victory? If you want to remove these so-called propoganda images, you can do so, but also remove the POV cartoon image. It may well be the case that many Arab countries hated Israel, but to communicate that in a crude, caricatured cartoon is equally point of view. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 08:52, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Countering Systemic Bias</span></h2>
<p>If anyone wants to see bias at work, go to the Islam and other religions page: a group of rabid islamofascits have taken over that page, protected by a monitor who in violation of wikipedia rules "disappears" editors who attempt to provide a npov to the article. wikipedia is not a valid reliable source of information so long as it permits extremest monitors to "own" certain sites.Incorrect 16:29, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am extremely dishearted by what I have found on Wikipedia. Given demographics, I suppose it is no surprise that in the last week+ of editing the Arab-Israeli conflict, I have pretty much single-handedly represented the "Arab" views -- the vast majority of other editors have made changes that could reasonably be characterized as pro-Israel. When I first came to this article, it was pretty much single-handedly a pro-Israel screed, with even the "Arab views" sections starting off presenting Israeli views... and the fact that there are no Human Rights pages for Israel or the West Bank?</p>
<p>I realize that people should write what they know. But it is very upsetting to find this place at the tyranny of the majority. As I said, the majority of editors here write from a pro-Israel perspective. How can this be countered? It does not appear that we can rely on the "Countering systemic bias" team. It's sorta upsetting, too, not least because I am DISinterested in this topic... the only Arab I know was the guy I just spoke to on the phone at the PLO office (getting permission to use the "controversial" image). But others clearly are interested in this topic, and are pushing POVs that are pretty extreme.</p>
<p>Do you not all see that the Arab view is only sporadically represented here? Do you not see that denying an equal presentations of facts is indeed a Pyrhhic victory? Do you think that this one-sided presentation will encourage people to trust, read, or contribute? At least for this topic, it most surely won't.</p>

<dd>I find the phrase, "pretty much single-handedly a pro-Israel screed," is <b>uncivil</b> and **<b>highly insulting</b>** to the editors who have been working on this page up until recently. Reading through the page, there have been many editors working here with many points of view. If the page didn't read like a "boycott Israel" fact sheet, that's because this is Wikipedia and all points of view are supposed to be presented here in a respectful way. I am very confused about exactly what is happening with the current rewrite. Could someone please state what exactly the goals and process are here? <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">elizmr</a> 14:04, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The goal is to represent the facts neutrally, comprehensively, and diligently. I believe that the facts as of a few days ago were not done so in this manner, with many of the "Arab views" sections begininng not with Arab views, but Israeli rebuttals right away. That you feel the BBC is biased, and that presumably, like Humus, you will debate their sourcing is very upsetting. Humus offers right-wing Israeli news sources as a source alternative to the BBC. As I said, I found all of the citations on the BBC because I had assumed that most people would accept it as the most neutral arbitrar available. I have also quoted from the US State Dept, the CIA, etc, in an attempt to find acceptable sources. If you like, I will start to use NPR itself, as well as CNN, MSNBC, etc. (Except that the latter don't really have very detailed work at all.) <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 20:24, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please discuss deletions on talk before making them. I would once again like to recommend that we agree on versions represented on talk. Anyone can edit the temp version and post a link to their preferred version here, so that we can all discuss it. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 10:08, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Per Viriditas instructions:</p>
<p>Slated for deletion: The following paragraph appears in the "Jewish Settlements in the West Bank" section; as near as I can tell, it has nothing to do with that section: "In 2000, at Camp David, the Palestinians were offered a nominally independent state composed of discontiguous parts of most of Gaza and the West Bank, with Israeli control over its airspace, borders and trade. Led by Arafat, the Palestinians rejected this offer, claiming that this state would be a "Bantustan" (a state divided in many pieces) without sovereignty. President Clinton and the Israelis asked the Palestinians to offer a counter-proposal, but Arafat declined and returned to the West Bank. Later, further negotiations did take place, but they were terminated by the Israeli side. In his book The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace, Dennis Ross, the American ambassador and facilitator, asserts that the idea the Palestinian state would be a "Bantustan" was a myth, and provides maps showing an offer that included contiguous territory. [40]"</p>
<p>If you object to the deletion of the aforementioned please let me know why.</p>
<p>I also plan to delete the TWO disputed facts that have not found any citations for a few days (that Israel maintains a population exchange occured; and that Israel won't bring Pal refugees back because Arab states won't deal with Jewish refugees). If you object to this, I request that you please provide citations. By the way, I have mentioned that these will deleted several times in the talk page, and no one has commented or raised any concern or provided citations, so I am planning to delete tomorrow unless I hear otherwise.</p>

<p>Well, I was trying to reduce the size of the article... I deleted an entire "pro" Palestinian section too (because it was turgid and didn't seem to say much of anything), but that was also added back. Anyway, I moved that content to a new section in Israeli views.</p>

<p>The temp page is probably okay, provided that the POV map (in my opinion, and which has been mentioned by others elsewhere) isn't repeated again and again on the history and views page. The introduction probably needs some expansion to include more information: the current two paragraphs that are there are more or less worthless, in my opinion, because they have been so qualified and neutured that they don't really say anything. I mean, sentences like this just waste space: "Animosity emanating from this conflict has caused numerous attacks on supporters (or perceived supporters) of one side by supporters of the other side in many countries around the world." That's like saying "A human can drink water from a tap or other source, but water can also be drunk by itself."

<blockquote>
<p>A powerful example of this divide can be found in opinion surveys of Palestinians and Israelis. In a March, 2005 poll 63% of the Israelis blamed the failure of the Oslo Peace Process on Palestinian violence, but only 5% of the Palestinians agreed. 54% of Palestinians put the blame on continuing Israeli settlement activity, but only 20% of the Israelis agreed [1]. It is therefore difficult to develop a single, objective reason for the conflict, so this article will present some of the arguments made by each side, in turn.</p>

The history of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proposals_for_a_Palestinian_state_4ccb.html" title="Proposals for a Palestinian state">Proposals for a Palestinian state</a> shows exactly the opposite: the Arab leaders refused to create a Palestinian state consistently over the decades:</p>

<p>Your use of the term "Israel's existence as a Jewish state" is POV in that it frames the argument as 1) a demographic issue of increasing Arabs in Israel and 2) that the issue is so black or white that it is all about whether or not Israel exists, or not. I am not arguing that both of these arguments hare part of this conflict. They are. However, while both of are important, it is inexact to represent the entire conflict in the most extreme example. That is similar to George Bush's argument that "the freedom of the World is at stake" when he makes his arguments. Indeed, in the A-I conflict, there is much subtlety and additional facets, and it is inappropriate to reflect the most extreme aspects of the conflict in the caption. The term "The future of Israel" is more neutral and highlights the fact that it is not all about Israel's "existence". <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 06:01, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(i edited this and then couldn't post it because V posted in-between. and again!&#160;;)&#160;;)) By that I mean it is the most extreme example in that some parties claim Israel should not exist. However, by using that as the framing for the entire argument, it bypasses the other facets and subtleties of the conflict, and represents it as a "life or death" conflict by Jewish Israelis. I realize that this is indeed the concern for some, and that threats against Israel are made, but I think most parties would agree that Israel's very existence is not under threat (unless youare talking about Iran, but they are not Arab).</p>
<p>By using your phrasing, you bypass the other subtleties such as economic involvement, refugees in Arab countries, the Arab media, the use of the conflict as a tool in Arab govt's, etc etc. I just don't understand why you cannot agree to a more NPOV statement. I am tired of sentence battles everyday with you. You take and reflect pro-Israeli POVs, and I am trying to compromise here: why can't you agree to more neutral framing, really?

I do not propose hiding information, and I think you will agree that the future of Israel, its threats, and so on are represented in the article. But to state that the very "existence of the Jewish state" is at stake phrases things in an overwrought, obtuse manner, and frames the issues as one of Israel hanging by a thread, will it survive or not.</p>
<p>Almost all agree that Israel will survive (even if its Arab neighbors wouldn't want it to (but even this is not that accurate, as many have signed agreements, etc., with Israel), and this phrasing ignores and, indeed, hides subtleties of the situation. And I will further state that the Pal-Israeli conflict reflects on the Arab-Israeli conflict as it is an important touchstone for that conflict.</p>
<p>I again maintain that the phrasing I proposed is more neutral. The Arab-Israeli conflict should not be boiled down to a sentence which suggests that the fate of Israel's very existence is at stake.</p>

So Morocco doesn't accept Israel? The "core" conflict is a matter of perspective. Do you think if you went to, say, Egypt and asked a man on the street what he saw the core conflict of Arab-Israel he would say, "oh it is because we don't accept them". Of course not.</p>
<p>Indeed, Arab nations would <b>NOT</b> describe the issue as their unacceptance of Israel (of which many actually accept Israel) <b>BUT</b> they would probably describe it as an issue of colonialism, of the Nakba, of settlements, and so on.</p>
<p>It is a totally Israeli perspective to define it all as an issue of Arab leaders not accepting Israel. Do you think they just do that for the heck of it, or do you think that they might have some perspective on why they do that? Do you think that their perspectives should be taken into consideration for this article, or should we make it all from an Israeli perspective? Please let me know, because if you want a POV article, similar to the right-wing articles you cite from (as opposed to the horribly unfair BBC), then I will leave and we can mark this article POV and we can let you rule the roost.</p>
<p>I am trying to be NPOV and put a neutral description. If I took your approach, I would have changed it to: "The establishment of Israel on lands occupied by Palestinians, their eviction, and the continued human rights abuses by Israel in the occupied territories, including settlement building..." I am not doing that because I do not believe that is a fair perspective.</p>
<p>BUT I am beginning to realize that to deal with you I may just have to do what you do and push extreme POV positions.</p>

<dd>Israel was established by the UN in 1947.

<p>There are so many facts in this article, in the Views section, that we are forced to split the argument into 3 section.

<p>Your "summary" of the events is also biased: it's all about Arab leaders rejecting totally fair and grand gestures on the part of Israel, right? It's all the Arab leaders fault. It is POV to summarize in such shorthand and then say, in effect, see, I told you it is all about Israel and its very existence. You should know that there is far more history and background than simply Arab leaders supposedly rejecting out-of-hand anything to do with Israel, not least because that doesn't describe the CURRENT conflict. So you are saying that Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Cormoros, etc etc, just totally refuse to even recognize Israel and call for its destruction day after day?</p>
<p>Even if that was the case, to say that this is the core of the issue, without reflecting on why the Arab states might be doing this belies a POV that is unconstructive. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 08:23, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lokiloki, <i>why</i> do they do this is a secondary issue. <i>Whose fault</i> it is, is a tertiary issue (no one's an angel) and this is not what we are talking about. Please don't switch the topic.</dd>
<dd>I hope you still remember the quotes by Azzam Pasha, Nasser, Assad, Saddam, Qaddafi, etc. They didn't have any problem announcing their goal loud and clear. Even WP proudly brandishes "Illegitimacy or illegality of Israel" as a major Arab view. When you suddenly switched from "Viability of a Palestinian State" to some fuzzy "future of Israel" in place of "Israel as a Jewish state", <b>you</b> confirmed it too, so why deny it?</dd>
<dd>I am wondering, what is that mysterious "future" that you refer to. You shyly ignored Spain/Basques and Turkey/Kurds. Perhaps you may try to assert that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Troubles_79c5.html" title="The Troubles">British-N. Irish conflict</a> is about the "future of the UK"? Note, none of these states' existence is threatened by their local conflicts.</dd>
<dd>Everyone is entitled to their own POV. You may deny documented facts, but you cannot make WP do it. Comoros &amp; Co. are not the leaders but rather followers. BTW, someone here insisted that Qatar is not a part of the AIC: see <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N14382130.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N14382130.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 10:22, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "illegit/illegal" point is not "proudly brandished" as you say. I have denied no documented facts. I am denying your POV characterization of this conflict, which is quite different.</p>
<p>The conflict is about both the past and the present. Now, the State of Israel is a fait accompli, and its future existence is not significantly part of the present facts aside from political rhetoric. That is to say, the future is about borders, treaties, terrorism, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, settlements, reparations, refugees, and the like. To this end, the "future" is about this basket of issues... the very "existence of a Jewish state" is not a major present fact, except in empty rhetoric and propangada from both sides.</p>
<p>It's like describing al-Q and the USA as "The conflict is about the very existence of the United States": it's just silliness to characterize the conflict in that way. Yes, al-Q doesn't want USA to exist. But to characterize it in such a way is useful for politically expediency to exaggerate threats and make the USA (or Israel) as a STATE appear to be under grave danger, just as the statement you are arguing for does.</p>
<p><i>P.S., You should well know that I am not shy, so, as for Basque/Spain/France, Kurds/Turkey/Iraq, N.Ireland/Ireland/England, I might not be smart enough because I could not understand the parallels you were trying to draw.</i></p>
<p><i>P.P.S., So, Morocco is simply a "follower" and not in control over itself... perhaps Syria has its proxies there too??</i></p>

<dd>At the center of the AIC, first you tried to assert "Viability of a Palestinian State" (that surely belongs to IPC, not AIC), then you tried to remove "Israel's future as a Jewish state". Is this some kind of revenge for not having your way?</dd>
<dd>"the future is about borders, treaties, terrorism, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, settlements, reparations, refugees, and the like." - again, you try to confuse the IPC with the AIC.

<dd>Please correct me if I misunderstood: perhaps you don't deny that the conflict is about Israel's existence, but rather you think that "Israel's future as a Jewish state" is not important. So what, the Arab leaders made all those inflammatory speeches it's just "empty rhetoric and propangada, and fought all these wars - <b>they didn't mean it!</b> What is important is a "viable" 22nd Arab state.

<p>I said that the conflict evolves and has evolved, and that the very "existence of Israel as a Jewish state" is not realistically at stake currently. You keep bringing up wars from 60 years ago to define the current situation. When I look at "the very existence of the United States", do we hang by a thread because of King George's provocations and taxation without representation?</p>
<p>I do not deny that the message is still used, but it is neither realistic nor central to the reality of the current situation. Indeed, it is disengenuous and propagandist to define the current conflict by the same definitions used for the wars of 60 years ago; it is specious to suggest that Israel hangs by a thin thread, when many of the relationships have evolved and become peaceful, when Israel is militarily powerful and backed by the strongest nation on earth (just confirmed by Bush yesterday), when the basket of issues has matured and split it into those of borders, settlements, reparations, economies, water access, pipelines, global proxies, <i>a Palestinian state</i>, and so on. The central issue is simply not as you define it, and while such a definition would probably be appropriate in the History section, the War of Independence was 60 years ago, and the elements of that time have shifted dramatically and should be represented as such.</p>

<dd>I strongly reject your qualification "disengenuous and propagandist". Numerous compromises were made here for years and months before your arrival. WP accomodates various views (including yours) but WP does not have to reflect only your POV.</dd>
<dd>"60 years ago": much more recently than Amin al-Husayni and Azzam Pasha, Nasser, Qaddafi, Saddam, papa+baby Assads, Saudi kings, Ahmadinejad, Hamas and Hizballah reiterated this same goal: destruction of Israel as a Jewish state. As even you admit, "the message is still used" and as we know, these are not empty words. Israel's existence as a Jewish state is still threatened in many ways: after open wars didn't work, they try to strangle it with economic boycott (still in effect), covert/proxy wars (still in effect), political measures (still in effect), demographic threat (60 years later, still "viable" 4 million of descendants of refugees ready to flood the Jewish state), so your "pipelines" sound hollow. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 21:06, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dispute regarding Jewish loss of property after 1948</span></h2>
<p>The article states: "Most of these Jews [those leaving/fleeing Arab countries] lost most of their property and continue to claim compensation." Given the description at <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_lands_7cd1.html" title="Jewish exodus from Arab lands">Jewish exodus from Arab lands</a> it seems a real reach to suggest that "most" Jews lost their property, given that that article indicates that only in Egypt and Libya did property confiscations occur (and in Egypt it was described as "hundreds" of Jews, and not the 75,000 in Egypt at the time; and in Libya the confiscations began in 1969, 20 years after the initial conflict). The other large Jewish populations in Morocco, Tunisia, Iraw, and Algeria, who compose the majority of the Jewish populations in 1948 Arab lands, did not experience confiscations, per the article.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Change of Column heading in table</span></h2>
<p>The temp development area for this article has a suggested new column heading. The previous one reads, "Jews expelled or who fled from Arab lands (1948 / 2001)". I have changed this to "Jews in Arab lands (1948 / 2001)". I also include a referenced footnote at the bottom that details the Jewish exodus from Arab lands, including the expulsions, flight, and other reasons.</p>
<p>I make these changes for two primary reasons:</p>
<p>1. The heading "Jews expelled or who fled from Arab lands (1948 / 2001)" is nonsensical in that the column then proceeds to list two numbers for each country, e.g., "Morocco 350,000 / 5000": the heading would lead us to believe that in 1948 there were 350,000 Jews fleeing, and then in 2001 there were 5,000 Jews fleeing. These figures actually represent previous and current population, and the simpler heading "Jews in Arab lands" explains this.</p>
<p>2. As the page on <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_lands_7cd1.html" title="Jewish exodus from Arab lands">Jewish exodus from Arab lands</a> highlights, it is inaccurate to describe this exodus as either ONLY flight OR expulsion. There were a multitude of other reasons that resulted in Jewish exodus (and indeed in some Arab countries, they tried to stem the flow). So the "Jews in Arab lands", besides taking up less room, presents the facts accurately, without requiring a huge column heading that says all the possible reasons that they left (this can be saved for the footnotes).</p>
<p>Of course, I am sure there will be cries of, wait, this isn't fair as the Palestinian side is labeled "Palestinian refugees". First, we are not trying to "balance" out facts -- our goal is to tell the truth. Second, the "Palestinian refugees" is factually based as these are the numbers used by both the CIA and the UN.</p>

<dd>Loki I'm sorry but a lot of this is clear POV. Your assertion that you only want to tell the truth instead of balancing both POVs out is ridiculous as you clearly are only trying to show *your* POV, not all Palestinians left involuntarily either. You continue to attempt to show most of the Jews left because they simply wanted to which is just not true. Some arab rulers only tried to stem the flow of the minority of Jews who signifigantly contributed to their economies, and even then these same rulers enacted laws which created a hostile enviorment to Jews. Also I find your attempt to show that only a few of these people lost any belongings as just silly, first becasue there were more confiscations than you suggest (also you shouldn't cite another wikipedia article) and secondly even if they weren't directly confiscated, they would be indirectly confiscated becasue the emigrating Jews wouldn't be allowed to carry very much of their belongings, similar to the Japanese internment camps in the US during WWII.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 08:28, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Humus, I followed your link and found on the very same page this following piece of racist drivel: "The Arabs by nature, are an incited/deluded lots from womb to maturity! Apart from the words of their Qur'an who orders them to kill the non believers, myths, chimeras and exaggerations are most of the information they get from their respective elders who in turn, have received it from their elders... This continuous hate generated at the crib will never end towards the Jews until THE TWO PEOPLES ARE SEPARATED FOREVER!" I presume you find this material as repugnant as I do, and now that you know www.israel-wat.com publishes openly racist material you will refrain from posting links to it on Wikipedia (except perhaps in an article devoted to hate sites on the web). <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Tvedt_88bd.html" title="User:Brian Tvedt">Brian Tvedt</a> 11:49, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, what Emil Choury is supposed to have said is "the fact that there are these refugees is the direct consequence of the action of the Arab States in opposing partition and the Jewish State…". But even if Emil Ghoury actually said "The Arabs by nature, are an incited/deluded lots from womb to maturity…" to a Lebanese newspaper(!), that doesn't mean the statement is not racist, it just means that someone found a quote from a self-hating Arab. By the way I didn't make any comment about Israel, only about one very unfunny, racist web site.

<p>With regard to the value of Jewish property in Arab States there are figures available from the Israeli Registrar of Foreign Claims. The first record of claims was in 1950 when the total value of claims registered was US$54,032,576. By 1952 this had risen to $86,870,456 of which $1,252,944 was bank accounts. By 1956 the total value of claims registered was $103,373,000 - see Fischbach, 2003, p. 176-7. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> 12:13, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with Elizmr, the reason I used the example of the Japanese internment in WWII was becasue a lot of the hardships was indriect. They didn't always get their property confiscated by goverment policy, but rather they had to leave it behind, or to sell it at ridiculous prices, the reason that Ian's number is so low is becasue you cna't claim your belongings if you sold it, even if it was only at .5% of its actual value.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 00:07, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, I have always been ambivalent about splitting, but I support moving the Temp to here simply to stop the various edit bifurcations which are confusing things. I just worry that splitting will encourage similar edit battles as we've witnessed here yet in 3 different articles: in some ways I can't help but feeling that expanding to three articles will therefore expand my stress and re-awaken various other battles. I am also concerned that the table presented by Humus now outshadows the more important Views and History section. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 10:26, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well lets face it, it is not on the fringe in the Arab world to believe that Israel should not be a Jewish state, in fact I think it is mainstream. While in Palestine most have pragmatically accepted that at least some of Israel will continue to exist as a Jewish state, in the resat of the Arab world they for the most part believe one of three things 1) That Israel should completey cease to exist 2) that Israel should allow the numerous decendents if Palestinian emigrants to return to Israel proper thereby committing demagraphic suicide or 3) the most progressive in the region think that Israel should be a secular state in control in all of Palestine (although this is mostly mere rhetoric covering a belief in one of the two previous conditions.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 12:04, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really don't wish to get in another argument where I parrot everything I stated above. Arab states recognize Israel. And it is incorrect to reflect the center of this conflict as whether Israel can exist as a Jewish state. It's existence is fait accompli, and the current conflict is about the various offshoots of that existence, such as borders, refugees, territories, natural resources, economic realities, immigration, emigration, reparations, and so on. The very "existence of a Jewish state" may have been primary concern in 1949 etc, but nowadays it just isn't. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 12:09, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I have stated, the current Arab-Israeli conflict nowadays often dovetails with the Pal-Israeli conflict.

<p>That is what I am TRYING TO DO! I originally had it as "The future of Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, Golan is at the center of this battle" But Humus kept reverting it.</p>
<p>I meant to add above: When bin Laden says that he will destroy America, only the propagandists on both sides use that to present that war for the very "existence of the United States". Most people accept that the US is not in fatal danger, that the conflict involves multiple fronts &amp; multiple subtleties &amp; multiple centers, and that only those who wish to promote the war or their views describe it in such stark, black &amp; white, and unrealistic terms.</p>

The Pal state IS part of the A-I conflict, because it is a potent symbol for all Arab people, Arab nations, and the increase in global terror related to that: they all cite Pal as a major instigator.

<p>I have three concerns:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Israel was created 58 years ago which means that the Arab-Israeli conflict is 58 years old only. However, the Arabs-Zionists conflict might be a century old or more.</dd>
<dd>2. The Arab nations did not refuse to create a Palestinian State without the destruction of Israel. This is misleading because they refused to accept creating Israel on the land of Palestine at all. Big difference!</dd>
<dd>3. The Jewish displaced communities needs a reference. All the sources that I have read indicated that Jewsih communities were not forced out of Arab countries as the article suggests. They have, however, chosen to immigrate to Palestine before and after the establishment of Israel.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is at the center of the Arab-Israeli conflict</span></h2>
<p>Among Loki's agressive edits, s/he changed the stable caption <i>Israel's existence as a Jewish state and the future of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Golan Heights are at the center of the conflict</i> to include "Viability of a Palestinian State". My arguments against this change may be found in the section <a href="#Viability_of_a_Palestinian_State" title="">#Viability of a Palestinian State</a> above, I can summarize them again if necessary. Loki's objections didn't work for me and it seems they didn't work for him/her either, because s/he decided to give up the "Viability..." and instead removed "Israel's existence as a Jewish state". No major Arab leader accepted Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, and if necessary, a ton of mainstream quotes and numbers may be brought to support the mainstream position that <b>the continued existence of Israel as a Jewish state</b> is the culprit of the AIC.

<dl>
<dd>I disagree that this phraseology accurately reflects the center of the <b>CURRENT</b> conflict -- as I have stated many times, even if people impotently threaten the existence of Israel, the very "existence of Israel as a Jewish state" is not at risk. The conflict has evolved into far more than that black or white, simplistic, and POV way of framing this conflict; I do not doubt that the "existence of Israel as a Jewish state" was an accurate way to describe, for example, the initiation of this conflict, but it is an inaccurate descriptor for the current conflict. I believe that the more accurate "the future of Israel" is more appropriate, and this phrasing was accepted by others; it better reflects the subtleties, dimensions, and realities of the current conflict, rather than using propagandist phrasing to suggest that Israel's plight is dire, critical, and immediate. I have tried multiple times to offer several variations on the captions, but you continually revert. As soon as my 24-hour revert is complete, I do plan to edit the caption again to better reflect this topic comprehensively, neutrally, and accurately. You have failed to accept any compromised phrase, any middleground, or anything but "your way or the highway". And so long as you continue to demand your way or no way, I will retain the POV dispute on the article page. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 00:45, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I recall, the stable caption was an compromise when someone added this map long ago. If we are to show this map, not to include clause "as a Jewish state" is unacceptable POV statement. BTW, we are not saying "immediate", our text is "continued existence" or simply "existence".</dd>
<dd>Loki, since when did the conflict "evolve"? What was the date or event? <b>What major Arab leaders has accepted Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state?</b> Not even counting overt/covert/proxy/ecomonic/politics... As of 2005, 4+ million of Palestinian "refugees" (in quotes because 58 years after 1948, they are mostly descendents) are being kept by Arab states in misery to be ready to demographically flood Israel with their claimed "right of return". <b>Was RoR given up?</b></dd>

<p>One of the reasons you didn't want the "Palestinian state viability" in the caption was because this was an Arab-Israeli conflict, and not a Palestinian-Israeli conflict. But then you mention the Palestinian refugee status and the right of return as one of the demographic threats to Israel, and as one of the reasons for your captioning. Since you therefore accept that the issue of Palestinian refugees is a component of Israel's "existence as a Jewish state", it makes sense to reflect their status, which figures prominently in the larger Arab psyche and most immediately in terms of their "threat" to Israel, in the caption.</p>

<dd>The "viability of a Palestinian state" is a pretext. There has never existed a Palestinian state and, as <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proposals_for_a_Palestinian_state_4ccb.html" title="Proposals for a Palestinian state">Proposals for a Palestinian state</a> clearly show, the Arab leaders consistently - for decades (and as late as 2000) - refused to create one.

<p>I believe I have made most of my points a few times. As the cold war ended, and as military and other aid flowed from the United States to Israel, and as Israel became the military power in the region, and as no Arab member countries are actively at war with Israel, and as the Arab media focuses extensively on the plight of the Palestinians, and as the "Arab street" finds common cause with the Palestinians, and as the occupied territories and treatment of Palestinians therein becomes the dominant focus in fact and media, and as the shift comes down to terrorism, settlements, checkpoints, walls, and unilaterality, and as the conflict becomes a tool for some Arab leaders to distract their populations from their own treatement, and as the United States establishes itself militarily in neighbouring countries... these are some of the reasons for the evolution. Simply: it is inaccurate to describe Israel's existence as a Jewish state as the <b>CENTER of the conflict</b>. That is all I am saying. Why can't you agree to phrasing which reflects the evolution of the conflict? <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 02:00, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Loki--Humus can't agree to phrasing which reflects the evolution of the conflict because your view of the conflict (even though you think it is the only correct analysis) isn't the only view. No matter how many times you repeat yourself, you have to realize that Wikipedia isn't here to express one point of view. You have to let others express theirs too. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">elizmr</a> 02:11, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the problem here is whether or not sources are being quoted for one caption, because if this caption thing gets ironed out, then the conflict will move to another point and so on and so forth. I enjoyed reading this page when I first started editing Wikipedia because of the variety of views expressed. I was especially impressed by the tenor of the page and the mutual respect long time editors showed in their writing and discussions. Over the last couple of weeks a new belligerent pattern of editing has started that is not in keeping with Wikipedia goals and principles. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">elizmr</a> 02:07, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find Loki's tactics to browbeat the opposition conceited and disruptive. WP works on collaboration, convincing others and building consensus.</dd>
<dd>Ironically, none of the BBC links Loki added even mention the word "viable" in regards to the proposed Palestinian state (plus proposed flooding Israel with millions of Arabs), but do include words of Israeli FM spokesman: "This means <b>the destruction of the state of Israel</b>". So much for Loki's denial, post-Cold War, etc. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 21:40, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Viriditas said that citations would help. I provided citations to demonstrate that the Palestinian state, and its viability, is indeed a central part of the Arab requirements for peace. Presumably the refugee threat to Israel is implicitly part of the "existence as a Jewish state", as you mentioned elsewhere. I used the word "viability" to indicate that the possibility of a Palestinian state is part of the conflict: I do not care if a different synonym is used. If indeed this conflict all boils down to the word 'viability', let's indeed get rid of it, or use something else... "possibility" or "future" or "aspects" or "details". How about one of those?</p>
<p>I changed it to "issue of Palestinian statehood". How about that?</p>

<dd>I think we are dealing with severe case of <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunnel_vision.html" title="Tunnel vision">tunnel vision</a>. This proposal means <b>the destruction of the state of Israel</b>", and to present it simply as an "<b>issue of Palestinian statehood</b>" is totally inappropriate. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 22:08, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What are you talking about? The proposal contains several things, one of which is the right of return, and which the Israeli representive calls the "destruction of Israel". And, as you have already stated elsewhere, the issue of demographic shifts are already reflected in the phrase "existence of a Jewish state".</p>
<p>I really do not know what you are arguing about at this point: I provided citations indicating that Palestinian statehood is a central component of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and therefore included the additional "the issue of Palestinian statehood". What exactly are you arguing for now? You feel that this should not be included because the same peace PROPOSAL also addresses the right of return? But, as you have already stated, that aspect is reflected in the "existence of a Jewish state".</p>
<p>And, by the way, there is no need to continually bold various aspects of your arguments.</p>

<dd>It seems that you are changing your position again. First it was the "Viability of a Palestinian State" and as anyone can see, <a href="#Viability_of_a_Palestinian_State" title="">you earlier argued</a> that there is no danger to Israel as a Jewish state and even insisted to remove these words. Now you promote 2002 Saudi plan to create a Palestinian state plus to flood Israel with millions of Arabs, effectively destroying it.</dd>
<dd>If "the issue of Palestinian statehood" is mentioned, it should be reflected that the Arab leaders consistently refused to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proposals_for_a_Palestinian_state_4ccb.html" title="Proposals for a Palestinian state">create a Palestinian state</a> that would not involve <b>Israel's destruction</b> (embolding means most important). ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 22:58, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let's be clear: I am not "promoting" a Saudi plan, but presenting it as citation to support the fact that a Palestinian state is central to this conflict, at least for Arabs. I have done that. I still don't know what you are arguing about. What do you disagree with about the current caption?</p>
<p>The current caption reads: "Israel's existence as a Jewish state; the future of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Golan Heights; and the issue of Palestinian statehood <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1898736.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1898736.stm" rel="nofollow">[24]</a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1896659.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1896659.stm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> are at the center of the conflict."</p>
<p>Now that citations have been provided for the Palestinian statehood issue, and given the contention that a threat to Israel's existence is still ongoing and is reflected in the "Israel's existence as a Jewish state" part, what disputes do you have about this caption?</p>

<dd>Yes, Loki: please be clear, make up your mind and stop bullying. It won't work.</dd>
<dd>"a Palestinian state is central to this conflict" is a <i>claim</i> (related to the IPC) and not a <i>fact</i>. The relevant <i>facts</i> are listed in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proposals_for_a_Palestinian_state_4ccb.html" title="Proposals for a Palestinian state">Proposals for a Palestinian state</a>. Therefore, if "the issue of Palestinian statehood" is mentioned, not to say that the Arab leaders consistently refused to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proposals_for_a_Palestinian_state_4ccb.html" title="Proposals for a Palestinian state">create a Palestinian state</a> that would not involve Israel's destruction would be misleading POV reflecting only one side and revising history. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 23:32, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi again. Definitions of what is "central" to this conflict are difficult, not least because both sides will have different perspectives. There are no clear-cut "facts" as to what is central, and what is not. You have maintained that Israel's destruction is central, and this is reflected in the beginning portion of the caption "Israel's existence as a Jewish state"; I maintain that Israel's existence is fait accompli, and, apart from the unlikely eventuality of nuclear war, that there are no extant or likely facts to actually threaten Israel. The fact that the issue of refugees is viewed differently from both sides -- that Israel sees it as a demographic threat to their existence as a Jewish state (but presumably not as a threat to Israel as a state), and that Arabs view it along compliance with UN resolutions demanding "right of return" -- presents the difficulty and controversy in representing this conflict neutrally. Regardless, the threat is reflected in the current version.</p>
<p>So too, I have demonstrated via citation that Arabs view the existence of a Palestinian state as central to their peace with Israel; you maintain that this is not a fact, as Arab leaders have historically rejected such existence. But the fact that it is cited again and again by Arab leaders indicates that, at least to them, it is central to their perspective. You might counter that this is a cynical ploy. But, like the issue of refugees and the differing perspectives therein, this component, and its differing interpretations, is clearly central to the issue. For this reason, I believe that "the issue of Palestinian statehood" is most neutral, and does not expound needlessly about the background on this issue (which is better left for the main article).</p>

<dd>"Anti-Israel"? I strenuously object to that characterization. I think you will find that my edits are not very large, although they are frequent since I save frequently. Further, you will find that I always provide citations, and that, if anything, the edits could be described as "pro-Arab": to characterize them as "anti-Israel" is objectionable. As well, I feel it is impolite to suggest that frequent editing is somehow wrong. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 02:33, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with editing a lot, I think it's great when people are making NPOV or non-controversial edits, I can get kinda irritated though when almost every edit a person makes only represents their POV, I am also saying that you shouldn't really complain that there are too many pro-israel editors on this talk page when you edit substantially more than all of them combined.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 03:17, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Give me a break, besides the fact that I didn't specifically call you anti-Israel, it would only be libelious if I didn't back it up with fact- you have consistently removed references that showed Israel in everything besides a negative light, you changed anything that showed that the Jewish refugees lost any substantial property and you insisted on including a passage about Israel being the main reason of the emigration. I find your reaction to be clearly disingenuous.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 03:30, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You continue to revise the history of my contributions to these articles. And since you do so on this topic, rather than on our talk pages, I feel that a response here is necessary. I did not change "anything that shows that the Jewish refugees lost any substantial property" -- in fact, there, I changed it to reflect reality, that MANY Jews lost MOST of their property. This was more accurate than the previous "most Jews". If I deleted anything, it was due to lack of citations. And Israel's pro-emigration policies did impact the Jewish immigration to Israel: I simply added this as a factor for the exodus, rather than the previous description which placed everything on the hostility of Arab nations. Again, your implication of my anti-Israel editing, and your previous implication of my anti-Semitism, are libellous statements; I feel that these do not belong here, and I will take the appropriate action within Wikipedia. Last night you removed the entire sentence claiming that Sharon's visit to TM was responsible for the 2nd intifada: I do not call you, or this edit, as "anti-Arab". <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 03:55, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>The Arab Israeli Conflict is a long-running conflict in the Middle East concerning Zionist and subsequent immigration of non-local Jews, joining the existing Jewish population in the British Mandate of Palestine, their claim to self-determination in the Land of Israel and, after the establishment of the State of Israel, the country's relations with the Arab states and the Palestinian population (see Israeli-Palestinian conflict).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This sentence is can be improved by making it shorter and easier to read. It is especially important since this description is the first sentence in the article, and serves as the definition. Here are my proposed changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>"Zionist and subsequent immigration"</i> = <i>"Zionist and non-Zionist immigration"</i> = <i>"immigration"</i>. One can expand on different waves of immigration in later sections. Think of it as substituting "adult men and adult women" for "people".

<dd>Zionism is definitely relevant to this article. My point is not that the word "immigration" somehow reflects the particulars of Zionism; my point is that saying "Zionist and non-Zionist immigration" is the same as saying "immigration".</dd>
<dd>I think you are saying that since Zionism is so relevant to this article, it should be mentioned in the first sentence (sorry if I misunderstood). However, there are other movements (e.g Arab Nationalism), wars, agreements, etc. that are very relevant as well. I believe that the right thing to do is to expand on their importance in the body of the article, instead of trying to mention all of them in the opening sentence.

<dd>Regarding the new intro:</dd>
<dd>1) Do we want to list all the wars so early? Is "includes" the correct verb? I can't come up with a better one right now. Also, should we at least mention the violence of 1920s-1930s?</dd>
<dd>2) Since we already say "spanning nearly a century", I think "long-running" is redundant.</dd>
<dd>3) "the Arab states, Palestinian Arabs, and Israel, before and after its founding" - I think <i>Jewish self-determination</i> is important enough to be mentioned. Also, some Arab states are not much older or even younger than Israel (e.g. Trans-Jordan got its independence in 1946). Don't know how to reflect this properly. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 02:40, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure of the purpose of denying facts: this isn't a caption, but a longer introduction, and the facts and issues surrounding the West Bank/Gaza/Palestinian State is central to the Arab views of this conflict (as per the Saudi peace plan). It is one thing to present lots of detail, in the intro, about the self-determination of Jews which is redundant... but it is pretty errant to then blot out any reference to the Arab views of what facts are important to this conflict. Should we deny the facts that Arabs view as important from the introduction, and present only those that Israel sees as important? <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 00:01, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and the establishment of Israeli settlements therein" is PLO propaganda. This sentence makes false impression that these areas were not occupied before 1967 - by Egypt &amp; Jordan, the Brits, the Ottomans, etc. or that Israeli occupation is somehow especially brutal.</dd>
<dd>You already acknowledged that this is only a <b>view</b> (and we need to distinguish <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">fact</a> from <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinion.html" title="Opinion">opinion</a>), therefore this belongs to the <b>Views subarticle</b>, and not to this article's intro.

<dd>I am saying that there are a series of facts.

There are VIEWS on which FACTS are important to this conflict. The current views reflected are from the perspective of Israel. It makes sense to fairly balance the views of which facts are referenced by both parties to the conflict.

<dd>I know a few families of Iraqi and Egyptian Jews who were expelled by the countries of their birth. They did not immigrate to Israel and live in the West. If I understand you correctly, they (and many thousands like them; I don't know an intl. agency that supports or counts them) deserve to be mentioned in the intro only together with the "viability of a Palestinian State". How are these two related?</dd>
<dd>Since you do not insist on mentioning any refugees in the intro, so won't I. As an alternative to the current 2nd paragraph, I propose to change "Arab states" to "Arab nations": 1) some Arab states came into existence after Israel; 2) the proponents of the Palestinian cause seem to insist that the Palestinians are a separate Arab nation. I would leave "(see related Israeli-Palestinian conflict)" as a compromise:</dd>

<p>I think some light should be given to the fact that though it is often called the Arab-Israeli conflict, it is not really bound by those two groups. It seems a little misleading to present the conflict purely in terms of Arab Nationalism versus Israel. I think some light should be given to the fact that it is a Pan-Islamic movement in the Middle East thus encompassing Iran.

<dd>This issue keeps coming up - the term "Arab-Israeli conflict" is of course a blatant oversimplification. This is however not a Wikipedia issue, it just so happens that the series of military and diplomatic crisises concerning the existence, and more recently the extend, of the state of Israel are generally refered to as "Arab-Israeli conflict". Both media and international diplomats are using this term, and it is not Wikipedia's job to correct them. -- <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor"><font color="#000040"><b>H</b></font><font color="#400000">eptor</font></a> <a href="../../../h/e/p/User_talk%7EHeptor_c1c0.html" title="User talk:Heptor"><sub><small><font color="#400000">talk</font></small></sub></a> 20:02, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't know if this matters for the article, but Iranians aren't Arabs. They're Persians. I'm not sure they should count as an "Arab State" in the graphic, but it might just muck everything up to have a special color for Iran. I leave it up to you all.68.231.159.253 11:41, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may more accurately describe the conflict, however we can't be novel here (see <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>), we have to be encyclopedic so we're stuck with the terminology sources use, and "Islamic-Israeli" conflict is pretty much a neologism.

<p>From <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somalia.html" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> Demographics and languages section (as of April 2006; just copying my response to another individual who asked the same question on another page): "As early as the seventh century, indigenous Cushitic peoples began to mingle with Arab and Persian traders who had settled along the coast. Interaction over the centuries led to the emergence of a Somali culture bound by common traditions, a single language, and the Islamic faith." In other words, Auspx, Somalians are viewed in much the same way as North Africans; they may not be entirely Arab, but they have been assimilated into the greater Arab nation. --(<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMingus_ah_um_497a.html" title="User:Mingus ah um">Mingus ah um</a> 09:38, 19 July 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Djibouti and Somalia are members of the Arab league because they have less than 15% Arab minorities. There is a similar situation in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comoros_Islands_98d6.html" title="Comoros Islands">Comoros Islands</a> - by your logic, why shouldn't we include this small island nation in the map too?
