<p>What are you talking about? You do nott removed source information! those are more accurate than everything you say especially the mitanni myths. Nareklm 02:52, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Vochvok chooneee ed ziner mer lezooee. I cant give examples in English cause those letters dont exist in English, and those sounds. They are not found in any other language. That is why we are a independant branch of Indo-European(Aryaee). That guy Thanasimii was even saying he doesnt trust in Greek historians. So what does that tell you? So since he doesnt, the Greek historians are the only ones who mention we are from that region of Anatolia migrated to Armenia. Dont you see that he's saying that because he's from there. Just like Assyrians who were in the southern Armenian Highlands mention Armani. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 02:57, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why are you saying Mitanni myth? You even have read gevork's site, and its not just him, menk Hyer emanoom enk mer budmootooon. Soot chen. You even made the Armenian kingdom of Mitanni page. Why are you ranting and raving like this man?? I even saw the khatchkar page you put the info about Armani,(Aratta) Mitanni <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 03:00, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You need sourced information! do not remove these things this is a warning you read too much from Armenian highland those sources are not 100% accurate since most of it is nationalist BS. The Mitanni is impossible i did that because you wanted a page like that, and its impossible since we can barely trace back from Urartu. And letters mean nothing! if you know anything scholars and historians long agreed that names have nothing to do with inscriptions or alphabets. Nareklm 03:01, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Armenian historians can not be reliable you need other sources yet there aren't that many. Nareklm 03:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Listen, I told you Hovick Nersessian explains this, i recently gave you the <b>New York Academy of Sciences</b> Hovick Nersessian is in. Hovick mentions Hurrian words and sentences in Armenian. He mentions that Mitanni is an Armenian kingdom. Also, the Mitanni kings names are in Armenian. the Proto-IE language is what it was written the names are in Armenian. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 03:06, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also found in the <b>Encyclopedia Americana, v. 2, USA 1970, pgs 539, 541</b>, mentions ancient Armenian writings is cuneiform. Cuneiform meaning the Hurrian writings and Hurri Urartu wriitngs. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 03:08, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Like i said names mean nothing, you need evidence, real inscriptions, real evidence from left over artifacts etc no pure evidence have been discovered there fore primarily research and going further from the urartu empire is indeed 100% inaccurate. Nareklm 03:10, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Luv ooremn erank el chen emanoom ov en. They dont know who the Mitanni really was then. You agree? We have evidence of us being in Armenia during Hyk's time of the Armens(Armeni) Akkadians mention in inscriptions <i>Armeni</i> 4,500 years ago <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 03:12, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since we were there at that time, that means Mitanni since it was IE (Aryaee) that would be none other than our people (also Persians and Indians) , we were together at that time. That is why there as an Indo-Aryan migration <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 03:13, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mitanni began at 1500 BC right you see? Yet the Indo-Aryan migration in the Encyclopedia I looked at says, 1500 BC Indo-Aryans migrated to Persia and India?? <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 03:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is the third time there isn't enough evidence that proves that Armenians were related to the Armens names mean nothing!!!!. Also those tribes have nothing to do with Armenia you're just guessing about Armenian history now. Nareklm 03:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Khent es toorkern edbess hasganoom. Oo soot banner asoom. You sayig Armeni is different than Armeni(a)&#160;?????

<p>Why are you all of a sudden acting different then last night. You purposely wanted to remove those images and pages you made? The Khatchkar page you didnt do for me. I never said to make that. Im glad you made those pages and the Mitanni one. I never said to make that page, but Im glad you did it for a good reason havada. No I dont have those videos on the internet.

<p>He even said we share knowledge. We have different gifts each of us. You might know some parts that I dont know, I might know some you dont know. For example when I realized our sounds are only found in Chinese and no other language. Our 8 or 9 sounds that nobody has. We are a unique IE language, which is the origins. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 22:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That doesn't matter Patrick you have to realize this everything you say has been discovered i dont think historians are dumb have you even gone to college? Nareklm 22:50, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of course I have, have you? I havent studied in specific on history, bytes sirel em vor jarel em hasgazel em. They are not always right man. For example when they say our language is like Greek, thats part of it when we shared cultures during the Greek and Roman periods of our history. The Greek language doesnt have our sounds. They dont have those 8 or 9 sounds. You know which ones Im talking about&#160;? For example "Jeesht" = true the J they dont have. Huz = bread the "z" they dont have. Yet these people explain we are from Greeks majority. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 22:54, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These unique 8 or 9 sounds are found in one place which they "havent" discovered fully the "Hurrian" langauge. Just ask Thanasimii, ask anyone they havent found the Hurrian language fully yet. They havent translated all of them, but as much as they those sounds that we use are from the Hurrian language sounds and Sumerian<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 22:59, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let's try to get a Mitanni map, I like that you put the Dynasties of Armenia links from Gevork's site. None of us have a site like Gevork. Gevork has devotged 10 years in making the site. So his site is very very good. Armenianhighland.com, the name is also very good. Its not one of those external sites you know? Did you like the Urartu pictures?

<p>Narek I told you where those false info comes from. Since they want to lightn the zeghaspanootoon. They say that we also came later and took other peoples lands just as they dajeek did. Ararat arev 06:13, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just take a look at Vartanank hopefully it will work on the internet streaming , and all our historians knows about our true history. Artak Movsisyan just one of many many recent historians, young etc. Ararat arev 06:14, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Im glad you brought up myspace to my attention. Now we can see more younger Hye like your age look into our history. To get more into our history and to love our history and budmootoon.

<p>Narek I just looked at the schedule, Vartanank is repeating at Sunday 12 noon your time. So you can watch Sunday 12 noon. I dont know what channel it is in Boston, but just look in your channels they have it in Boston too.

<p>Look up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushku" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushku" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushku</a> To find more about Phrygians and Mushku or Mushki(Mushkitsi) These are Georgian tribes, they have nothing to do with our history. We are never remembered by the name Phrygians, but yet we are rememberd by Nairi etc etc. Greeks say there is no link with Assyrians referring to Phyrgians as Mushki, yet Moshchoi which Greeks use is Georgian tribes. We have always called ourselves with the name Armen. The most common Armenian name. A nationality just doesnt forget its name, or put another name sometime in their history, it doesnt work that way. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 17:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That name is of Semitic origin, and is also used by Assyrians, and probably by Arabs too. Nayiri is its Armenian derivation. By the way, "Nahr" means river. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavo88_09f3.html" title="User:Davo88">Davo88</a> 19:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ararat Arev your research is based on names only a few historians have claimed that mitanni were indeed Armenians therefore it is not encyclopedic unless more people accept this which will not happen names don't matter like i said you need real proof. Nareklm 19:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is Davo88 who knows as much as Gevork and I. You are doing a good job man, Im not sayig something bad about you. You are 16 that is very good. You still have a lot to learn about astronimical knowledge and wisdom connected with our history and truth. Gevork as you see on his site explains all this. I knew this before I saw his site thats why it was amazing. Learn astronomy and truth also with our history. I was always into astronomy from the time of age 8. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Arara t arev</a> 20:30, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Narek, dont argue and fight. We need to work together. If you want things to work out you need to work together. Im not spamming, we need to correct our "History" and so people will understand the Armenian genocide issues and the "Yegvor" issues. This is what its about and nothing else. Also you need to gain more knowledge on astronomy and truth its linked with our history. Look at Gevork's site a little since he put that info there. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 20:32, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes i am young and also thats why im going to become a historian your sources are valuable since turks are twisting up our history i am going to document all this information including the mitanni and Egypt etc, im also going to publish a book hopefully soon.

<p>Listen the stuff I put is not wrong, its just I need to know there is a method of doing this. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 20:49, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Put the Mitanni seal back since those other even none Armenian people didnt remove it. That means it was approved or else the guy would've removed it a long time ago, as he does with other things. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 20:52, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You messed up there man. You got me upset man. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 20:53, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Narek, do you understand? That is a Mitanni seal from Mitanni, even if Mitanni is not Armenian, that is still a Mitanni seal. So you dont have a reason for removing it. You removed it. Its a Mitanni seal not Armenian. I'll even rename the file. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 20:55, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Narek you know why they left the Mitanni seal? Because its a "Mitanni seal" image. They consider it none Armenian, but a Mitanni seal image put in the Mitanni page. So while you're add it, put it back cause its a Mitanni related image. Nothing Im saying here is about Armenian, its a Mitanni related image man. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 20:57, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would rename the file to Mitanni-seal.jpg, but I dont want to remove the edit history of the copyright approver. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:00, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Narek, you said you wanted to "search" and "research" our history right? You are just 16 , you have a lot of time yet to find more of the true history. So dont just quickly judge now on the more ancient history of Armenia. So go find out and I hope you make that book about Mitanni&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:02, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>But when you remove things that are approved and they didnt remove, that doesnt show you are even interested in finding out and writing a book. Thats not how to start off first of all by searching and understanding. You dont just remove something they left there. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:04, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Narek you're not responding ok. I said Im going to let all of them know you removed something that is related to Mitanni, the "Mitanni" seal. I will also put in the Talk page of Mitanni and wherever else I can to make sure to let them know. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:10, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Im going to let them know you put copyvio when it was already approved by the handlers of copyright images. You put that reason in the edit history and requested for deletion. Now you going to make this hard on yourself? Or you just going to put it back how it Mitanni seal , Mitanni "related" image. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:12, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Im going to make sure you get in trouble. I have very good reasons for this. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:14, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Get ready to put it back, cause Im about to let them knmow that "Nareklm edits images and pages that are approved by admins and handlers of copyright <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">User:Jkelly</a> and other users which approved the Mitanni seal. He purposely removes with modivations that are against me personally for his needs. This is vandalism, please let Nareklm if he repeats these acts he will be banned. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>My time is about up, so Im getting ready to let them know your deeds here. Your modivations and how you put false info when you dont check the edit history of things approved. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:18, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah go ahead relax. Sit back and relax huh? The guy already gave you a warning I saw his Talk page. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:22, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Narek brother, this is not how we help our history by removing things that are approved and left to stay. You are doing the opposite by removing them. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:23, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Im going to let them know while I was banned and couldnt respond, Narekl was vandalizing and removing info that was approved by handlers of copyright <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">User:Jkelly</a> and putting edit descriptions to remove approved images , putting copyvio. Also, by creating that reason to remove the image that is "related" to the page in order to justify his reasons. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:29, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Im getting ready to let them know, Im tellng you again, if you dont put it back yourself, you are making things worse for yourself. Cause I have really good reasons to let them know about this. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:31, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you havent understood what this all means at this point, This is not the same as when Clevender removed the Urartu warriors image. This is a different reason. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:38, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Narek you think Im not serious about this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitanni&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitanni&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, Im going to let them know That Nareklm, order to justify his reasons for removing the image you placed a huge "copyvio" in the image info, to remove the Mitanni "related" seal image which was approved by admins like <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">User:Jkelly</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">User:Thanatosimii</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 21:48, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Narek I wont let admins know about your mistakes if you just correct it now. So go ahead and correct it, tell the reason that you misunderstood and put it back. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArarat_arev_8df7.html" title="User:Ararat arev">Ararat arev</a> 22:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you stated you were archiving some material from your talk page. However you don't appear to have linked to these archives anywhere. Also, I question why you've chosen to selectively archive a case when you were broke a rule and were blocked accordingly. Many people, including me feel it is inappropriate to selectively archive or remove appropriate warnings and block notifications because it semi hides your history. While there is no current explicit policy against this, and some people do feel your allowed to remove whatever you want provided you don't change the meaning of comments I ask you to consider whether you feel it is appropriate and whether you should at least provide a link to anything that your archiving. If you're not sure how to do this, I can try and help. Should you disagree with me, that is your right I guess and there is nothing I can or will do about it, but I just thought I'd let you know how I feel.</p>

<p>I noticed you stated you were archiving some material from your talk page. However you don't appear to have linked to these archives anywhere. Also, I question why you've chosen to selectively archive a case when you were broke a rule and were blocked accordingly. Many people, including me feel it is inappropriate to selectively archive or remove appropriate warnings and block notifications because it semi hides your history. While there is no current explicit policy against this, and some people do feel your allowed to remove whatever you want provided you don't change the meaning of comments I ask you to consider whether you feel it is appropriate and whether you should at least provide a link to anything that your archiving. If you're not sure how to do this, I can try and help. Should you disagree with me, that is your right I guess and there is nothing I can or will do about it, but I just thought I'd let you know how I feel.</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Armeni-Sumerian2.jpg</b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then you need to specify who owns the copyright, please. If you got it from a website, then a link to the website where it was taken from with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher then their copyright should also be acknowledged.</p>
<p>As well as the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use</a>.

<p>If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a>. <b>Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged</b>, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.
