<h2><span class="mw-headline">Headers</span></h2>
<p>I've gone through the headers and have neutralized them somewhat. Zain, I'm not certain how your research fits into the Arab-Israeli conflict article, but only material already published in a reputable publication is allowed in Wikipedia anyway. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 22:14, Dec 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zain, you just deleted some material, which I've restored. If you feel something should be deleted, could you please say why on the Talk page, rather than just deleting it without comment? Many thanks, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 22:21, Dec 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah I thought may be it was clear from edit now let me explain.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This claim is about 'NEAR East' only. not about all jewish-muslim areas. Just only to 'NEAR East'.</p>

<dd>You removed the 'NEAR East' by saying see in talk. There is nothing in talk, about 'NEAR East'. Can I ask why?</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../z/a/i/User%7EZain_engineer_cf12.html" title="User:Zain engineer">Zain</a> 22:32, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zain, you can't decide single-handedly what the section is about. Also, many Wikipedia readers won't know what you mean by the "near east" as it's not a term used much by non-academic English speakers anymore. Please discuss changes on Talk before making them, because the English in these articles has to be free of errors, so far as is possible, quite apart from the issue of POV or NPOV. I feel you should wait until Ed Poor arrives back to edit, as you seem to have made an arrangement with him regarding some mediation either for this article or State Terrorism, so perhaps his input would be helpful before you make any more changes. Many thanks, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 22:35, Dec 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>See I have right to put claim they have right to put response. I put 'Near East' earlier too but I don't know how it got removed. the claim is only about those countries where jewish-muslim relations were always good prior to creation. that's the core of the claim. And 'NEAR East' is technically more 'Encylopedic' then middle east. Middle east is very confusing that which countries to count and which not to count. See american own website <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/nea/" class="external free" title="http://www.state.gov/p/nea/" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/p/nea/</a>. To avoid confusion Can I use 'ottoman empire'?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Will it be f9 If I use 'ottoman empire areas'?</p>

<p>I have put Near East back in for you as you seem so keen on it, but more Wikipedia readers will understand Middle East than will understand Near East, in my view. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 22:58, Dec 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok I put middle east. Can I remove the content about spain? because it doesn't come under middle east. To avoid confusion of areas can i use 'ottoman empire'. Or use 'formal jewish friendly countries'?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Can I put some thing like <b>Relations effected in previous Jewish friendly countries</b>, or too remove jewish word (if it is offensive).</dd>
<dd><b>Relations effected in previously friendly communities</b>. Then in claim I can mention those countries like. Palestine itself , Iran , Iraq, UAE? can I do that. This way heading will be NPOV. Area will be less confusing because claim will have list of countries. Time will have less confusing, because <i>previous</i> means kind of <i>adjecent</i>, not very far past so can I use the heading.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Relations effected in previously friendly communities</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>And spain removal?</p>

Zain, the header said: "Jewish-Muslim relations affected by creation of Israel." It didn't say where. You wanted to specify "relations in Near East." I objected. You insisted. I conceded, pointing out that most readers will not understand what Near East refers to. You therefore changed it to Middle East. I agreed, as a further concession. Now you want to delete material from the section to make it conform to the Middle East header . . .</p>
<p>The header should describe the section, not the other way round, because the section was there first, and it was you, I believe, who added most of these headers in the first place. You can't now change content to fit headers that weren't there until you added them.</p>
<p>If you want to request a reference from the editor who inserted that material, that's legitimate, but you shouldn't just delete it. If you feel the section doesn't match the header, then the header should be changed back to "Jewish-Muslim relations affected by creation of Israel." <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 23:46, Dec 25, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Looks like a tricky issue. Because I think I can add a full new section of 'middle east'! right? or others which i suggested earlier. But may be i have to wait for others. (But Please note technically I have full right to add that view, which is not covered yet in the article. That is considering jewish friendly countries only)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Any way i think tomorrow i can edit heading. Bcoz if a particular view/angle is not covered. if i won't add it some body else will.</dd>

<p>Zain, you are right that anyone has the right to edit articles. No editor has "ownership" of any article. But edits must be in relatively error-free English, and that can be difficult for some people if English isn't their first language. That isn't a criticism of you, so please don't take it that way. I feel it might be helpful if you wait until Ed Poor returns, because he has offered to assist, either here or at State Terrorism, so it would make sense to see what he suggests. Or perhaps Mustafaa would help out, though I can't speak for him, and he may not have time. I don't know when Ed will be back. It may not be for a few days because it's the holiday season in many countries, but it would be a good idea to wait for him as he is a very helpful person. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 00:11, Dec 26, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Changing my earlier comments. Actually I thought wrong and it was not me who gave that heading. this view was not even there when I categorized. It was later put by me. You can check in this difference. I was going out but Just thought that you raised incorrect point. My orignal point was not 'existance of anti-sentiment' but my point was the 'increase in anti-sentiment'. My orignal point was washed during reverts.</dd>

<p><br />
I'm new to this whole Wikipedia thing, but I just wanted to make a general comment about the Arab-Israeli conflict page. It doesn't do that great of a job representing the Palestinian points of view. In short, the central idea of Palestinian thinkers like Edward Said, is that the occupied territories are oppressed areas. Houses are said to be bulldozed all the time to, say, build a road to a new settlement. And settlements are accused of getting preferential treatment all around-- water, security measures, you name it. Settlements are just what they are-- Israelis coming in and building on Palestinian land with a degree of government support.... maybe Israelis claim to hold settlement land legally? I don't know. The military presence on the whole is seen as a problem; just the idea of Israelis with guns who aren't big fans of the Palestinians scares them and it's alleged the military abuses its power.</p>
<p>So my point? But "Life in the Occupied Territories" should be a category. It's a central part of the Palestinian point of view. House bulldozings, checkpoints, and more should be mentioned. Obviously, the Israeli responses should be there too. You do mention settlements, but not as a part of the direct indictment so many Palestinians support.</p>
<p>A final comment-- I hear generally cited stastics (by 'objective' news agencies) that indicate that roughly 1000 Israelis have died in the intifada, and 3500 Palestinians have died. Palestinians like to point those figures out because the media gives us the impression that the intifada mostly consists of terrorist attacks on Israel. Again, any disputes about those figures should be mentioned.</p>
<p>Since I am new to Wikipedia, I don't want to jump into this hornet's nest myself. ---Pat.s</p>

<p>The opening sentence explaining reasons is curently: "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israelis</a> name various reasons for aggression toward Israel. One of the primary reasons cited is <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> (compare to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philo-Semitism_ed44.html" title="Philo-Semitism">philo-Semitism</a>)." That version is POV because it implies that aggression towards Israel is an established fact. In fact, to be NPOV it should say, ""<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israelis</a> name various reasons for what they describe as aggression toward Israel." I NPOVed the sentence to: "<a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israelis</a> perceive the roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict in many ways. One of the primary reasons cited is <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> (compare to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philo-Semitism_ed44.html" title="Philo-Semitism">philo-Semitism</a>)." --<a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPravda_1c9a.html" title="User:Pravda">Pravda</a> 03:53, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently different sides are allowed to state their own views of these matters. For example, the Palestinian side states "Palestinians cite many reasons for the lack of support of their cause in the United States, despite its broadly being supported in Europe", which, of course, is POV, since, for example, it presumes a lack of support for their cause in the United States. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 04:32, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

Instead of accepting POV exceptions to the NPOV rule, the proper course of action is to pursue NPOV more carefully.

<dd>Nope check the history and see the headings which I gave to israeli section. They were all POV toward Israel. Like palestenian headings were POV towards Palestine. Reason is that I thought headings can be POV. Nobody objected on it. But when palestenian headings got too strong. 'Policy' of no 'harsh' heading was used. But that too didn't remove the effectivity of palestenian headings. so at the end NPOV heading was choosen. So go back and check the history of the page before you make any claim.</dd>

<dd>I am not saying that they treated good or not. The claim is only about middle east.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding maps and caricatures</span></h2>
<p>Greetings. I have been trying to make non-text revisions to this article, which have been immediately reverted (within seconds) by Jayjg. I believe the initial graphic is largely irrelevant to the actual conflict, and ought to be replaced by a close up map of the actually disputed territories that generate the greatest division between Arabs and Israelis. Moreover, the depiction of the Arab League member states in one colour and Israel in another colour smacks of a peculiarly partisan tactic used repeatedly by former Israeli PM Netanyahu (among others) to try and evoke an image of a tiny and defenseless Israel struggling for life and land from a huge mass of surrounding Arab states. This depiction obscures the fact that the territories in actual dispute have nothing to do with those Arab countries not bordering Israel, especially in the context of what has been negotiated and stipulated by both sides up to the present time. Your point about the separate Israeli-Palestinian article is well taken, but Wikipedia is full of separate articles that use the same media resources. I am willing to discuss having both these images side by side. What is your opinion?</p>
<p>As regards the caricature you keep deleting, I think it compliments the existing caricature (which is relevant and quite valid) well, because having only one cartoon depicting the oft-attributed Arab desire to "throw the jews into the sea" is unbalanced. To correct this, I introduced a second caricature depicting an Israeli shark, hinting at the powerful Israeli military machine, devouring a small struggling yet defiant Palestinian boy, evoking the much weaker stone-throwing children that make up the bulk of the Intifadas. This is also played out in the facts on the ground, where Palestinian deaths exceed Israeli deaths by more than 2:1. Arab summits often implore the US to intervene, while accomplishing little themselves, and the view, shared by Arabs and a majority of the member states of the United Nations, that the US usually responds by biased support for Israel and admonishments for the Palestinians, is valid and germane to this article. Thank you. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S. A.</a> 07:47, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The map you have given is simply a map of Israel and the territories, not of the conflict between a large number of Arab countries and Israel. As such, it might be relevant to an article about the Israel-Palestinian conflict, but not to the Arab-Israeli conflcit. The map itself has already been agreed to in previous Talk: As for the caricature, the existing one was actually published in an Egyptian paper immediately prior to the war, and directly refers to Arab feelings about Israel; the current one, of unclear provenance, is about Arab feelings about America. America is not Israel. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 07:59, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Occupied Territories are the crux of the modern Arab-Israeli dispute. Therefore, including a map of those territories, is extremely relevant to the article. In deference to your views, I have modified my previous opinion on replacing the original map altogether, and placed both maps side by side. As far as the caricature goes, as I said I think it is an important and well placed balancing addition. The US involvement in the Conflict is extensive and discussed in the article at length. This makes the caricature both balancing and relevant. You have deleted both my additions immediately, and three times in a row. I am consequently going to defer to the published Wikipedia "<a href="../../../s/c/e/WP%7ESCEGH_8852.html" title="WP:SCEGH">Staying cool when the editing gets hot</a>" guidelines, and stop this revert tug of war, so that I may revisit the disagreement in a day or two. I hope you will reread my opinions and come to agree that including all these images enriches the article overall. <b>P. S.</b> The caricature also depicts Arab views of Israel, not just Arab views of America (i.e. the more powerful Israeli side ravaging a much weaker Palestinian one). <b>P. S. 2</b>: There seems to be some error. You say the first caricature was published in Egypt, but the caption reads Lebanon. Regarding the origins of the second caricature: It was not, I beleive, published in any paper, but was released into free public internet circulation by a Diaspora Palestinian artist. I thought it was an adequate counterbalance to the first cartoon. Sincerely, --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S. A.</a> 08:35, Jan 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After waiting several days, I revisited Wikipedia and soberly re-read the article and the Talk. I notice the caption of the map I added has been changed to remove any references to "occupied territories." After reading previous Talk sections, I suppose am not surprised. Several partisans have been adamant that the territories not be labeled as occupied. People, come on. These are territories which have been seized and kept through force of arms, despite the vehement objection of their population. Furthermore, the sovereignty of Israel over any territory it occupied or annexed after June 1967 is not recognized either by the United Nations or any nation in the world, including the United States. Therefore, I find it extraordinary that anyone can claim the use of the adjective "occupied" can be construed as a POV. Yet this is an article replete in controversy, so I suppose nothing is really extraordinary. Therefore, in the spirit of compromise, I will not revert the edit of that caption.</dd>

<p>Now, regarding the caricature. Your statement that it "obviously has nothing to do with the history of the conflict" is just flatly incorrect. Intifadas have been raging since the 80s. It is now 2005. That most definitely makes it history. I have defended the caricature repeatedly in this talk section and as there are no new arguments, I have nothing further to add. I have consequently returned it. If repeated knee-jerk reverts continue, we can refer the matter to arbitration. Please remember, I have not added or changed any contested factual textual information. I merely added a caricature graphic to counterbalance the first one. According to Wikipedia guidelines, you must believe an addition actually <b>harms</b> the article (<i>not</i> your POV), to be justified in reverting the edit. Belief in irrelevancy, as fantastic as I find that, is not sufficient grounds to delete someone's contributions. Let the readers decide for themselves if it is relevant.

<dd>The caricature appears to be a non-notable drawing produced on someone's website, illustrating his feelings about the United States. It is not part of the Arab-Israeli conflict. If you want to produce balance, produce a related cartoon; that is, a historial cartoon taken from an Israeli paper showing anti-Arab feeling, or one from an Arab paper showing pro-Israeli feeling (O.K., the last one is a joke, you're not going to find any of those). Irrelevancy is used all the time to remove content from articles, and for good reason; articles should be cogent summaries of a specific topic, not partisan re-hashes of broad and unrelated subject areas. Finally, if we can't work this out on the Talk: page, the next logical step is a Request for Comment, or, if that doesn't work, mediation. It is highly unlikely arbitration would be accepted on this topic, given that the preliminary steps towards conflict resolution have not been attempted. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 15:55, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are now repeating ourselves. I've already stated, the caricature clearly depicts Arab views of both Israel and the it's major ally, the US. You may not presume to take upon yourself the sole arbitration of what is relevant, nor have you made any case for how the article is harmed by the inclusion of the caricature. This is the only standard by which Wikipedia allows deletion of other people's contributions. It is my opinion that you do not wish there to be a balancing cartoon, because you want only the one which shows the Arab side to disadvantage. You may not impose on me what kind of cartoon I should introduce, nor from which source. I have compromised substantially on this issue; the caricature will stay unless administrators specifically rule otherwise. As for the caption of the map, I am certain it was changed precisely to follow a political agenda. Trying to deny the occupied status of the territories is as absurd as trying to find euphemisms for the genocide in Rwanda, like "accidental killings" for example. I will not stress again the relevancy of this cartoon, I have explained it fully. Sincerely,--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S.

<dd>First of all, you have no evidence that this represents any more than one man's view. Second, the source is not particularly notable. Third, you have misunderstood the grounds on which editors can remove information from articles; perhaps you can quote me the section of policy you think states that. Fourth, I have made it clear that I would welcome a balancing cartoon; the problem is, this is not it, but is a cartoon on a different topic from a dissimilar source. Fifth, regarding the caption, please <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>; the forumulation I have used is precise, exact, and NPOV. All other forumlations are ambiguous, often debated, a focus for edit wars, and imprecise. Your formulation adds no information, actually muddies the waters, and promotes a political agenda. And finally, I cannot stress again the irrelevancy of this cartoon, and the need to find one that is relevant instead. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 17:38, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We cannot assume that the artist was a man. It may well have been a woman. Internet circulation has long been considered a reliable gauge of popular opinion. A cartoon by a Diaspora Palestinian artist aggressively circulated by Arabs and interested parties all over the world is a valid expression of a popular sentiment, and in fact specifically highlights the phenomenon of the Diaspora itself. Assuming good faith is increasingly difficult at this stage, for all arguments relating to the caricature to this point have been repetitive and entirely unconvincing. The section of <a href="../../../r/v/_/WP%7ERV_7050.html" title="WP:RV">policy</a> you asked me to quote is as follows: "Note that reverts are not appropriate if a newer version is no better than the older version. You should save reverts for cases where the new version is actively worse." This, to me, clearly means that an addition which you have stressed to be so irrelevant should not be reverted. An irrelevant caricature leaves the article no worse off. The fact is we disgree utterly about the caption of the map and the relevancy of the caricature. While I was able to compromise on the former, the caricature dispute obviously requires outside assistance. In situations approaching an edit war, Wikipedia advises a maximum revert of once daily in an effort to cool heals, as it were. I think this is good sense. I will revert one more time today, remaining within the 3RR, and henceforth revert once daily while the dispute resolution proceeds. I am a relative newbie so I hope I have begun the process correctly. I am waiting to hear from an advocate or administratior. I will also look for new Talk comments as often as I can, but I reserve replies for <b>new ideas</b>, because as I said we have been repeating ourselves for some time.

It's difficult to see how the disputed cartoon could be said to be irrelevant to the subject of the article; the fact that it involves the U.S. is at best a red herring (unless the claim is that the notion of Israel as a man(boy)-eating shark is peripheral, which it clearly isn't). Are we really supposed to accept that inclusion of the U.S. makes it irrelevant, and by implication that the U.S. doesn't play an important role in the conflict? Aside from this cartoon, the set of illustrations is dubiously neutral; the first map is particularly bizarre, giving as it does a very misleading impression of the relative strengths of Israel and its enemies, as well as the impression that every member of the Arab League is involved in the conflict in the same way (I know that there's a comment on this in the text, but pictures tend to speak louder than words). I suppose it's inevitable that this should be a page whose editors are more than usually unlikely to be wholly disinterested, but it's good that that generally comes out in the Talk page rather than in the article itself. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 20:20, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The cartoon discusses the alleged feelings of Arabs regarding American support of Israel; the article does not discuss that topic at all. It's hard to see how a cartoon that is unrelated to article content could possibly be relevant. "Balance" is not about tit for tat, that is "if one side gets a cartoon, the other side gets a cartoon too". The items included must be relevant and notable as well. As I've said before, an anti-Arab cartoon from an Israeli paper would be perfectly relevant and appropriate, not this anonymous cartoon on a topic not discussed in the article. As for the map, it was the Arab League that attacked Israel in 1948, and which declared a number of boycotts against it; the Arab League is definitely involved. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 03:32, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, no, the cartoon doesn't discuss anything. It does, however, indicate – via caricature – a view relevant to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and an essential part of that is the notion that Israel is a large predator attacking small and defenceless prey. The insistence that in order to illustrate an article a picture of whatever sort should focus solely on what is explicitly mentioned in the article is not borne out by other Wikipedia articles, and is surely difficult to argue for. Similarly, I can't see the relevance of the anonymity of the cartoon's creator, nor its lack of "notability". You seem to be appealing to one of the criteria concerning the <i>subject of</i> an article – that the subject be notable – to an <i>illustration in</i> the article. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 21:47, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well said, Mel Etitis. You have crystalized the relevancy of the caricature better than I could have done. Your point regarding the Arab League versus Israel map is highly insightful as well. I touched on it earlier in the Talk section. Showing Israel in one color and the rest of the Arab World in another is a favorite tactic of Netanyahu's. He does it on TV frequently, especially when addressing American TV networks. Nevertheless, I did not fight its inclusion when I was able to carry my point of showing a map of the Occupied Territories alongside. Note: Criticizing this particular map and it's color-delineation technique in no way implies that the Arab League is not relevant.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<li>Regarding the Nasser's cartoon: there is no doubt that Nasser's intention or at least his quote was: <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/mideast/history/history4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/mideast/history/history4.html" rel="nofollow">NPR</a>, <a href="http://www.paktoday.com/style.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.paktoday.com/style.htm" rel="nofollow">Pakistan Today</a>, <a href="http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/8769.html" class="external text" title="http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/8769.html" rel="nofollow">HNN</a>. Several Arab countries backed Egypt in 1967 and in addition to six Arab countries that attacked Israel in 1948-49, many other Arab countries actively supported the aggressors. These are <b>facts</b> (so much for Arab leaders impotently standing by). Your cartoon is an <b>opinion</b> and should be attributed as such. Where and when was it published?</li>

<dd>It was placed there to counterbalance the existing caricature, as I explained earlier. However, in the spirit of compromise and despite my better judgement, I will offer no objection in principle to moving it away form the 1967 war section, as a purely organizational edit. Mel, if you would that for us, I will reserve my final opinion of the move after I see where it is put. For the last time, the caricature is extremely relevant, and I will not waste key strokes to belabor the point further. It seems to me that we have said our peace on that point, and we must await the eventual ruling of the administrators, assuming the dispute resolution process goes all the way. As far as the Nasser cartoon, I have no objection to it, and you need not try to justify it, at least not to me. I realize that some Arabs and sympathizers with their cause will not like to have this damaging notion of "throwing the jews into the sea" publicised, but it is valid and it existed, and in some quarters continues to exist, and therefore must be faithfully reported. Likewise the caricature I introduced is a legitimate addition that adequately illustrates prevailing perceptions. As for the view of Arabs you think I am trying to project: I am not. Neutrality and balance is what I am striving for. Those other "points" I need not address because Mel Etitis has answered them so eloquently. I think things are really getting quite desperate, if spurious arguments like these are beginning to be flung about. As far as the "predominant Arab view"; there is no credible international contention to this assertion. It is routinely reported as such across international media, including Israeli. Allow me to quote former PM Yitzhak Shamir: "Our image has undergone change from David fighting Goliath to being Goliath." (Quoted in: Daily Telegraph, London, 25 Jan. 1989). There have been in fact polls taken in the Arab world by western researchers and announced on CNN a few times, (Wolf Blitzer in particular seems fond of them) but even without them, the assertion is firm and well supported. I also have no objection to the replacement of the close up map of Israel and the Occupied Territories, since the new map clearly delineates Israel's legal, internationally recognized pre 1967 borders. Lastly, like I said before, I am limiting my reverts to once daily in deference to Wikipedia's guidelines when dealing with an edit or revert war. I advise all contributors to do the same.

<p>I'm sorry, but you're regurgitating the same arguments. Top begin with, what you mistake for "legal, internationally recognized 1967 borders" are in fact, for the most part, 1949 armistice lines. The difference is significant. Borders are decided by agreements between opposing countries, and the 1949 Armistice lines were deliberately rejected as permanent borders by the Arab states; I'm sure you can guess why. As for the cartoon, balance would be provided by a similar cartoon from an Israeli newspaper showing Israeli sentiments towards the Arab countries, not an anonymous cartoon on a topic not discussed in the article. I have no objection to such a cartoon; as I said, I welcome it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:07, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have regurgitated nothing. I specifically declined to repeat any previous arguments, and confined myself to new points as well as answering specific questions put to me. You have stated your position several times on balance and relevancy, you need not repeat yourself. We disagree. As for the borders, I am not mistaken. Regardless of how the borders were arrived at (and I am aware of the armistice lines), the borders of Israel immediately preceding the 1967 war <b>are</b> the legal, <i>internationally recognized</i> borders.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<dd>This is no <i>claim</i>. To state that the borders of the State of Israel up to june 1967 are what today is internationally recognized as her legal borders requires no treaty. Neither the United Nations nor any country or independent polity in the world have recognized Israel's sovereignty over the territories it occupied and/or subsequently annexed after the Six Day War. It is a simple statement of fact. It does not address what Israel believes is right, merely what is internationally recognized.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S.

<dd>Sorry, I didn't see the documents outlining Israel's legal borders. Could you try again please? Also, please note that Israel has not annexed the West Bank or Gaza, therefore there it has not legally asserted sovereignty over them. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:46, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What we have here is a failure to communicate. I have stated clearly what is meant by <b>Internationally Recognized</b>. There is no treaty the the whole world has to sign in order for the term "international recognition" to be applied. All member states of the UN do not recognize the legality of Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and the Golan. No non-UN member recognizes the same either. Furthermore, I distinctly said "occupied and/or subsequently annexed" to preserve the difference, so you need not edify me on what Israel has officially annexed. Also, please note that Israel has placed illegal settlers even in non-annexed territory, in contravention of the Geneva Convention. Israeli law and protection, and therefore a very important measure of sovereignty is extended to these settlers--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S.

<dl>
<dd>In fact, UN resolutions implicitly recognize that the Israeli armistice lines are not final borders, and the Oslo Accords recognize Israel's right to occupy. As for the Geneva Conventions, even if there were a High Contracting Party making them relevant (which there is not), the articles in question apply to involuntary population transfers. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:47, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Both sides have stipulated that a final peace settlement may redraw borders, giving Israel some territory in the West Bank to encompass as many settlements as possible, so that as few as possible will have to be evacuated. Any such agreement would give Palestine corresponding uninhabited territory inside Israel, while preserving a contiguous border for the West Bank portion of the Palestinian State. This does not alter the fact that the 1967 borders are what the whole world, the UN especially, recognizes as the lawful frontiers of Israel, where her sovereignty and military presence is lawful and not in contravention of International Law and UN resolutions. The Oslo Accords in no way recognize Israel's "right to occupy." What it does is <i>stipulate</i> to the fact of the military occupation, by way of providing for limited Palestinian self-government in the form of the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Authority_16df.html" title="Palestinian Authority">Palestinian Authority</a>, as a prelude to a final settlement. As for the Israeli settlements on Occupied Land, the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Geneva_Convention_ea40.html" title="Fourth Geneva Convention">Fourth Geneva Convention</a> <i>specifically</i> applies to them, and those Israeli prevarications which you summarized have been universally rejected in official diplomatic order by all nations of the world as well as by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Court_of_Justice_d564.html" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a>. The plain fact of the matter is that the Conventions are at complete odds with Israeli policy. One example: War Crimes; Under the 1949 Conventions collective punishments are a war crime. Article 33 states: "No protected person may be punished for an offense he or she has not personally committed," and "collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited." As I'm sure you are aware, Israel routinely demolishes the homes of the families of suicide bombers.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S.

<dd>Julius Stone! Of course. A jew and a zionist. A most unbiased commentator! As I have said before, the prevarications championed by zionist partisans like Stone have been universally rejected. Of course there are supporters of Israeli occupation and expansionism, but their cause is clearly not credible, in terms of international opinion. As for the international disputes you asked about: Incessant resolutions in the UN Security Council, General Assembly, and ICJ (West Bank Wall case being the most recent). Not to mention the universal diplomatic non-recognition of both Israel's claims and the arguments put forth by the likes of Stone. As for the borders, this communication breakdown is really most remarkable. Please see my input above, dated 04:39, Jan 28, 2005, 05:07, Jan 28, 2005 and 05:19, Jan 29, 2005.

<dd>Ah, yes, you asked for legal experts, and as soon as I bring one, you pull out the old "Jew and Zionist" card. I guess his CV means nothing: <small>From 1942 until 1972 he was the Challis Professor of International Law and Jurisprudence at the University of Sydney. From 1972 until his death in 1985 Professor Stone held concurrently with his appointment as visiting Professor of Law at the University of New South Wales the position of Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the Hastings College of Law, University of California. In 1956 he received the award of the American Society of International Law, and in 1962 he was made an honorary life member of the society. In 1964 the Royal Society of Arts named him as a recipient of the Swiney Prize for Jurisprudence. In 1965 he received the World Research Award of the Washington Conference on World Peace through Law. His 26 major works include the authoritative texts Legal Controls of International Conflict, Aggression and World Order, The International Court and World Crisis and the Province and Function of Law.</small> As for General Assembly resolutions, they are irrelevant to international law; rather, they are popularity contests, as are most Security Council resolutions, including the ones one the territories. The ICJ ruling was about the security barrier, not about Israel's lack of borders. And Israel's lack of borders goes both ways; a number of countries don't recognize Israel as legal in its current Armistice lines, and critical U.N. resolutions anticipated that they would change before a settlement was reached. Finally, arguments put forward by "the likes of you" have nothing but ignorance and prejudice to contribute to a discussion on International Law, particulary as compared to "the likes of Stone". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup></dd>

<dd>It is plain you think this <i>is</i> the place to debate this, after all. Very well. You fail to recognize the sarcasm (much less the rhetorical question) implicit in the comment "The Israeli Bureau of Wishful Thinking". It was not experts I was demanding you produce, it was a comment that such expertise does of course exist in zionist circles, and is internationally <b>discredited</b>, especially in terms of universal condemnation of Israeli occupation and settlement activity. It is not a <i>card</i> one pulls when one points out that the expert you cited is so clearly biased and a member of an ideology. I reject your implication that the use of the word "zionist" and "jew" are intrinsically racist or in anyway imply ignorance or prejudice. Stone's position and background is clearly not impartial, no matter what impressive list of accolades he has achieved. What's more, his arguments have failed repeatedly in the UN and are reflected in the official diplomatic standing of <i>all nations in the world</i>, none of which support his reasoning or his conclusions. Naturally, when Israel loses, resolutions and world bodies become popularity contests, and the whole world is anti-semitic. Also note: While General Assembly resolutions are non-binding according to International Law, Security Council resolutions most certainly are. Nevertheless, both are a manifestation of an "international dispute" that Israel consistently loses. The recent ICJ ruling was an advisory opinion, but nevertheless clearly rules on international law, and the Wall, by duly considered international law, is illegal. Note that I did not say it concerned borders, and was an example of an International Dispute that Israel lost, which you specifically asked me for. Action demanding its removal, must be made by the Security Council. Finally, I must ask you not to engage in <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> on me.

<dd>I haven't seen any "discrediting" done by anyone, outside of your claims. The issues of the legality of settlements is different from the issue of the legality or even existence of an occupation. <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominum.html" title="Ad hominum">Ad hominum</a> arguments are indeed a "card" that people pull when they have no substantive arguments, and when the labels "Zionist" and "Jew" are used to dismiss arguments, rather than rational discourse, there is only one logical conclusion. No-one is particularly impartial about anything, though they may pretend otherwise, and Stone's arguments have not been tested in a court of law; the geo-political maneuverings of various interest groups at the UN are irrelevant to them. Your <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman_argument.html" title="Strawman argument">strawman arguments</a> regarding "Israel losing at the UN" are noted and discarded; the UN is a body where countries advance their own political interests, and this has nothing to with the strength of Stone's legal arguments. As you admit UNGA resolutions and ICJ advisory positions have no impact on International Law. Nor do most Security Council resolutions, except Chapter 7 resolutions, none of which have been made against Israel. As for my comments, they were no more offensive that your "the likes of Stone", the "Jew" and "Zionist", comments were. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:48, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the universal rejection by <i>every nation in the world</i>, independent of the UN, of the views espoused by Stone and his supporters [read: <i>likes of Stone</i>, absolutely no derogatory meaning implied] does not prove to you the utter discrediting of his legal arguments, then nothing will. Stone is not the only expert arguing for Israel; A little research will produce more, just as it will produce an avalanche of expertise of the opposite view. The main point is that this sort of reasoning (pro-Zionist) officially failed as expressed by Security Council resolutions and ICJ rulings, as well as the afore-mentioned universal diplomatic rejection. As for the ICJ having no impact on International Law, that is flatly incorrect. The court has no power of <i>enforcement</i>, that rests with the executive branch of the UN, the Security Council. Nevertheless rulings of the ICJ <b>are</b> international law, which the UNSC uses, along with other sources, in it's role as enforcer. Your reasoning that I have engaged in argumentum ad hominem is a red herring to try and paint me as a racist. I repeat: The use of the terms "Jew" and "Zionist" are in no way racist. In fact, suggestion to the contrary smacks of racism, by implying that the "Jew" and "Zionist" are inherently "bad". I have given you enough rational discourse to fill a tank, we both have.

<dd>The caricature is by no means libelous, that is an outrageous suggestion. I don't think you understand the nature and definition of a caricature at all, in fact. You are now grasping at straws, and I will not attempt to engage you in this ridiculous assertion. I doubt very much that Wikipedia administrators will find it libelous either.

<dd>Your position seems to be that anything representing the Arab side's beliefs and attitides is libellous, and this is accompanied by a steadfast refusal to address the point that <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editorial_cartoon.html" title="Editorial cartoon">political cartoons</a> work by exaggeration, caricature, and metaphor, frequently in terms of animals. As the Wikipedia article notes, political cartoons in the form of story-lined comic strips are "often denounced by traditionalists as being little more editorial columns desguised as cartoons." (so, by clear implication, other political cartoons are not).<br />

I've been following the exchanges, now I'm going to take a deep breath and jump in..</p>
<p>Friends, despite the high quality of the discussion, I get the feeling that you may be missing each other.</p>
<p>A. S. A. - You need to understand that for Jayg and for many Jewish readers object strongly to the shark comparison. Why is that? Because during the 30s Jews in Europe were typically compared to rats, pigs, etc.. This was done, cynically, in an effort to deny Jews their humanity, after which their persecutors felt they would be able to do whatever they wanted with them. Since then Jews have felt an understandable visceral repulsion to animal comparisons.</p>
<p>Jayg - The point of cartoon is not to dehumanise jews. There is <b>no</b> metaphor along the lines calling upon a expedition to exterminate the sharks. What the cartoon is about, is the Palestinian feeling of helplessness in the face of Israel's overwhelming military superiority as well as American complicity and indifference.</p>
<p>I'm hoping these remarks help to bring you forward. Maybe ASA will show sensitivity and chose another metaphor. Maybe Jayg will overcome his repulsion and accept the cartoon. And just maybe, we will make an ever so small step in the direction of understanding; which, after all, is more important than the content of the article.</p>

<p>None. Israeli sovereignty over territory within the 1949 armistice lines, alternatively known as the 1967 borders, is not in dispute by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan or the PA. Most Arab League States have stipulated the same. Likewise the world recognizes Israeli sovereignty over those territories, acknowledging that a final border agreement is pending (as mentioned earlier). I wouldn't be surprised if Qaddafi's government is probably in belligerent opposition to anything agreed so far, but that is neither here nor there, Libya has no contested borders with Israel. It is also by no means certain that Iran's current theocratic government will ever recognize Israel or normalize relations. The point being, quotations form the armistice agreement are not in contradiction with statements set forth in earlier Talk segments.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<dd>Your reply is interesting, and often factual, but not relevant. The fact remains that the documents which define the Armistice Lines themselves make clear that they are not borders.

<dd>It's amusing to see you declaring QED on a factoid that is not in dispute. Please note that (a) in international media coverage, (b) in negotiations between the combatants, (c) in commentaries by world leaders and the like, the armistice lines are repeatedly referred to as borders. The term "armistice lines" is rarely mentioned, nevertheless they are valid and will be revisited when a final peace agreement is reached and borders are agreed upon by treaty. In the interim, the phrase "1967 borders" and alternatively "pre-1967 borders" will continue to be used by the world to refer to what they consider as Israel's <i>lawful</i> frontiers, without prejudice to the legal status of a final border agreement.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A.

<p>Could this be accepted as a breather? I assisted to a conference about the Middle-East peace, 2 years ago in Edmonton Canada. The speakers were a Catholic Bishop, a Rabbi and a professor of university who spoke on behalf of the Palestinians. All agreed that before any real progress can be made politicaly, religious peace had to be found first. The conference ended without an answer. Abbas, not the name of the Palestinian leader, but the sound of the word, its meaning and its plurial are of great drawing force upon the 3 major religious participants of the present opportunity for peace. Abba Father is the utmost intimate exclamation of one's heart and spirit in communion with the Fatherhood of God. The obvious and simple point of reference for the religious peace in the Middle-East is found in cultivating the abba Father of Abraham when he received the blessing from the King of justice and of peace, Melchisedec. That blessing is what seals God's blessing upon all families and nations of the Earth! ABRAHAM’S UNIVERSAL APPEAL As a child of God, maturity grows because all of one's heart, soul, mind and strenght is compelled by love in the worshipping obedience that comes in response to God, as He makes Himself known to one as the personal adopting, heavenly, creating Father. A word used to express this sacrifice of worship is: "Muslim"! Also, where from God reveals Himself within each one of His children, for the sacrifice of worship to happen in truth and in spirit, is known in the Bible as the inner most being and prophetically unveiled as the Holy of Holies in Zion. Therefore, by historically accepted definitions, it is divinely safe to say in practical theory, that the maturity of God's blessing to Abraham's family, is to live out His appointed version of the Muslim-Zionist state... The true and simple nature of the Covenant in the union with God as quoted in Heb. 8, 10-12 of the New-Testament, is given to humanity so as to become, along with other equally proper definitions, a race of Muslim-Zionist!!!...PS: The same completion from the Covenant of union with God is available to adapt with humanity from all genuine openings who seeks to find and to serve Love and Justice, in the fostering of eternity through time and space...</p>

There is no need for "research" to rebut that kind of analogy. And of course it can be USA, Greenland, or Australia, that's the whole point of a rhetorical analogy. At no time is the destruction of Israel advocated just because this highly POV quotation is balanced with the Arab perspective of the invalidity of the analogy and argument Bauer was making.

<p>You might want to elaborate the context, or increase the quotation, to more clearly show this. Even so, please note that "destruction of the Israel" is also a political consideration, not a physical one. It entails abolishing the state (which for the record I strongly oppose) and in no way advocates or includes "genocide" as you have implied in your edit summary. The fact is that a swath of Palestinians and Arabs, as you well know and as is documented in several articles, do not accept the legality of a Jewish state, but nevertheless advocate the Jewish residents remain if the Israeli state is abolished. This view and it's related context to the "destruction" of Israel and alleged anti-semitism must be included and that is why I rebutted the Bauer analogy. I think the quotation is certainly confusing and misplaced but rather then delete it I offered a balance.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S.

<li>If it is true (which I doubt) that "most Arabs" object to the formation of <b>any</b> state on the basis of ethnicity (which the paragraph seems to imply), Bauer's objection is apt.</li>
<li>The argument that is obscured here is that "most Arabs" assert that:

<li>As per the PLO charter, Jews are in fact nothing like a people; they are merely adherents to a religion, the way Christians are</li>
<li>Even if they were a people, they have no legitimate connection to the area</li>
<li>Even if they did have a legitimate connection to the area, their rights are trumped by those of the Palestinians</li>
</ul>

<li>Several writers have made the point that Palestinians aren't antisemitic because their objection is to state of Israel, not to the people who live there. To put it bluntly, they don't mind Jews, as long as they don't live in what is now known as Israel.</li>
<li>Bauer's point is that if you wish to abolish the state of Israel, you must also consider - even take responsibility for - the consequences for the Jews who live there specifically, and you have to consider the fact that the formation of the state of Israel is a response to millenia of persecution of Jews. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 20:57, 2005 Mar 22 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have problems in general with qualifiers as "most Arabs," but it I have read several PLO and other writings that deny any connection between the area in question and the Jews. They claim that Jews are descendants of the Khazars, Jesus was not a Jew but a "Palestinian," there was never any Jewish temple in Jerusalem, etc. The PLO charter does state - as Jayg points out, that only "indigenous" Jews have the right to remain in the state of Palestine, and these are limited to descendants of those who can prove they lived there before 1917 or 1880. If we would take the kingdom of Jordan or (more or less) autonomous PNA areas on the West Bank as an example, it would appear that Palestinian leaders want a - and I use this term quite deliberately - Judenrein Palestine. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 21:42, 2005 Mar 22 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The distinction that Palestinians (including the PLO) draw is between Zionist and non-Zionist Jews. It's every bit as reasonable to want to keep immigrants who openly proclaim their desire to take over your country out (isn't that <i>Israel's</i> argument when the subject of refugees comes up?) as it is unreasonable to expel people who have lived there all along without any such plans, and the fact that the PNA has the good sense to try to keep the former out of their areas in no way implies that they want to eliminate the latter from Palestine. As for denials, none of the denials you cite are denials of <i>any</i> connection, but of specific connections. The claim that there was never any Jewish temple in Jerusalem is normally accompanied by the claim that the Samaritans are right and the Jewish temple "should" be on <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Gerizim_76d3.html" title="Mount Gerizim">Mount Gerizim</a>, and in any case, since it contradicts Islam, is not popular with anyone but negotiating teams. And nobody claims that <i>all</i> Jews were descendants of the Khazars; the claim is that Ashkenazis are descendants of the Khazars (and is often accompanied by the argument that Sephardis/Mizrahis should side with their Arab brothers.) - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 22:58, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Charter makes no distinction between Zionist and non-Zionist Jews; rather it sets the arbitrary (and not clearly defined) date as the dividing point. Since the vast majority of Jews are Zionists of one type or another, including those who lived in Israel before (at best) 1917, and since the PLO Charter would exclude 99.9% of Jews from Israel regardless of their beliefs, I don't see the sense in your argument. Yes, it's true that a few hundred nonegenarians would present no threat to a Palestinian state, other than a drain on their healthcare system, but this argument is still rather specious. The history denial regarding the Temple doesn't seem to mention the Samaritans, but rather simply denies Jewish attachment to the city (somehow ignoring 3,000 years of prayer and yearning). The claim that Palestinians "only" insist that Ashkenazi Jews are Khazars is also rather specious, given that at least 80% of Jews are Ashkenazi. As for Sephardi/Mizrahi Jews siding with their "Arab brothers", the ones I know are rather more militant about doing the exact opposite, since they have unpleasant memories of their experiences of their treatment at the hands of their "Arab brothers". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:16, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The date is far from arbitrary, as you surely realize, and the charter includes their descendants. And yes, "history denial regarding the Temple" does mention Mt. Gerizim (at least, the only forms I've ever come across), not that it's any more than a silly negotiating pose. Nor does anyone claim that "Palestinians" insist, but that "some people" insist. The implausibility of Sephardis siding with their Arab brothers (despite occasional examples) does not stop this from being commonly given as a flip side to the Ashkenazis being Khazar. Not that it would matter - having been somewhere 2,000 years ago is never a good excuse to take it over now. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 23:27, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe we're reading different PLO Charters. From what I can see, <small>Article 6: The Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the Zionist invasion will be considered Palestinians.</small> makes no mention of descendents. As well, <small>Article 20: ...Claims of historical or religious ties of Jews with Palestine are incompatible with the facts of history and the true conception of what constitutes statehood. Judaism, being a religion, is not an independent nationality. Nor do Jews constitute a single nation with an identity of its own; they are citizens of the states to which they belong.</small> denies that Jews have any historical or even religious connection to Israel, regardless of whether they are Ashkenazi/Sepharadi/Mizrachi, and also denies that the Jews are a people (several years, by the way, before Golda Meir said Palestinians were not a people). As for the Temple argument, I've seen mention of Nablus, but nothing specific about Gerizim (which is outside of Nablus) - do you have a link? And in response to your last argument, I could say that have been somewhere 60 years ago is never a good excuse to take it over now. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:41, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But if you did claim that "having been somewhere 60 years ago is never a good excuse to take it over now" (as Israel does...) you would at the very least have to acknowledge that having been there 2,000 years ago was an excuse many times worse. Gerizim, Nablus - same thing, for this purpose; the point in both cases is the idea that the Samaritans were right. As to the charter, recall Article 5: "Anyone born, after that date, of a Palestinian father - whether inside Palestine or outside it - is also a Palestinian." Thus if they are Palestinian, so are their descendants. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 23:56, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I personally think that efforts to deny the historical connection between the Jewish people and Israel in general and Jerusalem in particular are rather pathetic and really only undermine the credibility of the PNA, Waq'f, etc. But I think it's worth parsing the issue you're getting at. Prior to the birth of modern Zionism, there were plenty of Jews that wanted to return to what they perceived as their homeland in Palestine, for a variety of reasons. They were looking for the right to live there in peace, but had no national aspirations beyond that. The Dreyfus affair gave Herzl the conviction that the nationalist impulses of Europe could only be met by a Jewish nationalist movement that included the formation of a Jewish state. The Shoah made the movement an imperative of great urgency. The ongoing conflict with the Arabs only served to reinforce the perspective that a secure Jewish homeland (which was needed to ensure survival of the Jewish people) could only be achieved with great struggles, sacrifices, and - tragically - armed conflict. The canard of the "Zionists" as colonialists, imperialists, etc., therefore comes across as an absurdity. Most Israelis - and indeed Jews - are deeply troubled by the fact that Palestinian Arabs are suffering because Jews needed desperately a homeland, and they resent the implication that they had much choice in the matter. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 23:53, 2005 Mar 22 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, efforts to deny the historical connection between the Jewish people and Israel in general are rather pathetic; they actually backfire, insofar as they suggest that if Jews do have a historical connection (which of course they do) that would somehow legitimize Israel. And I do appreciate (if not entirely agree with) the perspective you outline - the idea that Jews needed a homeland as a matter of physical survival, and Palestine was the most readily available and (for them) desirable one available. However, while their motivations were, at least in part, substantially different from typical colonialists, their effect on Palestinians was much the same as it would have been if their motivations were identical. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 00:07, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><small><code>"If you advocate the abolition of Israel ... that means in fact that you're against the people who live there. If you are, for example, against the existence of Malaysia, you are anti-Malay. If you are against the existence of Israel, you are anti-Jewish." (As this is quote, it needs a citation)</code></small></dd>
</dl>
<p>Bauer never says <i>State of</i>, he says "Malaysia" and "Israel," and I think he may be using (possibly a product of imperfect English), the word 'abolish' and 'annihilate' interchangebly, but this isn't a published work, it takes place during unrehersed conversation. From the interview with Michael Krasny, Tue, Jan 11, 2005:</p>
<dl>
<dd><small><b>A. Contd.</b> There are [Unclear: certain intellectuals who] ... propogate a type of anti-Israeli propaganda which crosses the line between a perfectly legitimate criticism of any Israeli or any other government, I mean, one can and should perhaps be opposed to policy they dosen't [sic.] like, one oppose things that are wrong, certainly I would be part of that. But, on the other hand, the Israeli media that are probably more critical of the Israeli government than any one outside of Israel, are critical because they want to better Israel, have a better and more prosperous and secure and humanistic and so on and so forth Israel. Now, when you cross that line and advocate, in fact, a war against Israel in some form or way, you are getting very near to a genocided [sic.] propaganda against the Jews of Israel. [unclear few words] But, again, you have to emphasize, this is a minority, and the majority of media and intellectuals and so on would not subscribe to that, but, it's the ones who raise their voices which one hears.</small></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><small><b>Q.</b> That's a very vexing question, though, where do you distinguish, how do you distinguish, between anitsemitism and being anti-Israel, well, you know [unclear; Bauer interjects]</small></dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd><small><b>A.</b> Well, it's simple, if you advocate either the abolition of Israel, or you support a war -not only of words, but you know, terrorism and so on and so forth - to reduce Israel to compliance with a policy which would abolish it, annihilate it, that means, in fact, that you are against the people who live there. Now, if you are against the existence of Malaysia, for instance, you are anti-Malay, if you are against the existence of Israel, you are anti-Jewish.</small></dd>

<li>The only edit that might need further clarification has to do with the ability of the land to absorb more people. But from what I know, there are no or very few Israelis that doubt whether there is room for all the world's Jews and all the world's Palestinians - the reason they're resisting letting Palestinians move in, is because they have noted that a) that would lead to an Arab majority in the country; and b) Palestinians are demonstrably hostile toward the existence of a Jewish state.

<p>I have just introduced an edit to these contested phrases. NPOV does not mean placing "they claim" before Arab views and leaving Israeli claims as statements of facts. Please refrain from inflammatory rhetoric (like "sick mind"). The acute need for relief from persecution is not disputed. It is the some-time Arab view that they were being made to pay for European atrocities that is a valid POV to be listed in an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 13:43, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course it is valid to state the contention; what I object to is questioning the need Jews had for protection against Nazi atrocities; so I think we're in agreement about that. I made on correction - "mainstream Zionists" (whatever that means these days) aren't - as I've pointed out - concerned about it being too crowded in the area; they fear than an influx of Arabs/Palestinians would cause an intolerable demographic situation. There are (solvable) issues related to fresh water supply. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 16:38, 2005 Apr 2 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is nothing POV about the fact that "the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist.html" title="Zionist">Zionist</a> immigrants arriving in Palestine from the late 1800s on did so with the intention of taking it over and establishing a Jewish majority state, in some cases by force". That is the definition of Zionism: an effort to establish a Jewish national homeland. As Israelis (including Leifern's own edit) constantly remind us, this involves establishing and maintaining a Jewish majority state, and that was their stated intention. And indeed, the need for relief from persecution is not disputed - but the a Jewish state in Palestine would not have prevented the Holocaust any more than it prevented the persecution of Soviet Jews, and if someone claims it would have that needs to be labelled as a claim. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 10:22, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You are more than welcome to find and add some. More importantly, the <i>Nasser kicking the Jew into the sea</i> caricature is extremely detrimental to the Arab position, and as such is used to great advantage. I cringe when I see it, because I worry that it perpetuates the myth that all Arabs literally want to drive the Jewish population in Israel, to <i>physically</i> drown in the sea. I have never thought of deleting it because it's a valid measure of what was in the 1960s an overwhelming pan-Arab desire to abolish the Jewish state. While there are mudereous factions on both sides of this conflict, implications of mass genocide is a myth used to demonize the Arabs. It's nothing to wink at. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 04:58, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I understand your emotions, but please don't be so self-centered. Nobody says "all Arabs", but it doesn't even matter. I am sure <b>all</b> Germans were not ready to murder Jews either. First, <b>all</b> are not required. Second, with leaders reckless enough, propangda loud enough, technology advanced enough and some economic incentives, it's possible. I am afraid finding a similar Israeli anti-Arab cartoon won't be so easy, because AFAIK the mainstream Israel's press (while brutal towards the Israeli govt) does not demonize/dehumanize/calls to genocide their neighbors. I have a 1949 picture of Arab women voting in Israel that can be considered. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">Talk</a> 10:18, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was talking in the context of a myth, and moreover I explicitly stated "overwhelming pan-Arab desire" so surely I am not being self-centered. Also, again I stress that cartoons like that are <i>not</i> a call to genocide, although murderous factions do exists on both sides. Calls for the abolition of the Jewish state, using the metaphor of Jews being driven into the sea, is not the same as a genocidal call for the destruction of Israel and the massacre of her citizens. As for anti-Arab caricatures being hard to find, nothing easier. Women in Green <a href="http://www.womeningreen.org/olegindex.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.womeningreen.org/olegindex.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> have a bevy of both anti-Arab caricatures as well as plenty of snipes against any Israeli figure that advocates the least modicum of rights for Arabs. I think the one of Arafat passing the dynamite to Abbass is a good candidate for possible inclusion in the article. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 01:03, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV Vs POV</span></h2>
<p>Just came across this on a random link... I see a lot of arguing about whether something is POV, which is understandable considering such a contentious issue. A couple of things that would, IMHO settle a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple wording:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>An example:
<dl>
<dd><i>Israelis and supporters cite a source of the Arab-Israeli conflict as the traditional interpretations of...</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If this were reworded to avoid an us-and-them sentiment then it would appear less POV. As in get rid of the Isaelis and supporters and change it perhaps by deleting it all and making it start "Traditional interpretations of...".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And another:
<dl>
<dd><i>Some Israelis contend that one of the primary reasons for continued Muslim Arab hostility towards Israel is that sharia forbids Jews or Christians from being considered equal to Muslims.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Could be changed to
<dl>
<dd><i>(Also) Sharia forbids Jews or Christians from being considered equal to Muslims</i> - if this is not a fact then add Some interprettations at the start.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And the picture:
<dl>
<dd><i>Caricature illustrating the US as biased towards Israel, a view predominant in (but not limited to) the Arab world.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Even I've seen this picture before and so:
<dl>
<dd><i>A often cited example of a caricature illustrating the US as biased towards Israel.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Adding the "often cited" makes it clear the articles not trying to push a POV case. Taken out the Arab world because it is very disdainful, and kind of obvious. It would be great if it could be referenced and most importantly dated (I seem to remember it was the 60s/70s). I'd just like the say the other caricature's labeling is a good example.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In summary, talking about "Arabs/Israelis view this ...." sounds inherently POV (and adding "Generally", "Some" or "Predominantly" before doesn't help). <b>It doesn't mean what it's trying to be asserted is POV.</b> Use "Observers", or "Reasons for the conflict may include" rather than "Israelis" and "Arabs".</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>More refereces:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia aims at being an accademic resource so sorting as many statements as possible <i>especially</i> the contentious ones would be great. If possible every subsection within "Reasons for the conflict" should have something supporting that it is not an original idea.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Length</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The article is hideously long. Not related to POV, but would be nice if new articles were made out of it. I probably only managed to read a fifth of it before giving up.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is a good article, and if you sit down and read it without the points above it is reasonably NPOV. Thoughts welcome. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 22:52, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

This article will probably always be a hotbed for edits and attendant debates/arguments, but I think we should all try to resist the temptation to edit it to conform with our worldview at the expense of other's.

<dd><i>I think we should all try to resist the temptation to edit it to conform with our worldview</i>. Bare in mind that reverting IrishpunkTom's edits does just that. I think saying it has no credibility is harsh. Going through his edits paragraph by paragraph:
<ol>
<li>This paragraph he's labeled that <i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharia.html" title="Sharia">sharia</a> (Islamic law) which requires, among other things, that <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> territory encompass all land that was ever under Muslim control.</i> is contended. Unless this is a stated fact there is nothign wrong with that. Some of the wording would need taming though.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I contend that That is simply not true. I'd like to know from what scholar said is was so, and from what maddhab that scholar was from, and the exact wording of any Fatwa that says such. Comparrisons here should also note other lands that were once Muslim but are no longer. Spain, India and Sicily being obvious examples. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Muslims-&gt;Others is one of the things I've suggested above so I quite like. As for the quote removal, may not be right - IMHO it should just be a <a href="http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp490.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp490.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> link as its saying exactly the same thing as the rest of the paragraph so redundant.</li>
<li>First sentence looks fine from whoever's view. Adding Jewish in front is also fine, although I would word it "Pro-Israeli" - it makes it clear his bias (unless you're going to tell me that Morris represents the vast majority of views). Removal of the tear-up sentence, I don't know enough about. Sounds an odd thing to do, since if they were that rash they could happily just ignore it and expel all jews anyway.</li>

<li>I'd agree. The Bias of the author is obviously important in an article of this nature. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup></li>

<ol>
<li>As said above, there is no need to go into each of the persecutions. This article isn't about documented persecutions, its about what caused the conflict so as above "Despite the pact, Morris (2001) documents persecutions continued to occur" is plenty.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Link to another site containing this paragraph. There is no reason to keep it, as it contains a Lopsided POV. For example, it mentions an attrocity in Granada as an example of Muslim prejudices against Jews in Spain, yet at that time the Most Major Muslim City in Spain was Cordoba where Jewish Persecution was non-existant. I'm not trying to deny that Persecution existed at that time in Grenada, but the way it is presended is Lopsided and Pushes a POV in to the direction of Bias of the author. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup></li>

<p>He deleted huge amounts of well-cited information (which, by the way, violate no copyrights), and inserted completely un-cited personal opinions, filled with spelling errors. It astonishes me that you would suggest that any of his edits were reasonable. As for the other specifics, I'm not sure which you're referring to, but I should point out that labelling Morris as "Jewish" and Kadourie as "Iraqi Jewish" is <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">poisoning the well</a>, and it rather surprises me that you accept his labelling Morris and Kadourie this way, but prefer "Others" to "Muslims"; I haven't seen anyone but Muslims defend Sharia. As well, he removes information asking for sources, when Morris is clearly listed as the source. He moves the "repressive regimes that lasted a short time" disclaimer from the distinctive clothing dhimmi regulation to cover all dhimmi regulations without any sort of justification, etc. There's not an edit I can see that isn't either censorship, POV, uncited, or simply wrong. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:00, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Jay, Firstly, as you yourself have argued previously, not every israeli agrees on any one subject. So me inserting "Certain" in front of Israelis, i thought, would have met with your approval. Secondly, what these People, apparently, believe is the shariat seems to be woefully far from reality. I Cannot accept that that remains without the Caveat that it is a non-muslims belief of what the shariat entails. I am not defending the Shairiat, I am simply not believing this non-Muslim interpretation. I am non-Muslim. As I've stated previously, Morris is a Historian who crticisizes previous israeli Governments for not doing enough Ethnic Cleansing of the Arabs of Israel, and is a proponent of mass expulsion of Arabs from israel and the Occupied Territories, he is far far far far from having a NPOV on this matter.--Irishpunktom\</li>

<dd>Regarding the Benny Morris quote, it was inserted because an editor (possibly more than one, I don't recall) insisted on having a full quote and would not accept a summary or paraphrase. If we do summarize or paraphrase it, all that will happen is that another editor will come along and delete it for not being properly referenced. As for Morris being Jewish, he's a respected academic historian with a doctorate from Cambridge University writing about his area of academic expertise; is the implication here that, because he's a Jew, he would make these things up or in some way deliberately obfuscate evidence to the contrary? Furthermore, politically, Morris has often been held to be pro-Palestinian, though his views have changed somewhat in recent years. As for the copyright claim, there is no copyright issue here. It's not that long a quote and we attribute it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:00, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The claim that David Irving is a good historian, the quality of whose work can be compared to Benny Morris, is absurd and can't be allowed to stand. Irving is an unqualified, self-taught writer, who has been shown in a court of law to be a fraud and whose work no one will publish anymore. Morris has a PhD in history from Cambridge University, holds an academic post at a respectable university, and is writing about his area of expertise. This isn't Noam Chomsky, a linguist, waxing lyrical about Iraq. This is an academic historian doing history, and that makes Morris a reputable source as far as Wikipedia is concerned. If you find opposing academic views regarding the issue we quoted him on, by all means add them with a citation, but Morris's views do not have to be qualified by referring to your perception of his bias. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:27, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The difference is that labeling Moris as Jewish is that he is a person. Talking about Muslims as whole is different - it implies that they have a collective viewpoint which many consider offensive and thus the POV allegations. If you note that in the section above I prefer the term others whenever it talks about what Muslims think AND Israeli's think. As said I prefer pro-israeli as it is more open (ie leaving the opportunity Jews may be pro arab and non-israelis may be pro israeli which obviously are around).</dd>
<dd>Anyway that is a very small point. My problem is that strawman arguments are being built against him and his whole collection of edits are gone.</dd>
<dd>I still so no relevancy to quoting the entire paragraph though - we don't need a list of attrocities here - this article is about the reasons for the conflict. It doesn't matter where, when and how the attrocities happened. A small note to say that despite the pact, persecutions did occur is sufficient. They belong in an article Pre-1948 persecutions of Jews by Muslims. The only reason I can see for the details being stretched out is to demonize Muslims.</dd>

<dd>Regarding Morris, he is known as a historian; actually, the most famous of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Historian_56b0.html" title="New Historian">New Historians</a>, not as a "Jewish historian". As for the quote, as SlimVirgin pointed out above, the whole reason that quote was included was because some Muslim editors insisted that these things never happened, so they removed any reference to them, and refused to accept paraphrases, thus necessitating the use of exact quotes. Now that the quotes are here, people who were involved in the page at the time have suddenly decided they don't like to see them, and are trying to delete them. Next will come the denial that these kinds of things happened at all, followed by another round of inserting references, which will be rejected as biased paraphrases, followed by exact quotes. I prefer to break the cycle here, where the exact information is included, and properly sourced. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:49, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's also worth mentioning that the Morris book the quote comes from is about the Arab-Israeli/Arab-Zionist conflict, so in using this quote, we're not simply lifting information about the persecution of Jews that no one has argued is connected to the conflict, and using that information to build a case. The inclusion of the information in Morris's book is part of his thesis that these issues are connected: that the current conflict is connected to previous conflicts. No demonization of any group is intended; rather, an historical context is being provided, with reference to a scholarly work, which is what Wikipedia articles are supposed to do. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:58, Apr 20, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Only guidelines but still.</dd>

<p>Other than the fact that you are using a logical fallacy (<a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">poisoning the well</a>) to lead this conversation in another direction, I have nothing to say on the issue. I have stated my position clearly on my page. Yet, I do not burst into threads and do some unileteral redecorating without cooperating with other posters on the issue. I know there is a tendency for new users to come in and do something controversial to get their name out, but it is not acceptable in wikipedia. If you disagree with something, take it to talk. If you have a wider disagreement with the take on Sharia, take it to the Sharia article and work to change it from there. Like I said, I have my position, and there are times when I find something I do not agree with, but I work within the system to change it through agreement, and if that is not possible, I leave it alone until I find something to support my position or someone more knowledgable does. And if not, I just leave it alone.</p>
<p>I have no vested interest in your edits. I never liked Benny Morris, like I never like any New Historian, and after he changed his conclusion, my views of him slightly improved. Even I grudingly accept his historical nerrative. In the end, you erased supported historical information from a controversial historian, and that doesnt fly here.</p>

<p>This is all getting very confusing and bordering on personal. I suggest we start subsections regarding EACH of the edits discussing their relevance rather than whitewashing Irishpunktom edits as <i>no credibility and diminish the quality of the project</i> and <i>He deleted huge amounts of well-cited information (which, by the way, violate no copyrights), and inserted completely un-cited personal opinions, filled with spelling errors. It astonishes me that you would suggest that any of his edits were reasonable</i>. Both are unfair comments attempted to squash all of his edits rather than considering each of them in turn. Granted, many may be without merit, but he deserves to have his say without being flamed.</p>
<p>The same can be said about the converse - <i>Mass expulsion and Ethnic Cleansing and as such cannot be used a Neutral source</i> doesn't mean he's wrong and bringing up other irrelevant historians who are <i>Nazi Sympathiser and a Holocoust Denier</i> is a blatent atempt to get a rise out of the Jewish quarter on this talk page. Also labeling biases are irrelevant. They may still (and often do) have valid points.</p>

<dd>Irishpunktom has been fundamentally dishonest about any number of things, including this, his stalking, his reverts out of pique, etc. from the very start. He has reverted pages time and time again without even looking at the content, often complaining about text that wasn't even in articles, or alternatively claiming sources weren't there simply because he failed to read them. He has inserted POV that is rarely, if ever, supported by sources, and in general completely ignored Wikipedia policy. His every edit is for the purpose of propaganda, yet has the nerve to accuse others here of "bias".

The Jewish <i>dhimmi</i> were forbidden, under pain of death, to defend themselves by striking the children.

As Jayjg said above, we should break the cycle now, and leave the quote where it is, and I agree. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:17, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I haven't participated in —nor read— the discussion (by which I mean: who? why? and to what end?), but I fail to see why Morris needs to be cited at such lengths, listing these massacres individually.

<dd>As I said above, the whole reason that quote was included was because some Muslim editors insisted that these things never happened, so they removed any reference to them, and refused to accept paraphrases, thus necessitating the use of exact quotes. Now that the quotes are here, people who were involved in the page at the time have suddenly decided they don't like to see them, and are trying to delete them. Next will come the denial that these kinds of things happened at all, followed by another round of inserting references, which will be rejected as biased paraphrases, followed by exact quotes. I prefer to break the cycle here, where the exact information is included, and properly sourced. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:38, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Anyway, why not embed it with the arrow and dash thingy, whatever you call it (and what do you call it?), do you not find it to imbalance and hinder the flow of that section? At any rate, hypothetically, someone on the other side may ask for the Hamidullah passage to be expanded for this or that reason. I only wish to avoid overquotationing.

<p>At least if it remains the stated opinion of Benny Morris, the reader is not led to believe that it is taken for fact. The "Muslim editors" (who a quick check of the archive reveals were not all identifiably Muslim) can always add in contrary opinions from other sources.

<p>El C, the discussion on the dhimmi passage is in archive number 3. It seems that Dr Zen (a peculiar name for a Muslim) suggested that Morris had not said that Muslims "rose up" against Jews in the incidents mentioned. It all seems rather flimsy justification for quoting so much of one person, but that's a matter of judgement for the interested editors. Since one is SlimVirgin, whose judgement I generally trust, I wouldn't demur. Dr Zen also gave a reference to Hamidullah's article. I believe Hamidullah's works are widely available. He's quite well known and respected on this and other subjects, although apparently not "knowledgeable". <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:05, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>No but I think the point is rather that he suggests that the overall relationship was favourable to dhimmi. I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with either view, Jay, simply suggesting that that is what the views in question are. The massacres are not <i>necessarily</i> indicative of a broader bad relationship nor does what happened in 900 <i>necessarily</i> reflect what happened in, say, 1800. Times and people change. For instance, the Protestants were severely persecuted in France, often by their neighbours, in the most savage way, but that doesn't mean that a Protestant would today encounter problems in Paris, or that recent French history, for example, has been characterised by anti-Protestantism, or that the same thing <i>necessarily</i> happened in other Catholic countries. It doesn't even suggest that the anti-Protestant feeling was particularly widespread (although other things do confirm that). That's not to say, either, that Jews might not have the feeling that previous discrimination is indicative, only that we ought not to be too quick to endorse the inference from one to another, or to draw too broad a conclusion about how widespread it was from one incident or another.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 00:52, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Exactly, the section is already personified with the two of them (at least, that's the logical conclusion I've drawn to make the whole thing coherent) — perhaps this in itself needs to be rethought. More specifically, Morris depicts his point poorly for us. Maybe he just didn't think this through (I don't know, I never heard of him), considering his rather propagandist line (unless, again, he elaborates, clarifies and qualifies elsewhere), the only concrete casualty figures he gives us amount to less than ten thousand. This paints a glowingly favourable picture of Islam's treatment of Jews in past Centuries — at a minimum, one tenth of of the <a href="../../../c/h/m/Chmielnicki_Uprising_1b4c.html" title="Chmielnicki Uprising">Chmielnicki massacare</a>. The rest is uninformative for the purposes of such a (pivotal) comparison: casualty-less massacres, a district almost being destroyed (which tells very little in and of itself), and a few <i>dozens</i> murdered by Nazi mobs. As for such an underlying attitude by Muslims (just) towards Jews (?), I mean, 'infidelism' is a property of every religion that I know of, without exception, whatsoever. It's all about degrees, which we measure foremost with human lives. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 08:39, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yikes, I leave wikipedia over night and I come back and this is all done. The sections certainly has a less repressive feel to it (dispite, not removing any facts).

<dd>I haven't deleted the sharia section. If somebody actually makes this argument, I don't think it needs to be removed. But it strikes me as being very far out of the mainstream. In the section I added, I have cited examples of pro-Israeli sites using the arguments I mentioned. I would be interested to know if there is any pro-Israeli literature that cites sharia law as the main or even a primary reason for the conflict. Even religious Israelis who claim that god has promised Israel to the Jews (again an argument that I am not qualified to elucidate) focus their arguments on the Jewish bible and Jewish law, ignoring Islam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This section strikes me as an argument that would be advanced by a religious Israeli who has figured out that the people he is arguing with have a very negative opinion of the "god promised the land to the jews" argument. In this way they are saying "oh yeah, well Islam also claims the land on a religious basis, so you can't blame Israel".</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Reguardless, I am arguing for its demotion in the list of Israeli arguments not because it is flawed or ineffective, but because I believe that it is difficult (if not impossible) to find Israelis that consider this a primary explanation for the Israeli Arab conflict.

<p>I think the Sharia issue is connected with Islamic fundamentalism that claims all of the Middle East for an Islamic state. Islamic terrorist groups such as Al Quada and Hamas consistently use their interpertation of Islamic law to legitimize terror against Jews. It is also connected with the idea that having an "infidel state" in the Holy Land would be blasphamous as it is their belief that Islam must rule the world.</p>

If someone asked me (not involved in this conflict at all, but find it interesting) why arabs might be less than amicable towards israelis I'd say it was to do with their belief that its their land.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reorganizing the "reasons for the conflict" section</span></h2>
<p>Looking throught the talk page, it appears that many people have made negative comments about the organization of this section (or of the entry as a whole). I think that there is some merit to the idea of reorganizing the entire "reasons for the conflict" section. I think the section often makes it difficult (for somebody unfamiliar with the conflict) to determine which points of view are representative of which side. I also think the section does a poor job of prioritizing (clearly some points of disagreement of created far greater amounts of discord than others) and of relating the various arguments to each other.</p>
<p>I propose reorganizing the section on a point by point basis. Each subsection ("Historical claim to the land" might be one) would have an Israeli position subsubsection that cites the arguments commonly used by pro-Israeli commentators, an Arab position subsubsection that cites the same for pro-Arab commentators, and where appropriate a reconciliation subsubsection section, citing points of commonality, arguments made by pro-Peace factions, and information that nether side likes to cite (like the recent study showing that Jewish and Palestinian mitochondrial DNA are more similar to each other than either is to European or Saudi Arabian).</p>
<p>The subsubsections would not try to argue the positions per-se. They would just try to provide an encyclopedic reference of the arguments that have been made and their relationship to each other.</p>
<p>Of course I acknowledge that the diversity of viewpoints on both the pro-Israeli and pro-Arab sides creates challenges, but it will create challenges no matter how we organize the material, and we shouldn't allow this difficulty to impede progress. Arguments that are made by extremist minorities can be cited as such, and positioned towards the bottom of their respective subsubsections.</p>
<p>I will leave this here for discussion and further ideas. If at the end of the month people seem to be in favor of this, I will use the talk page to propose an outline for a new "reasons for the conflict" and after discussion implement this.</p>

<dd>I would advise some care over original research, here. There is always the urge to frame any war to seem pointless (Look, they have the same genetic background! or nobody liked Franz-Ferdinand anyway!), but, unfortunately, the conflict is real and needs to be addressed based on real sources. I would suggest that a good starting place are the pro-israel and pro-arab links that I added awhile ago when sorting the references for this article. They lay out the arguments from both sides, and address the other's posiitons. Use them as a framing device, rather than an orginal approah. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 00:31, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Any failure on my part to do so will be a consequence of laziness, not a belief on my part that we need some new narrative of the conflict. As far as the possibility of making the conflict seem pointless, while I believe that there should be a place for including Pro-Peace arguments (certainly in recent years comparatively neutral arguments have become an important part of the dialog) I don't think there is any danger that including such arguments will make the conflic seem like a silly misunderstanding. --<a href="../../../j/s/o/User%7EJsolinsky_dbca.html" title="User:Jsolinsky">Jsolinsky</a> 04:20, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Suppose we had a "Historic claim to the land" section. It probably should reference the argument that Jews aren't native to Palestine, but instead are of European or Khazar descent because there are still some Arabs who make and publicize this claim, along with the standard rebutal. Similarly, it should probably reference the claim that Palestinians aren't a distinct people and/or are the result of Arab invaders from the period when Islam spread throughout the region because there are still some Jews who make and publicize these claims, along with the standard rebutal. Neither of these belong at the top of their respective subsubsections, but they ought to be discussed given the significant number of contemporary arguments that still make these claims. If we present those claims, shouldn't we also reference information that argues against both of them? --<a href="../../../j/s/o/User%7EJsolinsky_dbca.html" title="User:Jsolinsky">Jsolinsky</a> 04:20, 23 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arab - Israeli conflict?</span></h2>
<p>There is no conflict between Israeli Arabs and other Arabs. Shouldn't this be called "Jewish - Arab Conflict"? or "Zionist - Arab Conflict". Even this is a matter of belief. Arabic is a language group and "Jewishness" is a religious belief. "Jewishness" has no more scientific basis than "White Race" or "Aryan". Any argument that uses terms like "Jewishness", "White Race" or "Aryan" must ultimately have a way of classifying individual humans into these groupings, like the Aparthied "Race Classification Board" or the "Israeli Rabbinical Courts". How could Israel exist without an official/legal way to say if a person is "Jewish" or not?24.64.166.191 08:23, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There have been official ways of deciding if a person is a Jew that have existed for thousands of years, the existence of Israel has nothing to do with that. But what do you mean by "There is no conflict between Israeli Arabs and other Arabs"? "Arab" has no more scientific basis than "White Race" or "Aryan". Any argument that uses terms like "Arab", "White Race" or "Aryan" must ultimately have a way of classifying individual humans into these groupings, like the Apartheid "Race Classification Board". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 15:10, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are several reasons for this name:
<ol>
<li>It is more commonly used than any other phrase to refer to the conflict.</li>
<li>It is a historical convention to label conflicts based on the nations involved. We don't say that Germans attacked Poles in 1939. We say that Germany attacked Poland even though many of the Germans living in Poland supported the Nazis.</li>
<li>Jewish is used as both an ethnic group and a religion. There are many examples of people who are ethnically Jewish but not religiously Jewish. There are a number of examples of religiously Jewish people who are not ethnically Jewish.</li>
<li>There are many non-Jewish (in either sense) non-Zionist Israelis who fight for and support their country. The Israeli <a href="../../../d/r/u/Druze.html" title="Druze">Druze</a> population is a good example.</li>
<li>It is common to characterize the nations that oppose Israel as being Arab, both inside and outside of the Arab world. You might also want to take a look at <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan-Arabism_9177.html" title="Pan-Arabism">Pan-Arabism</a></li>

<dd>First of all, please sign your entries. Second of all, give me a break. The Jordanian Legion was a highly organized and trained military unit, commanded in part by British officers. Without question, among Arab military forces the Jordanian military has the most to be proud about in the wars against Israel, both from the point of view of conduct and accomplishments. Many of the Jewish/Israeli communities were attacked by Arab irregulars, i.e., people with guns and a cause. In at least one known case, soldiers from the Jordanian Legion prevented rape and massacre by these mobs By and large the irregulars were roundly defeated, and even when they weren't, the Israelis put up resistance way out of proportion to the odds. As for being "highly prejudicial" to Palestinian nationalism, it's hard to see how blowing up discos, pizzerias, restaurants, shooting at random cars, stabbing random individuals, etc., helps. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 19:47, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most of the attacks by local Palestinian groups are simply identified as "arab militias". For example:
<dl>
<dd>On December 10, 1947, Arab militias attacked a convoy bringing food and water to Gush Etzion, and killed ten Jews.<a href="http://www.raiseyourspirits.org/Laughter%20in%20a%20Time%20of%20War.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.raiseyourspirits.org/Laughter%20in%20a%20Time%20of%20War.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Abdul Khader al-Husseini was a famous (and very successful) leader of the Arab militias in and around Jerusalem. If you are interested in this subject you could research and write an entry about him. He was effective in leading and coordinating a series of attacks that made it extremely difficult for Jews to get food and supplies to Jerusalem during the months leading up to Israeli independence. His death on April 9th or 10th of 1948, seems to have been a big loss for the Arabs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Legion_2962.html" title="Arab Legion">Arab Legion</a> attacked numerous Jewish settlements before Israeli independence (see, for example, <a href="../../../k/f/a/Kfar_Etzion_massacre_9555.html" title="Kfar Etzion massacre">Kfar Etzion massacre</a>), but I wouldn't call them a militia. Although in this and many other instances, they acted together with arab militias, those militias remain poorly documented.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a good reason for this. Whereas Jewish terrorists like those in <a href="../../../i/r/g/Irgun.html" title="Irgun">Irgun</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehi.html" title="Lehi">Lehi</a> often bragged about their exploits, even to the point of exagerating casualties (see <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deir_Yassin_massacre_af14.html" title="Deir Yassin massacre">Deir Yassin massacre</a>), and claimed some credit for the ultimate result of the war, most Arab participants in the war consider it to be a catastrophe (<a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakba.html" title="Nakba">Nakba</a>). They are unlikely to brag about their role in the war. Also, written accounts of thousands of Arab militiamen shooting civilians and raping women would be highly prejudicial to the cause of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_nationalism.html" title="Palestinian nationalism">Palestinian nationalism</a>.</dd>

<dd>I have added two more sources. One of them is a Christian zionist source that talks about Palestinian Christian revisionism and how Palestinian Christians blame Israel for their problems. It also says that Palestinian Christian theology cannot be disconnected from Palestinian nationalism. In reality, the sentence should say "most" but I kept it as "many". However, your reasoning that it is a minority view is very POV.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:27, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yuber, you keep adding links, but none of them show the information you keep inserting into wikipedia. You have shown one site about a man who blames American Christians for "turning their back" and leaving Palestinian Christians to the conflict, you linked to one which blamed the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict for the plight of Palestinian Christians, and now you are linking to one about an article which talks about an anti-Zionist group of Palestinian Arab Christians called the Middle East Council of Churches who are against the existance of Israel. <b>None of this is directly linked to your claim that "many" Palestinian Christians believe Israel is persecuting them and making specifically them leave because of their religion, which is supposed to be a counter claim to what directly comes before it, mainly Muslim persecution of Arab Christians.</b> Unless you can provide direct proof of:</p>
<ul>
<li>widespread belief among Palestinian Christians that Israel is persecuting them because of their religion in effort to encourage them to leave (as they are in the PA and other Muslim countries (Sudan, Nigeria, Egypt ext.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>that they blame specifically Israel and not the conflict in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then your edits will constitute <i>conjecture</i> and a <i>personal</i> pov that a majority and not a minority or whatever large number of people have this view. If it cannot be directly supported through sources, and it is a controversial viewpoint, than I have to use the information given to make an npov document. From the documents that you have provided, and I have read every one of them, I can only conclude that some Palestinian Christians blame the Palestinian Israeli conflict for their problems.</p>
<p>I have asked other posters, including Jayjg, and they have all concluded that your edit is reaching into territory that your sources do not support.</p>
<p>Also, remember that sources you provide to directly relate to the article as a counter to a claim must directly state this counter inside the source, if it doesn't, than it doesn't even belong in the article at all.</p>
<p>This means that if "some Palestinian Christians believe that Palestinian nationalism directly relates to Christian theology" and we are talking about Muslim persecution of Palestinian Christians, this information does not belong there as a counter. My edit stays until you can provide sources on the 2 points I have contention with.</p>

<p>As for your two points:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>widespread belief among Palestinian Christians that Israel is persecuting them because of their religion in effort to encourage them to leave (as they are in the PA and other Muslim countries (Sudan, Nigeria, Egypt ext.)</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The fact of the matter is that all the Palestinian Christians that were in those sources specifically said the creation of <i>Israel</i> was the cause of their diminishing population. That section on Islamic law and non-Muslims in Israeli views is implying that it is Muslim hatred of other religions that caused the Christian population to diminish. I am simply providing sources that show that Palestinian Christians specifically blame the creation of Israel. You are being an obscurantist when you say that it is solely the conflict they claim has diminished their community.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><i>that they blame specifically Israel and not the conflict in general.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous quotes in those sources that show Palestinian Christians blaming Israel in more ways than one. I have included a specific one, but if you truly are asking for it, I will include every single specific quote in that section. You seem to not want a simple one-sentence summary about what many Palestinian Christians themselves think, and instead you want specific references. This will be to the detriment of the article as it will double the size of that section, but if you wish, I will add them.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 03:03, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yuber, like I said, I read all the sources you provide. The specific instance that we are talking about is present Muslim persecution of Arab Christians because of their religion. The quote you have used is from an article that talks about Israeli fear of violent conflict between Arab Orthodox Christians because of the conduct of ex-Patriarch Ireneious. What you are trying to counter is a specific persecution of someone because of their religion despite their ethnicity. In all the cases provided, Palestinians, are singled out because of the current conflict, <b>despite</b> their religion. Arab Christians are singled out by Muslims <b>because</b> of their religion. What the sources you use say basically the same thing. How the sentences are constructed depend on the biases of the author. Like I said, it is up to you to prove to me that "many" Palestinian Christians feel this way. Specifically that Israel is persecuting them because of their religion and not because they are part of an enemy population. Also, try to make any changes so they are not detrimental to the quality of the article. If the changes will be detrimental as you say, I suggest you find a better way in making them.</p>

<dd>I just added a source from the <b>American Jewish Committee</b> that says that Christian groups around the world hold Israel responsible for the diminishment of the Palestinian Christian community. This refutation has to stay in order for the section to be NPOV. You can't claim that I'm using biased sources as it is the AJC that has recorded this, not a Pro-Palestinian source.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:52, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here is the exact quote from the AJC:</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Mainline denominations increasingly relied on churches in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza as a primary source of information and spent time with Palestinian Christian counterparts during frequent visits to the Holy Land. Many viewed Israeli military operations as an attack on their Palestinian Christian brethren and, hence, on peaceful Christian communities. They also held Israel largely responsible for the shrinking Palestinian Christian population in the region.</i><a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 19:56, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>So this talks about Presbyterian divestment from Israel and their warped reasons for why they are doing it. It did not actually talk about the views of Palestinian Christians but about American left wing churches, their beef with Israel, and how they view the conflict. It's still not on topic, but now I see what you did with the quote, and I have no problem with it.</p>

<dd>Well, it's marginally close to the topic, once it has been NPOVd; unfortunately his summary of the source, as usual, didn't actually match what the source said. Nevertheless, since Yuber is so desperate to find anything at all to support his POV, and this is the best he can come up with, I think we should try to accomodate him. What do you think?

<dd>The "best I can come up with" is a direct reference to Christians holding Israel responsible for the shrinking Palestinian Christian population. Not to mention it was from the American Jewish Committee, so none of your usual labeling of my sources as "hate-sites". If you are going to suppress this source as well, then it is clear to me that you are not committed to the NPOV policy.

<dd>Sigh. It only took a couple of minutes for you to add some completely unsourced claims again to that properly sourced, though improperly summarized, claim. Yuber, please do not insert information which is not supported by sources. There is no evidence that the claim that Muslims are responsible for oppressing Israeli is "widely disputed" by <b>anyone</b>; in fact, you have yet to bring a source which even comments on it. As for the "best you can come up with", it was indeed some American Protestant denominations which held Israel largely (note, not completely) responsible, which is why, though it didn't actually comment on the claim that Muslims suppression was (perhaps also) responsible, it was at least almost relevant, and why it was left in (after the obvious need to make your text actually reflect its source). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:14, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do I have to pick specific paragraphs out of the sources? Here is another one:</p>
<p><b>There are two main religious-freedom issues. The first is whether Israel has accorded religious freedom to Christians, particularly Arab Christians. I have access only to data concerning the relative numbers of Christians in the Holy Land, which is one (albeit very limited) measure of the climate of freedom. Leaders of the Christian Arab communities have insisted for years that, as Greek Catholic priest Elias Chacour puts it, “the Holy Land is being emptied of its Christians.” The Holy Land Foundation (begun in Washington, D.C., in 1994 to alert Christians to the “dilemma that Christians are facing in the Holy Land”) declares, “Because of a policy of systematic discrimination that impinges on every facet of daily life, Palestinian Christians along with Palestinian Moslems, can no longer live peacefully and securely in their native land. Christians are departing from the Holy Land at an alarming rate, and it is possible that they could one day entirely cease to exist in the very land where Christ founded His Church.”</b><a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:20, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently I began reading a fascinating book by a British prizewinning author, William Dalrymple. It's an insightful travel diary of a young man's journey among the Christians all throughout the Middle East -- an elegy to the slowly dying civilization of Eastern Christianity and those people who have tried to keep the Christian faith alive. Yet I am finding it most informative and not a depressing book.</p>
<p>Dalrymple writes about the great monasteries of Palestine "before the Zionists expelled half the Palestinians and began to turn the country into an American suburb...."</p>
<p>I guess what also made this very real to me is that I had just set the book down and called a friend in the Bethlehem area.

<p><i>3) There are some who mistakenly argue that Palestinian Christians leave because of the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. Research results on Christian emigration throughout the last 12 years show that people emigrate because of the bad economic and political situation. The rise of fundamentalism certainly poses some serious questions but in itself and by itself is not cause for departure. People, who are not familiar with Islam, as Palestinian Christians are, often see things in black and white. This is not our experience. We have lived with Moslems as neighbors for centuries, our children go to school with their children and make life-long friendships, and we experience together the same difficult political, social and economic conditions. The mutual tolerance of Islam and Christianity shows itself in practical activities of daily life: this is the real dialogue of life. But some would argue that there are Christians who are not comfortable and who have some concrete complaints, certainly not on religious freedom but on practical matters of daily life. This is true not only of Christians but of other Palestinians as well. What happens often is that a conflict over property or any other matter is reduced to religion as a cause. In reality, however, the causes of conflict can be found elsewhere: in legal claims, in some people wanting to usurp the property of other people or for a variety of other reasons. It is expedient to say that my Moslem neighbor is doing this to me because I am a Christian but this would not be the explanation, rather it would be sometimes a cover for it.</i></p>

<dd>How could your finally bringing an on-topic source destroy my argument? My argument was that you hadn't brought relevant sources, which was correct. Remember, the Talk: page is not a place for re-enacting the conflict; we are not here to decide which side is correct, but merely to quote correctly sourced and relevant material. I'm quite pleased you have at long last found some relevant material to add, it helps bring balance to the article. This source actually discusses the argument that Islamic fundamentalism has led to the emgration of Christian Arabs. Please use this source as an example in the future for the kinds of sources which are relevant and on topic. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:56, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, all the sources were relevant. Dr. Bernard Sabella is dismissing your unfounded argument. But even if you are quite pleased, Guy Montag has just removed all the sources and the quotes that were worked to a compromise.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 21:11, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Again, I haven't made any argument here; the article simply quoted a properly sourced argument saying the cause is Islamic fundamentalism. Please stop personalizing this. As for the rest, Guy clearly explained why these sources were not relevant; some were dead, most were off topic. I explained that as well, so your claim about "compromise" was illusory. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:24, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, the sentence "this claim is disputed" along with the 5 sources that blame Israel (and not the PLO) for the diminishment of the Christian population is NPOV.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 21:17, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But the section isn't about that, it's presenting arguments regarding the effects of Islamic fundamentalism and Muslim law; as such, arguments pitting the PLO against Israel cannot possibly be included here, since the PLO is a nominally secular organization. I urge you to remove this sentence, since it is not only off topic for this section, but also indicates yet another complex revert 3RR violation. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:24, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All information other than Dr. Sabella was irrelevent to the subject, couldn't be found, was innacurate as it relates to other wikipedia articles, or in one case actually helped the Times argument.

<p>I replaced the embattled Yom Kippur War section with summary language from the Yom Kippur War page. The notion that Israel's victory in the war is a direct consequence of American assistance is one that I hadn't heard before. If true, something should probably be written about it on the Yom Kippur War page, and citations provided there. Reguardless, I am highly sceptical that US aid was of such magnitude that it belongs in a three sentence summary of the war. (I'm not disputing that the 1973 war was a textbook example of Cold War politics, but a) that's not what the old language said and b) I still don't it belongs in a three sentence summary of the conflict.) --<a href="../../../j/s/o/User%7EJsolinsky_dbca.html" title="User:Jsolinsky">Jsolinsky</a> 03:46, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jewish refugees</span></h2>
<p>Theres a section in the text that refers to "Jewish refugees from Arab nations and Arab-controlled areas of Palestine".</p>
<p>The most prominent definition of <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refugee.html" title="Refugee">refugee</a> in wikipedia is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>a person who is outside his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion... and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of persecution.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree it occurred in mass numbers, but refugees? When people moved to the Americas during the colonisation they weren't refugees because their religious rights were restricted in Europe but not in the New World (or were they?). My point is, wasn't the Jewish exodus voluntary because although they were persecuted, they had no intention of returning. In otherwords I'm suggesting it might have been emigration. I note that <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emigration.html" title="Emigration">Emigration</a> says ethnic cleansing is one push reason for emigration.</p>
<p>Compare this to Palestinian refugees who had the intention of returning. Even after the Arabs lost the 1948 war, they cannot possibly return. I think many would agree that a fair few would want to return even though an Arab victory over Israel is particularly unlikely.</p>
<p>Using the same word for both in this article is slightly misleading as it suggests equal or similar circumstances. Particularly unfair as being a refugee doesn't fit in with the original Zionist "returning home" idea.</p>
<p>In summary my arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arab Jewish exodus was voluntary and had no intention of return so emigration</li>
<li>Jews in a fair few places still could return (if the original person who emigrated/refugeed is still alive)</li>
<li>Palestiniain refugees had intention of returning but cannot</li>
</ul>
<p>Just in case anyone's preparing a flaming reply, I'm asking this out partly of ignorance (not knowing any arguments against). If I was 100% sure I was right and no way of being convinced otherwise I'd have already made the changes. -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 16:41, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The term refugee is consistently used with respect to conditions in the country of origin, not the country of destination. So yes, the Pilgrims have many times been characterized as refugees because they fled a place where they faced persecution and "took refuge" in a place where they did not. Many, if not most refugees have no intention of returning to the land they came from, and willingly choose to leave behind the place where they were persecuted. Not many people would want to return to a place where they felt they had been be persecuted. The Palestinians are the exception to this, in a large part because they have an expectation that they will be able to change the nature of Israel as a primarily Jewish state simultaneous with their return. --<a href="../../../j/s/o/User%7EJsolinsky_dbca.html" title="User:Jsolinsky">Jsolinsky</a> 09:31, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Interesting comment! I do get the impression though that many Sephardim and Mizrahim (Jews native to Arab states) left in fear for their lives. If these Jews don't qualify as refugees, then who does?</p>
<p>A related point is that Jews leaving the Arab states (or, for that matter, leaving Europe) did have somewhere to go, where they found a welcome. Although it is true that many arrivals in Israel suffered sadness and longing for their former homeland, can this really be compared with Arab refugees, who today, almost sixty years after leaving their homeland in fear for their lives are still living in squalid refugee camps? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilopedia_0051.html" title="User:Philopedia">Philopedia</a> 15:55, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was more questioning the status as a refugee but didn't realise it only meant some of the jews (I thought it meant every jew that wanted to go to israel rather than those expelled). My mistake. Although palestinians refugees endure harder times calling all of the jewish refugees emigrants would, imho be unfair -- <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomhab_fa0f.html" title="User:Tomhab">Tomhab</a> 16:16, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jews didn't just "leave" Arab countries, they were forced out by persecution and in some cases expulsion. They suffered greatly when they arrived; the initial conditions were no better than what faced the Arab refugees. The subsequent difference is due to the fact that Israel integrated them into Israeli society, whereas Arab countries (except Jordan) kept them as refugees for political purposes. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:50, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sources and a Proposal</span></h2>
<p>I tried to put some organization in place without messing with the content, but it is clear that the "reasons for the conflict" section is unreadable for anybody seeking to understand what is going on. It makes it entirely unclear which reasons are generally believed and which are not as generally accepted as consensus views. Even worse, many of the "reasons" include arguments, counter-arguments, and debates in a way that often invalidates their own internal consistancy. The pages are so full of allegations and fuzzy words that the information content is very low, and the set of arguments on the page borders on <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, since they are not tied to any outside sources. I would propose that we take a bit of time to try and develop a way to make this page more useful and readable in the future. To that end, I wanted to suggest a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposal 1: Every "reason for the conflict" needs to be backed up with some sort of outside source that actually states that this is a reason for the conflict. Even better, these cites should come from something reputible, "Foreign Affairs," "Foreign Policy," or an author with some credentials. Enough people have written about this conflict that we should not have to construct our own arguments from scratch, and it is clear that many of the editors here are well read. We would cut issues that are not backed up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Proposal 2: We work in teams to rebuild the page. I would propose that we entirely rewrite the Israeli viewpoint and the Arab viewpoint from blank paper. We limit each side to 15 kilobytes and no more than 5 "reasons." If we really want to embrace the spirit of NPOV, we could have people draft the opposite argument from their viewpoint. For example, Jayjg and Guy (or whomever) would write the Arab viewpoint, and Yuber and Irishpunktom write the Israeli viewpoint on some scratch page, then we exchange the content. We would then have a new, and hopefully coherent, section to work from, as well as a Wikixperiment(tm).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Proposal 3: We leave the page as is, but we at least start trying to make the tone of each section consistant, and spend some time attaching facts (like the poll numbers and NY Times quotes I added). Better to edit down for awhile rather than just adding new reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope none of this sounds too naive, but it would be great to actually make this page work, so feel free to add your own suggestions as well. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 06:08, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Azzam quotation was mentioned in letters to the editor and opinion columns of the New York Times, including one by the Israeli ambassador in 1952, so it clearly does have a longer history than just Bard's book, and there were never any corrections about it, so I assume it was real. It has also been sourced to Collins and LePierre as well as to Lieber, so they might help provide leads to primary sources. I don't have copies of Collins and LePierre's O Jerusalem handy, and have not read Lieber's 1972 The Case for Israel.

However, the actual text of the NYT of May 16 places Azzam in Amman on that day and reads in full -- "AMMAN, Trans-Jordan, May 15 (Reuters) -- Abdul Rahman Azzam Pasha, Secretary General of the Arab League, stated here today that United States recognition of the Jewish state of Israel would not deflect Arabs from their determination to save the "Arab land of Palestine." Azzam Pasha discussed the American recognition by telephone with members of the Arab League Political Committee in Damascus. -- Rabbi Unger's letter in The NYT, 1951 also places Azzam in Cairo on 15 May; The letter from the Israeli Press Attaché published in the NYT in 1958 provides no additional information. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> 21:36, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Perhaps we should track down the BBC reference from May 15, 1948.

<dd>Ordinarily I'd agree that a reference to the quotation from someone of Morris' standing would be sufficient, but in this case the quotation itself doesn't actually say what is claimed of it. After all if Azzam does actually claim a massacre of Jews, then why doesn't the quotation say this. Instead all we have is "This will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades." Both massacres mentioned were of Arabs. We need Azzam's actual words in context to work out the meaning. I'm particularly skeptical because, although the interpretation could be correct, I find it difficult to believe that any career diplomat would use such language, let alone someone of Azzam's background and standing. I've also checked the reference to Leibler (1972) and most of these seem to be incorrect as well. The actual volume is Leibler, I. J. (1972). <i>The Case for Israel</i>. Melbourne: Executive Council of Australian Jewry (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0959898409</a>). I can't check whether the quotation appears on page 15 as claimed because the volume doesn't appear to be available in the US or UK and isn't in the British Library or the Library of Congress. There are copies in the National Library of Australia and the Jewish National and University Library. Perhaps someone in one of these countries could check. BBC Research is a commercial service, but I'll see what they can provide at what cost. --<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Pitchford_f7f8.html" title="User:Ian Pitchford">Ian Pitchford</a> 10:46, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Land, water, improvements</span></h2>
<p>The article doesn't say much about geographical facts that may be driving some of the conflict -- the quality of the land, access to water (apparently a huge issue), the military defensibility of Israel with and without the territories, the notion that Jewish settlers carved an oasis out of the desert.</p>
<p>For example, supporters of Israel sometimes make an argument that goes something like this: "Israel is tiny (smaller than 47 U.S. states including New Hampshire), and most of it was just desert before Jewish settlers got there. Arabs already had vast amounts of land, and could have spared a little sliver for the Jews, but chose to be petty. Now, of course, Israel is much more desirable land -- you can see on satellite photos that it is a green oasis in the middle of the desert, with flourishing cities. But that is only because of the hard labor and irrigation of Jewish settlers. Whether or not the U.N. was right to establish Israel, by now Israelis have surely earned the right to stay: in ordinary property disputes, a court would consider not just the land but also improvements made on the land. As for the territories, the Arabs are just being sore losers - they would still have them if they hadn't ganged up and attack Israel - and the main reason Israel has kept them is only to buffer tiny, skinny Israel against future attacks of the same sort, since it would only be 9 miles wide without the West Bank."</p>
<p>This argument clearly doesn't address Jerusalem, or sites of archaeological interest, nor the other reasons that right-wing Jews have settled in the territories. However, I wonder if it should be included in some form. I would also like to know about the part played by water issues - the fact that the Gaza Strip is along the sea and the West Bank is along the river.</p>
<p>I am not sufficiently informed to write about these issues myself, but maybe you are.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arab willingness to make peace</span></h2>
<p>Humus, I wrote much of this section, and I have to say that I prefer my version and believe it to be more factually correct, neutral and relevant to the topic. SC 242 is a framework for peace, not a precise agreement. That the Saudi plan is contradictory to SC 242 is simply not correct. The Saudi plan is a more detailed plan that in no respect is inconsistent with 242. It doesn't even contradict the main Israeli interpretation of SC 242, which is (some) land for peace - for (all the) "territories occupied" is a possible value for (some). Suggesting that it is contradictory and that it only claims to be based on these resolutions seems to be original research to me; I have never seen a reputable source e.g. the government of Israel, say such things and I doubt one exists. Saying that it went beyond it is true. It made more clear that in line with their interpretation the Arabs perhaps <i>asked</i> for more - full withdrawal (while leaving the door open for "minor and mutual" border adjustments) but also <i>offered</i> more than SC 242 required - treaties with full normalization of relations. That Israel officially welcomed it is proved by the reference I provided ( the previous version incorrectly said Israel rejected it), that Israel thereafter ignored it is simply a fact. (At least that is what all sources I have ever seen agree on, there are no later references to it at the MFA site, either. If Israel made a major statement on it later, I think you should provide it) If the phrasing is thought to be in some way pejorative, or not assuming good faith (though this is a policy for Wikipedians, not States - should an article on say, North Korea and the USA assume good faith on either part?) you should change the phrasing but not the basic meaning.</p>
<p>Maybe to something like, "Israel officially welcomed it, but said that Palestinian terrorism was the main obstacle to peace, and has made no important statements since then." I think longer quotes from Peres's statement are out of place in a section entitled "Arab willingness to make peace".--<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 08:12, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>John, we agree on many points, especially on <i>it went beyond</i>. I respectfully disagree on the "ignored" part. I added Peres' response because he stated specifically what is wrong with the plan:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>it is liable to founder if terrorism is not stopped</li>
<li>the details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians</li>
<li>problematic aspects and the harsh and rejectionist language at the Beirut Summit</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Also, this initiative coincided with horrific <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netanya_suicide_attack.html" title="Netanya suicide attack">Netanya suicide attack</a> (IMHO, the association between the two is strong enough to go together), which Peres mentioned but the Saudis failed to. I don't think it is fair to blame Israel for merely "ignoring" the alleged "Arab willingness to make peace". BTW, I am wondering why there is no "Israeli willingness to make peace". <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">Talk</a> 09:48, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, well, I am not sure whether I put in ignored or not (it is certainly better than the false "rejected" though), I just tried to make the minimal fixes to the earlier version throughout Wikipedia, where the same false statements popped up. In place of ignored, just saying that there have been no additional responses as in my suggestion above would be OK with me. The Beirut Summit was a long planned international thing, and the unpublished plan came a few months before, so it is hard to really link it with the Netanya attack. It would have been good if the Saudis denounced it at the time, but that was hardly what could have been on their mind negotiating with the other states. The Saudis hoped for a more from Israel; it is too bad perhaps that this unambiguous plan was not put forward a few years earlier. I think it is better to say that the plan itself goes beyond SC 242 than to imply that full withdrawal goes beyond 242 because this is a contentious point, with arguments on both sides based on the text, and which is treated in this article and the SC 242 one. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 10:53, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Saudis presented one of so many stillborn ME peace plans, the Israelis gave their reasoned response. Why do we need to stress that "there have been no additional responses", esp. from Israel? The Saudis never recognized Israel - not even before 1967 or 1948. They attempted to destroy Israel overtly (wars), covertly (support of terror), economically (boycotts) and politically (UN &amp; Co), they voted against R242 because it calls for secure borders - and now they ask Israel to give up ALL the land won in defensive war (why Russia is not giving up Kaliningrad?) for ethereal "full normalization of relations" that can be withdrawn the next minute. "Land for peace" is a wonderful principle, but it is not a suicide pact and I can certainly understand Israel's reservations when asked for FULL withrawal to indefensible 1949 borders that tempted so many invasions. The lack of reaction to Netanya attack is notable here because it timely highlighted that the Saudis do not act in a good faith. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">Talk</a> 02:56, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the lack of "israeli willingness .." this section seems to be there partly to balance 2.1.1 Arab hostility. The divisions and their names, as often are peculiar because of the nature of Wikipedia, and could be improved but that might be a big or controversial job, which I rarely have done. More generally, you have a point, there is a tremendous amount of material on diplomacy that is nowhere on Wikipedia, that would help anybody understand the conflict better, and is often not too easy to find elsewhere for that matter, it is a long term plan of mine to help remedy this deficiency. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 10:53, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Timeline for Jewish migration from Arab countries</span></h2>
<p>The summary of the 1948 war gave a very misleading impression, in that it implied that 600,000-900,000 Jews fled to Israel from Arab countries during the fighting of the 1948-49 war itself. In fact, there was no Jewish migration from Arab countries anywhere near those numbers until the early 1950s, <i>after</i> the 1949 armistice was concluded and <i>after</i> Israel had already refused reentry to the Palestinian refugees.</p>
<p>The argument that there is a Jewish refugee issue symmetrical to the Palestinian refugee issue definitely belongs in the article, as it has been a mainstay of Zionist disourse for decades. However, the different <i>circumstances</i> of those two exoduses must be presented accurately. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Tvedt_88bd.html" title="User:Brian Tvedt">Brian Tvedt</a> 11:31, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

It happened over approximately two decades as a process with several factors, some of which are not mentioned in this article (such as the role of zionist organisations and the Israeli government, as the WP article <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigration_to_Israel_from_Arab_lands_7f08.html" title="Immigration to Israel from Arab lands">Immigration_to_Israel_from_Arab_lands</a> reflects). --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECybbe_db35.html" title="User:Cybbe">Cybbe</a> 16:49, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If they fled or were expelled, then in ALL cases it would be because of anti-Jewish actions, not in "many"; why else would anybody "flee" or be "expelled" (well, apart from Arabic music)?

<dd>I see understand why you made your changes, though we end up with the oddity "...not their flight or expulsion from Israel as the Palestinians believe." I don't think it's a matter of dispute that most Palestinian refugees <i>believe</i> they were expelled; few if any blame "flight" for their predicament. I don't plan on changing it for now because: (1) there are other parts of WP that are more in need of fixing; (2) I don't want to set off the whole refugee debate inside the history section.</dd>

<dd>As to "Jews fled the Arab countries they were living in". I won't change it but I remain skeptical. Certainly there are people to whom this description applies. But does this apply to whole 600,000-900,000? We are told, repeatedly, by the Zionists that Israel is the "homeland" of the Jewish people, that they have maintained a "connection" to it through two millenia, and that they yearn to make Aliyah ("ascend" to Israel). And yet, when it comes to the Jews of the Middle East and North Africa, they use statistics in a way that requires assuming <i>not one</i> of them came to Israel solely to make Aliyah, or to fulfill the Zionist mandate to realize the "ingathering of the exiles" in Israel. Instead, <i>all</i> of them are assumed to have been pushed kicking and screaming out of the countries of their birth. Again, I'm not going to contest the text for now but it seems something is not right here.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Accuracy: Nasser's "basic objective" statement misquoted</span></h2>
<p>The article quoted Nasser's May 26, 1967 speech to the Trade Unionists as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>If war starts our basic objective will be to destroy Israel.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The article had a link to a translated transcript of Nasser's speech on the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. There is also a translation in Laquer/Rubin's Israeli-Arab Reader, and the texts are very close. What Nasser actually said that day was:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>If Israel embarks on an aggression against Syria or Egypt the battle against Israel will be a general one and not confined to one spot on the Syrian or Egyptian borders. The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The BBC broadcast of June 5, 1967, omits the crucial context "If Israel emarks on an agression..." and is therefore not reliable. I have deleted the reference to it and to the New York Times article. There is simply no reason to reference secondary sources about what Nasser said that day when the full transcipt of the speech is so readily available.</p>
<p>In the 1967 war summary, I have supplied the context, which shows that Nasser was clearly expecting Israel to launch the first blow. In the Arab Hostility section of the article, I have simply corrected the text. I'll leave it up to others to decide if the corrected quote is sufficiently demonstrative of Arab irrationality and hatred to be worth keeping in the collection.</p>
<p>I will point at that this is the only quote in the Arab Hostility section that I have been able to trace an primary source, and I have found it to be misleading as presented. This does not give me much confidence to the other quotes in that section, all of which are referenced only to Zionist advocacy literatare. Those who believe that Arab hostility can be demonstrated by "statements made by Arab leaders during and preceding the wars" would strengthen their case by finding primary sources for the quotes in this section. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Tvedt_88bd.html" title="User:Brian Tvedt">Brian Tvedt</a> 05:11, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>"Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian President at the time, proposed negotiations towards peace with Israel in the early 1970s but Israel refused the offer, claiming that it held unreasonable preconditions."</i> What were the preconditions?

<p><br />
The first refers to the June 19, 1967 cabinet decision to return the Sinai and Golan to Egypt and Syria. However, this decision was quite secret at the time, and the consensus is now that an offer was never in fact made. No Egyptians or Syrians ever heard of the offer at the time and their archives have been searched for it without finding anything. The US was to be the intermediary, and the US was told of the plan by Israel, but not that it was to send it on to the Arabs. It is a real historical tragedy - as far as I can tell, the person most to blame for the not-telling was Abba Eban. The various concessions were minor after the war - in comparison to territorial loss, but major points before it, like freedom of navigation through Suez and Tiran, etc. "relatively minor" might be the best wording in this general article to save space. "Israel maintains" is wrong, as far as I know, Israel has never said the offer was actually made, only "some Israelis."</p>
<p>The second refers to Sadat's February 1971 response to the Jarring initiative, which was important enough that I am slowly writing an article around it. The "unreasonable preconditions" part is not good here, as when one describes diplomatic offers one should keep as close to the actual text of the formal response as possible - governments weigh each word and comma very carefully, and we should respect that. The reason for the rejection was simply that it asked for complete withdrawal to the old international border.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 21:41, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Palestine

General Overview

        Since 1994, Palestine has generally been described as a semi-autonomous territory of Israel, with its official land area consisting of the Gaza Strip and roughly a quarter of the West Bank.  While the eastern half of Jerusalem consists of nearly one million Palestinians, thus forming a quarter of the nearly four million Palestinians in Palestine, Israel officially controls Jerusalem as its own capital.  To truly appreciate the complex nature of this irregular geographic definition, one must consider the history of Palestine - a history that is fundamentally rooted in border disputes, foreign interests, and bloodshed.  
        
Palestine is located in the Sinai Peninsula, a region of semi-arid land between the Red Sea to the South and the Mediterranean Sea to the West.  Palestine is surrounded by Arab nations with whom it shares its turbulent history:  to the North lies Lebanon and Syria, to the East lies Jordan, and to the Southwest lies Egypt.  
        With a land area of 5,860 square kilometers, the West Bank lies in the northeastern section of Israel, upon the western bank of the Jordan River, where it also borders the nation of Jordan.  Narrowly situated between Egypt and Israel, the Gaza Strip lies upon the far eastern border of the Mediterranean Sea and has a land area of 378 square kilometers.  Of this total land area of about 6,238 square kilometers, less than a quarter of it is controlled by the Palestinian Authority (PA), the Israeli-approved governing body of Palestine.  Israel strictly controls the remaining portion of this land area.  For example, since 1967, Israel has created settlements of its own in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, filling them with about a quarter of a million Israeli settlers who, in graven contrast to neighboring Palestinians, enjoy all the benefits of one of the strongest economies, protected by one of the strongest military regimes, in the Middle East.  Further, Israel controls virtually all the modes of transportation in and out of Palestine, holds the key to all borders, strictly limits the PA’s ability to nurture foreign relations of any type, and forbids the PA from creating a military force of its own.  In 2003, in violation of the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare and in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel commenced the building of a great wall of sorts along the borderline between the West Bank and Israel “proper,” and in so doing, has greatly changed and infringed upon the territory traditionally demarcated as the West Bank.  Much like Israel’s recent aggressive control of the Palestinian border has damaged the already ailing Palestinian economy, this physical barrier has further robbed Palestinians of equitable access to land and water, food sources, health care, and employment opportunities.  As a result, Palestinians are ever more beholden to Israel as their source of food, water, shelter, and safety.  
Although the once-rich soil of Palestine had traditionally been used by Palestinian farmers and shepherds for agriculture and livestock-grazing, over fifty years of Israeli-led military attacks against Palestinians, Israel’s destruction of the territory’s landscape, and Israel’s paralyzing blows to the Palestinian economy have more than simply eroded the topsoil and destroyed the practicality of subsistence farming.  Today, most Palestinians who are employed – about half of the workforce is unemployed – hold low-level jobs in the agricultural, construction, manufacturing, and service industries.  While farm work is the major form of employment for Palestinians, most of the farms employing them are located in Israel “proper,” and to a lesser degree, in the surrounding Arab nations.  As a general rule, Palestinians are far too poor to own their own companies or lands.  
Due to the Israeli government’s suffocation of Palestinians’ access to free trade, their free use of land and water, their free movement within and outside of their reserved territories, and their freedom from constant armed Israeli attack, more than half of Palestinians live below the poverty line of US$2 per day, more than half are refugees from the Israeli war machine, more than half are youth under the age of eighteen, and more than half are illiterate.
Since 1987, Palestinians have risen in mass revolt against Israel’s efforts to destroy them.  This Palestinian revolution is called the Intifada, or uprising.  It has come in two waves, now referred to as the First Intifada of 1987 and the Second Intifada of 2000.  In the name of nationhood, both sides have committed thousands of murders, and the fighting continues because neither Israel nor Palestine is willing to compromise on crucial issues.  In 1994, Palestine was granted partial self-governance by Israel as a result of negotiations between the PA President, Yasser Arafat, and the then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin, both of whom received the Noble Peace Prize for their efforts.  The PA, with its eighty-eight member Legislature, President, and Judicial Body, was born as a result of these negotiations.  Its nascent political structure is still too disheveled to appropriately handle the crisis into which it was born.  Although it has been attempting to clarify its Basic Law, to draft a Constitution, to delineate the powers of its Judicial Body, and to barter peace with Israel, the PA is itself embroiled in political turmoil between its various factions, ranging from the moderate to the extreme.  Such a delicate lawmaking process is only further hindered by the constant military violence between Palestinians and Israelis.


History:  Ancient Period to the 20th Century

Precariously situated between the continents of Africa, Europe, and Asia, this ancient crossroads of diverse nations seems to never have known the peace that multiculturalism is truly capable of spawning.  There was one not so brief exception, however, to this grim view of history.  Between the Sixth and Fourth Centuries BC, the Persians ruled this region with respect and support for the varied array of people living there.  The Persian kings rebuilt the Temple of Solomon that the previous Chaldean warlords had destroyed, and they helped foster an intellectually appreciative climate which, among many other academic and cultural pursuits, promoted the writing of the Torah.  This example of peace serves as a pristine historical lesson in the restorative potential of compromise and collaboration – virtues which seem to be dreadfully lacking in the periods of time before and after this particular era of Persian rule.  
        Archeological evidence proves that people have inhabited the Sinai Peninsula as far back as 200,000 BC.  Evidence of agricultural and artistic pursuits notes that a substantially sized community of human beings lived in this area around 12,000 BC.  Jericho, a Palestinian city in the West Bank, is considered by most archeologists to be the oldest continually-inhabited city on Earth, with evidence of farming, herding, and craftmaking dating back to 7,000 BC.  Between 5,000 BC and 2,000 BC, various tribes settled and clashed in this region, starting with the Assyrians and Akkadians, and the Amorites and Canaanites.  The Jewish faith commenced with the birth of the line of Abraham at about 1,800 BC, which over the next few centuries, splintered into the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel, who strayed almost entirely from the precepts of the Jewish faith and who battled for dominion over the region.  This taut struggle between the Hebrews was exacerbated by the influx of Greek Philistines at around 1,200 BC.  Such divisive tribal fighting eventually led, in the Eighth Century BC, to the destruction of all local power by the foreign Chaldean invaders, who took military advantage of the havoc in the region to broaden the reach of their own empire.  The oppressive Chaldean grip on the peoples of the region lasted until the Persians wrested power from them in the Sixth Century BC.  As noted, the next two hundred years of Persian rule liberated the Hebrews, Philistines, and even the Chaldeans, from cultural oppression.  
In 300 BC, Alexander the Macedonian, also known as Alexander the Great, entered the region at the head of vast armies with the singular focus of spreading Hellenism to the world.  Though Greek did become the principle language of this region for centuries to come as a result of Alexander’s invasion, the stability of the region that existed under Persian rule was utterly vanquished – thus, lending much support to the ancient credo that states, “it is much simpler to destroy than it is to create.”  Over the next nearly two millennia, the Sinai Peninsula became enslaved to foreign interests battling for control over the region with all the bloody elements of political, military, and economic warfare, thus signaling to the world that the Sinai Peninsula is a region of pivotal importance – a geographic key to throw open empirical fancies onto the stages of three empires – Asia, Africa, and Europe.  Power hungry empires followed in the footsteps of Alexander.  The Romans came in the First Century BC; the Arabs followed in the Seventh Century AD; the Romans returned - now aided by the French, English and Germans - with the Crusades in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries AD; the Arabs regained control in the Fourteenth Century; and finally, the Ottoman Turks added the region to their list of conquered peoples in the Sixteenth Century, and held such dominion until the Twentieth Century, when European re-ascendancy over the region’s affairs became certain during World War I.  Certainly, history shows us that multicultural appreciation for minorities did not exist in the Sinai Peninsula during those two bloody millennia.
Neither did multiculturalism seem to exist in Europe, for it was this very lack of minority rights in Europe that led to the Jewish Zionist movement of the late Nineteenth Century – a movement that would soon collide with the interests, rights, and very lives of the Arabs of the Sinai Peninsula.  


Twentieth Century History

        After World War I, with the Treaty of Versailles, Palestine was granted its long sought-after independence from the Ottoman Turks in 1919, and thus the nation of Palestine was born.  Its sad fate, however, was sealed two years earlier.  In 1917, Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, which voiced support for the Jewish Zionist movement – a policy that sought to assist Jews, particularly those in Europe, to migrate en masse to the Biblical Holy Land in and around Jerusalem.  Moreover, the Zionist movement activated the 1896 dream of its German Jewish founder, Theodore Hertzl - a dream of “a land without people for a people without a land.” The obvious problem with this fancy bit of propaganda was the fact that the Sinai Peninsula was home to a large Arab population – a people, indeed, who would look harshly upon further European despoiling of their independence.  In the 1920’s, tens of thousands of Jews started to migrate to Palestine.  By the end of this decade, Palestinians began to understand that Zionist immigration into their country would continue despite their laws to the contrary.  Violence erupted between the Palestinian Moslems and the Jews in 1929, when a skirmish over the holy site of the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem boiled over into a major street riot.  This initial confrontation over control of sites held sacred to Jews and Moslems alike marked the beginning of tensions that would carry forth to the present.  
        In the 1930’s and 1940’s, fleeing from Nazism and general European anti-Jewish fervor, European Jews began to illegally migrate to Palestine in ever-larger numbers, tripling the number of Jews that lived in Palestine before the commencement of the Zionist exodus, and quadrupling the amount of land owned by the Jews in Palestine.  The European Zionists’ purchasing power over the Palestinians was not the only factor involved in helping the Zionists to buy huge quantities of Palestinian real estate.  Since their immigration, the Zionists realized that they would have to fight for their right to stay in Palestine.  They began to form large and aggressive street gangs using thug-like activities to intimidate and destroy Palestinians at every opportunity.  Two of the most powerful Zionist terrorist groups were the Stern gang and the Irgun gang.  In order to send a clear message that anti-Zionist policies would receive violent responses, regardless of their state of origin, in 1944 these Zionist gangs killed the British High Commissioner after he expressed support for the Palestinians’ rights to limit Zionist immigration; in 1946, the gangs bombed the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, a hotel that hosted various diplomats whom Zionists perceived as hostile to their cause; and in 1948, as part of the Deir Yassin massacre, these Jewish gangs killed 254 Palestinians.  Meanwhile, Zionists in the USA lobbied US support for their continued migration into Palestine and defended the Jews’ right to a homeland via careful alliances with the media and academic intelligentsia.  
These combined political, economic, and military tactics worked to drive Palestinians out of their own lands.  By 1948, after the Deir Yassin massacre and related threats of further violence against the Palestinians by the Zionists, 750,000 Palestinians fled their own nation, leaving behind all their real and most of their personal property, and sought refuge in the neighboring Arab countries, especially Jordan.  The Zionists claimed victory.  As a response to the Zionist’s terrorizing methods, and even more so, in order to reverse the flow of Palestinian refugees into their lands, the nations of Jordan, Syria, and Egypt declared war on Israel.  By the end of this Arab-Israeli War, the well-funded Zionist forces occupied 78% of Palestine, ceding the West Bank and the eastern half of Jerusalem to Jordan and the Gaza Strip to Egypt.  On May 14, 1948, Israel declared statehood, and the short-lived nation of Palestine was destroyed.  Sealing their unchallengeable dominance over the region, that same year, the Zionists murdered the United Nations mediator Count Sweden who was deployed by the UN to help bring peace and safety to the region.  Further, immediately after declaring statehood, Israel issued laws appropriating all the real and personal properties that the Palestinians left behind in their escape from Zionist violence, thereby vastly multiplying Israel’s wealth and real estate holdings in what was once Palestine.
Between 1948 and 1967, Israel declared Jerusalem its capital, it continued its attacks on Palestinians living in UN refugee camps in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and it repeatedly defied UN resolutions reprimanding Israel for its violence.  Feeling unprotected by the international community, frustrated Palestinians began to mobilize into armed groups, such as Fateh and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), and used similar tactics as the Zionist gangs in prior decades.  Violence between Israel and Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip escalated to the point of war.  
On June 5, 1967, in a preemptive surprise attack against a poised offensive movement of troops by Jordan, Syria, and Egypt, Israel commenced the Six-Day War.  By June 10, Israel had defeated the three Arab nations, and had reclaimed the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as its own.  As a result, 325,000 fearful Palestinians fled these Occupied Territories and sought refuge in Jordan, Egypt and Syria.  As for the lands and properties abandoned by Palestinians fleeing their homes in the Territories, Israel appropriated these and established Israeli settlements in their place.  
The clashes between Israelis and Palestinians only worsened after this War.  In 1969, Zionists set fire to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of the most holy Moslem sites in Jerusalem.  Similar acts of violence were used by both sides of the confrontation; however, Israeli military, political and economic clout dwarfed Palestinian efforts.  Despite numerous documents issued by the UN and the international community, not one nation stepped forward to assist the Palestinians in their military struggle against Israel.  In the 1990’s, when hundreds of thousands of Zionist Jews migrated to Israel after the fall of the Communist bloc, and when 370,000 Palestinian refugees from Kuwait returned to the Occupied Territories and to Jordan after the First Persian Gulf War, the tension between Arabs and Jews naturally increased.
Palestinian resistance, left without effectual international support, eventually devolved into violent revolution, namely via the First Intifada of 1987 and the Second Intifada of 2000, caused by the Israeli Prime Minister’s surprise visit to the rebuilt Al-Aqsa Mosque – a show of great disrespect for Moslem’s rights in Jerusalem and a dashing of any pretense of Palestinian claims to partial-sovereignty in that holy and much-disputed city.  In response to these Palestinian uprisings, Israel has faithfully pursued what in 1988 it aptly named its “Iron Fist Policy,” a fierce course of action that includes a host of human rights violations against Palestinian revolutionaries and their ideological supporters in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jerusalem, and in any other part of Israel.  The official Israeli policy includes measures such as the “breaking of bones” that Israel publicly promised Palestinian detainees, mass arrests and minimum administrative detentions without trial, explosive home demolitions of suspected “enemies of the State,” strategic assassinations, and extreme methods of general warfare.
Such a dehumanizing level of oppression of Palestinian’s basic human rights has attracted much vocal and written international support, in addition to over four billion US dollars of aid earmarked for immediate relief and rebuilding efforts in Palestine.  Unfortunately, due to the disheveled structure of the new PA and the long standing war-torn status of Palestine, little of the international relief funds are effectively useable.  Further, the vocal support lent by the international community has not been backed by any actions aggressive enough to dissuade Israeli occupation and destruction of Palestinian life.  Despite the limited autonomy granted to Palestine after the 1994 peace accords, and despite internationally-bartered peace negotiations leading to the 2003 Roadmap, true independence for Palestine, the end of Israeli occupation, and a resolution to armed conflict in the region – indeed the very aims of the Roadmap – are, in the eyes of Palestinians, far-fetched hopes so long as Israel is effectively permitted by the international community to fearlessly employ hostile tactics against Palestinians.  
As it stands, Israel continues to deprive Palestinians of their rights to healthy food, land, air, water, shelter, safety, free movement, free expression, free worship, and among many others, the simple right to live in a homeland which Palestinians and their ancestors have held precious for thousands of years.  To justify its actions, Israel states that like the United States in its mission against Al-Qaeda and the nations that President George W. Bush has named the “Axis of Evil” – Iraq, Iran, and North Korea – Israel is a “freedom loving nation” fighting terrorist Palestinians in a war meant to bring democracy via a two-State solution.  Palestinians retort that they are not terrorists, but rather that they are freedom fighters, and are striving to overthrow a colonial regime directly headed by Israel and supported by the USA and Great Britain, whose oil interests in the Middle East arguably guide their necessity to find a sure foothold in the region from which to wage political, economic, and military warfare on all who hinder their access to such natural resources.  The truth of this dialectic remains clouded in the eyes of the international community.  
Meanwhile, what remains clear is that Palestine is falling, and Israel is on the rise.  Recently, one journalist embedded in Palestine captured a translucent image of this crisis on a brief video, which received little air time in the media of the USA.  The video shows an Israeli soldier with an M-16 chasing a young Palestinian boy, who seemed to be less than ten years old.  After being chased by the soldier for a couple of minutes through part of a village that had been dessimated by explosives, the boy stopped, bent down, picked up a rock, turned around, raising the rock fiercely over his head and aiming at the soldier.  Through the video, which was taken at some distance, one could see the boy yelling “Allah-u Akbar,” which means “God is great” in Arabic.  The soldier stood his ground and aimed his rifle straight at the boy’s chest, but he lacked the moral surety to shoot.  Instead, he turned around and started running in the direction from which he came, and the boy gave chase.  This image of the boy with a rock in his hand chasing a fully-equipped adult Israeli soldier shocks the conscience.  The reality, however, is that this scene depicts the actual differences in power between the two sides fighting this decades-long war.  The typical Palestinian “soldier” is a slingshot-armed boy - poor, hungry, and tormented.  Not only does this stand in stark contrast to a typical Israeli soldier, but this odd pairing of foes also clearly spotlights a frighteningly explosive situation to which the international community has failed to adequately respond.

The West Bank

The West Bank lies in the northeastern section of Israel, upon the western bank of the Jordan River, where it also borders the nation of Jordan.  With a land area of 5,860 square kilometers and a semi-arid Mediterranean climate, the landscape of the West Bank is primarily used by its residents for animal grazing and agricultural purposes.  
More than 80% of its population of nearly 1.8 million people consists of Palestinian Arab Moslems, with Christian Arabs and Israeli Jewish settlers each forming just under 10% of the population.  More than half of the population of the West Bank is comprised of youth under the age of eighteen.  There are nearly 700,000 registered Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, with a quarter of them living in nineteen United Nations recognized refugee camps and the rest living in West Bank towns and villages.  Due to an unemployment rate of about fifty percent, with sixty percent of the population living below the poverty line of US$2 per day, and burdened by dismal infrastructure, public utilities, educational and communications systems, the West Bank suffers from severe levels of human rights violations, crime, pollution, and social unrest, including ongoing armed clashes between Palestinians and Israelis.  
        The history of the West Bank mirrors that of the Gaza Strip.  Both territories were created in 1949 after the Arab-Israeli War of 1948.  The West Bank was governed by Jordan from 1949 until 1967, when on June 10, 1967, Israel regained control of the West Bank after the Six-Day War, in which, via powerful surprise attacks, it quickly defeated the combined armies of Egypt, Syria and Jordan.  To secure control of this post-war hotbed of Arab resentment against Israeli domination, the Israeli government appropriated Palestinian-owned land, established fortified Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and maintained an active military presence throughout the territory.  
In 1987, the Palestinians mounted a major revolutionary effort against Israeli occupation known as the Intifada.  Finally, after thousands of deaths, in May 1994, the Palestinians and Israelis signed a peace accord whereby the Israeli government agreed to cede limited autonomy of the city of Jericho and the Gaza Strip over to the newly-formed Palestinian Authority (PA) under the leadership of Yasser Arafat.  In 1996, Israel agreed to give the PA partial control of the remaining Palestinian-occupied regions in the West Bank, totaling 27% of the West Bank’s land area.  Further important power concessions by Israel, however, were reneged in subsequent years.  
In fact, Israel continues to maintain absolute control of the remaining seventy plus percent of the West Bank’s land area, including extremely strict governance of all borders, armed forces, foreign affairs, Israeli settlements, all modes of travel outside of the West Bank, and road networks within the territory itself.  The mounting level of Palestinian frustration with the Israeli government’s control of daily life, compounded by failed peace negotiations, ultimately led to the commencement of the Second Intifada on September 28, 2000, which continues to embroil the region in military, social, and political conflict.

The Gaza Strip

Narrowly situated between Egypt and Israel in the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip lies upon the far eastern border of the Mediterranean Sea.  A conflict-filled and impoverished territory created in 1949 by the armistice agreement between Israel and Egypt at the end of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, the Gaza Strip was occupied and governed by Egypt between 1949 and 1967, and then, as a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, by Israel from 1967 to 1994.  Of the 1.3 million residents of Gaza, at least 75% of them are Palestinian refugees who fled from the region’s war zones during the Arab-Israeli War and the Six-Day War.  
During the Israeli occupation, Jewish settlements were created in Gaza by Israel as a mode of increasing Israeli control over the territory, resulting today in about 7,000 Israeli settlers there.  Political, social, and economic differences between the well-supported Israeli settlers and the impoverished Arab refugees in Gaza, in addition to ongoing Palestinian resentment against the expansion of Israel’s control over their lives, led to the Palestinian uprising known as the Intifada in 1987, which lasted six years and claimed thousands of lives.  The Second Intifada, a similarly bloody armed revolt, commenced in Jerusalem on September 28, 2000, quickly spread to the Gaza Strip, and continues to rage today as a result of further disputes over human rights and border disputes between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  
To pacify that first major Palestinian revolt, in May, 1994, Israel redefined all of the Palestinian-occupied regions of the Gaza Strip as a quasi-autonomous zone to be governed by the newly-formed Palestinian Authority (PA) and its vociferous chairman Yasser Arafat, yet with borders, armed forces, foreign affairs, Israeli settlements, and the only international airport still to be controlled by Israel.  Since 1996, the 88-member Legislative Council of the PA has been headed by Arafat, who along with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for his joint efforts in peace negotiations with Israel.  In recent years, the Legislative Council has crafted certain reforms, such as adopting its first code of law known as the Basic Law, granting greater independence to its judicial body, preparing to form a Palestinian Constitution, and holding regular elections.  In March 2003, the Council created a new post of Prime Minister, currently held by Ahmed Qurei, to balance the executive body of government and thus assuage the controversy around President Arafat.  
As a consequence of decades of military confrontations in the region between Arabs and Israelis and a destabilized local government, the Palestinian refugees living in the Gaza Strip are plagued with extreme overcrowding, a 60% poverty rate, a 40% unemployment rate, pervasive illiteracy, a very limited educational system, a poorly-trained workforce, terrible pollution, serious shortages of food and water, widespread crime, a dilapidated infrastructure, civil rights abuses, and ongoing terribly violent upheavals with Israel.  Despite nearly a billion US dollars in promised international aid to Gaza, few projects structured to improve life there have actually materialized.

<p>Heptor, it's unclear why you reverted the changes I made, which linked to the article on the 1949 Armistice agreements; the agreements themselves were quite clear that they did not create legal borders, at the insistence of the Arab parties. As well, Brian, I'm unsure why you think this is the page to promote the <i>ex post facto</i> Arab position, when the sections in questions are mere summaries, and should stick to stating bare facts, not creating arguments. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 05:03, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jay, perhaps you haven't noticed that the existing summaries of the 1956, 1967, and 1982 wars already contain argumentative justifications of Israel's actions. While I would agree the History section should not be filled with "Israel proponents say..." and "Palestinian proponents counter..." type of narratives, I think it is reasonable to have <i>terse</i> statements of the <i>crucial</i> areas of disagreement, especially when it comes to the stated views of the major actors themselves. We are, after all, documenting a "conflict". And the Arab position as stated there is not "ex post facto", there is plenty of documentation (speeches at the UN and so forth) to back up that this was in fact their stated position <i>at the time</i>. I am not "promoting" their view by the way, I am simply <i>presenting</i> it, in the interests of making a better article: a reader interested in the Arab-Israeli conflict will want to know the positions of each side, right? It is not a "bare fact" to say that an "invasion" took place, because that presupposes the very issue under contention at the time, namely whether the proclamation of a Jewish state within Palestine, against the wishes of most of Palestine's inhabitants, was legal. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Tvedt_88bd.html" title="User:Brian Tvedt">Brian Tvedt</a> 02:55, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Much of Brian's changes were good, I thought, e.g. the outcome rather than the peace treaties that really don't belong there, he was better on the "pro-Israeli" fact of Jewish flight, etc. Of course I agree with you vs Heptor and am OK with your last deletion. The Arab justification might be shortened a bit more, mostly put in links. Mainly I just wanted to help point out to everyone that Khouri's old book is very, very good and absolutely belongs in the references, and I am very glad there is someone else reading it. IMHO it is one of the very, very best books on the conflict, a real model of neutrality, his "bias" being pro- League of Nations, old fashioned internationalism, not pro-Arab. He bends over backwards to give both sides of an argument, and there is a <i>lot</i> in there that belongs in Wikipedia, and is very hard to find anywhere else handy, and even seems to be forgotten, or is usually treated too briefly or wrongly, the problem being incomprehensiblity rather than bias really - e.g. the now-dead maritime issues.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 07:25, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>John, I am generally fine with your edits, but I'm not sure about the assertion that "most other states" called the Arab intervention in the Palestine War an "invasion".

<dd>Thought it was in Khouri, but couldn't find it. It would be more likely in General Assembly resolutions and debates, where the US had enormous influence then, rather more than in the SC, 2/3+ voted for partition after all. Maybe the exact word was not used, but equivalents, but I may be wrong. I'll replace it with US, SU and SG Lie called it aggression, which is in Khouri. I shortened because this is such a (naturally) long article, arguments should be very skeletal and mainly just point to internal links.</dd>

<p>The 1967 line has a much greater significance than simply an armistice agreement, significance that makes them without any doubt the de facto borders of the Israeli state before 1967. Another example of such de jure disambiguity are the Southern Kuril Islands. The territory is still disputed, with Japan still referring to it as "The Northern Territories". Because of this dispute, Japan and Russia have never signed a peace treaty, which means that the Second World War formally is still going on. Still, nobody is referring to the Kuril Islands as an "armistice line".</p>
<p>In contrast, not even the PLO is disputing the Israeli pre-1967 borders.

<p>Heptor, to expand, the main objection is to "borders" which may imply that the lines are de jure borders decided on by a peace treaty, which they are not. The 49 armistice lines and the pre-67 lines are very nearly the same. "Simply an armistice" makes no sense, "armistice" here strengthens, not weakens the lines' validity. The reversion removed the work of three editors - me, Jay and Brian; this usually is not a good idea, and is obviously unlikely to stick. I put back your CMIP correction, and also trivially changed the second use of 1949 a lines to "pre-67 a lines" while keeping the link to the armistice agreements article; you are right that "pre-67" is probably more common, and this could foster equating the two, which is a good idea for most purposes.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 23:24, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am not claiming that they were de jure borders at the time, and there are many borders on the World map that are defined by armistice agreements and not peace treaties. Kouril Islands are one of them. Anyway, I believe a good compromise will be "pre-1967 borders, defined by the the 1949 armistice agreements". The term is consistent with the general use in Western media and diplomacy, it reflects the importance of this line to the continuing peace effort and it reveals all available information. And, I simply do not agree with John Z that "... confusion could be beneficial.". Confusion is not beneficial to Wikipedia, clarity is.

<dd>Also, I readded the intention of the Arab invasion to destroy the Jewish state. This intention is important as to understanding of the conflict, and should not be excluded. (I don't consider this a controversial fact, so I didn't provide any sources. I somebody disputes, I will provide quotations of some Arab leaders vowing to thow Israel into the see). In addition, I paraphrased that sentence somewhat to avoid saying that Jordanians entered Palestine. I think somebody mentioned that some part of Palestine was at the time a part of Jordan. Besides, the specific cause of the war was that they entered Israel as allocated by UN, and not the part of the Palestine allocated to Arabs.</dd>

<dd>Heptor, I tried to pay attention to your concerns by the slight change in the second usage, where it was a little more appropriate also, to say 1967 lines. My point with "beneficial confusion" was that for almost all purposes there is no practical difference between the 49 lines and the pre-67 lines referred to in SC 242, but there <b>are</b> slight differences - the most important by far now is the border on the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_of_Galilee_d678.html" title="Sea of Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a> with Syria, so your new and more wordy suggestion is confusing in a way I think is bad - misleading that the lines were exactly the same. Clarity is not more important than accuracy. Having a link to the armistice article is the sensible way, because that is where the similarity and difference between the two should be explained, not in a general article, which should use either pre-67 lines or armistice lines, and not borders, which many feel could mislead. In any case, following Bush's statements last year, the "49 armistice lines" instead of pre67 lines has had a sudden surge of popularity in the media and diplomacy.</dd>

<dd>"Both" is poor English. Arguably, indeed probably, one of your statements is false, Jordan at least not entering to destroy the Jewish state, but rather to grab about half of the proposed Palestinian state and the holy places in Jerusalem, as it did. (Lebanon's casualty-free invasion is often described as "pretending to fight."), Additionally, practically all the fighting took place in the proposed Arab state area, except for one later Egyptian movement. The war is usually said to start when they entered mandatory Palestine, not then. The sourced "illegal aggression" seems enough, rather than adding a disputable fought to destroy the nascent (somewhat emotive, POV word) Jewish state. I am fine with "invading" which seems more an accurate neutral description than a pejorative to me, but Brian is not. Jordan entering Palestine creates no confusion as they were indisputably completely different entities at the time. So I am reverting to my version, except for your "maintained" which is better; it is shorter and obvious that these are the Arab justifications, and for the same reason I am taking out "as a result of the war." To compromise, I am also replacing 1949 armistice lines with pre-1967 armistice lines, as used later, your changes there seem to add nothing there but disputable verbiage. Here it may not be so good, Jayjg might want to change it back.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia generally urges people to be bold, but I think you should realize this topic is also pointed to as one of the possible exceptions; the wording is often the result of much hard work, fine-tuning and negotiations, and has considered reasoning behind it, and you might want to explore more of the talk and archives to see if you are the first with your proposed changes. Particularly you should not use "borders", especially after two people explain why not. It does not matter what <i>you</i> claim or mean, it matters what <i>the article</i> says and might be interpreted to say. I hope you will realize that the chance is practically zero that "borders" will stay, for good enough reasons.

When you enter the Northern Kouril Islands or Chechnya, you have to cross Russian (in first case naval) borders. Russia and Japan are still in de jure state of war over the Kourils. The situation in Chechnya needs no further introduction. In similar fashion, when you go to Tibet, you have to cross the Chinese border, despite that the Chinese occupation of Tibet is widely criticized internationally (is it recognized at all?). When you go to Northern Ireland, you have to go through British border, indifferent of what IRA, or now rIRA, has to say. Please explain why you think borders of Israel are any different.</dd>

<dd>Heptor - "pretending to fight" is pretty accurate and a common description for Lebanon. If the combined death figure on both sides in fighting between Lebanon and Israel was not precisely zero, as it was through much of the conflict, it was pretty close to it. Might have been a little later in the war, I don't recall exactly. There have been many terrorist incidents on both sides more lethal than the 48 Israel-Lebanon war. Too bad everybody didn't behave like Lebanon. :-) Even those who oppose the view that Jordan and Israel basically had a tacit or not deal to split up the Arab state and leave each other mainly alone outside Jerusalem agree that this is the majority view nowadays, so something that implies the opposite does not belong in a general introduction. So "Fought to destroy" has accuracy problems. How about 'proclaiming their aim of a "United State of Palestine" in place of Israel and the UN plan?'- quoting/paraphrasing/summarizing from their cable to the SG that I mention to Brian below. I think "pre67 armistice lines" gives a good balance of accuracy and common usage, as my OR has discovered that 1948 came before 1967. Jayjg and I have explained already why the word "border" is not going to stay in the article. This is something that I am sure is in the archives too, in many places on Wikipedia. It wouldn't bother me because I know the diplomatic/legal history fairly well, but there is a reasonable objection that other usually synonymous words should be used. Take a look at the armistice agreements article and links for more info.</dd>

<dd>Good points all together. The Arab coalition was anything but not solid, without a central command that functioned. Neither Jordan nor Lebanon were especially motivated to go to war, and Jordan may have even had its own agenda. In contrast, Israelis fought what they believed was a war for their own personal survival. As Golda Meyer put it, the Israelis had a secret weapon - no alternative (<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab-Israeli_conflict_ff03.html#Quotations" title="Arab-Israeli conflict">Arab-Israeli_conflict#Quotations</a>).</dd>

<dd>Heptor, to give you an idea of the bias of "...fought to destroy the nascent Jewish state" imagine a pro-Serb partisan describing the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_5483.html#Bosnian_War" title="History of Bosnia and Herzegovina">1992-95 Bosnian War</a> as an effort by Bosniaks and Croats to "destroy the nascent state of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republika_Srpska_295d.html" title="Republika Srpska">Republika Srpska</a>". Separatist enclaves unilaterally declared by an ethnic group do not automatically become states just because the ethnic group in question says they are. To be clear, I am not questioning the legitimacy of the modern-day state of Israel, or its recognition by the international community. What I am questioning is whether there was an <i>a priori</i> legitimacy that sprung into existence in May, 1948. Implying there was is ahistorical POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that nascent is biased, I am not the author of this expression. Newly-created would be better. I don't claim to know much on the Balkan wars, serbs didn't buy the land they were claiming, and they did not have support of the UN. --<a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor">Heptor</a> 11:32, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually the majority of the privately owned land in the area alloted to the Jewish state in the Partition resolution was titled to Palestinian Arabs.

<dd>John, I think it's very significant that <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council_Resolution_50" class="extiw" title="wikisource:UN_Security_Council_Resolution_50">UNSCR 50</a> does not mention "agression" or "invasion". If indeed the US and Soviets both viewed the Arab intervention as such, a rare moment of Cold War agreement, the fact that they could not pass a Security Council resolution with that language is all the more striking. Most importantly, the Security Council did not refer to any state of Israel, but rather the "Jewish and Arab authorities of Palestine". This means the Arab states must have had some support for their position, so that mentioning the US/Soviet/UNSG views, but not other neutrals, is still misleading. The Arabs at this time were not isolated in the same way, say, that Israel was isolated in 1956. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Tvedt_88bd.html" title="User:Brian Tvedt">Brian Tvedt</a> 02:32, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are overestimating Israel's isolation in 1956 - don't forget it had Britain and France with it, and underestimating the strength of the SU, US, etc put together in 1948. The Arabs were not isolated, as Khouri notes, China gave broad support to their side, but I think it is clear that they were on the losing side diplomatically, and they knew it, of the other big powers, Britain was fence sitting, and France was with the US. Not everybody supported Israel as strongly as the US and SU or at all, but the support and influence was enough. Perhaps add the fact about China, though the section is getting a bit unwieldy; this was just my second attempt to arrive at something neutral sticking to utterly indisputable sourced facts. The best source IMHO for the Arab intentions would be the cable sent to the SG on May 14, that Khouri summarizes. Parts are here <a href="http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/d442111e70e417e3802564740045a309?OpenDocument" class="external autonumber" title="http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/d442111e70e417e3802564740045a309?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> an important and relevant history summary, though the cable is in full nowhere on the net, maybe I'll put it up at WS. There is some relevant stuff from earthsound years ago in the discussion for the 1948 war article that he never seems to have put in the article, though zero urged him to. That is the problem, there is not enough on such issues there, where it really belongs, and can be treated at length. If there had it would have filtered here naturally. Maybe we you, I heptor, etc. should continue discussion and editing there, we can then summarize it here. I suggested to Heptor something which could replace the "fought to destroy", and maybe this stuff I put in about US, SU etc which is getting longwinded.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Z_7bb4.html" title="User:John Z">John Z</a> 14:15, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given the discussion of the difference between 1949 and 1967 borders (or armistice lines), I thought it was worth pointing out that there were actually agreed-to border changes between Egypt and Israel in Gaza that amounted to 43 square kilometers net gain for the Gaza Strip during this period.

<p>I find it absurd to speak of "invading Palestine" for the simple reason that most of the residents of Palestine welcomed the "invaders", who were fighting on their behalf. But let me address your comparison to Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.</p>
<p>Lebanon in 1982 was an internationally recognized state with well-defined borders. Israel's invasion was therefore a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Since you're saying the situations are comparable, that means you recognize that Palestine was a recognized, sovereign state with well-defined borders, even after the termination of the British Mandate. If that's the case, one could argue that if anyone was violating the territorial integrity of Palestine, it was the Jewish Agency, who did so by declaring a new state within it. (The endorsement of the Partition Plan by the UN General Assembly was of course not binding.)</p>
<p>The questions I have for you now are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Was Palestine or was it not a recognized, sovereign state with well-defined borders at the moment the British Mandate ended?</li>
<li>Did the Jewish authorities in Palestine intend their new state to be defined only within the areas alloted to the Jewish state in the Partition Plan, or did they intend to create their state in a larger area?</li>

<p>The term <b>Arab-dominated</b> is completely unjustfied. Remember we are talking about what the Arabs PROCLAIMED their aims to be.

</dl>
<p>and</p>

There is no question of their being thrust into the position of a "minority" in the bad sense of a closed community, which dwells apart from the main stream of the State's life and which exists by sufferance of the majority. They will be given the opportunity of belonging to and helping to mould the full community of the Palestinian state, joined to the Arabs by links of interest and goodwill, not the goodwill of the strong to the powerless, but of one citizen to another.</i></dd>

<p>I urge you to read the document in full. It might surprise you how far it is from the "drive the Jews into the sea" rhetoric you may be expecting.

<dd>These are good words, but hardly anything more. First, it is a reply to a report from an Anglo-American committee, and not an official proposal to the Zionist organization. Second, I would like to know what the Arab Office was, and did they had enough power basis to come up with any such proposal. Third, much of the text contradicts what Arab leaders were saying other places, such as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and the Secretary-General of the Arab League, who were talking more in the lines of "war of extermination" and "Murder the Jews!" <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_Arab-Israeli_War_5e85.html#Third_phase:_May_15.2C_1948_-_June_11.2C_1948" title="1948 Arab-Israeli War">1948_Arab-Israeli_War#Third_phase:__May_15.2C_1948_-_June_11.2C_1948</a>.</dd>

<dd>Third, the stated goal in that document was to establish a democratic Arab-dominated state. How realistic is that? Some fifty years later Americans are trying to do establish democracy in Iraq, and the process is going slow, to say the least. Frankly, the term "Arab democracy" is a joke in some circuits. --<a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor">Heptor</a> 12:38, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-American_Committee_ab7b.html" title="Anglo-American Committee">Anglo-American Committee</a> solicited comment from all parties to the Palestine conflict, and the Arab Office was formed to represent the views of the Palestinian Arabs (the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_Higher_Committee_9d40.html" title="Arab Higher Committee">Arab Higher Committee</a> officially boycotted the committee). It is totally reasonable to take it as an official statement of the Palestinian Arab position in 1946, and is almost always included in compilations of documents related to the conflict. Of course it was not addressed to any Zionist organization. Why should it be? It was addressed to a committee formed by Great Britain, who was at the time officially administering Palestine in behalf of the ENTIRE population of that country (yes, the word "country" was used during this period). Official documents and comminiqués, whose words are always chosen very carefully with full knowledge of their ramifications, should be given much more weight than verbal statements made in the heat of the moment, whose authenticity can be difficult to verify in any case. There have been many embarrassing statements made by Israeli leaders as well. For example, at the height of the Suez crisis, David Ben-Gurion once stated, in a speech to the Knesset, that <a href="../../../s/h/a/Sharm_el-Sheik_432f.html" title="Sharm el-Sheik">Sharm el-Sheik</a>, which is 100 miles from the Israel-Egyptian border, actually belonged to Israel, based on a claim that an ancient Jewish kingdom once existed there. It would be absurd to take this as the official position of the Israel government.</dd>

<dd>As for "the stated goal in that document", nowhere does it use the term "dominated". The 1948 cablegram that John references does not use the term either. To insert that term into a statement specifically about the Arabs' "stated" or "proclaimed" goals amounts to putting words in their mouth.</dd>

<dd>It will offend those who <i>want</i> democracy, yes. Hopefully enough to make them do something about it. I have no doubt in my mind that most of the Arabs are good people. Unfortunatly there are religious fanatic SOBs among them who simply do not value human life. They are not many, but they are willing to murder indiscriminantly to achive their political goals. You see it in Iraq.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Israeli Treatment of Minorities</span></h2>
<p>This section seems rather unfair. While the section above speaks of outside sources critiquing and supporting the Muslim treatment of minorities, the section on the Israeli treatment of Minorities is almost entirely from the mouth of Zionist beliefs. Far too many sentences start with "the zionist belief is..." or something to that effect. There is no critique of Israeli treatment of minorities. There needs be some balance in that section. I would even suggest deleting it, since all it adds is politicized information. <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmiralakbar_09e5.html" title="User:Admiralakbar">Admiralakbar</a> 05:01, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can all of the people residing in parts of Israel vote to leave, and make, say, the west bank or Jerusalem, its own nation? Does any minority group living in, or traveling to, Israel have the same rights for obtaining settlement lands and funds? Are they forced to have badges like stars, or separate license plates? Can 100,000 moslems, or 100,000 mormons (for that matter), get the same benefits as 100,000 jews, to move into settlements? Yes, they are treated "fairly" well, if <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">dhimmi</a> are treated fairly well, by the same yardstick.... which seems to mean the same way blacks were treated in the south during the 60s. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonabop_c15d.html" title="User:Ronabop">Ronabop</a> 11:59, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ehm, the Arabs in the West Bank are not a minority in Israel, as they are living in a territory occupied by Israel. In any case, minorities do not neccesarily have the right to create separate states on their land. AFAIK the Israeli Arabs indeed do not have the right to move to the settlements, that is what I meant by "relativly". Jews that are moving to Israel automatically get Israeli citizenship. Other european nations do the same: Somebody who can prove that he has some German anscestry can move to Germany any time, this applies to many Russians with German origin. Non-Jews may not move to Israel at any time, but neither are they a minority in Israel. To sum up, you are talking about people who are not a minority in Israel, and in any case are not mistreated. --<a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHeptor_46d0.html" title="User:Heptor">Heptor</a> 14:12, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're new at this. Most of the self-proclaimed "supporters of Israel" on Wikipedia will not admit that the West Bank is occupied by Israel. The reason is that the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Geneva_Convention_ea40.html" title="Fourth Geneva Convention">Fourth Geneva Convention</a> limits what an occupier can do, and it explicitly prohibits much of what Israel is doing there: the settlements, the deportations, using the West Bank aquifier to supply water to Israel proper, and so on.

<li>I don't like the word myself, let's use one of its synonyms (rule, control, etc).</li>
<li>In 1948, both Egypt and Jordan wanted to spread their infulence onto as much territory as possible, preferably the entire ex-Mandate territory. We can reword the text (for example to include Nasser's quote) but the fact is, no independent Palestinian state was established by either. "A key feature of the Arabs' plans was the complete marginalization of the Palestinians... This aptly reflected the political reality: The military defeats of April-May had rendered them insignificant. The Arab League through the first half of 1948 had consistently rejected Husseini's appeals to establish a government-in-exile... Under strong pressure from Egypt, which feared complete Hashemite control over the Palestinians, the League Political Committee in mid-September authorized the establishment of a Palestinian 'government.'"

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Between 1956 and 1967</span></h2>
<p>While I do believe that the History section should be expanded into more than just an outline of the wars, to have a whole paragraph on the founding of the PLO and when there is nothing else at all about the period between the 1956 and 1967 wars is just silly. This is giving too much weight to the founding of the PLO, which in fact was not very important during that period. An event far more important than its founding of the PLO in 1964 was its takeover by radicals after 1967, yet this is not even mentioned in the article. A discussion of the 1956-1967 period should include things like: the rise of Nasserism; the founding of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Arab_Republic_9aa5.html" title="United Arab Republic">United Arab Republic</a> and its collapse; the Israel-Syria border and water disputes; and the increasing Soviet role in the region. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Tvedt_88bd.html" title="User:Brian Tvedt">Brian Tvedt</a> 01:46, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are welcome to edit or expand the text (and I agree that Nasser and the UAR absolutely belong), but complete removal of a section containing a relevant quote and a ref, looks like an extreme POV attempt to hide facts. <i>"An event far more important than its founding of the PLO in 1964 was its takeover by radicals after 1967"</i> - but this section is called <i>Between 1956 and 1967</i>. Even if we leave the issue of supposed "moderateness" of their 1964 charter aside, the creation of the PLO and the fact that "This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the WB, GS..." (BTW, does anyone know what Himmah is?) is crucial (this POV is mine, and not only mine). This is not the first time you are unjustly removing entire relevant sections, please refrain from this annoying practice in the future. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens"></a>←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">←ну?</a> 03:07, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Brian Tvedt that there should be more in this section than just the PLO founding (and that quote about the PLO charter is as relevant in 2005 as David Ben Gurion's acceptance of the UN Partition Plan of 1947 is; the majority of the current population in Palestine/Israel wasn't around for either of these events). Anyway, to answer Humus' question: The "Syrian Himmah" region (as it is actually called) is a touristic region close to Lake Tiberias (<a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_of_Galilee_d678.html" title="Sea of Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>) close to the Jordan River that was part of Jordanian territory after 1948. It is a pretty nice place with parks and waterfalls (been there many years ago). Between 1950 and 1967 Syria somehow built up some of the area (since it's so close to the Syrian border) with some civilian dwellings as well as aquifers and such. Before this got to the level to really piss off the Jordanians, the war of '67 happened and Israel captured the area, and still controls it today. So there were negotiations between the Jordanian and Syrian governments as recently as last year to try and sort out some land swap because the Syrians had encroached on Jordanian soil and the Jordanians wanted a part of Syrian territory in return. These negotiations appear moot since Israel controls the area (I'm not aware that this has changed with the Jordan-Israel peace agreement). And I think some Palestinian officials have claimed that the area is part of Mandatory Palestine, and should be negotiated over with the Palestinians, but I don't think this is a widespread opinion. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 03:56, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Humus, maybe "radicals" isn't the right word to describe Arafat's Fatah faction who took over the PLO after 1967; "activists" would be better. This is the PLO everyone knows about today, and the one we should be talking about in this article (in the 1970's part of the timeline, of course, when they made their mark). You only want to talk about the Shukairi PLO of 1964-67, which really was content to be a tool of the Arab League, and was far less popular among the Palestinians for that reason. It was also far less important. I doubt you can find news accounts from the period just before the June 1967 war that mention the PLO as being a major factor. (Of course there were fedayeen raids, but they weren't at that time predominately under the PLO banner.)</dd>

<dd>The reason I deleted the "whole section" was that the whole section was about the nothing but the founding of the PLO and the phrases of its charter you find interesting.

<dd>Brian, instead of presenting the history of the conflict in disconnected chunks we should list relevant facts. I tend to think that the creation of the PLO was a crucial event and don't think complete removal was justified. I understand your POV is pre-1967 PLO is unimportant. I respectfully disagree. Googling for the text of the notorious Article 24 produces more than a 1000 links. It seems that many take it very seriously and even if some of us do not share that position, the cause of the concern deserves to be mentioned.
