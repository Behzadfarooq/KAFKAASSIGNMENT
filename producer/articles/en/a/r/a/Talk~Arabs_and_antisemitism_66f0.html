<dd>Damn, the jews and americans are so alike. Jews monopolized the term anti-semite just as the americans monopolized the terms "americans" and "united states" - when one says "the united states" - chances are one would think about USA, not the United States of Mexico
<dl>
<dd>Waah, the Greedy Jews are hogging all the Antisemitism for themselves and won't let anybody else have any. So, anyway, what would you call pogroms in Russia in the 1900s, expressions of antiZionist sentiment?

<p>What everyone forgets is that Jews (in the ethnic sense) and Arabs are both of Semitic ancestry. The Jews are descened from the Hebrews and the Arabs are Arabs, both ethnic groups originate from the same place (the Arabian Peninsula). Arabs can't be anti-semitic, but they can be anti-jewish, it's all in the wording. Anti-semitic has to do with being against semites (or ethnic jews), anti-jewish has to do with being against the jewish religion, and then there's anti-zionist which has to do with being against the (existence of the) State of Israel.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nobody's forgotten anything, as detailed in the article the word was coined specifically by Antisemites who thought it <i>declassè</i> to be bigoted on the basis of religion, but scientifically up to date to be biased on the basis of heredity. I don't know whether they would have been equally biased against those of Arabic nationality, given the relative paucity of Arab-Germans at the time, but there is no indication in their writings that they intended antisemitism to refer to anyone other than Jews. Such is the way languages work.

<dd>I agree, but what does that have to with the well-reseached and indisputable facts here? You seem desperate to hide the beliefs of hundreds of thousands of Muslim Arabs, especially those influenced by the Islamist movement. Quoting the Arab;s own pointof view, in their own words, and giving further references to show how accurate and representative this is is not gossip. In fact, this is precise opposite of gossip.

<dd>Frankly, it's completely unbalanced. Perhaps if you re-named the article "Mutual Hostility Between Arabs and Jews, Yet Another Example of Outdated, Unwinnable, and Extremely Tiresome Tribalism" and actually attempted to understand the situation from both sides, instead of just pointing the finger and playing victim. The Wiki shouldn't tolerate anti-Arabism anymore than anti-Semitism. My father, upon hearing the phrase "Artificial Intelligence", used to say, "I want to know when someone's going to start doing research into Artificial Stupidity..."

<dd>The content of this article may seem to fill your criticisms thereof, however the existence of the phenomenon is still worthy of study, if not necessarily of a Wikipedia article. My main criticism of the article remains not with the content, but rather with its name, since it is very easy to get the immediate impression from the name that "all Arabs hate Jews", which is simply not the case. There is, in fact, no really good way to determine the extent to which this sentiment is prevalent in Arab societies, except in Israel and the (fill in your POV-preferred description) territories, where nazi-style Jew-hatred seems to be a favored outlook by 30-80% (depending on the locale) of the Arab population. (This is the most-polled population in the middle-east.) If you sincerely believe that this is a tribalistic conflict, then perhaps you can sufficiently demonstrate that Jews entertain similar views wrt Arabs/Muslims/Islam/whatever-your-contention-is. As for where to direct your dad in his search for Artificial Stupidity, the article is not the place to point him, although this talk page might be. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 01:21, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it would also be valuable to historicize this discussion (as the article on Christian anti-semitism is). I was taught that Muslim Spain was a great time/place for Jews -- quite different from the situation today. I wonder how much Arab anti-semitism was aroused or even created by the rise of modern nationalism (both Arab nationalism and Zionism)? In any event, I think the aticle would be stronger if it could document changing Arab attitudes, as well as differences between official and popular attitudes towards Jews, and the changing contexts for these activities, SR</p>
<p>As SR had pointed out, the terms "Arab" and "Muslim" are not interchangeably. Many Arabs are Christians (maybe 2%, 5%, more?) , a tiny percent are are of the druze faith (though they rarely refer to themselves as Arabs). In the western world a small number of Arabs are likely Unitarians, deists, humanists and atheists. Similarly, a large number of Muslims are not Arab. Perhaps the current title of the entry should be re-titled "Islamic anti-Semitism"? I will not change the name of the entry today, to see if any other useful name suggestions come up. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></p>

<dd>"of the druze faith (though they rarely refer to themselves as Arabs)" That's simply not true.

<p>This is the first time I've edited a talk page - sorry if I mess it up. I totally agree with the above comments, the article isn't on arabs and anti-semitism, it's on arabs and anti-semitism in the 20th century. There is a long history of (generally) peaceful relations between the two, it's a shame to focus purely on recent history.</p>
<p>I must agree, we need more material on anti-arabism as well... also, we need some data on the part about how prior to the last century or so, Muslims generally treated Jews better thn just about everybody else--the contrast with modern events is staggering. <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetfreek_088b.html" title="User:Sweetfreek">Sweetfreek</a> 14:09, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article <i>is</i> silly. What if I were to create an article "Whites And Anti-Black Racism", or "The Chinese and Anti-Japanese Racism." This article is not relevant information, but a political opinion supported by facts. Yes, there are Arabs that are anti-semitic. But writing an article characterizing ALL or even a MAJORITY of Arabs as anti-semitic is racist. This article is an advertisement for someone's political opinion, therefore should not constitute as an article for an encyclopedia. I'd support renaming the article, revising it, or outright removing it. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.138.24.96.html" title="User:69.138.24.96">69.138.24.96</a> 19:09, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Emotionally driven and slightly off-topic, but you do have a point. Given that racism is not a monolithic concept, it stands perfectly to reason that individual subjects of racism should be discussed individually. <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetfreek_088b.html" title="User:Sweetfreek">Sweetfreek</a> 02:58, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Compelling and important as this subject may be, I have a hard time seeing a place for "reports" like these in Wikipedia's main entries. Encyclopedias aim to be objective and definitive, which this article cannot be. There is still plenty of cataloging (of things, concepts, events) before we begin generating controversial topics AS SEPARATE ENTRIES. This article must be merged under Antisemitism and severely edited.</p>

<p>I have completely no expertise in this area, but this passage struck me as odd:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unlike Christianity, Muslims sought to conquer the world through force of arms, rather than through conversion. As such, when Muslim armies conquered nations, they felt no special need to force Jews (or Christians) to convert to Islam. Members of other religions, however, were forced to convert, or they were killed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There was never a Christian program to conquer the world. There is one in Islam, but if memory serves the original idea in the Koran was more like conversion than anything else; certainly "world conquering" is a lousy description for the idea.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right, I was trying to show a contrast between Christianity and Islam. Christianity never officially sent armies over the planet to convert the world to Christianity. (although individual Kings and Queens effectively did this; but they did so as part of a nationalist agenda, and not a theological one.) In contrast, the Quran commands Muslims to conquer the world for Islam; during Mohammed's life and in the centuries after, that is what they actually did. They succeeded in militarily conquering over a third of the known world at the time. Muslim armies swept over nation after nation. Only massive amount of military force from Christian nations stopped the expansion of Islam. To this day Islamic law requires that Muslims reconquer the lands that they lost (including Spain and Israel.) <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, I think the claim that members of other religions were forced to convert or killed is plain wrong, so I'm removing it. Under Muslim rule in India during the Middle Ages, "dhimmi" status was extended to Hindus; similarly Buddhists elsewhere. -- <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECYD_b425.html" title="User:CYD">CYD</a></p>
<p>Jews had it better under nuslims that under Christians - well, from that article it seems that it have more or less the same rights (authonomy, right to practicise its religion) as in Poland (and i guess in few other christian countries the same). What were differences? I would either remove that sentence, or add "with exception of... and here listed few (right now i am thinking about one B-) ) countries". Or what were that rights compared to Jewish authonomy in Poland-Lithuania? Had Jews some authonomy in Hungary too?</p>
<p>For a detailed analysis of this subject, please see "Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages", by Mark R. Cohen, Princeton Univ. Press, 1994. The intro to the book says "Did Muslims and Jews in the Middle Ages cohabit in a peaceful "interfaith utopia?" Or were Jews under Muslim rule persecuted, much as they were in Christian lands? Rejecting both polemically charged "myths," Mark Cohen offers a systematic comparison of Jewish life in medieval Islam and Christendom--the first in-depth explanation of why medieval Islamic-Jewish relations, though not utopic, were less confrontational and violent than those between Christians and Jews in the West."</p>

<p>Why is this article titled "Arab anti-Semitism" and seems to only include information about "Islamic anti-Semitism"? Not all Arabs are Muslims and to suggest so would not be very NPOV. This doesn't seem to follow the logic of the more aptly named, "Christian anti-Semitism".

<dd>The choice of name for this article is just plain "bad". Even changing it to "Islamic anti-semitism" is a bad idea. What this article deals with is a very specific manifestation of anti-Semimitism, specifically as promoted by a (predominantly) Sunni Arab-world media and religious establishment dominated by Wahhabis or others who use Wahhabiya to promote their agenda (or in the case of certain governments, to help divert attention from their oligarchist or dictatorial régimes). In that light, it should be renamed "Wahhabi anti-Semitism" or included in a "Modern Manifestations" section in the already extant "Islamic anti-Semitism" article. I agree that this article is crap, not because it's a made up phenomenon, but because it's poorly done. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">TShilo12</a> 07:44, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, MANY ARABIC PEOPLE ARE SAMITES! Samites is a common description for the people living or lived around the Palestine/Israel area, Jews, Palestinians, Samarians, Philistees and so on.

<dd>Arabs are <i>not</i> Semites. They are a people whose langauge is Semitic, which is a big difference. Please see the article on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> for a discussion of the etymology of the word. It doesn't mean what you imagine it does. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 12:46, Aug 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(1) There is no such thing as "Arabic People". Arabic is a language, spoken by many peoples, most of whom are Semites or relatives of Semites. "Arab" describes several of those peoples, primarily those who live on the Arabian peninsula. Not all Arabs, however, speak Arabic. Your claim that "Semite" describes peoples who live/d in or around the Palestine/Israel area is patently wrong. Ancient Jews were predominantly Semitic, descending directly from Noach's son Shem. Palestinians is a nationality that was made up in 1964 to describe the Arabic-speaking residents of (and refugees (real or claimed) from) living in the Levant in what is presently the nation-state of Israel including the disputed territories, not-including the Golan. Palestinians take their name from Palestine, the name the Romans gave the province of Iudæa following the quashing of the Jewish revolt against Rome in 72 AD. Why did they name it Palestina? In honor of the Philistines, the ancient enemies of the Jews, who had been long since conquered in succession by the Jews, Egyptians and Assyrians...in other words, they named the province in honor of a people who no longer existed, in order to give that people a posthumous "victory" over the Jews. (Jerusalem was at the same time renamed Ælia Capitolina, but this really is not a history lesson...) The Samarians were Jewish residents of the Shomron, who were exiled 'en masse' by the Assyrians approximately 3600 years ago. I assume, however that what you meant were the <i>Samari<b>t</b>ans</i>, who were a people brought in by the Assyrians to displace the Samarians who had been exiled 1000 km to the east. These people were (and in Hebrew, to this day, are) called Kuthim, because they came from the region of Kuth, somewhere in Mesopotamia. I assume this is the modern city we know as Al Kut in modern-day Iraq. It is possible that these people were also Semites. The last group, "Philistees" (an erstwhile spelling of Philistines) is an almost laughable inclusion, since of the little that is known about them, the one thing upon which every historian agrees is that they were definitely <i>not</i> Semites. In fact, it quite clearly says in the only text from the time that says anything about their origin, that they came from Kaftor: Cyprus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(2) The claim that Israel has engaged in bacteriological warfare against their enemies is incomprehensible nonsense. That quote would make a good inclusion into what the article discusses. What really makes it all-the-more ridiculous is that the same people who make these claims, in other contexts, claim that Jews today are <b>not</b> really Jews, claiming instead that Ashkenazim especially are descendants of Khazars (who were legitimately Jewish, but by conversion...which apparently doesn't mean anything to the anti-Jewish promulgators of this nonsense, since they cite conversion as a reason to say that someone isn't <i>really</i> Jewish...), and therefore not only not Jewish, but also not even Semites. Genetically speaking, Jews (with the exception of Temanim, Bene Israel, and a few other important groups) are overwhelmingly more closely related to Arabic- and Aramaic-speaking populations from Syria, Jordan and Iraq than they are to populations from Arabia or north Africa. In fact, genetically speaking, the vast majority of Jews, including Ashkenazim, are closer to these populations than Egyptian "Arabs" are to Arabian-peninsula Arabs. This is a fact well known to the Israelis (20+% of whom are "Arabs"). I won't continue to discuss (right now at least) how ridiculous this assertion is, but it'd be nice if you'd provide a single shred of evidence to back it up when you spout such drivel. (No, that was not meant to sound diplomatic. Don't watch for an apology.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(3) I couldn't agree more about the stupidity of quoting things without context from 1300 year old texts. This does not stop the same people about whom this article was written from quoting 3300 year old texts out of context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(4) Renaming the article is a great idea, one which I fully support. Renaming it "Jewish racism against Arabs" is not the answer. Such a recommendation is nonsensical, and it certainly would <b>not</b> fit, and not only because Arabs aren't a "race" (indeed, no moreso than Jews are). In any case, while I recognize that you might find the article (or its name) personally offensive, lashing out in this way, especially anonymously, does nothing to serve your cause.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(5) Finally, the term "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">antisemitism</a>", no matter how it's hyphenated or capitalized, was specifically invented by a professed hater of Jews for the express purpose of meaning "hatred of Jews", to replace the earlier term "Judenhaß", because he thought it sounded more scientific rather than emotional or religious. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">TShilo12</a> 08:40, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There was no effort at all to represent the situation in a historical light, nor any attempt at all to do anything less than present a full-fledged Islamic apologetic. The person made very clear, in a number of places, that Islam really was the one true religion, and every change he made reflected this viewpoint. Very little of what he or she wrote was NPOV. It would be a huge waste of time to through every single change one sentence at a time. If someone wants to make a good faith effort in adding to or improving this entry, they need to at least try to be NPOV. My user-history shows that I am perfectly willing to do the same kind of revert with regards to articles on other faiths; in recent months I (among others) have done precisely the same thing when presented with Orthodox Jewish apologetical rewrites of articles, or Jehovah Witness Christian apologetical rewrites of articles. It doesn't matter if the person is a member of my faith or not. Even when changes are made that make my preferred faith out to be "the one truth" I have removed such claims, simply because I am trying (the best I can) to be NPOV. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<dd>I understand that my actions make it look like I am unwilling to accept any changes, but that is not so. We can look through the history of this article, and at our leisure incorporate one change at a time, as long as there some historical scholarship to back it up, or as long as opinions are presented as such. I just would hope that when new changes are made, they don't concern every single paragraph at the same time, and that when changes of major importance are made (as they were) there is something offered in the Talk section to back some of them up. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

<p>As a muslim I've always been told to respect all humans and never go against a Jew or Christian since they are also followers of the same God. I'd have to definetely say this is fabricated material written by a ignorant individual, and should not be featured as one of the pages in this site. Prophet Mohammad always tells us to love and respect those of other faiths who worship the same God. These quotes are ridiculous fabrications written by misguided people. The Quran has never been interpreted as such or translated in such a manner. Quran verses have always been written in a beautiful poetic manner.</p>

<dd>Dear Mr. Anonymous: You may find this page insulting or uncomplimentary to the Prophet, pbuh. That fact however, does not negate the fact that the material presented in this article is an accurate portrayal of the daily pronouncements coming from the MEDIA and (especially Allawite and Wahhabi) RELIGIOUS establishment both in the modern Arab world and in those enclaves of the rest of the world where their influence is felt. I have already registered my distaste with the name of the article as a whole, but the fact remains that the phenomenon exists, and to a much greater extent than many people, especially Muslims living in "the West" are comfortable admitting. I have shown examples of the subject matter of this article to Muslim friends of mine, and their invariable instant reaction is "That's not Islam!" While I'm happy to hear that "that's not Islam", their voices are not heard, or if they are, have no impact on the vehemently anti-Israel, and anti-Jewish rhetoric that is now commonplace on "the Arab Street". This is unfortunate, but denying it doesn't make it go away, nor does an unwillingness to admit to its existence or pervasiveness make it misguided fabrication. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">TShilo12</a> 08:28, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quotation from the Qur'an? Not really, sorry. What this article is missing is a thorough analysis of the development of anti-semitism (how much effect had the creation of Israel?), a critical debate of how much is anti-Israelism and how and if the terms are seperable, a description of the practical institutionalization of anti-semitism (are there any laws in the arab countries which discriminate against Jews, i.e. especially Jews, not just adherents of other religions?). A mere collection of anti-semitic statements of arab jounalists and politicians does not make it an encyclopedia entry. And this is something I can't do, because i don't have the knowledge. I don't want to use ad hominem arguments, but ideally all this should not be written by a Jew, who lacks the necessary distance to discriminate between Anti-Israelism and Anti-Semitism (this is not directed to Jews in general). --<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElian_23dc.html" title="User:Elian">Elian</a></dd>

<p>'<b>Please'</b> specify for the sake of NPOV. It's absolutely trivial to claim that there <i>are</i> anti-Semitic newspapers (a lot of countries do), and specify which newspapers, what governments, etc. I've tried to do begin this in the article, but I implore you to add more.</p>

Their views should correctly be compared to the hate mongering of religious extremist settlers in the West Bank, Gaza and in other places." I have no thanks to write or say.

<p>Some of the examples on the page can be reasonably be classified as anti-semitism, but some cannot. The long section about children on Palestinian TV doesn't contain anything that should be here. It is just the normal propaganda bullshit that occurs in most societies that are at war. So the Palestinians hold as heros people who did violence to their enemies in the past; so what is new? Israel does that too (including people who were terrorists by all reasonable definitions). All countries do that. What we are seeing here is just the standard propaganda device of demonising the enemy so that their legitimate concerns don't need to be listened to. The sentence I just wrote applies both to the Palestinian TV segments reported here and to the person who thought they belong on this page. -- zero</p>
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, that section should be removed. Not only for the reasons you point out, but also because they would appear to be an attact on the state of Israel - not Jews in general. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStewacide_4b83.html" title="User:Stewacide">stewacide</a></dd>

<p>Agreed too. Many Palestinians wiew the Israelis as an illegitimate occupying power and terror attacks as a legitimate way to drive them out, yet that does not imply any notion that they are necessarily against Jews per se. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 08:44, 19 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I strenuously disagree with Stewacide and David Monniaux. Their claims are divorced from reality. The uncontested fact is that in the Arab Middle East, the terms "Israeli", "Zionist" and "Jew" are used interchangeably, indicating a conjoining of anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism. The vast majority of Arabs make no difference between opposing Judaism and opposing the Israeli government. Since the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, Arabs have interchangeably used the term "Zionists" (Sahyûniyyûn), with "Jews", "Children of Israel" (Banû Isrâîl) or "Israelis". (Stillman, 1986) "The mounting scale and sheer extent of this vehemently anti-Semitic literature and commentary in the newspapers, journals, magazines, radio, television, and in the everyday life of the Middle East have swamped that minority of Arabs who did try to separate their attitudes to Jews from their rejection of Zionism."

<p>Even assuming the truth of everything you wrote, your logic is broken. Just because someone does not verbally distinguish "Jew" and "Israeli" that does not mean that an attack they make on Israel is actually an attack on Jews. The four paragraphs in question do not even contain the words "Jew" or "Israeli" in Palestinian quotation. What we have in those paragraphs is an account of Palestinians railing against the people they see as their oppressors. I don't see the slightest anti-Semistism in it and I don't think it belongs in this article. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">zero</a> 08:29, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pardon me for thinking for myself, I tell things as I see them and don't look to other people for my opinions. Apparently for you any antipathy towards people who happen to be Jews is antisemitism, but for me the Jewishness has to be a root cause of the antipathy. The fact is that Palestinians would want to kill Eskimos if the Eskimos treated them as Zionism and Israel have. It has nothing to do with the Jewishness of the Israelis. The position you espouse is simply a convenient way to avoid engaging the real issues. They are evil so their cause has no merits. Furthermore, in your paragraph above, as in many things you have written in Wikipedia, you make no attempt to distinguish between the Palestinians (the subject of the paragraphs in question) and "the Arab Middle East" (the subject of your quotations). That is exactly the same sin you are accusing others of.-- <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">zero</a> 13:41, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Absolutely false. The PLO <b>does</b> kill random Jews worldwide. They have never restricted themselves to Israeli soldiers, or even to random Israeli civilians. (For that matter, they also have machine gunned Jewish babies int their cribs in recent years. This made newspapers in the West; did you miss all those stories&gt; This by you is political and not anti-Semitic? What nonsense. In any case, the PA and PLO often makes no distinction between "the Jews" and the "the Zionists". Unless you are accusing them of lying about their own beliefs in their own newspapers, PA funed mosques, and radio stations, you have nothing to back your position up with. Their own words and actions are clear, and it is intellectually dishonest to twist them around to make them into something quite the opposite. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 02:28, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>When was the last time a mainstream branch PLO killed random Jews worldwide outside Israel? When was the last time there was a serious act of terrorism worldwide which a mainstream group of the PLO claimed to have carried out&#160;? The world and the PLO have changed since the 1970s. The PLO does not gun down babies in the crib. Maybe an extremist group did it, but that does not represent the PLO.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I don't think this is a completely fair and accurate description of anti-Jewish sentiment in the Arab world (which I take is the topic). Even though the article starts by warning against frequent confusion between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, it soon loses itself in that very confusion. I don't deny the existence of anti-Jewish sentiment in the world and in particular in the Arab world, but I think the facts highlighted here, notably in the section about the PA, demonstrate more anti-Zionist lines of thought than anti-Semitism. I spent a summer in Palestine, and it's true that people there call Israelis "Jews", but not in a racist/intolerant sense. They have their share of racist people, like every one else, but they say "the Jews" because that's what they always said, before the creation of Israel. Habits are slow to fade, especially this one because some people still would rather not accept Israel as a reality.</p>
<p>Anyway, I really think the section about the PA is mostly inappropriate and misleading if not altogether irrelevant. I don't think the PA would be acting any differently if the Israelis were Christian or even Buddhist for that matter. It shows an apology of violent armed struggle, and foolish propaganda, but against Israel, not against Jews.</p>
<p>All this goes to underscore the self identification of the Jewish people with Israel as one entity, which most non-Jewish people in the world don't make or at least don't understand.</p>

<p>This article is crap, and I don't even need to look at the history to tell who wrote most of it. Examples of what I mean:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Genuine anti-Semitism is extremely prevalent in the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> world</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Arab world includes three hundred million people, distributed from Morocco to Oman (so sayeth <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_world.html" title="Arab world">our article</a>; is this statement is based on polls conducted throughout the entire region? Or is it just a subjective opinion from someone who can probably neither read nor speak Arabic?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Many Arab newspapers . . . either deny that the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> ever took place, or state that it was massively exaggerated"</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>How many? 10%? 30%? 50%? 99%? Do any systematic, quantitative studies exist?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Educated Arabs and Muslims do not accept such views, and like Americans, they correctly saw these claims to be yet another <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The POV should be obvious—even if you think, as I do, that this belief is a nutty conspiracy theory.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>However, a great many within the Arab world viewed this terrorist act as a conspiracy to make the world hate all Arabs, and therefore people perceived to be enemies of the Arabs must really be to blame.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>How many? There are polls to back up this statement, I assume.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This is despite the fact that an actual Mossad conspiracy to carry out major terrorist attacks against the United States in the hope that Arab terrorists would be blamed would be an insanely risky course of action for Israel.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>POV by omission: we could also mention the fact that a war between the US and certain Arab countries could be of immense benefit to Israel—but this isn't the place to debate conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Then there's the debate over the PA's war propaganda (see above), but I doubt that will be resolved any time soon. . . Anyway, I'll see what I can do for this article, but I am not sanguine about its prospects. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a> 20:13, 23 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. We will not play these word games. In the English language the word "anti-Semitism" was <i>invented</i> to mean the htared of Jews, and of Jews alone. It has always held this meaning, and the only people who dispute this today are those who try to hide the existence of anti-Semitism. Further, there is no such word as "misoJudaism". Please see the Talk archives on this specific subject in the Anti-Semitism article; this issue has been talked to death a dozen times, and a firm consensus already exists on useage. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a></dd>

Semitism is an article, but I don't believe semite is (looked, semetic people is). Semetic doesn't refer to a group of people speaking a language it refers to a group of people from the north coast of Africa to Iran (i believe, that is why i'm on a discussion page) Not trying to complain, it just seems that this needs to be sorted out by people in "the know". Also, it seems that you need to research to find this info, it doesn't pop out at you. Anti-Semitism is a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misnomer.html" title="Misnomer">misnomer</a>, maybe putting that in the article would clear things up. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeHenzi_f13e.html" title="User:JoeHenzi">JoeHenzi</a> 09:20, 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The muddying of language is easily revealed here. Just because an author in the 1800s used the word, Anti-semitic, to refer to Jews only, doesn't mean that the word fails to exist when used amoung two groups in the Semetic lingual group. As one author here, miso-Judaism is more accurate and allows us to see how non-Arabs discriminate against Arabs and Arabic in a broad sweep. Therefore, would we be correct in starting a new term for Arabs, anti-Arabic, even though they are semites?</dd>

<p>The author above who says inter-African hatred would never be called African anti-Africanism. The limited confines of some who have already variated the actual words meaning reveals their confusion about the terms meaning at its root. Further the Stop sign at the top that states "we know" should force the original page on Anti-Semitism to be refined to include all anti-Semitic hatred. If not, we can slide that slippery slope where the word Rabbit will mean hippopotimus because they have four limbs and 2 ears.

<p>I like the part about the "UltraOrthodox Jews that the wider Jewish community considers anti-Semitic"! It appears that everyone, even Orthodox Jews, are guilty of anti-semitism. Are these Jews considered anti-semitic simply because they are anti-Zionist? If so, this must be one of the most glaring examples of misuse of the phrase "anti-semitism" for political purposes and it calls into question whether the allegations of anti-semitism made against Arabs are due to the same blind spot. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 05:25, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

Alberuni,</p>
<p>I have watched your comments for over half a year now, I've been patient, but all I have read is disgusting,propaganda and narrow minded polemic from your side, never anything constructive has come out of your mouth. You are just a Jihadist, and I put Jihadists like you in the same catagory as Neo nazis. Stop trying to defame Judaism, stop making anti semitic, false claims about Judaism's non existant "negative" views on gentiles, stop quoting discredited defamers and anti semites like Israel Shahak, or equate Islamist terrorist apologist fronts like CAIR to human right organizations like the ADL. If you continue your politicized crusade and continue to vandalize these boards instead of offering constructive criticism instead of idealogical diatribes, I will make a petition to ban you from this site.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Montag_3a27.html" title="User:Guy Montag">Guy Montag</a></p>
<p>Wow. The above paragraph actually astounds me. "Israel's non existant negative views on gentiles"? Yo, have you been living under a rock? Are you that much in denial of current events? I can only begin to imagine what your definiton of Jihadist is, but let me warn you of something. Here in the USA we have a certain level of freedom of speech, so as long as its not vicious volleys of curses that you see on this board, then deal with it. In my opinion, you strike me as a potentially dangerous extremist, but hey thats just my opinion.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure on Alberuni's positions, but calling CAIR a "terrorist apologist front" in that light is the pot calling the kettle black. Both the ADL and CAIR (And while we're at it, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee) are fine civil rights organizations, dedicated to fighting racism against their own peoples. It's just a shame they aren't working with each other more often. Don't criticize others' biases without being aware of your own.</p>
<p><br />
Don't worry, I suspect "Guy Montag" is a possible extremist, who advocates the destruction of the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hashemite_Kingdom_of_Jordan_2f2c.html" title="Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan">Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan</a>. He is not to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>While I agree that the article is quite problematic, it seems that much of the problem stems from the violation of the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">policy against original research</a>. It is the detailed -- but inherently uneven -- citing of examples that seems to drive the article toward polemic and away from a practical, neutral description of the political, religious, and racial tensions in the region.</p>
<p>For example, imagine an article on racism in the 21st century in the United States referring to a set of examples like this. It would be informative, but a bit bizarre, since it would not include some of the major trends and debates that this topic should cover, such as a discussion of affirmative action, access to education, racial profiling, diversity in the workplace, etc.</p>
<p>Put another way, if you have to go to source documents to prove the trend ourselves, then we are engaged in original research. If the trend can be discussed as a force observable in many different events, then we are talking about the kind of theme that belongs in an encyclopedia. I don't think that this trend is so obscure or difficult to discern that original research is needed. This is a case where the wrong examples weaken the case.</p>
<p>Moreover, I agree that the article fails to examine and objectively handle the problem of discerning anti-Israeli and anti-Semetic views. It would probably help to note that in virtually all violent conflicts where these issues arise, they become quick intertwined. Look at U.S. World War II propaganda poster images of the Japanese to see some examples. Not that it is excusable, just that it makes it difficult to distinguish these themes with precision.</p>
<p>The article currently contains the following qualification: "Some people claim that the Palestinian Authority's hostility to Israel constitutes anti-Semitism in itself; others regard this claim as absurd, noting that hostility to an enemy nation need not imply hostility to the associated ethnicity . . ." It seems like this should lead off the article. Slvsirhc 16:39, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You make an interesting and valid point. I don't think the article is itself an example of original research, but it certainly appears that way, primarily bcz Wikipedia <i>is</i> the cutting-edge encyclopedia. What might appear in the 2016 Enyclopœdia Brittanica in a 4 paragraph section is appearing here in a 204 section article. I have full confidence that by 2016, not only will this article be 178 billion times better than the EBrittanica article, but will have been pared and expanded appropriately. That's part of what's so great (IMHO) about this whole project. All of that to say, I don't think it's "original research" as defined in the rules, that being done by many other organizations, I just see it as being distilled seriously here into an encyclopedic article for the first time. Like I said: cutting-edge. I don't know about you, but I'd rather be cutting-edge, with caution, than over-cautious and dull-edged. On the subject of the sentence you say you think should lead off the article, I would vote "absolutely not", since that sounds more appropriate for the Opinion page of the National Enquirer than for any serious encyclopedia. The subject of this article, while it may involve an analysis of the PA's media, textbooks, policies, etc., is not Palistinian Authority antisemitism...although specific mention of the fact that the PA legally forbids sale of land to Jews, punishable by death, does fall within the purview of this article. It is noteworthy, in that regard, that that PA law is based on an extant (and enforced) Jordanian law that says the same thing. This is a real phenomenon, and in many ways it's getting worse, rather than better. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">TShilo12</a> 08:44, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your understanding is completely baseless and without comprehension or comprehensibility. VfD's require one-week terms, not two-weeks. There was no consensus, especially not "strong" to "npov"ize the article. The possibility that the article is not entirely unbiassed remains as a flag, and has nothing to do with your personally instigated and promoted push to have the article deleted. Your behavior with regard to this VfD, including your not having contributed to its Talk page prior to your request for deletion, and your disingenuous "compliments" to those who voted in favor of your stated position, are indicative of a sad inability on your part to be an objective contributor to the Wikipedia project. I am sorry to have to say it, but while I hold much greater leniency with respect to the posts of even demonstrably idiotic "contributors" to this project, if it were up to a vote to deny you further editing ability to Wikipedia, and if I had a vote in such a question, I would have to, without hesitation, vote to prevent you from further sabotaging the respectability of wikipedia. Chill out, calm down, and learn. Stop feeding your hatreds with ridiculous information. Those are my words of advice, although because I disagree with you, I am sure my words of advice will fall on your fore-deafened ears. The fact that I'm a Jew will almost certainly remove any remaining chance that you might hear my admonition. I pity you, and unfortunately, I have little doubt but that my pity will be used by you as further excuse to fuel your pathetic diatribes. God have mercy on your pitiful soul, and on the day of final Judgment, may you at least then finally realize how ridiculously miniscule your mind is. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 12:44, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)

I do however care about whether or not you are involved with, endorse or otherwise the practice of sexual abuse to which I am a victim. This is however irrelevant to this article which is an entirely different issue: Charges the arabs with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">anti-semitism</a> without considering the context in which the Arab world has been effected by the mostly Jewish state of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>. And censorship is what this is all about. You were never interested in understanding my view or having a meaningful debate on the circumcision issue and therefore you extend that to mean that I can't have anything meaningful to say about this issue either. Its silly. You remind me of those people that shout anti-semitism whenever a doctor has a meaningful finding against circumcision and yet pump the papers full of the smallest hint that circumcision may have a benefit. No wonder the public has such a skewed view on the subject. Do you realize that the I have only recently discovered that I was too <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-dependency.html" title="Co-dependency">co-dependent</a> to critize circumcision because I was afraid it would label me as anti-semitic. As a result I am sick and unable to work despite a University degree. It is people like you that want to censor people's ability to talk not to the point of reason, but to the point where they actually become ill. That is not acceptible. You have no idea if my mind is miniscule or not, you don't know me. As for your religious views, you have no right to push them on me anymore than you have the right to deny your son his foreskin! <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirkumsize_0f89.html" title="User:Sirkumsize">Sirkumsize</a> 03:48, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When I discussed your "understanding", it had nothing to do with circumcision, it had to do with rules for VfD. I'm sorry to hear you have emotional or social problems. If we were to discuss the "emotional trauma of childhood circumcision", perhaps your experience might be relevant, but we're not, and for the purposes of the Wikipedia project, we shouldn't be anyways, since such a discussion would fall very clearly into the realm of "original research". Your misinformed and misdirected diatribe against me and Israel has nothing to do with the subject at hand. If you suffer the problems you say you do, I hope you can get help for them, but Wikipedia is not the place for healing emotional problems. There are therapy groups for that purpose. I have no desire to push my religious views on you or anyone else, but at the same time I refuse to sit idly by while people who hold thinly veiled baseless hatred for my religious view spew their views publically. You have the right to say your piece, and I have a right to counter it. That said, however, Wikipedia is NOT the place for airing your political or religious views, and certainly not the place to lecture me about your perceived infraction on my part of your right to hold your views, while simultaneously telling me that I have no right to hold mine. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 07:12, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've removed this section to the talk page because it needs to be completely rewritten. It is extremely POV, completely uncited, largely irrelevant and poorly written. For one thing, surely there is no single "Arab view of anti-semitism" but rather many divergent opinions, yet this section is written to indicate that all Arabs think alike. Surely if we're going to say what hundreds of millions of people think than we need to cite it to something! The first paragraph needs to be much more readable, who is the "they" in the entence "they still indeed use thee terms interchangeably..." for example? The second paragraph needs to be eliminated entirely, its tone is unacceptable and the text is largely irrelevant (what does Israel being located in between Africa and Asia have to do with anti-semitism?) The sentence in the third paragraph talking about the remaining Jewish communities in the Arab world should be greatly expanded, but the comparison to Israeli Arabs and Israeli Jews of Arab descent should be eliminated as it is irrelevant to this article and hopelessly POV. Finally, I'm not entirely sure what the fourth paragraph means and I'd recommend it be eliminated. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 20:12, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arabs view anti-Semitism as a historical racial discrimination against the Jews and Semitic-like people by the Europeans. Nowadays they see it as an oxymoron political term that has been extended to include the arabs as anti-semitic. Although the arabs try to point to the difference between terms such as <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israelis.html" title="Israelis">Israelis</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>, <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionists.html" title="Zionists">zionists</a>, and <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semites.html" title="Semites">semites</a>, they still indeed use those terms interchangeably and inaccurately in many instances. The <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabs.html" title="Arabs">Arabs</a> argue that they do not hate Jews. For them the historical relationships between Jews and arab rulers is a good testimony of no hate towards Jews. The Arabs, however fear that the zionism project and its outcome of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>. For them Israel and the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_movement.html" title="Zionist movement">zionist movement</a> erected or tried to erect <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_settlements.html" title="Israeli settlements">settlements</a> not only on what the United Nations gave them in 1947 but also on the occupied territories of Palestine, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinai.html" title="Sinai">Sinai</a> of Egypt, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Lebanon_8dc7.html" title="South Lebanon">South Lebanon</a>, and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golan_Heights_4b58.html" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a> of Syria. The most contentious issues are <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and the Israeli borders. Arabs are reportedly scared that Israel would keep the occupied Jerusalem and extend their borders from <a href="../../../n/i/l/Niles.html" title="Niles">Niles</a> to Euphrate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>They also see that Israel has cut off the land links between the Arab countries of North Africa and those of the western Asia that is the bridge at heart of the Arab world.Moreover the treatment of Arabs both Christians and Muslims in Israel itself is quite discriminatory with their Jews couterparts. Even the Arab Jews are ill-treated in Israel, they contend. They see Israel policies very racist in terms of citizenship. Most Jews around the world can easily claim and get Israeli citizenship, while Israeli-Arab citizenship is withdrawn if they marry a non-Israeli.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the contrary, many Jewish communities still live in Yemen, Iran, Morocco, Tunisia and other Arab countries and it is rare that they are persecuted like the Israeli-Arabs in Israel who are often linked to Hamas and Islamic Jihad by many zionist organizations if not by the racial profiling of the Israeli government itself. <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasser_Arafat_cf67.html" title="Yasser Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> of even have a chief rabbi in his adminstration for the Palestinian territories.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Finally, the term "Arab anti-Semitism" for Arabs is not an accurate description of the Arab feelings towards the Jews. Arabs appear to alien themselves from the accused practices against Jews.</dd>

<p>All the links you put at the end the article are militantly zionist and/or right-wing I don't see a equivalent article on israeli or zionist anti-arab racism.</p>

<dd>Hi, you didn't sign your comments above, but don't you think that sometimes asking for a tit-for-tat "zionist anti arab racisism" article to counter a "anti semetic arab article" is oversimplifying the issue? Quite honestly, there is a lot of anti-semitism in the arab world and a lot of it is based on deliberately made up stuff like the protocols of the elders of zion and blood libels. The stuff is still used to make prime time television shows. YOu can't really say that this is not true, all you can say in defense of this stuff is that the Arab world has a right to say whatever it wants about Jews by freedome of speech. Freedom of speech is fine, sure, but what they are saying is not true. Jews don't use blood of non-jews to make their matzah, and in point of fact are not allowed to eat blood at all. Jews don't have domination over the world by any means, and certainly not by an international plot; actually they suffer quite a bit due to antisemitism. Jews don't descend from monkeys and pigs, and actually Jews and Muslims are closer than Jews and Christian in their origins and beliefs. In the Jewish world, there really isn't the equivalent any absurdly false and deliberately hate inspiring depiction of Arabs. There is anti-arab feeling sure, and distrust, sure, based on the history of how Jews have historically been treated (had to wear special clothes, pay special taxes, had many freedoms restricted) and agressed against in Israel. Nevertheless, Jews aren't going around making up and promulgating theories about Arab world domination or stuff like blood libels and showing it on their national TV! Actually, most Jews I know are NOT right wing, and bend over backwards to give Muslims and Arabs the benefit of the doubt. YOu can't have tit for tat here, because there is no "tat". This stuff is ugly, sure, but it is real and saying it is pOV and should be on Wiki or similar doesn't make it go away. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElizmr_0824.html" title="User:Elizmr">elizmr</a> 16:27, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's incorrect to say that Jews lived in Arab lands since the Babylonian Captivity because those lands <i>weren't</i> Arabic until the Muslim conquest of the 7th century CE (unless you mean the Arabian Peninsula itself). Even earlier Arab migrations like the Ghassanids and the Lakhmids didn't happen until the first centuries CE, and these mainly settled the desert regions of Transjordan and the Mesopotamian frontier. So in fact, Jewish settlement in these lands, particularly in Egypt and Iraq, actually <i>predates</i> Arab settlement there by many centuries.</p>
<p>Also, this article fails to mention the 1840 Damascus Blood Libel, which, IMO at least, was a defining moment of Arab antisemitism, committed under Arab rule before the excuse of Zionism was around, and the 1929 pogrom in Hebron.</p>

<p>Historical Muslim anti semitism: I've been doing a little research in this area for this article, discovered an article in May 20, 2006 issue of The American Thinker (part of which I've just edited into the main article here) - I didn't know that the origin of Jews being forced to wear a distinctive badge was not from the Nazis but from the Persians, the treatment of Jews (and Christians) by the Persians was horrendous - the history of Muslim anti semitism goes back for centuries.Incorrect 16:39, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a hebrew israeli it seems to me that arab hatred of jews is due to political and religious reasons, and not racial distinctions. anti-semitism is a doctrine that discriminates against hebrews due to their "racial" origins. The nazis are anti-semites since their hatred of hebrews is largely independent of political or religious reasons, it is based on their non-aryan status. Arabs are themselves defined linguisticaly as semites. Arab anti judaism is criminal and unjust, but it should not be compared to the horrendous oppression and genocide commited by nazis. The title of the article should be, in my opinion, Arabs and anti-Judaism. 212.201.79.15 11:22, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed this section is a collection of allegedly anti-Semitic remarks made by Palestinian figures, and I'm wondering whether such collections violate Wikipedia original research and POV policies. Obviously, the descision to include these quotes is based on the interpretation of the contributor(s) and thus is POV. As Wikipedians, it is not our place to interpret the statements and derive a conclusion ourselves. The best practice is to cite, within context, notable historians, writers, organizations etc. making the accusation of anti-Semitism. Readers <b>then</b> can decide whether the statements are anti-Semitic or not.</p>
<p>Also the only quote relevant to the subject is the Lewis quote, which could probably be incorporated somewhere else in the article.

<p>Arabs can't be anti-semitic</p>

<dd>I removed it. Although the term anti-Semitic is a misnomer since it technically would include Arabs, in common usage it is used only to refer to Jews.

<p>I'd love to help, but I think I'm too emotionally involved. I'm too pro-Jewish and anti-Islamic to contribute neutrally to this article.</p>
<p>My take on it, since the bot "asked" for my help, is that Arabs resent Jewish success and also resent their own lack of freedom. This jealousy, added to a "long memory of wrongdoing", makes it hard for them to tolerate any Jewish presence other than "hat in hand and very humble, if you please, sir".</p>
<p>This attitude is reflected in their treatment of woman (see <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honor_killing.html" title="Honor killing">honor killing</a>). I've been reading <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phyllis_Chesler_8a8b.html" title="Phyllis Chesler">Phyllis Chesler</a>'s <i>The Death of Feminism</i>, a recent book which describes Islamic abuse of women in comprehensive detail. It's not pleasant reading.</p>
<p>Another reason I won't be much help is that I think I know of a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. This solution is so much on my mind, that I can't concentrate on describing what is: I'm to caught up in "what ought to be".</p>
