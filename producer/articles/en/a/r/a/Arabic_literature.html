<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_literature.html" title="Edit section: Pre-Islamic literature">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-Islamic literature</span></h2>
<p>The period before the writing of the Qur'an and the rise of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> is known to <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> as <i><a href="../../../j/a/h/Jahiliyyah.html" title="Jahiliyyah">Jahiliyyah</a></i> or period of ignorance. Whilst this ignorance refers mainly to religious ignorance, there is little written literature before this time, although significant <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_tradition.html" title="Oral tradition">oral tradition</a> is postulated. Tales like those about <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinbad.html" title="Sinbad">Sinbad</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antar_bin_Shaddad_f895.html" title="Antar bin Shaddad">Antar bin Shaddad</a> were probably current, but were recorded later. The final decades of the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">6th century</a>, however, begin to show the flowering of a lively written tradition. This tradition was captured over two centuries later with two important compilations of the <i><a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27allaqat.html" title="Mu'allaqat">Mu'allaqat</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../m/u/f/Mufaddaliyat.html" title="Mufaddaliyat">Mufaddaliyat</a></i>. These collections probably give us a biased picture of the writings of the time as only the best poems are preserved; some of the poems may represent only the best part of a long poem.</p>

The Qur'an was the first major work of Arabic literature and the most influential.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> had a significant influence on the Arab language. The language used in the Qur'an is called <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_Arabic_ca20.html" title="Classical Arabic">classical Arabic</a> and while modern Arabic has diverged slightly, the classical is still the style to be admired. Not only is the Qur'an the first work of any significant length written in the language it also has a far more complicated structure than the earlier literary works with its 114 <a href="../../../s/u/r/Sura.html" title="Sura">suras</a> (chapters) which contain 6,236 <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayat.html" title="Ayat">ayat</a> (verses). It contains <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injunction.html" title="Injunction">injunctions</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrative.html" title="Narrative">narratives</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homily.html" title="Homily">homilies</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parable.html" title="Parable">parables</a>, direct addresses from God, <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instruction.html" title="Instruction">instructions</a> and even comments on itself on how it will be received and understood. It is also, paradoxically, admired for its layers of metaphor as well as its clarity, a feature it mentions itself in sura 16:103.</p>
<p>Although it contains elements of both prose and poetry, and therefore is closest to <i><a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhymed_prose.html" title="Rhymed prose">Saj</a></i> or <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhymed_prose.html" title="Rhymed prose">rhymed prose</a>, the Qur'an is regarded as entirely apart from these classifications. The text is believed to be <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_revelation.html" title="Divine revelation">divine revelation</a> and is seen by some <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslims.html" title="Muslims">Muslims</a> as being eternal or 'uncreated'. This leads to the doctrine of <i>i'jaz</i> or inimitability of the Qur'an which implies that nobody can copy the work's style nor should anybody try.</p>
<p>This doctrine of <i>i'jaz</i> possibly had a slight limiting effect on Arabic literature; proscribing exactly what could be written. The Qur'an itself criticises poets in the 26th sura, actually called Ash-Shu'ara or The Poets:</p>
<dl>
<dd>And as to the poets, those who go astray follow them.
<dl>
<dd>16:224</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This may have exerted dominance over the pre-Islamic poets of the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">6th century</a> whose popularity may have vied with the Qur'an amongst the people. There were a marked lack of significant poets until the <a href="../../../8/t/h/8th_century.html" title="8th century">8th century</a>. One notable exception was <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hassan_ibn_Thabit_1056.html" title="Hassan ibn Thabit">Hassan ibn Thabit</a> who wrote poems in praise of <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammed.html" title="Muhammed">Muhammed</a> and was known as the "prophet's poet". Just as the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> has held an important place in the literature of other languages, The Qur'an is important to Arabic. It is the source of many ideas, allusions and quotes and its moral message informs many works.</p>
<p>Aside from the Qur'an the <i><a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a></i> or tradition of what Muhammed is supposed to have said and done are important literature. The entire body of these acts and words are called <i><a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnah.html" title="Sunnah">sunnah</a></i> or way and the ones regarded as <i>sahih</i> or genuine of them are collected into hadith. Some of the most significant collections of hadith include those by <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim_ibn_al-Hajjaj_a86e.html" title="Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj">Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Isma%27il_al-Bukhari_160a.html" title="Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari">Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari</a>.</p>
<p>The other important genre of work in Qur'anic study is the <i><a href="../../../t/a/f/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">tafsir</a></i> or <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_reading.html" title="Close reading">commentaries</a> on the Qur'an. Arab writings relating to religion also includes many <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon.html" title="Sermon">sermons</a> and devotional pieces as well as the sayings of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> which were collected in the <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_century.html" title="10th century">10th century</a> as <i><a href="../../../n/a/h/Nahj_al-Balaghah_d50f.html" title="Nahj al-Balaghah">Nahj al-Balaghah</a></i> or <i>The Road to Eloquence</i>.</p>

<p><br />
The research into the life and times of Muhammad, and determining the genuine parts of the sunnah, was an important early reason for scholarship in or about the Arabic language. It was also the reason for the collecting of pre-Islamic poetry; as some of these poets were close to the prophet—<a href="../../../l/a/b/Labid.html" title="Labid">Labid</a> actually meeting Muhammed and converting to Islam—and their writings illuminated the times when these event occurred. Muhammad also inspired the first Arabic <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography.html" title="Biography">biographies</a>, known as <i>al-sirah al-nabawiyyah</i>, the earliest was by <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahb_ibn_Munabbih_f0ca.html" title="Wahb ibn Munabbih">Wahb ibn Munabbih</a> but <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Ishaq_d96e.html" title="Muhammad ibn Ishaq">Muhammad ibn Ishaq</a> wrote the best known. Whilst covering the life of the prophet they also told of the battles and events of early Islam and have numerous digressions on older biblical traditions.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest work studying the Arabic language was started in the name of Islam. Tradition has it that the caliph <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a>, after reading a Qur'an with errors in it, asked Abu al-aswad al-Du'ali to write a work codifying <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_grammar.html" title="Arabic grammar">Arabic grammar</a>. <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalil_ibn_Ahmad_46f4.html" title="Khalil ibn Ahmad">Khalil ibn Ahmad</a> would later write <i>Kitab al-Ayn</i>, the first dictionary of Arabic, along with works on <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prosody.html" title="Prosody">prosody</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a>, and his pupil <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibawayh.html" title="Sibawayh">Sibawayh</a> would produce the most respected work of Arabic grammar known simply as <i>al-Kitab</i> or <i>The Book</i>.</p>
<p>Other caliphs exerted their influence on Arabic with <a href="../../../27/a/b/%27Abd_al-Malik_f765.html" title="'Abd al-Malik">'Abd al-Malik</a> making it the official language for administration of the new empire, and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Ma%27mun_b6ed.html" title="Al-Ma'mun">al-Ma'mun</a> setting up the <i>Bayt al-Hikma</i> or <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Wisdom_b9d2.html" title="House of Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a> in <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> for research and translations. <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basrah.html" title="Basrah">Basrah</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/f/Kufah.html" title="Kufah">Kufah</a> were two other important seats of learning in the early Arab world, between which there was a strong rivalry.</p>
<p>The institutions set up mainly to investigate more fully the Islamic religion were invaluable in studying many other subjects. Caliph <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hisham_ibn_Abd_al-Malik_08fd.html" title="Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik">Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik</a> was instrumental in enriching the literature by instructing scholars to translate works into Arabic. The first was probably <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s correspondence with <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> translated by Salm Abu al-'Ala'. From the east, and in a very different literary genre, <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Ibn_al-Muqaffa_7b11.html" title="Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa">Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa</a> translated the animal <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fable.html" title="Fable">fables</a> of the <i><a href="../../../p/a/n/Panchatantra.html" title="Panchatantra">Panchatantra</a></i>. These translations would keep alive scholarship and learning, particularly that of <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>, during the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_ages.html" title="Dark ages">dark ages</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the works would often be first re-introduced to Europe from the Arabic versions.</p>

<p>A large proportion of Arabic literature before the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> is in the form of poetry, and even that which is not is ether filled with snippets of poetry or is in the form of <i><a href="../../../s/a/j/Saj_%28literature%29.html" title="Saj (literature)">saj</a></i> or rhymed prose. The themes of the poetry range from high-flown hymns of praise to bitter personal attacks and from religious and mystical ideas to poems on sex and wine. An important feature of the poetry which would be applied to all of the literature was the idea that it must be pleasing to the ear. The poetry and much of the prose was written with the design that it would be spoken aloud and great care was taken to make all writing as mellifluous as possible. Indeed <i>saj</i> originally meant the cooing of a dove.</p>

<p>In the late <a href="../../../9/t/h/9th_century.html" title="9th century">9th century</a> <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_al-Nadim_68fe.html" title="Ibn al-Nadim">Ibn al-Nadim</a>, a <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdadi</a> bookseller, compiled a crucial work in the study of Arabic literature. <i>Kitab al-Fihrist</i> is a catalogue of all books available for sale in Baghdad and it gives a fascinating overview of the state of the literature at that time.</p>
<p>One of the most common forms of literature during the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbasid.html" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> period was the compilation. These were collections of facts, ideas, instructive stories and poems on a single topic and covers subjects as diverse as house and garden, women, gate-crashers, blind people, envy, animals and misers. These last three compilations were written by <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Jahiz_12e9.html" title="Al-Jahiz">al-Jahiz</a> the acknowledged master of the form. These collections were important for any <i><a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadim.html" title="Nadim">nadim</a></i>, a companion to a ruler or noble whose role was often involved regaling the ruler with stories and information to entertain or advise.</p>
<p>A type of work closely allied to the collection was the manual in which writers like <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Qutaybah_843b.html" title="Ibn Qutaybah">ibn Qutaybah</a> offered instruction in subjects like etiquette, how to rule, how to be a bureaucrat and even how to write. <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Qutaybah_843b.html" title="Ibn Qutaybah">Ibn Qutaybah</a> also wrote one of the earliest histories of the Arabs, drawing together biblical stories, Arabic <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_tale.html" title="Folk tale">folk tales</a> and more historical events.</p>
<p>The subject of sex was frequently investigated in Arabic literature. The <i><a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghazal.html" title="Ghazal">ghazal</a></i> or love poem had a long history being at times tender and chaste and at other times rather explicit. In the <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufi.html" title="Sufi">Sufi</a> tradition the love poem would take on a wider, mystical and religious importance. Sex manuals were also written such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Perfumed_Garden_e2cd.html" title="The Perfumed Garden">The Perfumed Garden</a></i>, <i>Tawq al-hamamah</i> or <i>The Dove's Neckring</i> by <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hazm_e134.html" title="Ibn Hazm">ibn Hazm</a> and <i>Nuzhat al-albab fi-ma la yujad fi kitab</i> or <i>Delight of Hearts Concerning What will Never Be Found in a Book</i> by <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_al-Tifashi_7dc2.html" title="Ahmad al-Tifashi">Ahmad al-Tifashi</a>. Countering such works are one like <i>Rawdat al-muhibbin wa-nuzhat al-mushtaqin</i> or <i>Meadow of Lovers and Diversion of the Infatuated</i> by <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Qayyim_al-Jawziyyah_b077.html" title="Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah">ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah</a> who advises on how to separate love and lust and avoid sin.</p>

<p>Aside from the early <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography.html" title="Biography">biographies</a> of Muhammad, the first major biographer to weigh character rather than just producing a hymn of praise was <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Baladhuri_d1ae.html" title="Al-Baladhuri">al-Baladhuri</a> with his <i>Kitab ansab al-ashraf</i> or <i>Book of the Genealogies of the Noble</i>, a collection of biographies. Another important biographical dictionary was begun by <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Khallikan_1b74.html" title="Ibn Khallikan">ibn Khallikan</a> and expanded by al-Safadi and one of the first significant <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography.html" title="Autobiography">autobiographies</a> was <i><a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitab_al-I%27tibar_fbbf.html" title="Kitab al-I'tibar">Kitab al-I'tibar</a></i> which told of <a href="../../../u/s/a/Usamah_ibn_Munqidh_dccc.html" title="Usamah ibn Munqidh">Usamah ibn Munqidh</a> and his experiences in fighting in the <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crusade.html" title="Crusade">Crusades</a>.</p>
<p>Ibn Khurradadhbih, apparently an official in the <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postal_service.html" title="Postal service">postal service</a> wrote one of the first <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travel_book.html" title="Travel book">travel books</a> and the form remained a popular one in Arabic literature with books by <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hawqal_f510.html" title="Ibn Hawqal">ibn Hawqal</a>, <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Fadlan_b4e8.html" title="Ibn Fadlan">ibn Fadlan</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Istakhri_ae00.html" title="Al-Istakhri">al-Istakhri</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Muqaddasi_dc0e.html" title="Al-Muqaddasi">al-Muqaddasi</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Idrisi_6117.html" title="Al-Idrisi">al-Idrisi</a> and most famously the travels of <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Battutah_c1bc.html" title="Ibn Battutah">ibn Battutah</a>. These give a fascinating view of the many cultures of the wider <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic.html" title="Islamic">Islamic</a> world and also offer <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> perspectives on the non-Muslim peoples on the edges of the empire. They also indicated just how great a trading power the Muslim peoples had become. These were often sprawling accounts that included details of both <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">geography</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>.</p>

<p>There is comparatively little fictional prose in Arabic literature, although many non-fiction works contained short stories a large proportion of which were probably made up or embellished. The lack of wholly fictional works is in part due to a distinction between <i>al-fusha</i> or quality language and <i>al-ammiyyah</i> or the language of the common people. Few writers would bother to write works in this <i>al-ammiyyah</i> or common language and it was felt that literature had to be improving, educational and with purpose rather the just entertainment. This did not stop the common role of the <i>hakawati</i> or story-teller who would retell the entertaining parts of more educational works or one of the many Arabic <a href="../../../f/a/b/Fable.html" title="Fable">fables</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk-tale.html" title="Folk-tale">folk-tales</a> which were not usually written down.</p>
<p>The one significant exception to the lack of fiction is the <i><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thousand_and_One_Nights_6846.html" title="Thousand and One Nights">Thousand and One Nights</a></i>, easily the best known of all Arabic literature and which still effects many of the ideas non-Arabs have about <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_culture.html" title="Arabic culture">Arabic culture</a>. Although regarded as primarily Arabic it was in fact developed from a Persian work and the stories in turn may have their roots in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. A good example of the lack of popular Arabic prose fiction is that the stories of <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladdin.html" title="Aladdin">Aladdin</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Baba_c09a.html" title="Ali Baba">Ali Baba</a>, usually regarded as part of the <i>Tales from One Thousand and One Nights</i>, were not actually part of the <i>Tales</i>. They were first included in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> translation of the <i>Tales</i> by <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_Galland_9b33.html" title="Antoine Galland">Antoine Galland</a> who heard them being told by a traditional storyteller and only existed in incomplete Arabic manuscripts before that. The other great character from Arabic literature <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinbad.html" title="Sinbad">Sinbad</a> is from the <i>Tales</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Thousand and One Nights</i> is usually placed in the genre of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_epic_literature.html" title="Arabic epic literature">Arabic epic literature</a> along with several other works. They are usually, like the <i>Tales</i>, collections of short stories or episodes strung together into a long tale. The extant versions were mostly written down relatively late on, after the <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century.html" title="14th century">14th century</a>, although many were undoubtedly collected earlier and many of the original stories are probably pre-Islamic. Types of stories in these collections include animal fables, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proverb.html" title="Proverb">proverbs</a>, stories of <i><a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">jihad</a></i> or propagation of the faith, humorous tales, moral tales, tales about the wily con-man Ali Zaybaq and tales about the prankster Juha.</p>

Over a series of short narratives, which are fictionalised versions of real life situations, different ideas are contemplated. A good example of this is a maqama on musk, which purports to compare the feature of different perfumes but is in fact a work of political satire comparing several competing rulers. Maqama also makes use of the doctrine of <i><a href="../../../b/a/d/Badi.html" title="Badi">badi</a></i> or deliberately adding complexity to display the writer's dexterity with language. <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Hamadhani_0376.html" title="Al-Hamadhani">Al-Hamadhani</a> is regarded as the originator of the maqama and his work was taken up by Abu Muhammad al-Qasim al-Hariri with one of al_Hariri's maqama a study of al-Hamadhani own work.

<p>The expansion of the Arab people in the <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_century.html" title="7th century">7th</a> and <a href="../../../8/t/h/8th_century.html" title="8th century">8th century</a> brought them into contact with a variety of different peoples who would affect their culture. Most significant for literature was the ancient civilization of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a>. Persia still liked to think of itself as the epitome of culture despite its decline in importance over many centuries. <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shu%27ubiyya.html" title="Shu'ubiyya">Shu'ubiyya</a> is the name of the conflict between the Arabs and and Non-Arabs. Although producing heated debate amongst scholars and varying styles of literature, this was not a damaging conflict and had more to do with forging a single Islamic cultural identity. <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bashshar_ibn_Burd_6d8d.html" title="Bashshar ibn Burd">Bashshar ibn Burd</a>, of Persian heritage, summed up his own stance in a few lines of poetry:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Never did he sing camel songs behind a scabby beast,</dd>
<dd>nor pierce the bitter colocynth out of sheer hunger</dd>
<dd>nor dig a lizard out of the ground and eat it...</dd>
</dl>
<p>The cultural heritage of the desert dwelling Arabs continued to show its influence even though many scholars and writers were living in the large Arab cities. When <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalil_ibn_Ahmad_46f4.html" title="Khalil ibn Ahmad">Khalil ibn Ahmad</a> enumerated the parts of poetry he called the line of verse a <i>bayt</i> or tent and <i>sabah</i> or tent-rope for a foot. Even during the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> this nostalgia for the simple desert life would appear or at least be consciously revived.</p>
<p>A slow resurgence of the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian language</a> and a re-location of the government and main seat of learning to <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, reduced the production of Arabic literature. Many Arabic themes and styles were taken up in Persian with <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Khayyam_4698.html" title="Omar Khayyam">Omar Khayyam</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attar.html" title="Attar">Attar</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumi.html" title="Rumi">Rumi</a> all clearly influenced by the earlier work. The Arabic language still initially retained its importance in politics and administration, although the rise of the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> confined it solely to religion. Alongside <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a>, the many variants of the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_languages.html" title="Turkic languages">Turkic languages</a> would dominate the literature of the Arab region until the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a>.

<p>A revival took place in Arabic literature during the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> along with much of Arabic culture and it is referred to in Arabic as <i><a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Nahda_a766.html" title="Al-Nahda">al-Nahda</a></i> (النهضة), or Renaissance. This resurgence of writing in Arabic was confined mainly to <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> until the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> when it spread to other countries in the region. This Renaissance was not only felt within the Arab world but also beyond with a great interest in the translating of Arabic works into European languages. Although the use of the Arabic language was revived, many of the <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trope.html" title="Trope">tropes</a> of the previous literature which served to make it so ornate and complicated were dropped. Also the western forms of the short story and the <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novel.html" title="Novel">novel</a> were preferred over the traditional Arabic forms.</p>
<p>Just as in the <a href="../../../8/t/h/8th_century.html" title="8th century">8th century</a> when a movement to translate <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greek_c878.html" title="Ancient Greek">ancient Greek</a> and other literature helped vitalise Arabic literature, another translation movement would offer new ideas and material for Arabic. An early popular success was <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo_7c87.html" title="The Count of Monte Cristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></i> which spurred a host of <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_novel.html" title="Historical novel">historical novels</a> on Arabic subjects. Two important translators were Rifa'ah al -Tahtawi and <a href="../../../j/a/b/Jabra_Ibrahim_Jabra_558b.html" title="Jabra Ibrahim Jabra">Jabra Ibrahim Jabra</a>.</p>
<p>Major political change in the region during the mid-20th century caused problems for writers. Many suffered censorship and some such as Sun'allah Ibrahim and <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Rahman_Munif_97ee.html" title="Abdul Rahman Munif">Abdul Rahman Munif</a> were imprisoned. At the same time, others who had written works supporting or praiseworthy of governments were promoted to positions of authority within cultural bodies. Non-fiction writers and academics have also produced political polemics and criticisms aiming to re-shape Arabic politics. Some of the best known are <a href="../../../t/a/h/Taha_Hussein_bb98.html" title="Taha Hussein">Taha Hussein</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Future_of_Culture_in_Egypt_5683.html" title="The Future of Culture in Egypt">The Future of Culture in Egypt</a></i> which was an important work of Egyptian <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and the works of <a href="../../../n/a/w/Nawal_el-Saadawi_26fd.html" title="Nawal el-Saadawi">Nawal el-Saadawi</a> who campaigns for women's rights.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_literature.html" title="Edit section: Modern Arabic novels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Arabic novels</span></h3>
<p>Characteristic of the <i>nahda</i> period of revival were two distinct trends. The Neo-Classical movement sought to rediscover the literary traditions of the past, and was influenced by traditional literary genres such as the <i><a href="../../../m/a/q/Maqama.html" title="Maqama">maqama</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thousand_and_One_Nights_6846.html" title="Thousand and One Nights">Thousand and One Nights</a></i>. In contrast, the Modernist movement began by translating Western works, primarily novels, into Arabic.</p>
<p>Individual authors in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, and <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> created original works by imitating the classical <i>maqama</i>. The most prominent of these was al-Muwaylihi, whose book, <i>The Hadith of Issa ibn Hisham</i> (حديث عيسى بن هشام), critiqued Egyptian society in the period of <a href="../../../i/s/m/Ismail_of_Egypt_94ba.html" title="Ismail of Egypt">Ismail</a>. This work constitutes the first stage in the development of the modern Arabic novel. This trend was furthered by Georgy Zeidan, a Lebanese Christian writer who immigrated with his family to Egypt following the <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> riots of <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860.html" title="1860">1860</a>. In the early twentieth century, Zeidan serialized his historical novels in the Egyptian newspaper <i>al-Hilal</i>. These novels were extremely popular because of their clarity of language, simple structure, and the author's vivid imagination. Two other important writers from this period were <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalil_Gibran_1aae.html" title="Khalil Gibran">Khalil Gibran</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikha%27il_Na%27ima_f0a2.html" title="Mikha'il Na'ima">Mikha'il Na'ima</a>, both of whom incorporated philosophical musings into their works.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, literary critics do not consider the works of these four authors to be true novels, but rather indications of the form that the modern novel would assume. Many of these critics point to <i><a href="../../../z/a/y/Zaynab_%28novel%29.html" title="Zaynab (novel)">Zaynab</a></i>, a novel by <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Husayn_Haykal_de8b.html" title="Muhammad Husayn Haykal">Muhammad Husayn Haykal</a> as the first true Arabic-language novel, while others point to <i>Adraa Denshawi</i> by Muhammad Tahir Haqqi.</p>
<p>A common theme in the modern Arabic novel is the study of family life with obvious resonances with the wider family of the Arabic world. Many of the novels have been unable to avoid the politics and conflicts of the region with war often acting as background to small scale family dramas. The works of <a href="../../../n/a/g/Naguib_Mahfuz_723d.html" title="Naguib Mahfuz">Naguib Mahfuz</a> depict life in <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo.html" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, and his <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo_Trilogy_9245.html" title="Cairo Trilogy">Cairo Trilogy</a>, describing the struggles of a modern Cairene family across three generations, won him a <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobel_prize_for_literature.html" title="Nobel prize for literature">Nobel prize for literature</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. He was the first Arabic writer to win the prize.</p>

<p>Theatre and drama has only been a visible part of Arabic literature in the modern era. There may have been a much longer theatrical tradition but it was probably not regarded as legitimate literature and mostly went unrecorded. There is an ancient tradition of public performance amongst <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27i.html" title="Shi'i">Shi'i</a> Muslims of a play depicting the life and death of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Husayn_a866.html" title="Al-Husayn">al-Husayn</a> at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Karbala_1d7d.html" title="Battle of Karbala">battle of Karbala</a> in <a href="../../../6/8/0/680.html" title="680">680</a> CE. There are also several plays composed by Shams al-din Muhammad ibn Daniyal in the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th century</a> when he mentions that older plays are getting stale and offers his new works as fresh material.</p>
<p>Drama began to be written in the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> chiefly in Egypt and mainly influenced and in imitation of French works. It was not until the 20th century that it began to develop a distinctly Arab flavour and be seen elsewhere. The most important Arab playwright was <a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawfiq_al-Hakim_2a6d.html" title="Tawfiq al-Hakim">Tawfiq al-Hakim</a> whose first play was a re-telling of the Qur'anic story of the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_sleepers.html" title="Seven sleepers">Seven sleepers</a> and the second an epilogue for the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>. Other important dramatists of the region include Yusuf al'Ani of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and Sa'dallah Wannus of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>.</p>

<p>Whilst not playing a major part in Arabic literature women have had a continuing role. The earliest poetesses were <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Khansa_0e36.html" title="Al-Khansa">al-Khansa</a> and Layla al-Akhyaliyyah of the <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_century.html" title="7th century">7th century</a>. Their concentration on the <i>ritha'</i> or elegy suggests that this was a form designated for women to work in. A later poetess Walladah, Umawi princess of al-Andulus wrote <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufi.html" title="Sufi">Sufi</a> poetry and was the lover of fellow poet ibn Zaydun. These and other minor women writers suggest a hidden world of female literature. Women still played an important part as characters in Arabic literature with <i>Sirat al-amirah Dhat al-Himmah</i> an <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_epic_literature.html" title="Arabic epic literature">Arabic epic</a> with a female warrior as the chief protagonist and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahrazad.html" title="Shahrazad">Shahrazad</a> cunningly telling stories in the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i> to save her life.</p>
<p>Modern Arabic literature has allowed a greater number of female writers' works to be published: Suhayr al-Qalamawi, Ulfat Idlibi, Layla Ba'albakki and <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alifa_Rifaat_af24.html" title="Alifa Rifaat">Alifa Rifaat</a> are just some of the novelists and short story writers. There has also be a number of significant female academics such as Zaynab al-Ghazali, <a href="../../../n/a/w/Nawal_el-Saadawi_26fd.html" title="Nawal el-Saadawi">Nawal el-Saadawi</a> and Fatimah al-Marnisi who amongst other subject wrote of the place of women in Muslim society. Women writers also courted controversy with Layla Ba'albakki charged with insulting public decency with her short story <i>Spaceships of Tenderness to the Moon</i>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_literature.html" title="Edit section: Literary criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Literary criticism</span></h2>
<p>Criticism has been inherent in Arabic literature from the start. The poetry festivals of the pre-Islamic period often pitched two poets against each other in a war of verse in which one would be deemed to have won by the audience. The subject adopted a more official status with Islamic study of the Qur'an. Although nothing as crass as literary criticism could be applied to a work which was <i>i'jaz</i> or inimitable and divinely inspired, analysis was permitted. This study allowed for better understanding of the message and facilitated interpretation for practical use, all of which help the development of a critical method important for later work on other literature. A clear distinction regularly drawn between works in literary language and popular works has meant that only part of the literature in Arabic was usually considered worthy of study and criticism.</p>
<p>Some of the first studies of the poetry are <i>Qawa'id al-shi'r</i> or <i>The Rules of Poetry</i> by Tha'lab and <i>Naqd al-shi'r</i> <i>Poetic Criticism</i> by Qudamah ibn Ja'far. Other works tended to continue the tradition of contrasting two poets in order to determine which one best follows the rule of classical poetic structure. Plagiarism also became a significant idea exercising the critcs' concerns. The works of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Mutanabbi_398b.html" title="Al-Mutanabbi">al-Mutanabbi</a> were particularly studied with this concern. He was considered by many the greatest of all Arab poets but his own arrogant self-regard for his abilities did not endear him to other writers and they looked for a source for his verse. Just as there were collections of facts written about many different subjects, numerous collections detailing every possible <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhetorical_figure.html" title="Rhetorical figure">rhetorical figure</a> used in literature emerged as well as how to write guides.</p>
<p>Modern criticism at first compared the new works unfavourably with the classical ideals of the past but these standards were soon rejected as too artificial. The adoption of the forms of European <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic_poetry.html" title="Romantic poetry">romantic poetry</a> dictated the introduction of corresponding critical standards. <a href="../../../t/a/h/Taha_Hussayn_d914.html" title="Taha Hussayn">Taha Hussayn</a>, himself keen on European thought, would even dare to challenge the Qur'an with modern critical analysis in which he pointed out the ideas and stories borrowed from pre-Islamic poetry.</p>

<p>Literature in Arabic has been largely unknown outside the Islamic world. Arabic has frequently acted as a time capsule, preserving literature form ancient civilisations to be re-discovered in <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> Europe and as a conduit for transmitting literature from distant regions. In this role though it is rarely read but simply re-translated into another standard language like <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>. One of the first important translations of Arabic literature was <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_of_Ketton_f0e7.html" title="Robert of Ketton">Robert of Ketton</a>'s translation of the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> in the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a> but it would not be until the early <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> that much of Arabic's diverse literature would be recognised, largely due to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabist.html" title="Arabist">Arabists</a> such as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forster_Fitzgerald_Arbuthnot_145a.html" title="Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot">Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot</a> and his books such as <i>Arabic Authors: A Manual of Arabian History and Literature</i>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_Galland_9b33.html" title="Antoine Galland">Antoine Galland</a>'s translation of the <i><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thousand_and_One_Nights_6846.html" title="Thousand and One Nights">Thousand and One Nights</a></i> was the first major work in Arabic which found great success outside the Muslim world. other significant translators were <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_R%C3%BCckert_c0f6.html" title="Friedrich Rückert">Friedrich Rückert</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Burton_49d2.html" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>, along with many working at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_William%2C_India_0603.html" title="Fort William, India">Fort William, India</a>. The Arabic works and many more in other eastern languages fuelled a fascination in <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orientalism.html" title="Orientalism">Orientalism</a> within Europe. Works of dubious 'foreign' morals were particularly popular but even these were censored for content, such as homosexual references, which were not permitted in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian society</a>. Most of the works chosen for translation helped confirm the stereotypes of the audiences with many more still untranslated. Few modern Arabic works have been translated into other languages.</p>
