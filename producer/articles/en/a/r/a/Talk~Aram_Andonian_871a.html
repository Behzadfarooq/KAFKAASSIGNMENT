<p>I just created this article and hope that we can expand more on Andonian's role concerning the telegrams. This article is partial and I hope we can also include some of Andonian's personal life.

<p>Hi, just dropped by while doing some general wiki cleanup. You have a link to <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian.html" title="Armenian">Armenian</a>, which is a disambiguation page, and should not be linked to directly. I'm not sure if you are referring to his ethnicity or his nationality. If the former, you should use [[Armenians|Armenian]]; if the latter, [[Armenia|Armenian]]. (If either is correct, I would probably choose the former.) Thanks. -- <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> 11:18, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EAram_Andonian_871a.html" title="Edit section: Authenticity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Authenticity</span></h2>
<p>"Among others, Turkish professors have asserted that Andonian's telegrams are in fact forged..." Not only Turkish professors have asserted this. Look what <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guenter_Lewy_dac0.html" title="Guenter Lewy">Guenter Lewy</a> has to say about the documents: &gt;&gt;Turkish authors are not alone in their assessment that the Naim-Andonian documents are fakes. Dutch historian Erik Zürcher, writing in 1997, argued that the Andonian materials "have been shown to be forgeries." British historian <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Mango_98dc.html" title="Andrew Mango">Andrew Mango</a> speaks of "telegrams dubiously attributed to the Ottoman wartime minister of the interior, Talât Pasha." It is ironic that lobbyists and policymakers seek to base a determination of genocide upon documents most historians and scholars dismiss at worst as forgeries and at best as unverifiable and problematic.&lt;&lt; For further reading: <a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/748#_ftnref40" class="external free" title="http://www.meforum.org/article/748#_ftnref40" rel="nofollow">http://www.meforum.org/article/748#_ftnref40</a> .</p>
<p>And: &gt;&gt;For example, the alleged thirty-one telegrams of Talât Pasha contained in the Naim-Andonian volume, some of which order the killing of all Armenians, are rejected as crude forgeries not only by Turkish historians but also by almost all Western students of Ottoman history. Hilmar Kaiser, cited by Dadrian and the one exception to this rule, did say documents from the Ottoman Ministry of the Interior "confirm to some degree" two telegrams, but he concluded that "further research on the ‘Naim-Andonian' documents is necessary."&lt;&lt; <a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/895" class="external free" title="http://www.meforum.org/article/895" rel="nofollow">http://www.meforum.org/article/895</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The section relating to authenticity rather brushes over just how vast the weight of opinion against the authenticity of the telegrams are - to a degree it seems to try to minimalise it, using only the term 'among others' to refer to the vast array of international scholarship that discards the documents as crude forgeries, while finishing up with Dadrian's defence of his use of them.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Dadrian, the present director of the Zoryan Institute, claims that they were authenticed by a German court when, as Lewy points out, the stenographic record published in 1921 shows otherwise they were withdrawn as evidence before any authentication was attempted. Other Armenian campaigners have used the same ploy, notably Peter Balakian in his book Burning Tigris - of which Norman Stone wrote "There is one mistake which really blows Balakian’s effort sky high. He relies on a forgery that was exposed as such over eighty years ago, the Naim-Andonian documents." Stone was referring to the fact that British officials at the Tribunal dismissed these as forgeries generated in Paris in 1920 by Aram Andonian.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Erich Fiegl describes his meeting with a previous director of the Zoryan Institute, Gerard Libaridian:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since it seemed reasonable to assume that Libaridian knew that the papers were forgeries, I did not want to waste a single word on the subject. There were so many other, more interesting things to talk about. But remarkable enough, he stuck with Aram Andonian's book, and its "documents". Finally I had to say, "But Doctor Libaridian, you know as well as that these 'Andonian papers' are forgeries!" I will never forget Dr.Libaridian answer or his facial expression as he replied simply and briefly to my reproach:</dd>

<p>"These telegrams were also used in the trial of Soghomon Tehlirian, who assassinated Talat Pasha in Berlin, Germany on March 14, 1921. The introduction of these documents in court help acquit Tehlirian; albeit on grounds of temporary insanity due to the traumatic experience he had gone through during the Genocide."</p>
<p>As described under the Authenticity discussion, these documents were never introduced as evidence. The motion was withdrawn. Whilst I will leave the issue of authenticity, which is an issue of a biased representation of the debate, for discussion, I am removing the above statement immediately as it can be empirically demonstrated as false by the court records published in 1921.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia relies on the threshold of verifiability, not fact. News articles at the time stated that the documents themselves indeed were submitted to the court. I'll attach a citation to go along with it.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshallBagramyan_31db.html" title="User:MarshallBagramyan">MarshallBagramyan</a> 23:00, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Newspaper reports can provide a degree of verification that the documents were submitted. The court recorts can provide absolute verification that the newspaper reports were wrong and they were not entered. However, my good faith has been depleted by such a pointless line of argument that it is better I withdraw.
