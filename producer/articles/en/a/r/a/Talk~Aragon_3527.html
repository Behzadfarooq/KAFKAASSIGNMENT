<p>"In speaking of the reign of Henry IV, present-day historians usually call the kingdom the "Navarre-France Confederation" or, some of them, simply "Navarre-France," since it was the Navarre kings that inherited the French Crown and not the other way around." <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">User:Wetman</a></p>
<p>In the text there is a confution between the Aragon Kingdom &amp; the Corona de Aragón (I ignore the correct term in English). The first was independent under 1714 (fisrt under the power of the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Barcelona_f6f4.html" title="House of Barcelona">House of Barcelona</a> and later under the power of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Spain_cfeb.html" title="King of Spain">king of Spain</a>) and never rules in Catalonia, Balearic Islands, Valencia... the second was the name of Aragon Kingdom, Catalonia, Balearic Islands.... under the power of the same person until 1492. <a href="../../../l/l/u/User%7ELlull_fbf8.html" title="User:Llull">Llull</a> 19:50, 17 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "Crown of Aragon" is the second term you're looking for. The first would be the "Kingdom of Aragon". So the crown of Aragon consisted of the Kingdom of Aragon, the Kingdom of Valencia, Catalonia (the County of Barcelona), the Balearic Islands (Kingdom of Majorca?), the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the two Sicilian kingdoms. The last three were lost by the treaties ending the War of the Spanish Succession, and the first four were incorporated more fully into a central Spanish administration, although I don't think it's accurate to say that there was a Kingdom of Spain until the Napoleonic intervention in the 19th century - there was no official title of "King of Spain" before that, although the term was used colloquially. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the term was used more that colloquially. "Juan el Hermoso" was who began to use this term. And yes, the Balearic Islands were the Kingdom of Majorca. I won't correct the differences between the crown and the Kingdom because of I'd introduce bugs. <a href="../../../l/l/u/User%7ELlull_fbf8.html" title="User:Llull">Llull</a> 06:48, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It may have been used, in the same way that James I and VI of England and Scotland called himself "King of Great Britain," but it was not an official title until 1808. I'm not sure what you mean about introducing bugs. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 06:56, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>At any rate, I think you're right that the article conflates the region of Aragon with the whole lands of the Aragonese Crown which were in personal union with Castile from 1479. Not sure how to deal with this. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> 06:32, 19 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Present-day historians usually call the kingdom the "Catalan-Aragonese Confederation" or, some of them, simply "Catalonia-Aragon". Barcelona was the center of what was in many ways a Mediterranean Empire, ruling the Mediterranean Sea and setting rules for the entire sea (for instances, in the Llibre del Consolat del Mar (in Catalan).</i> There was never something as <i>Catalonia-Aragon</i> or the <i>Catalan-Aragonese Confederation</i>. The union between Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia and Majorca was allways called the "Corona de Aragón" (without any Catalonia in front or behind). I don't know who has introduced those other names in history books but I have my suspicions. As for Barcelona being the "center" of the "empire", well the union between the different kingdoms was quite loose. Valencia and Naples were very important trade cities too. To say that Barcelona was the center is simply wishful thinking. I think there is a tendency to project the importance of modern Barcelona into the past.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are probably right there. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon">Chameleon</a> 12:18, 31 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>While Barcelona was the center of the Crown of Aragon administration, it is true that links among Catalonia, Valencia and Aragon were very loose. This claim about the importance of Barcelona city is probably exaggerated and should be editted out, since it belongs better to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barcelona.html" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> article. I suggest that history of the Crown of Aragon should be explained in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aragonese_Empire_48da.html" title="Aragonese Empire">Aragonese Empire</a> while the relationship between Kingdom of Aragon and Crown of Aragon belongs here. IMHO, this would prevent confusion. --62.81.27.241 17:34, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>As I have been saying in other Spain-related pages, we should be putting as the official name ONLY the official name of the region. As Aragonese and Catalan and not recognized within Aragon, both of those names cannot be considered official.</p>
<p>Eboracum 02:22, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am reverting the names of the Autonomous Community to only the official version. Will the user putting back unofficial names as if they were official please discuss why?</p>
<p>Eboracum 23:26, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article isn't neutral, someone try to rewrite the history to support their political ideas, but my english is very poor to correct it. Only one point, the map about languages isn't good, in all Aragon all people speak spanish and in some parts there are persons who speaks two languages, for example, spanish and catalonian. In fact, only spanish is the legal language of the Comunity of Aragón.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree there: The labeling of the map is misleading. There are regions of Aragon where two languages are spoken, but in all of them people speak Spanish. Would someone with the proper tool modify the map labeling, please? 128.195.88.18 06:30, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pardon my ignorance of this matter, but I was under the assumption that in Spain, regional languages were given official status in areas where they were spoken, to the extent that even tiny languages like Aranes have official status (as can be seen on the page for Catalunya). Is Aragon an exception to this? Seek100 23:14, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Only if there is a law recognizing that official status in a first place. The "Ley de Lenguas de Aragon" (Language Law of Aragon) delimited official borders for catalan and aragones. It created a lot of polemic and wasn't even presented at the aragones parliament (DGA) for fear of it being turned down. The new "estatuto" (similar to a small constitution for a federal state), which will surely last for at least some 20-30 years mentions no borders. Indeed, it doesn't even mention "aragones" or "catalan"! It only mentions regional languages in generic. Attempts to solve this have been hampered by internal political fights. So, yes, Aragon is an exception to this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are several reasons to this. 1) some people trying to impose one monolithic version of aragones on all territory. 2) some tremendously small languages trying to get official status (benasqués, ribagorzano). 3) fights between supporters of "catalan in aragon" and supporters of "oriental aragones". 4) interference from catalonia to support "catalan in aragon", which causes more trouble than it solves. 5) "right" and "left" taking one side or other. 6) rivality between big cities and villages and between Catalonia and Aragon, and many, many, more reasons. It's going to be a <i>long</i> time before this gets settled. --<a href="../../../e/n/r/User%7EEnric_Naval_c438.html" title="User:Enric Naval">Enric Naval</a> 17:55, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
