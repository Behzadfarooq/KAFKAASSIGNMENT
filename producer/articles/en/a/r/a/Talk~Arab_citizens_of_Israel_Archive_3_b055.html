<dd>-- (Consider just the Bedouin for now.) Alas, neither of these sources suffice for this claim. The first one (the same Israeli government article noted as incorrectly cited above) says the Bedouin "feel an exaggerated sense of deprivation" (sounds warm, doesn't it?) and then argues that the Bedouin are wonderfully well off even if they claim they aren't. The second one mentions that Bedouin often serve in the army, then it says "'The military rule over Israeli Arabs is over, but there are still confiscations of our land, especially the land owned by Bedouin in the Negev,' says Samih al-Kasim, editor of a Nazareth newspaper and one of the Arab world's leading poets. 'And there are still Arab `refugees' inside Israel today -- over 40 of our villages remain unrecognized. The plans to `Judaize the Galilee,' the warnings of a `demographic problem' in the Haifa area -- how can we see this as anything but racism?'".

<p>The relationship between the Jews and the Bedouin are complicated. Some are very warm, serve in the Israeli army and have full rights and enjoyment. Many have died for protection of the country and are commemorated in a special ceremony etc. Such an example where no difference exists at all between Jews and Bedouin in all aspects of life is the village of Arab el-Aramsheh in the north <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3351581,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3351581,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Other relations are more tense, for example around Beer Sheva there are allegations of crime, protection money and also the issue of traffic accidents relating to the Beoduin in the region. Some claim the situation is bad and there's a chance of an intifada due to the conditions etc.<a href="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3262090,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3262090,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> It's all a process, much with similarities and differences with the Arab population and with Druzes - the Druzes is especially good historically because they have mandatory service and because their perception is that they're loyal to the country they're in and not of external nationality - usually. The plans to Judaize the Galilee and issues of demographics is not racism, it's Zionism. It's a difference you may not wish to understand, but for Jews it's a matter of survival and a necessity. That doesn't mean that the minorities should be discriminated which is what's important. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 15:55, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zionism is definitely not equivalent to racism, and this is why the plan to "Judaize" the Galilee has been subject to quite a lot of criticism in Israel. Generally speaking, it failed anyway (save some successful projects, like the city of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karmiel.html" title="Karmiel">Karmiel</a>). The hilly part of the Galilee is still predominately Arab, and cities like <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazareth_Illit_22b2.html" title="Nazareth Illit">Nazareth Illit</a> eventually became Jewish-Arab mixed cities. Nonetheless, the Galilee is definitely Israeli. The Arabs there have become part of the Israeli society in this way or another. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrork_a20a.html" title="User:Drork">drork</a> 22:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Abu ali, please distinguish between "generally warm" and "100% of all of them love Israel." Do you know how many cases of Jewish Israelis I can find that say how much they hate the government? Thousands. Same with Protestant Americans. The fact is that many Bedouins have complaints, but they are generally warm with Israel. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 01:44, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>From a Bedouin:"Beyond being a democracy, Israel is a bureaucracy. Its good intentions to solve our problems in Israel always overlap with the bureaucratic system, and that increases the frustration of Bedouins. The Bedouins have lots of demands, and there are many problems with the bureaucratic system here.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I always say, and it might be a joke but it’s true, that a shepherd cannot be made into a hi-tech engineer. We are a shepherd society…very traditional and conservative. It will take us a long time to settle down and be a part of modern society.</p>
<p>The Israeli government decided throughout the years that they wanted to help. It’s just the way that Israeli authorities are trying to solve the problems that is wrong. Maybe they’re doing the right thing, but at the wrong time. Bedouins don’t need internet access. We need more schools and medical care. But Bedouins may also need to build dairies for their sheep and for their goats, because it will take them time to abandon being shepherds and to be maybe not hi-tech engineers but educated people who went to university.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Israeli society is very supportive of our demands. But Bedouins don’t have a strong enough lobby to help us, to knock on the doors of authority.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Misrepresentation of sources</span></h2>
<p>Shamir1 has insisted on including material alleged to be from Freedom House's country report on Israel and PDF summary of world freedom in the article lead. The latter states that Israel is "free" and surrounding Arab countries are all either "partly free" or "not free". On this basis, Shamir states that Arabs in Israel have more rights than those in any Arab country. This is a clear violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.</p>
<p>Then he uses the former Freedom House document to include material in the article about how well represented Israeli Arabs are in the political sphere. Fair enough, except that the first thing this document says about Israeli Arabs is that "while extended full political rights... Arab citizens of Israel... receive inferior education, housing, and social services relative to the Jewish population." (my elisions). Obviously when a source gives an assessment of a situation that is part-positive, part-negative, it's not very good manners to use it in order to help make an article introduction give the impression that everything is brilliant.</p>
<p>This will not do. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 03:24, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Update: I see Shamir is now using edit summaries to order me to "NOT make false accusations".

<dd>Except Abu Ali you were doing exactly the same thing as Shamir and Amoruso are doing with the Freedom House material when you used the Haaretz article about Tartman and Lieberman in what looked rather like an attempt to prove that Israeli politics is evil and racist, ignoring the rather salient material in the article that Lieberman's and Tartman's comments had been strongly condemned by not just Meretz but also Labour and Likud.

<dd>Lieberman does represent the right wing of Israeli politics. But it is the 3rd or 4th largest party as far as I remember so it is not a fringe element.

Maybe you could learn a lot instead of talking doodoo and wasting our time here. It seems that you would rather make "Zionists" look bad while ignoring who is really being mistreated.

<dd>Palmiro, there is nothing to interpret, nothing, it is there, you can read it. I have given you the sources. They indicate the degree of political rights and civil liberties of the citizens in each country. You can read what is needed in order to achieve a "1" on their site, as well as a brief description on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_in_the_World_8261.html" title="Freedom in the World">Freedom in the World</a>. The Arab citizens of Israel enjoy more political rights and civil liberties in their non-Arab country, than the Arab citizens of any actual Arab country. Their political parties mean more in Israel than they do in Arab countries.

<dd>Abu ali, by saying that the worst crimes were done by Christians does not make what Muslims did even close to good, or even okay. Even the Jews who escaped Spain to North Africa had their stomachs cut open by Muslim Moors in search of gold. The king of Morocco sent many of them back knowing that they would be burned or forced to convert. Egypt had a great deal of segregation and bad treatment of dhimmi. In Iran, every Jew had to end his last name with the same suffix to make it visible on their birth certificate. Whole communities were forced to convert to Islam. Abu ali, if Arabs are "persecuted" in Israel than three things are going on: 1) you do not know the meaning of persecution, 2) you are not giving justice to the people who have actually endured persecution, and 3) the Arabs of Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia are being persecuted to an extent five to six times more.</dd>

<dd>Palmiro, the source is reliable, that is not the question. The citizens of Israel, all equal, enjoy the highest degree of political rights and the highest degree of civil liberties in the Middle East. You can see that with the numbers. You can also see what is needed in order to achieve a 1. If the citizens were "second-clas" a 1 could not be achieved. In the explanation it says specifically that Arab citizens enjoy the full extent of rights, and these rights surpass that of their family that is actually in an Arab country. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 21:13, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is precisely this kind of analysis that is outlawed in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

Also, again, in the explanation it says that Arab citizens enjoy the fullest extent of political rights, which is a 1. No other Arabs in the Middle East hold that extent of political rights per the source.

<dd>Shamir, I agree that that is an entirely reasonable conclusion to draw from the two reports, taken together. However, what you have to bear in mind is just how widely the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy forbidding original research</a> is interpreted. Basically, drawing any sort of conclusion that is not drawn in the original source is not allowed. Of course, you can get away with this in non-controversial areas, but this is not such an area. Furthermore, you have been trying to use a source that says both good and bad things about the treatment of Palestinian citizens of Israel in order to get something purely good into the lead paragraph. That is not really an honest use of the source. And trying to put your own conclusion into the lead while rejecting material that is actually contained as such in the source doesn't look good. The report's own summary statement, that I put into the lead, is a better choice. It seems reasonable to assume that this is more likely to represent what the authors of the original report felt was the principal point. That would suggest that it is more likely to be of sufficient import to be put in the article lead, especially compared with something that - leaving aside the question of "original research" - the authors did not feel was of sufficient import to state explicitly at all.</dd>

<dd>It is an obvious conclusion that does not take interpretation. Palmiro, please learn what should be in the lead. 1) The report concludes 2 main things about Israeli citizens: 1 in terms of political rights, and 2 in terms of civil liberties (both of which are considered suffice to be free and democratic according to FH. That is the main point that is for the lead, NOT the sentence in the greater explanation of the entire report. That belongs in the current economic situation, where I put it. And please, I noticed how you conveniently left out the factors that are even written there, one might call that a misrepresentation of sources. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 20:40, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Look, four people have pointed out to you why your version constitutes "original research" in the Wikipedia usage. If you can't understand, maybe you could at least ask for explanation somewhere else, e.g. on <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ENo_original_research_2c3e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:No original research">Wikipedia_talk:No original research</a>. As for what belongs or does not belong in the lead, if you decide that the Freedom House conclusions about Arab citizens of Israel belong in the lead (I'm open-minded about this), then you must in order to accurately represent their conclusions seek to reflect their apparent sense of priority. If their opening sentence about the population in question gives both positive and negative remarks about their situation, then in order to be honest you should do the same. Instead you have decided to give their positive comments, along with positive comments they didn't make but you extrapolated from their publications, in the introduction, while relegating the negative comments to well down inside the body of the article. If you can't see why that is not honest, there's not much hope for us in this discussion. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 21:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Abu ali, the Jewish Virtual Library may be as reliable as it gets. Many of their articles come from a long list of sources. Others are directly copied from others, such as news sites or the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They have a large amount of documents, official documents, pertaining to Jewish history and Israel (old and new), some (like I said) direct from sources like the U.S. State Department. It provides many important documents, transcripts, and discussions. The 1956 attack was probably found on the website of the Israeli Ministry, where they are identified as terrorists. It would be helpful if someone could find what group the terrorists belonged to, if they even did. The Irgun and Lehi also participated in terrorist actions prior to independence. Like most democratic governments, Israel dismantled them and they no longer exist. Israel continues to ban even membership to certain radical groups, something even the U.S. does not do. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 07:42, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's strange how you call it impecibly referenced when the page used as a source in this example does not have any references at all. In general the Jewish Virtual Library has material from lots of sources, ranging from excellent to atrocious. So it is not possible to classify it either as always reliable or always unreliable. On the Druze guards, one important missing piece of information is who the guards were. If they were soldiers, then this was a military attack. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 11:51, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>The article alleges that "Most Bedouin reject calling themselves Palestinians". However, the source cited, an article in the Jewish Virtual Library <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/Bedouin.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/Bedouin.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, does not actually make this claim. Further, since the article itself is sourced by Jewish Virtual Library to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, it is hardly NPOV. I have deleted the reference, and I would like to see a neutral source, which actually makes this alleged assessment. Failing this, I will in a few days delete the whole sentence for lack of evidence. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 18:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now here we get into the delicate issue of what the term "Palesinian" means. The Bedouin (as well as the Druze) have distinct culture, somewhat different than the culture of other Arabs in the region of Israel/Palestine. Bedouin speak in a distinct Arab dialect, quite different than the one used by Palestinians. They also have different customs and traditions. However, they do write in Standard Arabic, They are Muslims and they keep social and political ties with the Palestinians. Their acceptance of the State of Israel has been much better than that of the Palestinians.</dd>
<dd>In short, it is not easy to determine whether the Bedouin are Palestinians. The best way is to ask the Bedouin themselves, but I doubt if you get a clear answer from any of them. This issue is so politically-charched these days, that the best answer would be keeping silent. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrork_a20a.html" title="User:Drork">drork</a> 08:20, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'm trying to understand, did you not find a mention of the information in the article in the sources given or did you just not find the sources reliable? If it's the latter, I don't see how it is in the Jewish Virtual Library's interest to distinguish Bedouins from Palestinians (by saying they don't consider themselves Palestinian). The fact is that Bedouins in Israel do not consider themselves to be Palestinian and have several distinguished characteristics that are different from the Palestinians (as drork mentioned, for example, they speak a different dialect from Palestinians). In addition, you can also see how they are separate from the rest of the Palestinian population since a significant portion of the Bedouin population serve in the IDF, definitely when compared to the Israeli Arab population (Palestinians). <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatan</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yonatanh_afb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yonatanh">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/n/User_talk%7EYonatanh_729d.html" title="User talk:Yonatanh">talk</a>) 11:29, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The Israeli authorities do have an interest in distinguishing Bedouin from Palestinian Arabs. It has to do with the tacit fear of irredenta. If the Bedouin are part of the Palestinian people, then the chances of irredenta increase should a Palestinian state be established in the near future. Nonetheless, and as I mentioned above, there are objective reasons to regard the Bedouin in Israel as a <b>culturally</b> distinct group. Their <b>political</b> identification is another story. Politics has to do with culture, but it doesn't end there. As for the army service - there are volanteer Bedouin soldiers in the IDF, many of them take risky jobs in the army, however the rate of enlisted Bedouin out of the entire Israeli Bedouin abled population is almost negligible (some 2-3%, but I take these number out of my memory, I should check). Furthermore, in some Bedouin communities anyone who volanteers to service is banned. <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDrork_a20a.html" title="User:Drork">drork</a> 07:56, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was talking about the Jewish Virtual Library, not the state of Israel. Regarding the percentage of their population that serves in the army, this may be caused by a few reasons:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1. They feel as if they have been wronged by the Israeli government (which in many cases is true) and\or feel like second-class citizens. 2. Their service isn't mandatory and therefore they don't see a reason to serve the army as they'd rather not risk their lives fighting a war that others can fight for them and\or they do not completely connect with the ideas behind the war. 3. They see themselves as Palestinians and therefore do not want to see their brothers.</p>
<p>As you can see, Bedouins seeing themselves as Palestinians is only one of a few reasons why this phenomenon is widespread. However, this isn't saying that the third reason isn't the most prominent (because it may be, I personally don't know). <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatan</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yonatanh_afb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yonatanh">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/n/User_talk%7EYonatanh_729d.html" title="User talk:Yonatanh">talk</a>) 14:05, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The key Israeli policy is divide and rule: Divide the Palestinians of 48 from the Palestinians in the territories, divide Gaza from the West Bank, Divide the West Bank itself into many disconnected cantons, divide Christain from Muslim Druze and Charcasian. The aim is to divide the Arab masses and set us to fight against each other so that the Israeli state can rule over us easier. The title of this article is the Israeli official doublespeak "Arab Citizens of Israel" to try to emphasise a that there is no connection between Palestinians on the other side of the green line. The structure of the article which begins by subdividing Arabs by "ethnic and religious groups" is another feature of official government texts. While entire paragraphs are devoted to listing every time Arabs killed Jews, the article is silent Arab culture, food music and literature. Arab Judges, Knesset Members, Ministers without Portfolio and Ambassadors are listed, but no mention is made of the dominent position Arabs hold in construction and catering. One of the few places the Jews and Arabs actually work alongside each other as equals is in the Health system, but this does not warrent a mention in the article. The only The only photograph shows a (headless) Beduin tracker serving the IDF. Is this really a representative picture of Israeli Arabs? <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">ابو علي</a> 00:36, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Marhaba Abu Ali. I agree with the points you've raised. The attempt to divide the Palestinians of 48 from their Palestinian and Arab brethren is reflected in the structure of the article. I tried to provide a balancing POV, but have failed. As a Palestinian with Israeli citizenship, I deeply resent the way Israelis try to tell me which national and cultural groups I belong to. Most of the Druze and Bedouins I know here identify as Palestinian too. But in this article, there is a concerted effort to try to make them somehow different from the rest of us. This reflects Israel policy, as you pointed out, but that policy has been relatively unsuccessful with more and more Druze refusing the compulsory army service. Know that despite the presentation of so-called "facts" here, we Palestinians know who we are and where we come from. Citizenship is just a piece of paper that we are required to hold in order to maintain our access and rights to our land. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 13:22, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am Israeli, and I know many Druzes from the army and the University, and I can tell you one thing for sure: they really do not see themselves as Palestinians, and neither as Arabs - but as Druzes with they own distinctive identity. They are in fact the most anti-Arab people I met in my life (with a few Maronite Lebaneses I met in Paris a few years ago). By the way, if you are so unhappy in Israel and wants to live in an Arab country, you are free to leave. I have the feeling you won't, I don't know why... Maybe you prefer living in a free, democratic and rich country than in anything that your "brothers" have created - always a complete failure. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 13:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this discussion needs to be calmed down. Tiamut, with all due respect, you cannot appoint yourself to the role of the representatives of the Arabs of Israel, even if you are one of them. Besides, talking about an Israeli "divide and conquer" policy, whether true or not, does not have a place on the talk page of this article IMO. Just like with anything else, some Arab Israelis may be more connected with their brothers from the Palestinian territories and others not as much. Bringing your view into the article, as an Arab Israeli is OR and also unverifiable as is Benjil's claim that the Druzes he's met are the most anti-Arab people he has met. The *fact* is that there is a very large percentage of the Druze population that serves in the IDF just like any Israeli Jew. Many of them serve even beyond the three year mandatory service and go on to achieve high ranks. Even those Druze who have refused serving in the Israeli military have done so in many cases on the basis of not serving a country that treats them as second-class citizens and not on the basis of their so-called "Palestinian heritage". You can put both sides in the article, providing they are both sourced but you will probably have to also mention that refusal to serve in the Druze minority in Israel is not such a widespread phenomenon. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatan</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yonatanh_afb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yonatanh">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/n/User_talk%7EYonatanh_729d.html" title="User talk:Yonatanh">talk</a>) 14:05, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If your goal is to calm me down, your approach is rather curious. Nowhere over the many months that I worked on this article have I inserted my POV in such a way as to compromise balance or violate Wikipedia policy. Talk pages are a place to discuss the article (which I was doing with Abu Ali). That I shared some of my background and personal experiences on this page and with Abu Ali in our discussion, does not grant you a license to attack my editorial credibility. I welcome you to review my many posts in the history for this article as proof of my eminently fair and balanced approach. You will also find there that I have previously inserted sources that bely the incredibly one-sided POV regarding Druze identity here, but that they were removed at some point in time during my last hiatus from here. In any case, welcome to this article's talk pages.

<dd>Shalom Benjil, What exactly are Tiamut's provocations? What exactly is so "unbearable and so offensive" about "his" remarks. That an Israeli Arab has the nerve to relate her experiences on the talk page of the article about Israeli Arabs? That she dares contradict the opinions of the American "experts on Arabs" who dominate this page. That she is putting serious work into trying to change the article from an article on Arabs written by their oppressors to one which actually gives a picture of rich complexity of Arab life. And I did not suggest that you should not tell Arabs on the pages of Wikipedia to leave their homeland. This has been the policy of succesive Israeli governments for years (See the Konig document). And speaking your views so openly and honestly on the pages of Wikipedia will teach the reader much about Zionism and its approach to Arabs. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">ابو علي</a> 10:55, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Abu Ali, I am happy that now everybody can see how you lie and distort facts and reality. Thank you very much. The Arabs have always been the best advocates for Israel. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 12:03, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Benjil's comment above is both personally offensive to Abu Ali, and arguably racist. It is never acceptable to accuse another editor of lying, and this is certainly a breach of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a>. And his implicit support for the expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland is exceptionally offensive. I hope that, on consideration, he will realise this, withdraw the remarks, and adopt a more civil and effective way of arguing for his positions. <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERolandR_9641.html" title="User:RolandR">RolandR</a> 15:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes you are right, accusing me of racism and of supporting the expulsion of Palestinians when I say explicitly the contrary is not personal attack, but stressing obvious lies from someone is. I guess I should refrain from saying what I think about you then. I will not continue this "discussion" with such kind of people. But don't worry, I will continue to be sure that the facts on the articles stay true. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjil_659a.html" title="User:Benjil">Benjil</a> 16:31, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Marhabten yaTiamut, I admire your coolness and restraint in the face of Benjil inviting you to expel yourself from your homeland. All power to you! To return to RolandR's point above, I would agree that the statement that "Most Bedouin reject calling themselves Palestinians" is contentious to say the least, and not supported by the citation, so should be removed. <a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbu_ali_1028.html" title="User:Abu ali">ابو علي</a> 16:21, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that if no references are found it should be removed, however if you wish to assert that [some] Bedouins see themselves as Palestinians you would also need to add a reference. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatan</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yonatanh_afb0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yonatanh">contribs</a>/<a href="../../../y/o/n/User_talk%7EYonatanh_729d.html" title="User talk:Yonatanh">talk</a>) 16:34, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Yonathan. Thanks for clarifying your intent, recognizing my impartial editing example, and sorry for jumping to conclusions. I guess my temperature just got raised by Benjil's ethnic cleansing remark. It strikes a little too close to home, especially considering the political climate here lately. Habibi Abu Ali, thanks for the words of support. I guess I have gotten used to that kind of racism living here. In the end, they can say whatever they want and do whatever they want: I know where I am from, who I am, and what my rights are. And I'm not leaving. Ever. I will try to find some resources on the identity issue. From both sides of the issue if possible. There is nothing to fear from the truth. People are smart enough to know what's what when they have the chance to see the information for themselves. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 16:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
