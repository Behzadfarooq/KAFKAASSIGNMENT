<p>This template is too large to be suitable for inclusion on many pages. It might just make more sense to move this to an article called "Overview of the Arab-Israeli Conflict" and then pare down the template a lot to just create a link with the text "For more on the Arab-Israeli Conflict, go here..." --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 19:20, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Won't it make more sense if it was somehow auto-hidden, and those who want to "know more" can click it to reveal the rest? Seems more logical to me. <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukeDoom_bd6e.html" title="User:DukeDoom">Those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.</a> 17:52, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. It would not be logical to assume the bottomreader doesn't want to know more. Someone who looks to the bottom of the page is usually searching for more information, whether they search for external info ("references", "footnotes" and "external links") or more Wikipedia info ("see also" and templates like this one). If this template would have been included in the middle of an article, it could be possibly be more logical to auto-hide however. <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 18:54, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>On an entirely different note, why are there no Norwegians on this template? I guess our role in the so-called 'peace process' is vastly overrated in our media.. <a href="../../../j/o/f/User%7EJoffeloff_ba63.html" title="User:Joffeloff">Joffeloff</a> 16:43, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I started working on this template today, and I'm far from satisfied with the "states" and "people" parts. For instance the UK and France have played a major role from the 1910's till the end of the '50s, but aren't mentioned... The role of the USSR... Norway's role has been important also. The whole time period (at least from 1917 till 2006) is just way too big to have a summary of the most important people, as I can mention a at least a dozen equally important people. Something else that bothers me is the name of the template. Iran has played a very important role, but isn't an Arab state. <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 16:45, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, neither is America. I don't think it's a problem, the conflict is (currently) one between arabs and Israelis and has been up until now, time will tell if Iran joins in. Their current behind-the-scenes role in supplying arms and other things to Hezbollah is no bigger than America's role on the other side, so I don't think the conflict ought to be renamed just for that.</dd>

<dd>Also, I didn't know this template was that young. Great work! What, in my opinion, would be a great addition would be flags for the various organizations. <a href="../../../h/e/z/Hezbollah.html" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a> and the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_League_2a91.html" title="Arab League">Arab League</a> already have their flags uploaded on Wikipedia - however I have yet to see the flags of the various Palestinian organizations, even the ubiquitous green <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> flag with the shahada on it. What do you think of this? <a href="../../../j/o/f/User%7EJoffeloff_ba63.html" title="User:Joffeloff">Joffeloff</a> 17:04, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>these list templates are getting out of hand. templates are not categories: link ten or twelve <i>central</i> topics, don't list everything and everyone involved.

<dd>I think the size is fine. As you see in the earlier notes about it, you can "hide" the template. It's huge because the Arab-Israeli Conflict is huge.

<dd>Perhaps we should remove the "other participant"-section and perhaps the people's collumn. The first adds almost nothing (the links provide no explanation how these countries were important + it's debatble who has played a role - and almost every country has played one, which means that it can keep expanding). The latter can expand almost infinitely, as events are already going on from 1917 onwards and is currently biased in favor of the events since the 1990's.

<p>As there are no criteria defined for the inclusion of individuals, this template is getting more and more bloated. There are at least (!) a few dozen extra people that were really important. Because the template is currently biased towards more recent events (events since the '90's) they are not yet added. (Also, many people since the '90's are not added.) Don't forget the conflict and tensions are going on since 1917. Do we really want a template with 100 people or more mentioned? This is not a category of "Arab-Israeli conflict people". Furthermore the links to the people's collumn do not directly explain how these people were relevant for this conflict, while the conflict and diplomacy collumns are directly relevant. Even more: relevant people are mentioned in these pages. I will restore this template. If you disagree, provide arguments. 134.58.253.131 20:29, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I do agree that some people there were irrelevant, most of the really important people should be there. People like Medeline Albright,Cytus Vance and Chaim Weizmann should not be there since they hardly represent anything in the Arab-Israeli conflict. However, people like the al-Assads, Mahmoud Abbas, Yasse Arafat, Golda Meir, Ehud barak, Ehud Olmert, Shimon Peres, Ariel Sharon, Lester B. Pearson, Faisal of Iraq, Arthur Balfour and Hassan Nasrallah should definitely be listed. Many of the people in the list have been invovled in the coflict during the nineties (there was more peace then) like Arafat, Abbas and Clinton as well as conflicts. 190.40.23.107 20:47, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I never stated that people in the collumn were irrelevant. I said that there are simply way too much important people, that this not a category (but a template), that the links do not provide a direct explanation in how they were important, and that the links in the other collumns already explain how these people were important. I'm a bit disappointed that you didn't respond to my arguments. Until we make strict criteria for the inclusion of people, we should refrain from a people's collumn (and as a consequence I will be bold and restore the template to its former form until such criteria are made). 134.58.253.131 20:54, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Who makes criteria? The template was OK. Most of the people are important in the conflict and links to these people do tell something about the involvemnt in the Arab-Israeli conflict. For example: Mahmoud Abbas, Bill Clinton, Yasser Arafat, Faisal of Iraq, Balfour, the al-Assads are all involved in this and all of their articles do talk about their involvement in the conflict. We should revert is to what is was until and admin or a senior member come and make criteria. 190.40.23.107 21:00, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Since when do admins have to make criteria? Normally regular users do so in a (rough) consensus. At this moment, only you seem to object - while I and some other users have complained about the fact that this template gets bloated. Also please respond to my arguments, which you still haven't done. If you keep reverting it, at least don't revert the added things (a few UNSC resolutions). 134.58.253.131 15:42, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can't respond to any of your arguments because I can't see them. Would you mind actually listing them? The only thing I understand from you is that it should not be listed because it is unnecessary. I think it should be listed because it provides users information on the people involved in the conflict and if you click on them how they were involved. Also, they are based on other columns, such as Conflicts and peace proposals. Who made the conflicts and the peace proposals: the individuals. See? They must be there. //BTW, it's me,190....

<p>For several reasons, I want to remove the people's collumn and the indirect participants section. Because it seems unclear why I want this, I list my arguments in numbers, which should make it easy for everyone to follow. Please reply below my list in the opinion poll and not in between my arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>The template is getting way too big.</li>
<li>The indirect participant section (of the first collumn) doesn't add anything, because it doesn't say in what way they were indirect participants, when, how, etc. nor do their links.</li>
<li>The people's collumn: (1) There are simply way too many important and relevant people. There are <i>at least</i> a few dozens people that could be added. The conflict has its roots since at least 1917 - which means that there are a lot of people not yet mentioned. Do we want to have a list of (more than) 100 people? (2) The people's wikilinks often do not provide a direct explanation in how these people are relevant - which does not mean that the page does not mention how they were relevant - but they often do not deal in the first place with the conflict - unlike the diplomacy and conflict collumns. Even more, how they were relevant is already mentioned in the last two collumns (conflict and diplomacy), which further reduces the need of a people's collumn. (3) The choice of people in this collumn is subjective (while the direct participants, the conflict and the diplomacy collumns are not) because there are no objective criteria who should be included and who shouldn't. The conflict and diplomacy collumns do not have this problem: they include all conflicts and plans/agreements/resolutions. (4) A template is not a category. Those are two distinct concepts and this template should not strive to be a category - in this case by trying to include all relevant people to the Arab-Israeli conflict - a specific user category could do this.</li>

<dd>(1) The template may be a little big, but it is usually at the bottom of long articles and people that read these articles may be interested in the individuals involved in the conflict and other events.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(2)I partially agree with you that some of the links (most of them do) do not talk about the involvement of individuals in the conflict. However, it is important that whether they are or aren't links that people be able to know more about to conflict from the part of the conflict they were reading (an article with the template at the bottom). It is not so important to mention how they were relevant, but that they were involved in the conflict. The mission of this template is to inform readers that the subject they're reading is part of a larger subject and provides links to other important areas of the subject. (3) That I agree with you. But still, over 80% of the links to individuals do mention their involvement and they were <b>very</b> important people in the conflict. I do agree with you that some people can definitely be removed from there, such as Madeline Albright, which is subjective. (4)Most of the people that are there are relevant. Some are not, which can be removed.</p>
<p>Minor argument: IMO, it looks good. It is slightly larger than the edit window. It is large because of its importance and duration of events. I see this as the most complete and useful template in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Until the future of the template is agreed, it stays the way it was. 201.240.248.62 21:38, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The individuals section is very important because it helps a reader to be informed simply about the people that participated in the conflict. It doesn't really matter if thei links don't give too much information about their participation (they do BTW) but they just simply inform people about it, and further research if necessary may give them some results.200.60.106.2 12:31, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A (link in the template to a) <i>category</i> of such people can fulfill that function much better. Reading the conflict and diplomacy articles would give the same (but quicker) result then the "further research" you mentioned. Btw: if I wouldn't obey <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> (which has become a general rule - not only referring to policy preferences), I would just add 30 or 40 (or more) relevant people, simply to make my point. Now, I will just have to wait: gradually people will add their favorite conflict person - and this will give the same result. <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 12:45, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>(1) the other states and governemnts, organizations and former states are important and must remain there because they have been involved in a lower level than the other states in the conflict. `For example, Norway was important laying the Oslo accords, Iran laying a lot of support for resistance movements, Russia providing small military and moral support to nations at war with Israel, the US by supporting Israel, supplying arms and laying many peace accords, the UK for bsically sparking this conflict, Germany for being a mediator in a prisoner exchange, the UN for making all the UNSC resolutions in the 4th column, etc. As you may see, these are very important. (2) Two columns for individuals in unnecessary. They all fit appropriately in one column, and it is in fact slightly smaller than the full participants column. It looks very uneven being split up and an indivuduals 1 and 2 column does not look good. Also, the template width is slightly large with another column. I've seen other templates similar to this one such as the Cold War and War on Terrorism ones and are very similar in width and slightly smaller in length. This template aesthetically is fine. 201.240.163.51 00:33, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(1) (a) The links do not provide an explanation about how these countries were relevant. If such links would exist, I wouldn't object. I don't say these indirectly involved countries weren't important (they were!) - but links to the economy, culture and demographics of a country doesn't add anything which is relevant to this template. An uninformed user of this template doesn't know how these countries were relevant and as such it doesn't add value (or even more: such user can get confused). (b) How these countries <i>were</i> relevant however <i>is</i> dealt with directly (but partially) in the people's collumn (the flags) and indirectly (but completely) in the conflict &amp; diplomacy collumns. (c) This template is getting too big. Much more countries were relevant and important, and adding them all would further bloat this template - but not provide new information. (d) The choice of countries is subjective.</p>
<p>(c) &amp; (d) <b>Algeria</b>n volunteers fought in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and Algeria sent squadrons of fighters and bombers, armored brigades, and dozens of tanks in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. <b>Morocco</b> sent three brigades to the front lines in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, while <b>Libya</b> sent Mirage fighters and gave Egypt around $1 billion to arm for war. <b>Tunisia</b> sent over 1,000 soldiers, who worked with Egyptian forces in the Nile delta, and <b>Sudan</b> sent 3,500 soldiers. <b>Cuba</b> also sent approximately 1,500 troops including tank and helicopter crews who reportedly also engaged in combat operations against the IDF. Also: Tunisia provided shelter for the PLO, which caused Operation Wooden Leg. <b>Iran</b> is also not (anymore/yet) added. <b>Uganda</b> under Idi Amin played an important role also.---<b>These are just some examples.</b> There are many more. Should they all be added? - by providing wikilinks to their countries, not their role? Who decides what countries are/were important enough to be added?</p>
<p>(2) It looks much more prettier. I'm not the only one would finds the old template extremely ugly because it had excessive and unnecessary long collumns.</p>
<p>Btw, 201, I must admit I get annoyed. I don't really know why you make such a huge point out of a minor edit. Normally, one leaves the template/article as it is and then discusses the matter. After a few days of discussion and after reaching a consensus, one can possibly revert it. Its getting very hard to assume good faith because of this, especially considering your earlier (first and multiple) violation of the three-revert-rule, the sudden appearance of sockpuppets, and the fact that you reverted the template again before reaching a consensus. What further bothers me, is that you never check whether there were other edits which were not related to your concerns. Last time, you reverted unquestionable important UNSC resolutions, this time you reverted some small edits which were included in my edit. I would also suggest you register, or log into an extisting account (if any). <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 02:23, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is not a minor edit. The whole template is being reshaped. I say that we leave the template as it is, discuss it, and then change it after reaching a consensus, as you say. I'm not a regular editor of Wikipedia, I'm mostly a reader and make small minor edits as you may seen in my history, so I'm not quite aware of every single little rule in Wikipedia. And I do completely apologize about that incident about the UNSC resolution. I <b>did</b>make a mistake there, and since then I've been closely watching what I revert. I checked what I reverted this time and I did not see any minor edit from you which I reverted.190.40.23.107 04:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The reverted minor edit was that I shortened the 1948 declaration. Oh well, it doesn't really matter. The reshaping <i>is</i> a minor edit as the content is not really altered, only the view, and I never had (until now) an edit conflict/discussion about a new look - and this new look is not even a drastic change as it is quite similar to the previous (only a reshaping of a collumn...). I would also wish to have some response to my arguments. <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 10:17, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>(1) The links to the countries certainly do not necessarily talk about the Arab-Israeli conflict but dempgraphics, geography, etc. However, they are used as reference. If a user wants to know more about any of these coutnries involvement in the conflict, they may do so by clicking in links in the peace declarations or the specific articles about smaller conflicts. And if the template is getting too big, a fifth column would make it even wider! And all those countries you cited did took part of the conflict. But those countries took part in the conflict like, only once or twice, which doesn't make them too important. Most of the countries you cited took part in the 1973 war, and if there was a template for the 1973 war they should definitely be included. On the other hand, states in the Other States and governments section took an important role throughout the whole conflict, from its roots till this day.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>(2) And this is basically personal opinion, I think it looks good, you bad, there isn't much to discuss about it. I agree that the template can be describes as big and making it wider doesn't really help. Plus, templates are at the very bottom of the page, and if someone bothers to scroll down to see the template seeing a long one doesn't really matter. Plus, if people think it is too long, they can click the Hide button and make it vanish. 190.40.23.107 20:27, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>(1)A fifth collumn does not make the template larger as the width remains the same (i.e. 100%) and the length is reduced. I don't see any way how you can claim that it gets larger. Adding links to <i>indirect</i> participants doesn't add anything, while the demographics, geography, etc. of the primary actors however is relevant (for instance: the location of Egypt, or the youth bulge in Lebanon). I don't see how the geography and culture of France (for instance) is relevant to this template. And your last argument makes even less sense: Canada, France, Germany and Norway for instance also played only one or two times a major role. Russia and the EU didn't really play a major role yet, let alone multiple times or let alone "from their roots till this day". I would also like to add that the role of for instance Tunesia is not a one or two time role. And this is the case for many other countries as well.</dd>
<dd>(2) Again, the template doesn't (and cannot) become wider - this is impossible as the template was already put on 100%. What you do have is that collumns take 1/5 instead of 1/4 of this 100%. This however merely condenses information, while at the same time reducing the length (=reducing the overall size). <a href="../../../s/i/j/User%7ESijo_Ripa_7655.html" title="User:Sijo Ripa">Sijo Ripa</a> 03:18, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry, you're right. It doesn't make it wider. But the peace proposal's column would look a little smashed. You're also right about the indirect participants, and I'd be willing to talk with you on removing some unnecessary ones, as well as some individuals. Not many, but some unimportant ones. Would you be willing to discuss that? I agree that some individuals don't ought to be in the individuals column 190.40.23.107 23:59, 16 August 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Please, all you debating whether the people column should remain or whether it and the participants column should be split into even more columns, start your thought process a bit earlier, by asking yourself the purpose of the template, i.e. what people are supposed to use it for.</p>
<p>The purpose of the template should not just be to create a list of everything and everybody closely or remotely involved in the conflict, but to create a convenient way for people to learn more about the conflict. Consequently, every link should enable them to do so. If we look at the current columns, I think we can all agree agree that the links under "Conflicts" and "Diplomacy / Peace proposals" meet this criteria, as these articles deal exclusively with aspects of the conflict. We can probably also all agree that the list of links of primary states and organisations under "Participants" is valid, as the articles about these states and organisations devote a significant amount of space to their involvement in the conflict. However, the list of other states and organisations doesn't meet this requirement, as the linked articles contain very limited or no references to the conflict. The same goes for most links in the "Individuals" column. These articles are biographies, and although a few of them have references to the person's involvement in the conflict, hardly any of them will enhance the readers' knowledge about the conflict. However, all these people are already properly linked in the various articles about the conflict, and in those articles their role is explained. Consequently, I think the whole "Individuals" list should be removed, as these individuals' roles in the conflict is better explained in the articles about the conflict than in their biographies. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Blomberg_de37.html" title="User:Thomas Blomberg">Thomas Blomberg</a> 17:15, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

The above small toolbar leads to full wikipedia pages. Instead, I suggest creating a similar toolbar, but with links only to template pages. Such as this template page:</p>

<p>I love the templates. The more detailed the better. But the long ones should not be on wikipedia pages because they take way too long to load. Especially with all the flag images. And especially for dialup users.</p>
<p>A toolbar that links only to templates would be very useful. That way template indexing can be very detailed, and can go deeper and deeper. Yet the templates would not clutter up individual wikipedia pages. See also the next talk topic section I started below. It shows a problem when trying to put more than one detailed template on a wikipedia page. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 15:30, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is confusing due to the placement of the template title bars and the hide-show buttons. Shouldn't they be completely separate from each other? Otherwise one can't tell which template box is which. The 2 title bars are right on top of each other. But their link boxes are both below both title bars. Very confusing to figure out. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 15:30, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>--<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 23:06, 14 October 2006 (UTC). <b>I absolutely love these type of long template pages:</b></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><b>Category pages do not have the great timelines that the template pages have.</b> Category pages do not have nested topics and sub-topics listed on the same page.</p>
<p>I want the template pages to be bigger, not smaller. But to do so means that these long templates can no longer be at the bottom of already long wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>So for those long wikipedia pages how about this idea for an additional hide-show template toolbar for the Arab-Israeli Conflict? A toolbar that one can add to the bottom of long wikipedia pages without the fear of longer loading times for already long wikipedia articles. Especially for dialup users. I have broadband, and the flag and organization images make even my loading time too long.</p>
<p><b>I suggest for this new toolbar that when one clicks the "show" button that one is sent directly</b> to the <b><a href="../../../a/r/a/Template%7EArab-Israeli_Conflict_d12c.html" title="Template:Arab-Israeli Conflict">Arab-Israeli Conflict template page</a></b>, on a new page, and not at the bottom of the long wikipedia article.</p>
<p><b>The unexpanded toolbar would list all the section and subsection titles:</b></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>States and authorities:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Active organizations
<ul>
<li>Former</li>

<li><b>Conflicts</b></li>
<li><b>Diplomacy / Peace proposals</b></li>
</ul>
<p>---</p>
<p><b>The list of subsections in the unexpanded toolbar</b> would show that this is not your typical category link, and it would entice people to explore the template.</p>
<p><b>The "show" button would open up the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Template%7EArab-Israeli_Conflict_d12c.html" title="Template:Arab-Israeli Conflict">Arab-Israeli Conflict template page</a> on a new page, and not at the bottom of the wikipedia article.</b> --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 23:06, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>--<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 02:23, 15 October 2006 (UTC). <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> said in his October 15, 2006 comment removing the link for the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre of 700 people:</p>
<p>"sabra and shatila wasn't an arab israeli conflict. 1982 lebanon war was and the implications are there..."</p>
<p>I disagree. Please reread the article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Munich Olympics massacre of 11 deservedly rates a link, so does this. Massacres covered in a major way by the international news media deserve a link. Both massacres were critical factors in world opinion about the Arab-Israeli conflict and subsequent events.</p>
<p>I think it makes more sense to put this in this Arab-Israeli Conflict template rather than in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict template:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Israeli-Palestinian_Conflict" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Israeli-Palestinian_Conflict" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Israeli-Palestinian_Conflict</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But I am not wedded to which template it goes in. So I will put it in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict template for now. That template uses the broader section heading "Conflicts / Violence / Terrorism"</p>
<p>Maybe the Arab-Israeli Conflict template could use that section heading instead of just "Conflicts". --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 02:23, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I noticed more discussion in the talk section higher up called "Why not anything about Sabra and Shatila massacre?" One could argue about all the players involved in the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and the degree of Israeli involvement. But my point in this section is that the event was and remains significant in worldwide public opinion, and therefore deserves to be on one or both of the templates. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 02:43, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The dispute is not my point. My point is that it is "violence" concerning Palestinians and Israelis. And therefore it currently qualifies under the section heading "Conflicts / Violence / Terrorism" in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict template. There is no dispute that the massacre occurred for 36 hours while the Palestinian refugee camps were surrounded by Israeli forces. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimeshifter_97a3.html" title="User:Timeshifter">Timeshifter</a> 02:53, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Obviously Israeli forces were in LEBANON, but it's a bit too much to ask Israeli Army to actively defend the Palestinians IMO.

<p>What is the source of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad flag that appears in the template? I'm not even sure they have a flag. They have an emblem, which is not white on black. I saw once a white-on-black flag similar to the one in the template being flown in a rally, but how do we know that this is their official flag? Their website shows the regular Palestinian flag. Anyway, the full resolution flag from this template has nonsense scribbles instead of the inscription that their emblem has.--128.139.226.36 09:50, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
