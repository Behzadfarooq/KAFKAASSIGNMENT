<p>I have to thank the anonymous authors who keep reverting the articles back to the referenced version despite persistent vandalisms by certain other authors. For the latter, the following applies as much now as it did when it was originally posted:</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EArain_ef61.html" title="Edit section: A bunch of fools">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A bunch of fools</span></h2>
<p>This has got to be the silliest article on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Instead of using the maxim that without specific, definite proof, the most obvious answer is the most probable candidate for the facts, the article is filled full of ultra-Pakistani/Muslim nativist posturing. A case in point is the origin issue. If no one can come up with a single (non-internet non-partisan) scholarly reference (it needn't even be an English reference) towards the Semitic claim, Occam's Razor dictates that the Aryan origin hypothesis should be cited as the most probable one. Anything else is just vanity. It would be as if present day (white) Christian Europeans claimed descent from Jesus' mainly Jewish disciples on the grounds that "We're Christian, they were Christian too. We don't want to have pagan ancestors and would prefer to preen ourselves as having Christian ancestors.". Today's Arain therefore seem to feel a misplaced sense of rage, shame, guilt, etc. at the wholly sensible deduction that Arain antecedents were almost certainly descended from Buddhists and Hindus.</p>
<p>And non-English speakers should probably be banned from editing the article too. The depth of ignorance in spelling, grammar and style, not to mention facts, is beyond belief. Don't these posters have a sense of shame for publicly advertising their stupidity? Obviously, lucid academic thought is alien to the multitudes which have succeeded in making this article a testament to immaturity and downright silliness.</p>

<p>The land of the five rivers was known as panchanad in the ancient period, and as Punjab in the medieval period. Punjabiyat is a recent concept, but the regional identity denoted by it has long been shaped by language, territory, literary and folk traditions, classical and folk art forms including the vigorous bhangra, cuisine, dress including headgear and so on. Punjab has witnessed far reaching ethnographic changes since the last ethnographic accounts were written. Partition entailed immigration of populations of the Hindus and Sikhs. The reorganization of the Punjabi Suba led to the rise of the Sikhs as the dominant community. Of the ninety-five communities studied under the People of India project in Punjab the Scheduled Castes form a major chunk. The state is divided into three distinct eco-cultural zones, defined by the dialects of Punjabi language. <b>While Punjabi is the most widely spoken language, followed by Hindi, sixteen other languages are also spoken by local communities and immigrants, all belonging to the Indo-Aryan family.</b></p>
<p>This paragrph does not say all these groups belong to Indo-Aryans family. Explain where does it say Arain belong to Indo-Aryan family?</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're absolutely right. I made a mistake and misread the Indo-Aryan as referring to the ethnic groups rather than the languages of the Punjab. I've re-used a cut-down version of the reference for further support that the Arain are a group in the Punjab: all mention of Indo-Aryan is now excised.<br />

<p><i>Arain's also claim to be descendents of the Aryan race. Some Arain’s are born with blonde hair and some with blue eyes; Aryans are the Indic subgroup of the Indo-Iranian branch.</i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this needs at least on reference and general clean up. Some points to consider:</p>
<p>- The concept of an "Aryan race" us a little shadowy and vague. Whilst it is undoubted that many groups were (and are) Aryan, whether this constitutes a (strictly) racial classification is under heated debate.<br />
- The Arain are not the only caste descended from the ancient population of the Punjab/India. The other neighbouring tribes are equally of "Aryan descent".<br />
- The bit about the Indo-Iranian Indic branch is the modern parlance for Aryan, and probably true. It still needs references though.</p>
<p>Speaking personally, I have seen undoubted cases of Arain with blond to brown to red hair, blue eyes, etc., however, this does not constitute a <i>verifiable reference</i> as is needed here, so there is no point in mentioning it. Until such references are found, we cannot state this as fact in the article. Please do see if you can dig up at least one reference and post it here on the talk page for discussion before editing the article directly with non-referenced statements.</p>

<p>Again the referenced study does not say that it "does not amount to a significant statistical difference such as would allow the Arain to claim different or unique ancestry". In fact there is a significant statistical difference that exists, hence the study mentions it. I quote the study "There is no statistically significant difference of ABO and Rh-D distribution among various ethnic groups,......<i>except in Arains</i> where B is the most common and O is less common." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.115.70.9_2f4b.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.115.70.9">193.115.70.9</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.115.70.9.html" title="User talk:193.115.70.9">talk</a>) 13:56, 12 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I have a bone to pick here. The quote obviously shows that the statistical difference is not <b>significant</b>. This term is not semantic, it is <i>quantitative</i>, with reference to percentiles in the jargon of statistical analysis (see <i>confidence intervals</i> and <i>significance</i> in stats discussion). So whilst the difference is noted, it is also noted that it simply isn't enough to (yet) differentiate the Arain significantly from their peers in the Punjab.<br />

<dd>The quote says that the statistical difference is not significant, <b>except</b> for Arains. It is also not enough to say that there isn't a difference, i.e. more research is needed, so we cannot say either way. hence my wording which does not make it a definite proof. 193.115.70.9 17:34, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lack of significant proof doesn't mean the Arain <i>aren't</i> different! They may well be different, it just means the study is unable to prove it conclusively: surely this point stands since statistical analysis for testing any quantity can have three possible "answers": a positive, a negative and a "not enough information for positive proof". It is the last of these which I'm advocating in accordance with the reference: I'm certainly not arguing for the negative result!<br />

<dd>OK I agree, but the current wording says "<i>However, this does not amount to a significant statistical difference</i>" however the study does make a statitical difference between Arains and others by at least 10% in blood groups O &amp; B. So although the study findings DO amount to a statistical difference of at least 10%, the study alone is not enough to prove the case, so wording like <i>However this study alone does not prove that Arains originate from Arabs, the study concludes that "Further ethnic based studies are required to confirm" <a href="http://www.pjms.com.pk/issues/janmar05/article/article6.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pjms.com.pk/issues/janmar05/article/article6.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></i> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.115.70.9_2f4b.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.115.70.9">193.115.70.9</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.115.70.9.html" title="User talk:193.115.70.9">talk</a>) 17:57, 12 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I've made changes which I hope accommodate the points you've brought up. I still think there's a little bit of ambiguity in the phrasing from that report: does the word "except" refer to Arain having group B blood, or to the significance? Either way, it's written as significant for now in the article.<br />

<p>Generally, I'm going to refrain from blindly editing your edits since you seem more concerned with improving the article than inventing poorly constructed fantasies using even poorer English, unlike many of the other posters. I am sure we can use this space to discuss changes and revisions in a civilised fashion before committing them after reaching consensus. What do you say? No more edits unless they've been discussed here?</p>

<p>The level of general knowledge lacking in lamentable. When a contention arises due to differing opinions, that is normal and healthy. Where there is disagreement solely due to one of the interlocutors not realising the meaning of a word or term, then it is a case of the immovable rock of knowledge facing the obstinate wind of ignorance. To wit, let us deal with the prickly issue at hand: market gardening. Strictly speaking, we do not need a reference for this due to what market gardening actually means: making it axiomatic that most farmers are, by definition, market gardeners.</p>
<p>Market gardening means to grow crops for sale upon the market. The opposite of market gardening in subsistence farming where crops are grown solely for self-consumption. Needless to say that subsistence farming does not occur in all but the most primitive of societies or where political and economic order have severely broken down. This has not been the case in the Punjab for centuries if not millenia: the Punjab is one of the oldest centres of civilisation and, more pertinently, trade. Farmers in the Punjab have therefore always grown their crop as cash-crops, not food-crops. They are therefore firmly in the category of market-gardeners, and have been for centuries. Including the period when Kipling's Kim is set, which, as it happens, accurately describes this profession.</p>
<p>To assert otherwise is to relegate the Arain to be, out of all the other farmers in the Punjab, the only ones incapable of earning money from their land. Indeed it speaks of a remarkably low opinion of the Arain: opining them to be the only primitive farmers amidst the other farmers of the Punjab who are udoubtedly market gardeners. Unless denigrating the Arain in this way was your intention, you'll quote a reference which states categorically that Arain were <i>not</i> market gardeners. Otherwise, the very definition of the term demands their classification as such.</p>

<dd>This is definition of market gardening<br />
<br />
In agriculture, market gardening is the relatively small-scale production of fruits, vegetables and flowers as cash crops, frequently sold directly to consumers and restaurants.<br />
<br />
First thing fruits, vegetables and flowers are not the only thing Arain grow, They grow all kind of crops other farmers of Punjab like Jat, Gujar etc do. Second thing based on the definition of market gardening farmers directly sell it to consumers that not what Arain do. That is why I am emphasising on fresh reference. small landowners statement also need fresh reference because things have been changed a lot after 1900.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</dd>

Sorry, that doesn't cut the mustard. Apart from proving that your familiarity with the English language leaves you in no position to emphasise the subtleties of phrasing, you've proved nothing as regards the market gardening claim. Not to mention that you've misunderstood the sentence entirely, it provides information as to the traditional vocation, not what the Arain are up to these days (quite obviously, a number now exist in all fields: business, medicine, academia, etc.). So the criticism that the sentence is outdated is an oxymoron: the sentence naver aimed to decribe the diverse state of the Arain community in this day and age. Nor is anyone reading the article silly enough to conflate a singular manifestation of the Arain in colonial literature with an entire caste, in those times or these. The vast majority of the Arain do not have land that even begins to approach the size needed for heavily industrialised farming. Your comments are doubtless well meant, but either back up your claims with explicit references on the market gardening front, or accept that the Kim reference stays.<br />

<p>The reference for this says <i>"Behind them an angry farmer brandished a bamboo pole.

It does <i>NOT</i> say thats arains are chiefly associated with market gardening. This is like showing a report that said General Zia-ul-haq was an arain, and therefore claiming that Arains are chiefly associated with the military.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're entirely correct: the reference doesn't lead to the sentence. In retrospect, I can see that the sentence was written with a certain perception of the Arain already in mind. However, let us use logic instead of the reference. We can divide all farmers into, roughly, a heirarchy of three layers. At the most basic, we have subsistence farmers, growing food crops. Then we have market gardeners growing cash crops. Then we have highly industrialised farmers, often with huge holdings, also growing cash crops. The Arain only fit into the middle category, as do the vast majority of all farmers from all castes in the Punjab. So I contend that the assertion is correct, albeit not <i>wholly</i> supported by the reference.<br />

<p>Mian Sir Muhammad Shah Nawaz, a prominent and influential politician of Punjab in the 1920s: <b>Please provide the exact quote.</b><br />
<br /></p>
<p>Mian Iftikharuddin , a prominent politician, who sat on the opposition benches most of his life.

<dd>I think this is the result of maybe an unavoidable error. You see: I've got the page of that book open in front of me now, and it just doesn't contain those lines! On the version I have access to, it says "...springboard into politics. Mian Fazli Husain, the first chief minister...". You see, those two names just aren't mentioned in this version <b>at all</b>! Which is why I excised the stuff from the article. However, you seem to be showing a definitive quote which has two additional people mentioned. Is there a url where I can refer to this version to corroborate?<br />

<dd>Here is the information you requested</dd>
</dl>
<p>Many Arain families flourished as urbanization increased the value of their land, and they put this new wealth to good use. According to a Pakistani anthropologist, the Arain "has little of the elegance and polish of the traditional feudal landlords of the Punjab, Noons and Tiwanas, of Rajput origin. Afternoon tea parties, partridge shoots, or polo are not associated with Arains. Nor does he waste his energies on dancing girls, or drunken evenings listening to poetry, or numerous marriages, a pastime of the landed gentry through which they alienated their lands." 9 Instead, the Arain families put their money into education and reaped quick rewards. Soon they were to dominate the legal profession among the urban Muslims of Punjab, and a number of them used law as a springboard to politics. Mian Sir Muhammad Shah Nawaz, a prominent and influential politician of Punjab in the 1920s, was an Arain as was Mian Iftikharuddin, who was to play an important role in turning the Muslim community of urban Punjab toward favoring an independent Pakistan. Some Arains went into the civil service. Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, the senior most civil servant to opt for service in Pakistan, was an Arain from Jullundur.

<p><br />
Behind them an angry farmer brandished a bamboo pole. He was <b>a market-gardener, Arain by caste</b>, growing vegetables and flowers for Umballa city, and well Kim knew the breed.</p>
<p>'Such an one,' said the lama, disregarding the dogs, 'is impolite to strangers, intemperate of speech and uncharitable. Be warned by his demeanour, my disciple.'</p>
<p>'Ho, shameless beggars!' shouted the farmer. 'Begone! Get hence!'</p>
<p>'We go,' the lama returned, with quiet dignity. 'We go from these unblessed fields.'</p>
<p>'Ah,' said Kim, sucking in his breath. 'If the next crops fail, thou canst only blame thine own tongue.'</p>
<p>The man shuffled uneasily in his slippers. 'The land is full of beggars,' he began, half apologetically.</p>
<p>'And by what sign didst thou know that we would beg from thee, O Mali?' said Kim tartly, using the name that a market-gardener least likes. 'All we sought was to look at that river beyond the field there.'</p>
<p>'River, forsooth!' the man snorted. 'What city do ye hail from not to know a canal-cut? It runs as straight as an arrow ' and I pay for the water as though it were molten silver. There is a branch of a river beyond. But if ye need water I can give that - and milk.'</p>
<p>'Nay, we will go to the river,' said the lama, striding out.</p>
<p>'Milk and a meal.' the man stammered, as he looked at the strange tall figure. 'I - I would not draw evil upon myself - or my crops. But beggars are so many in these hard days.'</p>
<p>'Take notice.' The lama turned to Kim. 'He was led to speak harshly by the Red Mist of anger. That clearing from his eyes, he becomes courteous and of an affable heart. May his fields be blessed! Beware not to judge men too hastily, O farmer.'</p>
<p>'I have met holy ones who would have cursed thee from hearthstone to byre,' said Kim to the abashed man. 'Is he not wise and holy? I am his disciple.'</p>
<p>He cocked his nose in the air loftily and stepped across the narrow field-borders with great dignity.</p>
<p>'There is no pride,' said the lama, after a pause, 'there is no pride among such as follow the Middle Way.'</p>
<p>'But thou hast said he was low-caste and discourteous.'</p>
<p>'<b>Low-caste I did not say, for how can that be which is not?</b> Afterwards he amended his discourtesy, and I forgot the offence. Moreover, he is as we are, bound upon the Wheel of Things; but he does not tread the way of deliverance.' He halted at a little runlet among the fields, and considered the hoof-pitted bank.</p>

<p>For a while after completing his education, Bulleh Shah taught at the same mosque. He then became a murid of Inayat Shah Qadri, a famous saint of Qadirya school of sufis in Lahore, who belonged to the Arain caste. Bulleh Shah had to face the resentment and taunts of his family and other Syed friends for accepting the spiritual guidance of a non-Syed. The poetic response from Bulleh Shah rejected his critics' false concept of inherent superiority and nobility of any caste and set the pattern of his lifelong challenge to accepted norms:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Those who call me Syed Are destined to hell made for them. Those who call me Arain Have the swings of heaven laid for them. The low-caste and the high-caste, Are created by God who is all-powerful; He casts away the fair ones, And clasps to His heart the meritless ones.</p>
<p>In 1729 when Shah Inayat died, Bulleh Shah succeeded him as the head of his monastery at Lahore. Bulleh Shah died in 1758. He never married.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It is pretty easy to find what Arain are: <a href="https://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/index.html" class="external free" title="https://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/index.html" rel="nofollow">https://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/index.html</a></p>
<p><b>In india there are four classes of muslims:</b> Syed: Decendants of Prophet Muhammad</p>
<p>Shaikh: Decendants of Arab merchants who settled in india</p>
<p>Pathans: Decendants of Pustuns</p>
<p>Ohters: All others are the converts from the indigenous people to islam.</p>
<p><b>Arians have two branches one is Hindu and the others are converts from Hindus to Islam</b>.</p>
<p><b>Arain Caste</b></p>
<p>If Arain were a tribe as the article claims, the Paksitani government forms would not have classified Arain as a caste, just as the Indian Govt clasified Arain as a hindo caste. There is a vast difference between a caste which is based on Hindo caste system and a tribe. The arain caste is the caste of vegetable growers. I hope someone will correc this.</p>
<p><b>Arain Caste</b> Kamboh-- The Kamboh is one of the finest cultivating castes in the Punjab.They are found in the upper Sutlej valley as low down as montgomery,throughout the northern portion of the eastern plains,and as low don the Jumna valley as Karnal.They are especially numerous in Kapurthala...</p>
<p>p.443</p>
<p>They claim descent from Raja Karan,and say that their ancestor fled to Kashmir.The Kamobhs of Bijnor also trace their origin to the trans-indus country,and Mr. Purser accepts this tradition as evidently true.They are said by some to be ancient inhabitants of Persia.Arains and Kambohs are commonly supposed to be closely related:indeed in Montgomery a man appears to be called Arain if he is Musalman and Kamboh if he is Hindu.But that this is not always the case is evident from the fact of a very considerable proportion of the Kambohs of Amritsar,Lahore,Ferozpur,Patiala,Nabha,and Maler kotla having returned themselves as Musalmans,although Musalman Arains are also numerous in these tracts.In Jullunder the village of Bhalowal is owned partly by Kambohs and partly by Arains,both being Musalmans.It is perhaps dountful whether the supposed relationship has any further basis than the fact that they both came from the west,and are both of much the same social standing and agricultural repute.It is highly probable that the nucleus of the Arain caste was a group of Hindu Kambohs converted to Islam.Thus in Jullunder the Gaure,Hande and momi clans are found in both castes,and in Montgomery several of their clan names are identical.It is said by some that the chief distinction is that the Kamboh take money for their daughters,while the Arains do not.But the social standing of the Kamboh is on the whole superior to that of the Arain and very markedly so where the latter is a vegetable -grower.The Kamobh moverover, is not a mere agriculturist.He not infrequently engages in trade,and even takes service in the army or in offices or even as a private servant,while his wife not infrequently lends money even where he is a mere husbandman;and under Akabar a Kamboh general called Shahbaz Khan commanded 5000 men and distinguished himself greatly in BengalMuslim Kambohs held Sohna in Gurgon some centuries ago;and the tombs and Mosques that they have left show that they must have enjoyed a considerable position.The military,mercantile,and clerkly Kamboh are said to be distinguished as Qalmi or 'men of the pen' and not to intermarry with the agricultural or Khaki section of the caste.The Kamboh do not seem to bear as high a character for honesty as they do for skill.There is a Persian proverb current in the united Provinces:"The Afghans,the kambohs,and the Kashmiris;all three are roughes(badzat)"..The Kambohs are said to be exceptionally numerous in Meerut.Their location under the hills lends some slight support to their tradition of origin from Kashmir...</p>

<p>Now lack of awareness of your literary standards abounds, but it is certain that comments such as "So and so is wrong", without providing multiple references to back up the point, are entirely worthless and cannot be considered. You may well be correct in your assertions, but why not post the necessary references here on the talk page before such brutal vandalism?</p>

<dd>For Kneelasher,<br />
<br />
The psuedonym you have chosen is quite "revealing". Personally I would have expected a proper name to communicate with someone teaching others about the rules of reference and how to write English and so on. Talking to a phantom is hardly a good way of making scientific assertions. But let me return to substantive matters with regard to what I wrote on the Arain:<br />
<br />
Mian Sir Muhammad Shafi of Baghbanpura, Lahore, was a leader of the Muslim League in the 1920s.<br />
<br />
(Mian Sir Fazli Husain, the first Chief Minister of the Punjab was not an Arain. He was a Rajput. Burki is wrong)<br />
<br />
(Mian Amiruddin, mayor of <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahore.html" title="Lahore">Lahore</a> at the time of the Partition of India was a Kashmiri and not an Arain,Burki is wrong).<br />
<br />
Forget my literary standards for the moment although I have written three books and have been writing a weekly column since May 2002, first in Daily Times and now in the News International. What sort of reference would you want to establish the authenticity of a certain information? Suppose someone publishes a book but it has incorrect information. what would you do in that case? With regard to the items given above let me say the following:<br />
1. About Sir Muhammad Shafi and his daughter Begum Shah Nawaz you can read their family history in the book by Begum Shah Nawaz, "Father and Daughter: A Political Biography" Karachi: Oxford University Press, 2002.<br />
2. About Sir Fazli Hussain, just google on "Sir Fazli Hussain" and you will find Khaled Ahmed's article in Daily Times. I have also interviewed his son Ashiq Hussain and anyone who knows anything about politics knows that Mian Sir Fazli Hussain was a Bhatti Rajput.<br />
3. About Mian Amiruddin I don't have any article to present but his son Mian Salauddin married Alama Iqbal's daughter and they have a son Yusaf Salauddin. The Mians of Barood Khana inside the Walled city of Lahore are Kashmiris.<br />

<dd>Common knowledge is not equivalent to a reference, despite its pervasiveness. And your three published books count for nothing in this arena since published work is no prerequisite for unbiased writing, even if it is in the same field. As for wrong information in a book, you'd better provide one or two countervailing references to rebut possible errors: your word is not enough.<br />
<br />
You seem to be providing bona fide sources for the additions you are proposing though: so why not actually do the work and cite all the links instead of asking to be believed on faith in your integrity?<br />

And jump up and down and gibber with rage mayhap? This is exactly the type of childish silly behaviour which ensures this article needs constant vigilance. If the reference exists, then it is valid to use it. If it is by I A Lahori, then I would exhort I A Lahori to make contributions of a similar nature to the article, duly referenced of course.<br />

<dl>
<dd>Point taken. That sentence could be omitted, but there is a caveat. The Arabs are noted for their passion (bordering on the extreme) for genealogy (Philip K Hitti, <i>History of the Arabs</i>, 10th ed.). Afghans settled in South Asia for well over a thousand years are still acknowledged as "Arabs" (i.e., of Arabic descent) by both the Arabs and the Afghans (cf, Idries Shah's biographical details). What the Arabs think therefore carries some weight, hence the statement is likewise not uninformed as it might otherwise appear.<br />

<dl>
<dd>Yes the arabs WERE noted for the passion of geneology, not anymore, especially since Islam became ingrained in the arab mindset which forbade exreme tribalism. I can confirm with you that Arabs do not consider Afgans as Arabs, Afghanisatn is not part of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_league.html" title="Arab league">arab league</a>, nor do they speak arabic, the main qualification. Also Afghans do not consider themselves <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a>, rather the pashtun oral traditions hold the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_Pashtun_descent_from_Israelites_0ccf.html" title="Theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites">Theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites</a> of the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Ten_Tribes_626e.html" title="Lost Ten Tribes">Lost Ten Tribes</a> of Isreal, who converted to Islam. There is nothing in the reference to that says anything about what the Arabs think about Arain, it is also an untrue Pakistani stereotype of Arabs, based on the poor experiences of Pakistanis in the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalij.html" title="Khalij">khalij</a> or gulf area. Pakistanis would be well informed if they acknowledged that any ill-treatment of them by <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khaliji.html" title="Khaliji">Khalijis</a> is not against Pakistanis but also of non-gulf arabs such as <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian.html" title="Egyptian">Egyptian</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moroccan.html" title="Moroccan">Moroccan</a> and <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemeni.html" title="Yemeni">Yemeni</a> arabs.

<dd>You've grasped the wrong end of the stick here: the Afghan tradition that they are of Arab descent is a can of worms I don't even want to touch. My point was about one famous half-Afghan who was known to be of Arabic (the Prophet's own lineage) descent and treated accordingly by both Afghans and Arabs. However, that doesn't detract from your main point. I'll excise the POV based reference accordingly.<br />

<p>"Two main Rajput tribes of Sind are: the Samma, a branch of the Yadav Rajputs who inhabit the eastern and lower Sind and Bahawalpur; and the Sumra who, according to the 1907 edition of the Gazetteer are a branch of the Parwar Rajputs. Among others are the <b>Bhuttos</b>, Bhattis, Lakha, Sahetas, Lohanas, Mohano, Dahars, Indhar, Chachar, Dhareja, Rathors, Dakhan, Langah etc." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKneeslasher_ae70.html" title="User:Kneeslasher">Kneeslasher</a> (<a href="../../../k/n/e/User_talk%7EKneeslasher_01e0.html" title="User talk:Kneeslasher">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kneeslasher_23df.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kneeslasher">contribs</a>) 17:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I don't want to get into personal spat over this with everybody, I'm just trying to make sure the info reflected on this page is accurate.</p>
<p>As the "Origin" section currently states, "The Arain, despite being majority Muslim, do have Sikh and Hindu members[12], as do the other agricultural castes of the Punjab (the Jats, Gujjars and Rajputs)[13]. The Arab origin claim can therefore be largely viewed as a desire for claiming an unbroken practise of Islam through the ages, for current prestige rather than accurate genealogical designation[14]."</p>
<p>This is misleading, as it attempts to reach a conclusion ("therefore...") from a misleading premise, namely the inference that there is no significant difference between the Arain, Jats, Gujjars, and Rajputs when it comes to the proportion of Muslims in each of the castes.</p>
<p>As the referenced website (Joshua Project, which was originally cited in support of this mistaken premise) actually reveals if you bother to look at the data there, the Arains are 97% Muslim, the Jats are 53% Muslim, the Gujjars are 55% Muslim, and the Rajputs are 31% Muslim. If anyone disputes these numbers, please provide an alternative source.</p>
<p>If there is no dispute over these numbers, then it is clear that the conclusion drawn above is unsupported by these statistics, and the Arain, like it or not, are <i>significantly</i> distinct in their religious makeup from these other castes, a fact which can be explained in various ways, but which <i>cannot</i> simply be explained away by saying, "They're pretty much similar to the other agricultural castes and the Arab origin claim must be a lie."</p>
<p>The Arab origin claim may be circumstantial, but it is certainly <b>not</b> contradicted by the data cited here.</p>
<p>I welcome discussion about this point.</p>
