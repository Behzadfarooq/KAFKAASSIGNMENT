<p>Hi, I hope I didn't mess anything up on WP:CfD. I had answered Netoholic's call for help on WP:TfD, and some of the templates there had associated categories which I needed to get rid of, and when I came over to CfD to do them I saw how much of a backlog there was, so I set to and tried to clear some of it. I do hope I didn't do anything that messed anything up, and that what I did was helpful. I mostly just deleted entries where someone else (you, often) had already deleted the category, and ones where the categories were already empty and there was no dissent on ditching the category. Still, I think that managed to get the page size down a fair amount. Do let me know if you don't need any assistance, or if I'm doing anything wrong. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 03:09, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: I don't usually check other User_talk: pages (so that I don't have to monitor a whole long list of User_Talk: pages - one for each person with whom I am having a "conversation"), so please leave any messages for me on my talk page (above); if you leave a message for me here I probably will not see it. I know not everyone uses this style (they would rather keep all the text of a thread in one place), but I simply can't monitor all the User_talk: pages I leave messages on. Thanks!</p>

<p>Dear aranel, I wonder why <b>Category:Long Hair people</b> should be deleted. I agree it's stupid, but it is nice to take a special note on people with long hair. People like Diane Witt, <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Gayle_654d.html" title="Crystal Gayle">Crystal Gayle</a> etc have long hair should be noted. Others says it is useless. Do you think that creating a page List of people famous for their hair is viable.</p>

<p>Thanks for what should be a good change on the Lamb Chop thing.

<p>Hi Aranel - I got up this morning thinking "only five more subcategories of geo-stub, and that will get it to a workable level". Imagine my surprise to discover two of the five had been done! FWIW, I was planning to put separate categories for all those countries with over 40 geo-stubs in the big <a href="../../../g/e/o/Category%7EGeography_stubs_7ab2.html" title="Category:Geography stubs">Category:Geography stubs</a>, and there are now only three left that have that many - Philippines, Serbia/Montenegro, and Thailand. If you think that any other countries should have separate categories, feel free, but I don't see the point of having separate categories if there are too few articles (the two Liechtenstein geo-stubs won't get a separate category!). Anyway, thanks for putting in Greece and Switzerland, and let me know whether you think the subdividing's gone far enough. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 02:33, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh. Sounds like me - compulsive organiser <i>sometimes</i>. My "secret" is that when I started I painstakingly went through all the geostubs and made a spreadsheet of name and country - that's how I knew which countries had over 40 stubs. Every couple of days I compare it with the category to see what new ones have turned up. For the record, other than Serbia-Montenegro, Philippines and Thailand there are a handful of countries with 30 or more (mainly eastern European ones - Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, and the like). Just seemed to me that 4200 geo-stubs was too many for anyone to look through to see what articles from a particular country needed work. The number of un-sub-categorised geostubs is down to about 1000 now... <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 02:44, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I considered, i think, all of those 5 changes, leaving them general in the belief that both fiction and non-fiction can qualify -- e.g. two of my favorites are <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_O%27Brian_d714.html" title="Patrick O'Brian">Patrick O'Brian</a> and <a href="../../../w/2E/e/W.E.B._Griffin_8b7d.html" title="W.E.B. Griffin">W.E.B. Griffin</a>, both primarily novelists.</p>
<p>At the <i>very</i> least i think you need to add descriptions to the Cats making clear what the Cat-titles do not; i expect many will consider you obligated to check each item to confirm their work includes the one you have assumed.</p>
<p>But my opinion is that you're just wrong. If it's worth being specific, the title should show it. It may be that mil fic, e.g., is too small for a cat, but that would be reason for creating Category:Military-nonfiction writers and deleting <a href="../../../m/i/l/Category%7EMilitary_writers_89d0.html" title="Category:Military writers">Category:Military writers</a> rather than misusing the existing cat.<br />

<p>While i don't have a list of your changes in front of me, i don't think i meant to include Category:Romance writers, about which we probably agree.</p>
<p>I don't doubt your characterization of them as a "horrible mess", tho i haven't looked lately. When i worked on it, IIRC, <a href="../../../w/r/i/Category%7EWriters_3d94.html" title="Category:Writers">Category:Writers</a> was a horrible mess, and IIRC i created or reworked many of its subcats, not believing i had or could eliminate it, but believing segregating it into smaller, more homogeneous messes was an improvement and a platform from which others could tackle smaller messes. (At that time, my main interest among Cats was getting articles and Cats out of <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a>; i think for instance that i moved <a href="../../../e/d/i/Category%7EEditors_4426.html" title="Category:Editors">Category:Editors</a> into <a href="../../../w/r/i/Category%7EWriters_3d94.html" title="Category:Writers">Category:Writers</a> (whether or not it has stayed there), and IIRC, at one point i had reduced <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_4ca7.html" title="Category:People">Category:People</a> from something like 140 subcats to more like 70. (This claim would be very laborious to document, so you don't have to take it seriously!)</p>
<p>I hope we are being careful enough about Cat names, BTW, that we do not useCategory:Military fiction writers (which should include soldiers who write romance novels) as opposed to what we are talking about Category:Military-fiction writers i.e., writers of military fiction.</p>
<p>I gotta run, probably more later.<br />

<p>These are turning into too many secondary issues for me to discuss exhaustively, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>You suggest at least rhetorically
<dl>
<dd>The alternative, of course, would be to get rid of the fiction and non-fiction subcategories and throw in the lot of them together.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To agree with that means admitting i was wrong in creating <a href="../../../w/r/i/Category%7EWriters_by_fiction_subject_area_fdb4.html" title="Category:Writers by fiction subject area">Category:Writers by fiction subject area</a> and <a href="../../../w/r/i/Category%7EWriters_by_non-fiction_subject_area_1d35.html" title="Category:Writers by non-fiction subject area">Category:Writers by non-fiction subject area</a>, but on reflection i suspect that is a good idea for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>It does not dramatically reduce the size of the categories needed: most subject areas have both fiction and non-fiction subdivisions, so that each of those two Cats is likely to be nearly as large as their common parent</li>
<li>Their own subdivisions don't do a particularly better job of categorizing than the corresponding undivided subject-area categories. The rule "write about what you know" means that many military-fiction writers are military-history and/or military-policy writers, and so on; as a result, the main effect of having both fiction and non-fiction sub-cats of a subject area is to require many or most authors in that area to have two tags rather than one. (Remember that these are categories of people, not of works, so the corresponding argument does not apply in that other realm.)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Don't worry about "what is meant by the category", what it "<i>is</i> being used for", or "what was going into them", and don't be surprised that this relatively new Cat structure still needs a <i>lot</i> of work (as perhaps best shown by the very active <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECfD_3468.html" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a> page). I for one often put articles in Cats by saying, e.g., "well, there should be a <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman-language_operas_714a.html" title="Category:German-language operas">Category:German-language operas</a>"; if the preview shows it in blue, i save without further research; if red, i may just strip it back to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Category%7EOperas_d24f.html" title="Category:Operas">Category:operas</a>, make sure <i>that</i> is blue, and save it with that tag. This is useful (in contrast to creating red-link tags) because it draws the article to the attention of people who are specializing in subdividing operas, and people who are specializing in correcting bad assignments to opera-related categories. (Better that something belonging in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Category%7EOperas_d24f.html" title="Category:Operas">Category:Operas</a> goes into <a href="../../../o/p/e/Category%7EOpera_5482.html" title="Category:Opera">Category:Opera</a> than having it stay untagged: bad tags attract eyeballs; nonexistant tags do nothing.) You can't assume the articles in a Cat reveal anything beyond common mistakes. The text of the cat (its description) is a better indication of what the Cat creator had in mind, but in any case, work out what kind of subdivisions <i>should</i> exist, and fix the names and descriptions as needed to produce them, then find better places for things that don't belong in those good categories, and things that are in categories that shouldn't exist.</li>
<li>You say "Consistency may be less important than clarity". Well, yeah, but what we should be discussing is how to <i>achieve</i> clarity, and consistency is an important aspect of that: consistency often makes editors clearer about what categories can be expected to exist, and thus about how to accurately assign articles to categories that they have not paid previous attention to.</li>
<li>If you really doubt that "science-fiction writers" is grammatically permissible, you will waste a lot of your colleagues' time if you fail to learn more about English grammar and style.</li>

<p>The idea behind this is not to overly clutter TFD and CFD with the votes, and allow the deletion of both on just one deletion page. Are there any improvements do you think I can make that will change your decision?

<dd>I don't have anything in particular against the policy, I just don't think that there needs to <i>be</i> a policy. The current deletion system is already complicated enough! (Also, I think we need to put some more thought into whether deletions should be listed first as templates or as categories. If just the category is listed, it's possible that many people using the template will never notice.) In general, I think we need to make the deletion policy less complicated, not <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:Instruction_creep">more complicated</a>. Any policy that goes above the bare minimum (i.e. specifying whether to list a stub template for deletion as a template, as a category, or both) is more complicated than we seem to need, currently.</dd>
<dd>There really is not any difference between a stub template and and any other template with an attached category. (We may actually need a policy to handle those, though. It's occasionally somewhat confusing when one of them comes up for deletion. On the other hand, they come up for deletion quite rarely.) In addition, I see no reason why stubs should be treated differently from anything else that is associated with a project. I just don't think a complicated policy is necessary here. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 01:09, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The big problem with deleting a stub template is that, when the template is no longer in use, it is common for the template to be removed entirely. Granted, common sense says to place the original stub template back into place, however, this is not always the case. Actually, I was trying to specify in the policy that if you list a stub template for deletion on TFD and it passes, the category along with the template should be deleted. Likewise for a stub category on CFD. To add everything to this, I wished for the project to have the power of their own voting process to remove stub templates without the need to bother TFD and CFD. I feel that if the project is primarily responsible for creating them, they should be the ones maintaining and destroying them. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 01:15, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the project were to decide that a template should be deleted and then list it for deletion, chances are extremely good that it would end up being deleted without any problem. Non-controversial nominations for deletion do not create an appreciable amount of extra work. (Unless the template has to be removed from, say, three hundred articles by hand. In which case it's going to be a lot of work anyway.) I'm afraid that if we say that the stub sorting project has the authority to have templates deleted, it will open the door for other projects to short-circuit the deletion process. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 01:21, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the pub-stub template probably should have been deleted--it's possible that if it were nominated now it <i>would</i> be deleted. At the time, stub sorting was much less well-organized. However, if an article, template, or category cannot get through deletion on its appropriate page, then <i>it shouldn't be deleted</i>, period. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 01:37, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we add an offifical policy about deleting stub templates and categories, I'm afraid that it will actually bog down the deletion process rather than freeing it up. In general, I feel that we should avoid further complicating the deletion process unless we absolutely have to add somethign to it.</dd>
<dd>I like the idea of having a discussion on the project page and then copying it over to TfD or CfD. Is there any particular reason why we <i>couldn't</i> do that under the existing policy (i.e. is it explicitly or implicitly forbidden)? If I were looking at a category deletion discussion and I noted that, say, nine out of ten people had voted for its deletion on an associated project page, that would be a significant factor in how I handled the decision.

<dd>It might be viewed as vote stacking. That is the only thing I can think of that might be considered as a problem. And I can understand why you don't want to make any official policy. It's kind of like the idea of if a law is passed to restrict certain speech, you don't want to set the precedent that it restricts free speech entirely. I understand that ideal, in that by not creating any official policy what so ever, we are free to do whatever we need to do without any restrictions. However, I think we need to think about scalability here. The Wikipedia will continue to grow, and so will our project, because we will have more and more stubs to sort. If we don't have some policy to deal with the increased growth of the Wikipedia, we will have far too many stubs to handle, and far too many to know what to do with. -- <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllyUnion_7163.html" title="User:AllyUnion">AllyUnion</a> <a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllyUnion_d722.html" title="User talk:AllyUnion">(talk)</a> 06:13, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. Just wondering why you removed the nonagenarian category. It seems reasonably fitting. I didn't revert on the assumption you had a good reason. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">â˜¯</font></a> 19:40, 2005 Mar 10 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for the speedy reply. I concur with your reasoning. It seems to me that such a category ought =not= to include living candidates, as the information will take maximally a decade to become stale and could become so much faster. Even better, such an age-related category ought not exist at all, except to group ages in centuries and millenia. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">â˜¯</font></a> 23:26, 2005 Mar 10 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi. I see you recently stubbed an LA station to PBS stub. I defended this stub &amp; category previously but after sorting many television stubs and being unable to get the size of the category by <i>normal operations</i> (as opposed to hunting specifically) above 50 stubs. Therefore, I've done some stub mergers for Sesame Street characters in an attempt to reduce the population further and make it a better candidate for deletion prior to nominating it. How strongly do you feel that the PBS stub should remain in play? <a href="../../../c/e/y/User%7ECeyockey_fb55.html" title="User:Ceyockey">Courtland</a> 17:30, 2005 Mar 13 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a faculty member at Oxford, a British life peer and an eminent scientist, is "Australian-bio-stub" really the best category for Robert May? (I haven't kept up with all the new stub categories, so I don't feel confident suggesting an alternatives). Thanks - and thanks for the work you put into re-stubbing articles. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 21:03, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a biologist I will of course be biased, but AFAIK Robert May's honours stem from his contributions as a scientist, so I would probably lean towards scientist-stub. I'll change it to that unless someone else feels strongly otherwise. (Or maybe I should just take it past being a stub, huh?&#160;:))</dd>

<p>Hello, I see you've removed the stubbiness flag from <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Routh_11c0.html" title="Jonathan Routh">Jonathan Routh</a>. I put it there, and I'd already stuck it back in after it was removed earlier, but I hesitate to revert your change because after all you're an administrator and might come running after me with a mop and bucket, or a pistol or something.</p>
<p>It was an extraordinarily long "stub", but my reason for calling it a stub was that it dealt in some detail with only a tiny percentage of Routh's work, and in a very cursory fashion with the rest. I wrote the moderately detailed bit because it interested me and I had the source materials; I skipped the rest as I knew very little about it and lacked any material -- I was hoping that others would eventually contribute.</p>
<p>So the article still looks stubbly to me.</p>
<p>I don't know whether this merits a reply, but if you reply, please do so here rather than on my page. Thanks. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 00:00, 2005 Mar 16 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are way, way, way too many articles in <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_stubs_7d02.html" title="Category:People stubs">Category:People stubs</a>. I tend to remove stub tags from articles that are borderline stubs because it decreases the number of stubs in the category. Many times, it turns out that the article has been expanded since the tag was added but the person who did the expansion neglected to remove the stub tag. I tend to sort stubs en masse, so I don't have time to look through the history of every one and see how it was tagged in the past. All of which is a rather complicated way of saying that if you really think it's a stub, by all means, reinstate the stub tag. (However, I really recommend using something more specific than bio-stub. There's now a UK-bio-stub. There's also a comedian-stub. And a writer-stub. Take your pick.) Being an administrator really doesn't give me any extra clout in making this kind of call. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 02:08, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Gotcha. I really know little about JR other than what I wrote, but my impression is that he's best known as somebody who used to appear on British TV and say moderately amusing things -- a TV "personality" rather than an out-and-out comedian. (I never once saw him myself, and indeed have never even seen a photo of him.) So I think that UK-bio is most likely to catch the eye of potential contributors. I'll add that one. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:16, 2005 Mar 16 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Did you even look at the history of the pages? Somebody tried to make the Dukes of Lorraine into France-related stubs before. As I noted at the time, this is misleading - Lorraine was <i>not</i> part of France until 1766. Until that time, it remained part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Dukes of Lorraine never considered themselves to be French, and, indeed, their heirs are the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. They <i>spoke</i> French, but then so did many other people who were not French. They no more belong being categorized as French than do the Dukes of Savoy. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 02:35, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>They're not exactly <i>not</i> French, in that they spoke French, and obviously Lorraine is <i>now</i> part of France. But I think it's misleading to call them French in any context. <a href="../../../d/u/k/Category%7EDukes_of_Lorraine_2f9d.html" title="Category:Dukes of Lorraine">Category:Dukes of Lorraine</a> should not be in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Category%7EFrench_History_bafb.html" title="Category:French History">Category:French History</a>.

<p>In reading your many wonderful and cogent messages on the talk pages for The Lord of the Rings movies I noticed an interesting comment on the various days of the week for releases of the movies and vhs, dvd, etc. Not knowing you age (and its none of my ding dang business anyway!) I wanted to let you know that in the late 1960's, through the 1970's, I remember that most movies opened on Wednesday (even into the '80's since <i>Return of the Jedi</i> premiered on a Wed. here). One of the interesting things about life is that, often, something that was commonplace when young may not even be known upon reaching middle age.
