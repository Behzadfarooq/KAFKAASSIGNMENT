<p>I'm confused by your edit summary in your last edit to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliphate.html" title="Caliphate">Caliphate</a>. You said some Islamist movements oppose a <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliphate.html" title="Caliphate">Caliphate</a>. How is that possible? I thought Sharia required a Caliph. Which Islamist movement oppose a Caliphate? Regards, <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 19:21, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi KazahhPol,</p>
<p>No sharia requires no caliph as such. Neither the Koran nor the sources about the Prophet Mohammed (Sunna/Hadith) specify what kind of ruler should rule the Islamic umma - important is how the ruler rules, not who rules (although, obviously, Caliphists would debate this). When the prophet died, this resulted in major problems of finding someone to follow him. Nobody else was a Prophet so every one to follow him would be a second best solution. It was agreed among the followers of the prophet to chose the person most suited to lead the Umma (Abu Bakr) but many people opposed this, who would later be called Shiites, because they believe only a person from the family of Prophet Mohammed can rule the umma. Shiite doctrine later developped on and concluded at some point of time that nobody but one of the 12 Imams (in a stricter Shiite sense) can rule the umma - the last of these Shiite imams disappeared in the Middle Ages (the "Hidden Imam") and is believed to return some time in the future, like a messiah. This is why Khomeini after the Iranian Islamic Revolution faced opposition by many other Shiite scholars, who believed it was unlawful for a normal human being to create an Islamic state before the return of the Hidden Imam.</p>
<p>Many Muslims thus actually argue that Islam is a religious/cultural system only, with the divine law being applied by societies as such - not inherently a political one. In other words, there is no need for a government to regulate praying times for example, because people apply this themselves. It becomes much more complicated when it comes to laws like marriage and inheritance law. Nevertheless, there are many convinced that the only really necessary condition is that a political system allows Muslims to apply Islamic law - everyone, e.g. can chose to set his testament in the way the Quran requires inheritance to work, without the government regulating this. Many moderate Islamists actually demand a policy which coheres more with Islamic values, i.e. makes decisions on the basis of sharia. An elected government which maintains Islamic family law for example would be something acceptable for many Islamists. Democracy here becomes a possible option, and many Islamists in countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, have demanded democratic rather than autocratic reforms. There are also groups, such as in Morocco, which actively participate in democratic elections, who find their political system ok and who simply wish to make a difference as part of a democratic process.</p>
<p>Indeed, many or probably even most of these movements would oppose a caliph; not only because many Islamist movements of today are strongly territorially bound, i.e. it would be very unpopular to advocate a common ruler for people who simply aren't the same - nationalism is also popular in many ISlamic countries (and the concept of Calip implies one ruler for all rather than one ruler per country)! But also because the idea of a caliph is not inherently Islamic and required by shria. Who implements sharia is not specified. A government acceptable to Islamists in general is Islamic, not Caliphist. The Caliphs also had many problems tied to them: they were secular rulers, many were extremely useless and corrupted. Inherited rights to rule are highly debated in Islam in general. Groups which support a Caliph are small streams within Islamism, in the same way in which there are royalists in many countries where monarchies ceased to rule a long time ago. I have been studying Islamism for several years and I have very rarely encountered caliphist movements. It doesn't mean that they don't exist but they are marginal among Islamists.</p>
<p>Sorry this got so long but I hope it helps! Regards, --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArabist_2592.html" title="User:Arabist">Arabist</a> 09:12, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur. I also believe that if <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a> would get a chance to use the modern democratic system to operate their government, they would definitely do that! As Islam gives basic guidance for governance and any thing more is simply confusion of culture with religion.
