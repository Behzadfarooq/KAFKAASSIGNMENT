<p>While tragic, it don't see where this event is uncommon or unique enough to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. Things like this happen all the time worldwide.

<dd>It is a significant feature of New Zealand history, actually.

<dd>In a country with far more gun control and far fewer murders than the US, it was a very disturbing event: I think the worst of its kind here (or did Stan Graham kill more?)

<dd>If you read the article you would have seen, <i>"It has also been suggested that Gray was influenced by the literature he read, in particular books by American author Kurt Saxon..."</i> Gray read Saxon's work religiously and even had written correpondence with him.

<p>The Muttonbirds refer to "some oilskins and a .303 for a hunter over in Westland" which is a reference to Stanley Graham, who went on a shooting spree in the 1940s. I think its same to assume the off-handed "and oh yeah, one of those AK47s for some collector down the line" is a reference to Aramoana.</p>

<dd>To add - I witnessed a performance by The Muttonbirds in Dunedin in which they introduced the song by stating that it related to the incident at Aramona. Excellent song, by the bye.</dd>

<p>The entire "Timeline of events" section reads like it was written by someone who found the whole killing spree thing rather exciting. Douglas Adams would be proud of the last sentence: Gray had claimed 13 victims, leaving the town of Aramoana devastated and with a significantly smaller population than it had had a mere 34 hours before.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I agree, the tone is still somewhat 'bizarre' and could do with a rewrite. Also, and most importantly I suggest a 'fact' needs establishing as the way part of it reads is contradictory. Look at the part just after the police officer being shot and killed that says "Minutes later the Armed Offenders Squad began to arrive" ... "In the early hours of the morning of the 14th, the Special Tactics Group began to move into Aramoana, searching houses." Perhaps it is intended to say "Minutes later the AOS was mobilised". From memory they did surround the town to stop Gray's possible escape, but to me it currently doesn't read quite right. Perhaps it would be best for the entire timeline to be reconstructed and rewritten.</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EAramoana_massacre_a70e.html" title="Edit section: Suicide by cop?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Suicide by cop?</span></h2>
<p>I've just taken a look at the <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_by_cop.html" title="Suicide by cop">suicide by cop</a> article, and I'm not really convinced that Aramoana is really an instance of it, as the article claims. I'd be interested to see what other people think, though.</p>
<p>If David Gray was really intent on committing suicide, there were numerous occasions when he could have made himself known to the police and provoked them. He probably could have let Sergeant Guthrie shoot him quite easily, but instead he distracted and proceeded to kill him. When Gray finally did get shot, he'd been asleep in the house, and was only forced out after the tear gas was thrown in. I guess that Gray probably realised he'd be dead by the end of it, and it might just be that he was accepting the inevitable when he ran out of the house, but I can't really see any evidence that this is anything he'd planned. Add to this that even if he had had suicidal thoughts in the past, <i>this</i> incident started as an argument with his neighbour when he supposedly just lost control, and probably wasn't thinking about suicide. If some people regard this as an instance of <i>suicide by cop</i>, then the article should state who the people are. Otherwise I think it should be removed, and the <i>See also</i> link should probably also be removed from the <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_by_cop.html" title="Suicide by cop">suicide by cop</a> article.

<dd>Gray came running out of his bach, wildly firing a rifle from the hip in no particular direction, screaming "kill me, kill me," knowing that he was surrounded by armed police. The <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_Complaints_Authority_%28New_Zealand%29_5724.html" title="Police Complaints Authority (New Zealand)">PCA</a> report says as much. <b>It's a classic <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_by_cop.html" title="Suicide by cop">suicide by cop</a> scenario.</b> (If it's not suicide by cop then what is it? He could have surrendered, or at least stayed in the bach, which had makeshift barricades against the gas grenades.) Any of Gray's thoughts or actions prior to that moment are totally irrelevant. Oh, and if that doesn't convince you, an article in the <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otago_Daily_Times_f0dc.html" title="Otago Daily Times">ODT</a> on 18 November 1990 has an in-depth report on Gray's demise, with the headline <i>Typical 'suicide by cop' — psychologist</i>. So Gray's death <i>was</i> suicide by cop. It is not even remotely dubious; it is not original research; it is what authorities agree actually happened. I can hardly believe anyone is debating this. -- <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirstPrinciples_f0ae.html" title="User:FirstPrinciples">FP</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFirstPrinciples_e002.html" title="User talk:FirstPrinciples">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_FirstPrinciples_3c99.html" title="Special:Contributions/FirstPrinciples">(edits)</a></sup> 21:31, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
