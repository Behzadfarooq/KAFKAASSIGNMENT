	    <p>I suppressed the sentence and link about the support of the AEL towards the recent Iranian president's declarations about Israel: this is a stub of 2 small paragraphs about this organization, such precise considerations don't bring anything useful to the knowledge of the AEL, whose position towards Israel has been clear from its beginning. It reminds me of the article about the Bulgarian Turks' <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_for_Rights_and_Freedoms_a3e1.html" title="Movement for Rights and Freedoms">Movement for Rights and Freedoms</a> where someone deemed of the utmost importance to stress and support the accusations of electoral fraud that have never been sustained by the ad hoc Electoral commission. Please note that I have no sympathy either for the AEL, Aminejad or Israel, but I'm afraid the person who added the recent text has more Zionist propagandist motivations than encyclopedic ones. --Pylambert 16:42, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"such precise considerations don't bring anything useful to the knowledge of the AEL"</i></dd>
<dd>Of course it does. It speaks to AEL's overall political position.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't follow your Wikipedia navel gazing, so I have no idea what you're talking about re. the Bulgarian Turks. Not that I can see how someone insisting on stressing the importance of an accusation is in any way comparable to a small paragraph of the official position and at the bottom of an article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Please note that I have no sympathy either for the AEL, Aminejad or Israel, but I'm afraid the person who added the recent text has more Zionist propagandist motivations than encyclopedic ones."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You must be a physic that you are able to speak on my Zionist credentials on the basis of a small paragraph about AEL and Israel and noting whatsoever about Zionism. But please note that this is in fact an encyclopedia and neither your nor my political leanings are of interest to anyone.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I looked up AEL to see what was, and found that the article didn't include this fairly controversial part. And in the interest of adding detail and information I put it in. I'm afraid the only one pushing a political agenda is you - which is made double clear by your ready admissions of your many dislikes as well as your easy accusations of other contributers <i>"Zionist propagandist motivations"</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But if you feel like you need to be the political propaganda wing of Wikipedia, have it your way. I'm certainly not going to go into an editing war with you over such a trivial matter, espicially since I in fact did not have any political or indeed Zionist reason for the addition other than more information on AEL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But really insisting on having the external link pointing to a non-existing page which give a 404 error, rather than my fixed link, is rather silly. <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune_X2_d1ac.html" title="User:Rune X2">Rune X2</a> 22:28, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This article does nothing but list a bill of particulars in attempt to villainize the AEL, without even giving a cursory glance at their side of the issues at hand (e.g., racist violence against Arabs across Europe). As such, it's going into the NPOV disputes category. Let someone who doesn't get all their information from FoxNews get a crack at it. --<a href="../../../d/t/a/User%7EDtasripin_8a3e.html" title="User:Dtasripin">Daniel</a> 02:06, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I note that my insertion of the Salon link was reverted by an editor on the grouds that it is not "open source." But references do not have to be; its okay to list a book as a reference for example, even though a book must be purchased. Also, the current version has some polemical claims, i.e. that the AEL has at most a dozen activists, some under 18. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a> 01:14, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I could not access the Salon article but I take your word for it that it contains accusations of anti-semitism, homophobia, and probably child molestation, treason and drug dealing. Still, who makes these accusations? Wouldn't it be helpful to identify the accuser rather than just say, "Some people believe the AEL is anti-semitic". --<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.214.59.196.html" title="User:68.214.59.196">68.214.59.196</a> 01:19, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I read through the article briefly. I do not think it supports the edits claimed. The only person named in the article accusing Muslims (in general - not AEL specifically) of anti-semitism is the director off the Dutch Center for Information and Documentation on Israel, Ronny Naftaniel. The rest are anonymous claims. There are no direct accusations of homophobia against AEL. --<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.214.59.196.html" title="User:68.214.59.196">68.214.59.196</a> 01:30, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you don't understand what I'm trying to do. I actually tried to improve the page. I don't understand the point of reverting a page to a worse state. Just compare the wording between my version and the older version, and then consider what is most POV. I don't say that my version is perfect, but it is at least better. Just compare.

<dd>Another comment. <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Standaard_156e.html" title="De Standaard">De Standaard</a>, a quality Belgian newspaper called the AEL cartoons anti-semitic and negationist <a href="http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=GHENRDR2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=GHENRDR2" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dl>
<dd>OK, AEL invited a speaker to the Netherlands who is accused of being a member of a group with "ties" to al-Qaeda and the Talban. Is sympathy for Iraqi resistance to occupation considered support for terrorism? Does this justify labeling AEL a supporter of terrorism? --<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.214.59.196.html" title="User:68.214.59.196">68.214.59.196</a> 02:12, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><strong>Claims that the group is connected to violence in antwerp:</strong> "Belgian lawmakers contended that Jahjah posed a danger to the community of Antwerp."</p>

<dd>A member of AEL, before he was a member, made statements advocating Biblical punishment for homosex.

<dd>Salon is a source. This particular article is short on facts. If you write clearly and provide full attribution in the Wikipedia article, like you did above and it should be OK. "According to salon article, M.

<p>OK, the article says they got less than 1% of the vote and this shows their support in the Muslim community is insignificant. But don't Muslims make up only 4-7% of the population in Belgium and the Netherlands? And how many are eligible to vote? 1% of the vote translates into <strong>at least</strong> 14%-25% support among Muslims, assuming voters for this party are predominantly Muslim, which is significant enough. So I think unless we have more concrete figures, that sentence ought to be removed. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a> 02:54, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are misunderstanding the policy. First of all, non-English sources should be avoided. "Readers may not be able to read source materials in other languages, and therefore require translations into English so that they can read them. Editors need this too, so they can check that the source has been used correctly." Therefore, if non-English sources are used in English Wikipedia, a translated quote from the original is needed. And the original must be provided next to the translation so that it can be verified by others later. Editing can get sloppy when editors are intent on putting their own POV into an article. That is why every edit must be documented and accurate. --<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.214.59.196.html" title="User:68.214.59.196">68.214.59.196</a> 04:59, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Translation is always needed. read these paragraphs especially carefully:

<p><i>The AEL of Abou Jahjah that is also active in the Netherlands heavely resists the plans of the Flemish green party Agalev to place posters of islamic dressed homosexual couples in the migrant parts of Antwerp. In a declaration, AEL calls this a "ridiculous, bad taste and provocing". The organization demands apologies of Agalev. If Agalev doesn't apologize, AEL will take further actions.</i></p>
<p><i>According to president Azzuz of AEL-Belgium the Qu'ran explicitly forbids homosexuality. "You cannot be a muslim and being homosexual and you can't be muslim and be an acoholic, according to Azzuz Thursday. "People may be gay, but they may not call themselves muslim then. We don't force anyone to be muslim, but islamic homosexuals don't exist, whatever a small group of alleged islamic homosexuals say. What Agalev now does, is a direct insult for our faith.</i></p>
<p><i>Azzuz doesn't want to say what further action he could take. "If they learn their lesson, they will see how we will react." According to the president of AEL-Belgium Agalev wants - that gained in the past a lot of votes from naturalized immigrants and also had a lot of migrant representatives in parliament - to gain votes after the election defeat in May. The party then lost all her seats in the Chamber. Azzuz: "Don't let them do stunts that hurts us."</i></p>
<p><i>Secretary Caals of Agalev-Antwerp doesn't say that it is yet decided to place the posters. "That's what the president of the youth organization, who is muslim and homosexual himself, wants to do. He wants to tackle the taboo that currently exists in Islam world and sees the posters as the best possibility, as something that is a little bit shocking. "Within the party we will keep talking. But we really want to do something about this taboo." Caals thinks the reaction of AEL happened "too soon". AEL plans a protest march in Brussel against the interdiction for muslim girls to wear head scarfs in the capital [Brussels] in different schools.</i></p>

<dd>If you want to go this way, we'll have to delete the Vlaams Belang page&#160;: there is no legal person called "Vlaams Belang". For matters of law, in Belgium political parties have no legal personality, they don't exist if you look at it purely from the legal point of view. So if one wants to start a trial against a party, because the party is racist, the only valid legal way to file a complaint is through the existing legal persons, the foundations, and/or the natural persons that constitute the party.</dd>
<dd>So, formally, legally, off course the party wasn't convicted, but for every means and purpose, in real life it has. Which is why a reputable source like the BBC (and many others), wrote that the court convicted the party. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucVerhelst_3fe1.html" title="User:LucVerhelst">LucVerhelst</a> 21:20, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They could have tried more, no doubt, but the point is -as I understand- what is left of the VB without it's constituent parts? If it is virtually nothing, than the conviction of the constituent parts (VZWs) is practically the conviction of the VB. As such it was also explained by the VB leaders <i>themselves</i>.</dd>
<dd>Apart from a legalistic debate, the history of the Party show leaders in Holocaust denial, attacks on anti-racists, members/sympathizers killing migrants, leaders visiting 'blood and honour' (nazi's) festivities, international cooperation with neonazi's. There is no doubt this party is also unofficially racist. <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 21:47, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

</dd>
<dd>Yeah, I fully agree with you, they should have been brought to court too!</dd>
<dd>But the point here is: without the VZWs the VB is nothing. Only in purely legal terms, in one's own mind, one can try to maintain a strict devide between them, but not in reality. Even the VB leaders themselves could not, however much they wished to do so. So, after the ruling, it was quite a clever political tactic of them not to push forward without their VZWs because their weaknesses would have become exposed. For appearences it was a clever tactic to 'officially' disband themselves and 'start all over' (also only legally and also never practically). It allowed them to play the role of the poor misunderstood innocent little school boy (while loading his gun so it could go hunting pregnant Malinese nannies). <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 07:54, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
