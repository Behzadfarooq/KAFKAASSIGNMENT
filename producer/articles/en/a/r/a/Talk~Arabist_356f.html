If someone can add material about other places, we could easily factor out a lot of this to a country-specific article, with a representative summary here.

<dd>Man... I'm working on it, but I have to say: there is a lot of internal evidence that this was written about 40 years ago. For example: "El actual director de la Escuela de Estudios Árabes es Jaime Oliver Asín (1905), extraordinario filólogo y romanista autor de Historia del nombre «Madrid» (Madrid 1959), de excelentes estudios toponímicos y de valiosos trabajos sobre moriscos. Finalmente, hay que citar a Leopoldo Torres Balbás (1888-1960)..." <i>"Actual"</i> in Spanish means "current". So this is saying that the current director is someone born in 1905, and gives no work of his past 1960? -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 08:15, Mar 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In pro-Israel circles in the US and UK, "Arabist" is a term used (slightly contemptuously) to refer to a group from an upper-crust elite social background who received a highly academic and purely theoretical ivory-tower training in Classical Arabic language and literature, after which they went to live in the middle east for a few months or years, and then emerged back to the UK or US with a highly romanticized view of desert Bedouins as some kind of Rousseauian noble savages -- accompanied with an implacable and rigidly-inflexible opposition to increased Jewish emigration to Palestine / the emergence of any sovereign Jewish political entity / any open support for Israel which might further anger the Arabs (depending on the decade). In England, Arabists (according to this definition) were generally pith-helemeted twits with a public-school and Oxbridge education, while in America they were pin-striped Ivy-League WASPs with a genteel anti-Semitism of the "<a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentleman%27s_Agreement_fc8a.html" title="Gentleman's Agreement">Gentleman's Agreement</a>" movie type -- and among pro-Israel advocates, it was thought that such Arabists had a stranglehold lock on Foggy Bottom and the Foreign Office until the mid-1960's. A lot of AIPAC's activities which some have characterized as overkill or beating the dead horse are actually aimed at pre-emptively preventing the accumulation of a critical wieght of "Arabists" in certain critical locations within the U.S. government. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonMoos_22a7.html" title="User talk:AnonMoos">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AnonMoos_e17d.html" title="Special:Contributions/AnonMoos">contribs</a>) 20 Aug 2005.</small></dd>

<dd>Well aware of the other page, as well as the "highly emotional opinions" (as in e.g. the 20 Aug 05 comment) - regardless it rather strikes me as a US-centric 'issue' centered around US-Israeli politics. The difference between the philologists and the political axe-grinding was not the object of my comment.

<p>Why does Jmabel think this is a copyvio, and how could it possibly be, since its been translated? Assuming the spanish version <i>was</i> a copyvio, this wouldn't be, because in translation and editing the wording has surely been changed more than enough...

<dd>No. One does not have the right to translate closely a piece that someone else owns the copyright on. Think for a moment about book publishing (since this certainly came from a book). If it weren't for this, there would essentially be no such thing as selling the foreign rights to a book.</dd>
<dd>Again, I did a lot of work on this article before becoming convinced that the source was "polluted". It's not like I <i>want</i> to throw away my work, but I think it's clear that in copyright matters we should err on the side of caution. That's what I've done restarting this at Arabist/Temp: much of that is a much looser rendition of the same material, which will stand us in much better legal stead.</dd>
<dd>Frankly, I think <a href="../../../../es/a/r/a/Arabista.html" class="extiw" title="es:Arabista">es:Arabista</a> was an example of a much more general problem that the Spanish Wikipedia has very little scrutiny for copyvios. I anticipate trouble, sooner or later. I'd like to make as sure as possible that when that trouble comes down, the English-language Wikipedia is well insulated from it. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:11, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sam, I don't have a source text. What I have is two pieces of evidence. (1) This massive article was created at a single blow in the Spanish Wikipedia by a contributor who contributed exactly two massive articles, both within minutes of one another, and was never heard from again. (2) The internal evidence in the article suggests that it was written in the late 1960s. The holder of a position at that time is described as <i>actual</i> (current), and no later work in the field is mentioned.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>Since I'm pretty much the only one who has worked on this in English, as far as the English-language Wikipedia is concerned I am not suggesting throwing away someone else's work. I am not willing to continue translating the remaining roughly 60% of this, because I don't believe we come by it honestly.</dd>

<dd>Besides all that, the Spanish-language article was <i>very</i> hispanocentric. In modern times, Spain has <i>not</i> been the center of world Arabism, but you would never know that from reading their article.</dd>

<p>According to the Real Academy dictionary, "asayar" is an obselete word which means "experimentar." I have accordingly translated assayamientos as "experiences", presuming that the doubled "s" in the root is just an artifact of non-regularized 15th century orthography.

<p>On the other hand, "A History of the Graeco-Latin Fable: Introduction and from the Origins to the Hellenistic Age" by Francisco Rodriguez Adrados, Leslie A. (TRN) Ray, Gert-Jan Van Dijk, translates the title of the book to a more likely sounding "Book of the Deceits and Lies of Women" Is it considered better wiki form to rely on someone else's (authoritative sounding) translation than your own?
