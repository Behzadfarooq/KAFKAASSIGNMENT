<p>Marshall was born in <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Joseph%2C_Missouri_3377.html" title="Saint Joseph, Missouri">St. Joseph</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri.html" title="Missouri">MO</a> (near <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City%2C_Missouri_d52a.html" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City</a>) to parents Deborah "Debbie" Mathers-Briggs and Marshall Bruce Mathers II, and spent most of his childhood moving back and forth between Kansas City, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a> and its suburbs, including <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren%2C_Michigan_36e2.html" title="Warren, Michigan">Warren</a>. His father had abandoned the family before Marshall turned 2 years old, and the two have not had contact since. Incessantly moving from home to home, he frequently changed schools, often finding himself to be an outcast in the new communities, and frequently fell victim to <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bully.html" title="Bully">bullying</a>. An assault by schoolmate DeAngelo Bailey that left Marshall hospitalised was the most notable such incident, which Marshall would later recount in greatly exaggerated form on the track <i>Brain Damage</i> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Slim_Shady_LP_25d1.html" title="The Slim Shady LP">The Slim Shady LP</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>). The song prompted legal action by the assailant<a href="http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1451396/12102001/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1451396/12102001/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, with accusations of <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander_and_libel.html" title="Slander and libel">libel</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_privacy.html" title="Invasion of privacy">privacy infringement</a>, which were eventually dismissed in court<a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1500270/04152005/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1500270/04152005/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>His childhood was further marred by his family's meagre financial status, which was the primary reason for the continuous moving, during which Marshall and his mother Debbie would often find themselves living in <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_housing.html" title="Public housing">public housing</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_home.html" title="Mobile home">mobile homes</a>, and under the care of relatives, such as Marshall's great-aunt Edna, whom he mentions in <i>Evil Deeds</i> (<a href="../../../e/n/c/Encore_%28album%29.html" title="Encore (album)">Encore</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>). During this time, Debbie was legally taking the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescription_drug.html" title="Prescription drug">prescription drugs</a> <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrocodone.html" title="Hydrocodone">Vicodin</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diazepam.html" title="Diazepam">Valium</a>, though Marshall later claimed in numerous interviews and songs that she was abusing the drugs <a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1436917/09152000/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1436917/09152000/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, to which Debbie retaliated with a lawsuit pressing defamation charges (see below). In the song <i>Cleanin' Out My Closet</i> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Eminem_Show_0712.html" title="The Eminem Show">The Eminem Show</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>), Marshall also accuses Debbie of having <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munchausen_syndrome.html" title="Munchausen syndrome">Munchausen syndrome by proxy</a>, adding that "my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't". This was not the first time someone suggested Debbie had the disorder, as a social worker had made similar comments following a <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> investigation of her mistreatment of Nathan Samra-Mathers, her second child, who is 14 years younger than Marshall <a href="http://www.freep.com/entertainment/music/eminem30_20000630.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freep.com/entertainment/music/eminem30_20000630.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>Before dropping out of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_High_School_259d.html" title="Lincoln High School">Lincoln High School</a> in Warren at the age of 17, Marshall made a number of significant acquaintances at the school. This included fellow rapper <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proof_%28rapper%29.html" title="Proof (rapper)">Proof</a>, who was to become one of his closest friends, and future wife Kimberly Ann "Kim" Scott, with whom he soon developed a long-term relationship. When Kim became pregnant in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, this further increased Marshall's drive to succeed through concern over the welfare of his new family. He discusses this in <i>Never 2 Far</i> (<a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_%28album%29.html" title="Infinite (album)">Infinite</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>), saying "I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car...I still stay with my moms...we gotta make some hit records or something [because] I'm tired of being broke". When the <i>Infinite</i> album failed to generate the revenue and acclaim he had hoped for, and Kim ended their relationship, preventing him from seeing his newborn child, Marshall decided to take his own life. However, his suicide attempt using an overdose of <a href="../../../t/y/l/Tylenol.html" title="Tylenol">Tylenol</a> <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analgesic.html" title="Analgesic">analgesics</a> failed, and Marshall resumed his efforts to succeed in the music industry and reconcile with Kim<a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/eminem/bio.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/eminem/bio.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. He ultimately succeeded in doing both, marrying Kim on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_14.html" title="June 14">June 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> in St. Joseph, MO.</p>
<p>The couple's daughter, Hailie Jade Scott, born <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">December 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> would grow to become an important part of Marshall's life, as he became dedicated to give her everything he himself was deprived of in his childhood, including a father figure and financial security. He would go on to mention her extensively in some of his songs, including <i>'97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde</i> (The Slim Shady LP, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>), which takes the form of a one-sided <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialogue.html" title="Dialogue">dialogue</a> with Hailie, as well as <i>Hailie's Song</i> (The Eminem Show, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>) and <i>Mockingbird</i> (<a href="../../../e/n/c/Encore_%28album%29.html" title="Encore (album)">Encore</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>), both of which are proclamation of his love and dedication to her. In addition, he samples her voice in the less serious upbeat track <i>My Dad's Gone Crazy</i> (The Eminem Show, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAramgutang_Worksheet_48d3.html" title="Edit section: Legal troubles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legal troubles</span></h3>
<p>The year <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> was marked by a rise to celebrity status for Marshall, but it also ushered the beginning of his numerous legal troubles. The first of these was his mother Debbie's lawsuit against him in September of that year. The lawsuit was motivated by comments on Debbie's drug use made by Marshall on the song <i>My Name Is</i> (The Slim Shady LP, 1999), specifically the lyric "my mom smokes more dope than I do", and similar accusations in numerous interviews. Debbie refuted the statements and demanded more than <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">$</a>10 million in for defamation damages in two lawsuits. After rumours of Debbie dropping the suit, she and Marshall reached a settlement in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> for $25,000, with over $23,000 of it going to Debbie's former attorney Fred Gibson by a court order<a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1446458/08082001/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1446458/08082001/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. A request for reconsideration of the settlement by Debbie was denied by a judge<a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1444814/06272001/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1444814/06272001/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Marshall's resentful reflections on the case can be heard on the song <i>Marshall Mathers</i> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Marshall_Mathers_LP_e960.html" title="The Marshall Mathers LP">The Marshall Mathers LP</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>) in the lyrics "my fucking bitch mom is suing for 10 million/ she must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealing" and the self-censored line "your attorney Fred Gibson's a faggot".</p>
<p>With Marshall's rise to stardom, new disputes arose between him and his wife, centred around Kim's dissatisfaction over the graphic fictional account of Marshall murdering her and dumping her body in a lake in the songs <i>'97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde</i> (The Slim Shady LP, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>) and <i>Kim</i> (The Marshall Mathers LP, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>). The tension between the couple came to a climax when Marshall witnessed Kim kissing another man, one Jose Guerra, outside the Hot Rocks Café in Warren on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. Highly digruntled, Marshall threatened Jose with an unloaded <a href="../../../9/_/m/9_mm_caliber.html" title="9 mm caliber">9 mm</a> <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semi-automatic_firearm.html" title="Semi-automatic firearm">semi-automatic gun</a> and proceeded to <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pistol-whipping.html" title="Pistol-whipping">pistol-whip</a> him<a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1436562/06072000/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1436562/06072000/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. In addition, it was soon revealed that the previous day, Marshall was involved in a heated dispute in Red Oak, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a> with Dennis Dail, an associate of the rap group <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insane_Clown_Posse_8aba.html" title="Insane Clown Posse">Insane Clown Posse</a>, with whom Marshall had an ongoing <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_rivalries.html" title="Hip hop rivalries">rivalry</a>. During the confrontation, Marshall was observed to be holding a gun, which he kept pointed at the ground<a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1436572/06092000/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1436572/06092000/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Being taken into police custody during the hot Rocks Café incident, Marshall was charged with <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misdemeanor.html" title="Misdemeanor">misdemeanour</a> charges of brandishing a firearm in public, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assault.html" title="Assault">assault</a> with a dangerous weapon, and two counts of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concealed_carry_%28USA%29_198e.html" title="Concealed carry (USA)">concealed</a> <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapon_possession.html" title="Weapon possession">weapon possession</a>, in two separate trials for the two incidents. After a <a href="../../../p/l/e/Plea_bargain.html" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a> in the Jose Guerra case, which concluded on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_10.html" title="April 10">April 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, Marshall pleaded guilty to weapon possession in exchange for the assault charges being dropped, receiving two years of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probation.html" title="Probation">probation</a> <a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1442685/04112001/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1442685/04112001/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, and was ordered to pay $100,000 in damages at the conclusion of the case evaluation in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> <a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1453345/04092002/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1453345/04092002/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. In the Dennis Dail case, he pleaded <a href="../../../n/o/l/Nolo_contendere.html" title="Nolo contendere">nolo contendere</a> to the charges of firearm possession and brandishing, receiving one year of probation, enforced concurrently with the sentence from the first case<a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1444843/06282001/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1444843/06282001/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. He would later recount the former incident in the song <i>Soldier</i> (The Eminem Show, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>) and the preceding <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interlude.html" title="Interlude">interlude</a> <i>The Kiss</i>.</p>
<p>While the trials were in the beginning stages, things were only getting worse for Marshall, when on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">July 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, Kim attempted suicide in the couple's <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sterling_Heights_0bad.html" title="Sterling Heights">Sterling Heights</a>, Michigan home by <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">cutting her wrists</a> <a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1436675/07102000/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1436675/07102000/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. This prompted Marshall to file for <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorce</a> a few months later<a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1436827/08172000/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1436827/08172000/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, which was promptly countered by Kim with a lawsuit that sought to deny Marshall custody of their daughter and $10 million in defamation damages<a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1123331/08222000/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1123331/08222000/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.

By the end of the year, the couple reconciled, agreeing to dismiss divorce claims and live together <a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1424555/12142000/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1424555/12142000/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. Marshall later went on to discuss Kim's suicide attempt and the Hot Rocks Café incident on the <a href="../../../x/z/i/Xzibit.html" title="Xzibit">Xzibit</a> song <i>Don't Approach Me</i> (<a href="../../../r/e/s/Restless_%28Xzibit_album%29_5e77.html" title="Restless (Xzibit album)">Restless</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>), criticising the amount of media coverage of the events and the public attention to his life in general.</p>
<p>The reconciliation, however, would not last, as Kim filed for divorce in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, which was finalised in October of that year, granting joint physical and legal custody of Hailie to both parties, as well as requiring Marshall to make <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_support.html" title="Child support">child support</a> payments <a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1449902/10102001/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1449902/10102001/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.

The incident was not to be her last, however, as she was sentenced to 30 days in jail in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, after failing a <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_test.html" title="Drug test">drug test</a> for cocaine while still on probation<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3484927.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3484927.stm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. Marshall makes numerous references to Kim's cocaine use on the <i>Encore</i> album, including the quotes "you're a fucking cokehead slut" and "mama developed a habit" in the songs <i>Puke</i> and <i>Mockingbird</i> respectively. Their relationship since their divorce has been subject to many contradictive rumours and statements in Marshall's music and remained in an undecisive "on-again, off-again" state for a long time. More recently, Marshall has stated in an interview that the couple have fully reconciled and "are probably going to remarry" <a href="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1517598/12072005/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1517598/12072005/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>Marshall himself was no stranger to drugs, as suggested by a large number of his songs, including <i>Drug Ballad</i> (The Marshall Mathers LP, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>) and <i>These Drugs</i> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_Night_%28album%29_660a.html" title="Devil's Night (album)">Devil's Night</a> (bonus disc), <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>), which are dedicated to his drug use in their entirety. The song <i>I'm Shady</i> (The Slim Shady LP, 1999) even includes the explanatory line "well, I do take pills [<a href="../../../e/c/s/Ecstasy_%28drug%29.html" title="Ecstasy (drug)">ecstasy</a> or prescription drugs], don't do speed [<a href="../../../m/e/t/Methamphetamine.html" title="Methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a>]/ don't do crack, don't do coke [<a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>]/ I do smoke weed/ don't do smack [<a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a>]/ I do do shrooms [<a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychedelic_mushroom.html" title="Psychedelic mushroom">psychedelic mushrooms</a>], do drink beer/ I just wanna make a few things clear". Later tracks, including the aforementioned <i>These Drugs</i> and <i>Kill You</i> (The Marshall Mathers LP, 2000) additionally suggest cocaine use, although he has never been in a law enforcement incident involving drugs. However, with the sentence of two years of probation taking effect in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, during which he was subject to mandatory regular drug testing, his recreational drug use was put to an end. This fact is supported with references to his drug use in his music, which all but disappeared after <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, and comments by bandmate Proof, who states that Marshall "sobered up" <a href="http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1452709/03012002/eminem.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1452709/03012002/eminem.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. However, with rising pressures and workload in his professional career, Marshall found it difficult to get the rest he wanted, and turned to <a href="../../../z/o/l/Zolpidem.html" title="Zolpidem">Ambien</a> <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedative.html" title="Sedative">sleeping pills</a> for relief. His use of the drug eventually became so extensive, that in <a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a> of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, he cancelled the European leg of his ongoing tour, and checked into a <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drug_rehabilitation.html" title="Drug rehabilitation">drug rehabilitation</a> clinic for treatment <a href="http://www.freep.com/news/health/eminem19e_20050819.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freep.com/news/health/eminem19e_20050819.htm" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>.</p>
<p>The decline of Marshall's drug use during his probation was in line with the growing demands for responsibility in his role as a parent to Hailie. In addition, he is also known to take care of the daughter of Kim's twin sister Dawn, Alaina "Laney", whom he mentions in the song <i>Mockingbird</i> (Encore, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>), referring to himself as her "daddy" and stating "it's almost like [Laney and Hailie] are sisters now". He also cares for his younger half-brother Nathan, who makes appearances in the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_video.html" title="Music video">music videos</a> for <i>The Way I Am</i> (The Marshall Mathers LP, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>) and <i>Without Me</i> (The Eminem Show, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>).

<p>At the age of 11, Marshall was introduced to <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip-hop_music.html" title="Hip-hop music">hip-hop music</a> by his uncle Ronald "Ronnie" Polkingharn, purportedly through the song <i>Reckless</i> by <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_T_a739.html" title="Ice T">Ice T</a>. This led young Marshall to develop a passion towards the genre, and he soon discovered his adeptness for composing <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freestyle_rap.html" title="Freestyle rap">improvised rap</a> lyrics. He used his skills in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freestyle_battle.html" title="Freestyle battle">freestyle battles</a> against his fellow schoolmates, and his frequent victories sparked hopes of adopting rapping as a prospective career.

<p>Interested in rap from a young age, Mathers began performing as early as thirteen, later gaining some popularity with a group, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul_Intent_fdd4.html" title="Soul Intent">Soul Intent</a>. His wife Kim gave birth to his daughter, <a href="../../../e/m/i/Eminem.html#Child" title="Eminem">Hailie Jade</a>, on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">25 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>. In 1996, he released his first independent album, named <i><a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_%28album%29.html" title="Infinite (album)">Infinite</a></i> (of which he sold about 500 copies out of the back of his car), following it up with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Slim_Shady_EP_905d.html" title="The Slim Shady EP">The Slim Shady EP</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>. He became famous in the hip-hop underground because of his distinctive, cartoonish style and the fact that he is white (a rarity in all rap, especially mainstream gangsta rap). Some people called him rap's "great white hope". With his storytelling way of expressing rap, he became known in the underground as "The White Shadow". <s>Marital problems, however, almost derailed his career, when, after arguing with his wife, he attempted to kill himself by overdosing with pills.</s> The suicide attempt failed, but encouraged him to rededicate himself to "The Slim Shady EP" demo.</p>
<p>It is said that <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Dre_1d84.html" title="Dr. Dre">Dr. Dre</a> found Eminem's demo on the garage floor of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Iovine_6344.html" title="Jimmy Iovine">Jimmy Iovine</a>, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interscope.html" title="Interscope">Interscope</a> label chief.

With the album's enormous popularity came controversy surrounding many of the album's lyrics. In "97 Bonnie and Clyde", Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter, disposing of the bodies of his wife, her lover and his son.

The first single released from the album, "The Real Slim Shady", was a smash -- thanks in part to the catchy rhythm and chorus line, "Will the real Slim Shady please stand up, please stand up, please stand up" (adapted from the catch phrase of the TV quiz show <i><a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Tell_the_Truth_0c2a.html" title="To Tell the Truth">To Tell the Truth</a></i>). It also created some buzz by trash-talking celebrities and spilling dubious gossip about them. In the song, Eminem claims, among other things, that <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christina_Aguilera_233a.html" title="Christina Aguilera">Christina Aguilera</a> gave "head" (<a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a>) to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Durst_580b.html" title="Fred Durst">Fred Durst</a> (of <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limp_Bizkit_663e.html" title="Limp Bizkit">Limp Bizkit</a>) and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carson_Daly_6a74.html" title="Carson Daly">Carson Daly</a> (of <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>'s <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Request_Live_8c4d.html" title="Total Request Live">Total Request Live</a>).

<p>With the enormous popularity of Eminem's second album, the controversy surrounding Eminem grew even larger, especially when <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i> was nominated for a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy.html" title="Grammy">Grammy</a> for Album of the Year. Though Mathers had always claimed that his lyrics were not meant to be taken seriously, and that he had nothing against homosexuals or women, the gay rights group <a href="../../../g/l/a/GLAAD_9625.html" title="GLAAD">GLAAD</a> organized a boycott of the Grammys against Eminem. Mathers responded to this by singing "Stan" on-stage with bisexual singer <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a>, ending the performance by hugging John to show that he didn't have anything against homosexuals. Though it shocked a lot of people, this gesture failed to appease all of his critics.</p>
<p>Since Eminem's rapid ascent to fame, tell-all biographies of varying quality have been published, including <i>Shady Bizzness</i> by his former bodyguard Byron Williams. Eminem himself has written a book called <i>Angry Blonde</i> (2001), where he reveals the emotions and intent behind the lyrics in the <i>Marshall Mathers LP</i>, and describes his passion and approach to rapping.</p>
<p>As one of six members of the rap group <a href="../../../d/1/2/D12_%28band%29.html" title="D12 (band)">D12</a>, Eminem appeared on the album <i>Devil's Night</i>, released in 2001. The album was certified multi-platinum. The album contained the single "Purple Pills". Another song, "Blow My Buzz", was on the soundtrack for the film <i>The Wash</i> (2001), in which Eminem had a cameo.</p>
<p>Eminem's third major album, <i>The Eminem Show</i> was released in summer 2002. It featured the single "Without Me", an apparent sequel to "The Real Slim Shady" in which he makes derogatory comments about boy bands, <a href="../../../2A/n/s/_NSYNC_b968.html" title="*NSYNC">*NSYNC</a>'s <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Kirkpatrick_7cf6.html" title="Chris Kirkpatrick">Chris Kirkpatrick</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limp_Bizkit_663e.html" title="Limp Bizkit">Limp Bizkit</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moby.html" title="Moby">Moby</a>, and <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynne_Cheney_b9ec.html" title="Lynne Cheney">Lynne Cheney</a>, among others.</p>
<p>On November 19th, 2003 new controversy surrounded Eminem when a cassette tape was played during a press conference held by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Source_%28magazine%29_e5b1.html#The_Source_Against_Eminem" title="The Source (magazine)">The Source</a> magazine. The 1988 cassette featured a younger Mathers performing a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freestyle_rap.html" title="Freestyle rap">freestyle rap</a> in which he made disparaging remarks about black women, calling them "stupid" in comparison to white women. Other racial slurs and remarks were stated to be on the tape. Mathers reportedly made the recording after breaking up with his black girlfriend. The ordeal would later end up with both Eminem and The Source arguing their views of the matter in court. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benzino.html#Benzino_vs._Eminem" title="Benzino">Benzino</a> is currently feuding with Eminem (see Benzino and The Source on the on-going feud with Eminem).</p>

The lyrics in question: <i>Fuck money/ I don't rap for dead presidents/ I'd rather see the president dead/ It's never been said, but I set precedents</i>.</p>
<p>Then, in 2004, Eminem made the video "My Band" with D12. The controversial song was the band's sarcastic response to the media's frequent portrayal of D-12 as Eminem's band, giving little or no credit to its other members. The video contained various parodies, including that of the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_Halftime_controversy_d63a.html" title="Super Bowl XXXVIII Halftime controversy">Janet Jackson 'incident'</a>, and of <a href="../../../5/0/_/50_Cent_813c.html" title="50 Cent">50 Cent's</a> "In Da Club" video.</p>
<p>On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of "Just Lose It," Eminem's first video and single off <i>Encore</i>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> called into the Los Angeles-based Steve Harvey radio show to report his displeasure with the video, which parodies Jackson's child-molestation accusations, his <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhinoplasty.html" title="Rhinoplasty">rhinoplasty</a>, and an incident in which Jackson's hair caught on fire while he was filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984. The lyrics to "Just Lose It" also refer to Jackson's troubles. In the video, Eminem also parodied <a href="../../../p/e/e/Pee_Wee_Herman_fb11.html" title="Pee Wee Herman">Pee Wee Herman</a>, <a href="../../../m/c/_/MC_Hammer_c2ad.html" title="MC Hammer">MC Hammer</a>, and a Blonde-Ambition-touring <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>.

<p>Black Entertainment Television was the first channel to stop airing the video. MTV, however, announced it would continue airing the video and "Just Lose It" became the number-one requested video on <i>Total Request Live</i> for the week ending October 22. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Source_%28magazine%29_e5b1.html" title="The Source (magazine)">The Source</a></i> magazine, through its CEO Raymond "<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benzino.html" title="Benzino">Benzino</a>" Scott, wanted not only the video pulled, but the song off the album, and a public apology to Jackson from Eminem <a href="http://www.sohh.com/thewire/read.php?contentID=6321" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sohh.com/thewire/read.php?contentID=6321" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>Eminem is also active as a producer of rap records. Besides <a href="../../../d/1/2/D12_%28band%29.html" title="D12 (band)">D12</a>'s two albums, <i><a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_Night_874f.html" title="Devil's Night">Devil's Night</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../d/1/2/D12_World_8081.html" title="D12 World">D12 World</a></i>, he also produced Obie Trice's <i><a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheers_%28album%29.html" title="Cheers (album)">Cheers</a></i> as well as 50 Cent's <i><a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_Rich_or_Die_Tryin%27_3d98.html" title="Get Rich or Die Tryin'">Get Rich or Die Tryin'</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Massacre_5c95.html" title="The Massacre">The Massacre</a></i>.

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, some industry insiders are speculating that Eminem is considering concluding his rapping career after five years and numerous multi-platinum albums. Speculation began in early 2005 about a double disc album to be released late that year, titled <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Funeral_%28album%29_5c30.html" title="The Funeral (album)">The Funeral</a></i>. The rapper himself has not confirmed any of these rumors, which speculate that the album would revisit the various personas Eminem has portrayed while laying each to rest.</p>
<p>In July 2005, the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Free_Press_cb21.html" title="Detroit Free Press">Detroit Free Press</a> broke news of a <a href="http://www.freep.com/entertainment/music/encore15e_20050715.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.freep.com/entertainment/music/encore15e_20050715.htm" rel="nofollow">potential final bow</a> for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inside circle who said that he will begin to fully embrace the role of producer and label executive. The Free Press, Eminem's hometown paper, wrote that the aptly titled <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encore_%28album%29.html" title="Encore (album)">Encore</a></i> album would now stand as his final solo album.</p>
<p>Deep within Eminem's inner circle there is talk that the rapper is planning on retiring after he concludes his <i>Anger Management Tour</i> in Detroit. The reason for his retirement is to focus on acting, spending time with his daughter and niece, and more on his increasing popularity in production. Eminem and his manager Paul Rosenburg as well as their representatives will not comment on the situation. This may not mean his retirement from rapping completely, as he may well still contribute to many of his Shady Record artists projects as well as Dr. Dre's possible <i><a href="../../../d/e/t/Detox_%28album%29.html" title="Detox (album)">Detox</a></i> album.</p>
<p>Eminem recently announced via MTV news that he does not plan on retiring soon, though he is planning on taking a break to produce music. He is still uncertain whether another album will be released, but his career has not come to a full stop.</p>
