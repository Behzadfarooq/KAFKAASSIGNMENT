<p>Following an undergraduate education with a focus on thermo-fluids, I studied energy conversion in my first graduate program. I am now working on a second Masterâ€™s degree in sustainable energy utilization. Throughout these studies, I have focused on refrigeration and would like to concentrate my future research on sustainable refrigeration.</p>
<hr />
<p>In my first experimental experience in the laboratory, for my bachelor's thesis, namely domestic refrigerator condenser modeling and optimization by parameter estimation method, I developed a theoretical model applying parameter estimation method. I also set up a test rig to analyze the influence of different boundary conditions on the condenser heat transfer characteristics. The model and the experimental results were in good agreements. The thesis ranked among the best annual department research in the year within the undergraduate thesis. Later, the results and the outcomes of other similar research within the state were the basis of national energy saving policy in the household energy utilization. I submitted the results as a technical paper at two domestic journals and presented them in one conference on behalf of my thesis supervisor.</p>
<hr />
<p>In addition, I investigated the benefits of direct injection of carbon dioxide for transporting frozen foods in compared with the conventional refrigeration. Through this research I have built a solid knowledge of food preservation methods and standards as well as the particular transition condition of the mobile refrigeration in contrast to the stationary systems. I have published my first awarded master's degree thesis on this regard. The results were also subsequently published in a domestic technical journal.</p>
<hr />
<p>In another experimental project, applied energy technology, I examined the detailed application of propane in a small air-conditioning unit (Electrolux compact window-type) instead of R22 as the factory filled refrigerant. We rebuilt the unit to obtain 1.5 kW cooling capacity with the charge (propane) limitation of 100 g. As a member of the research team, I took the responsibility to search for the proper heat exchangers to replace the existing unit. We had to minimize the refrigerant charge due to high flammability of propane, available standards, and regulations. The search led me to believe that micro channel flat plate heat exchangers were the appropriate solution. I managed to get two second-hand sets from a subsupplier to a domestic vehicle manufacturing company. They did not have any data on the performance of these cold plates. I developed a simple estimation method that helped us in selecting the correct heat exchangers dimension to meet the desired capacity. We succeeded to achieve the objectives and presented our results to Electrolux representatives as well they were very impressed by our work.</p>
<hr />
<p>My current master's thesis has involved some combination of the interesting and exceptional objectives. As a laboratory test of NH3/CO2 cascade system for supermarket refrigeration, we have installed a test rig running with ammonia in high stage and carbon dioxide in low stage providing the cooling demand of almost 30 kW. It comprises medium temperature cabinets and low temperature freezers. We are seeking to evaluate the energy consumption, the performances, optimum circulation rate, gravity circulation, thermosyphon versus forced condensation, and the safety issues of the system. We have achieved some significant results already and expect to get more valuable design information in the future. There will be at least two technical papers in 7th IIR-Gustav Lorentzen Conference which will take place on May 2006 in Trondheim, Norway, illustrating our work and its results. One of the most challenging parts of the test has been tuning PID controllers for the compressors that would strongly affect the energy consumptions and efficiencies of the system. I have also achieved solid and valuable experiences in this area. Now I am working in the research laboratory setting up the conventional test rig to compare with NH3/CO2 test rig while they are being run at the same boundary conditions. Also there would be another master thesis form KTH in laboratory that I am assisting on that which is a similar test with CO2 transcritical cycle.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have had a personal particular interest in computational fluid dynamics, and have learned the different methods, modeling levels, and number of software such as STAR-CD, and FLUENT. I have enhanced my CFD modeling skills through the academic exercises as well as several voluntary tasks in numerical methods in energy technology and CFD courses in my master's study. Currently, due to the similarity of various simulation modules, I feel confident in applying different pre-processing, solver, and post-processing modules to figure out the problem at hand. I believe that this skill will help me to perform any specific analysis in each individual part of a refrigeration system.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have thoroughly studied the past trend, existing techniques, and the latest advanced research and development on refrigeration technology. This knowledge of prior works and my graduate studies have prepared me well to pursue a doctoral degree in advanced refrigeration. I would like to focus my research on finding innovative refrigeration technologies including the application of the new refrigerants as the environmental friendly alternatives to the existing coolants.</p>
<hr />
<p>Prior to my graduate studies in Sweden, I worked roundabout five years in the industrial piping, Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning design and construction. As a project manager assistant, I was in charge of leading two feasibility study projects. Accordingly I have developed a broad view on economical issues of a refrigeration system as a whole. I believe that cost analysis should be an integral part of technology development for the innovation is to be successful.</p>
<hr />
<p>Beside my learning interest, I enjoy teaching as well. I believe that I have the talent while I am also able to refer to my outstanding teaching experience in department of aerospace engineering during my military service. I honored the student selected best lab instructor and course lecturer among over 100 teachers in Sattari Air Force University.</p>
