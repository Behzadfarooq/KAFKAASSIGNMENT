<p>This is <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia policy</a>, but it's something that Middle-earth articles tend to be lacking. It's especially important for <i>us</i> to state where we are getting our information, since often different sources will contradict each other.</p>
<p>Most of the relevant books actually have their own articles. You can link to them. The exact format is not important, as long as the source of the information is clearly presented. A "References" section may be appropriate at the end of some articles.</p>
<p>This is less important with material that is commonly known or unlikely to be controversial. ("Frodo was actually Bilbo's cousin.") If, however, you are correcting something that is published in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Silmarillion_7dd6.html" title="The Silmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></i>, it's extremely important to say <i>where</i> you are getting it.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_Guidelines_for_Middle-earth_articles_7c50.html" title="Edit section: The Middle-earth canon">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Middle-earth canon</span></h2>
<p>See <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth_canon.html" title="Middle-earth canon">Middle-earth canon</a> for a discussion of what has been considered "canon" by Wikipedia editors. If you disagree about what we should be doing, take it up on the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Talk%7EMiddle-earth_canon_17f6.html" title="Talk:Middle-earth canon">Talk page</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't memorized all of the available source books, you can still edit articles: just edit with what you know. If you are careful to cite your sources, it will be easy for others to add what <i>they</i> know. For example, if you start an article on <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celeborn.html" title="Celeborn">Celeborn</a> and say that he is a <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindarin.html" title="Sindarin">Sindarin</a> Elf, that's a good beginning for someone else to come along later and clarify that in later writings he is said to be from <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valinor.html" title="Valinor">Valinor</a>.</p>
<p>In instances where this is particularly sticky, you can add the code {{mecanon}} to the top of the article. Then, at the bottom, add a section entitled "==Other versions of the legendarium==", in which you discuss the differences between the canon version in the article and older material.</p>
<p><a name="Take_care_regarding_movie_material" id="Take_care_regarding_movie_material"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_Guidelines_for_Middle-earth_articles_7c50.html" title="Edit section: Take care regarding movie material">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Take care regarding movie material</span></h2>
<p>Be careful not to state as fact something that you learned from the movies (or the radio adaptations, the roleplaying game, etc.), unless you have support from the book. If you haven't actually read the book, it is probably better to spend your time proofreading existing articles and helping to locate potential points of confusion.</p>
<p><a name="Explain_your_dates" id="Explain_your_dates"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_Guidelines_for_Middle-earth_articles_7c50.html" title="Edit section: Explain your dates">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Explain your dates</span></h2>
<p>You need to specify <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Age_dfda.html" title="First Age">First Age</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Age_974c.html" title="Second Age">Second Age</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Age_ede9.html" title="Third Age">Third Age</a>, or <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Age_d0ee.html" title="Fourth Age">Fourth Age</a> (or sometimes link to <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shire_Calendar_f680.html" title="Shire Calendar">Shire Calendar</a> for explanation of Shire Reckoning). It's best to do this with a link, since the reader may not know what these terms mean in Tolkien's world.</p>
<p>The format used by Tolkien in the Appendix on dates and calendars at the end of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i> is "<i>T.A. 3019</i>", where the abbreviation for the Age goes before the year. If one hasn't previously spelled out "Third Age" with a link, "T.A." should be linked to the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Age_ede9.html" title="Third Age">Third Age</a> article. (Note that without the link, one cannot distinguish between <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Age_dfda.html" title="First Age">First Age</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Age_d0ee.html" title="Fourth Age">Fourth Age</a>.</p>
<p>The calendars of <a href="../../../n/%C3%BA/m/N%C3%BAmenor.html" title="Númenor">Númenor</a> (during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Age_974c.html" title="Second Age">Second Age</a>), <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gondor.html" title="Gondor">Gondor</a> (during the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Age_ede9.html" title="Third Age">Third Age</a>), and the New Reckoning (during the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Age_d0ee.html" title="Fourth Age">Fourth Age</a>) should be assumed. When referring to Hobbits, it is appropriate to also use <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shire_Calendar_f680.html" title="Shire Calendar">Shire-reckoning</a> dates.</p>
<p>Some suggested possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Age_ede9.html" title="Third Age">T.A.</a> 3019, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Age_974c.html" title="Second Age">S.A.</a> 156, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Age_d0ee.html" title="Fourth Age">F.A.</a> 98, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Age_dfda.html" title="First Age">F.A.</a> 500</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/h/i/Shire_Calendar_f680.html" title="Shire Calendar">S.R.</a> 1419 <i>(note that here the link is to <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shire_Calendar_f680.html" title="Shire Calendar">Shire Calendar</a>)</i></li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Age_ede9.html" title="Third Age">Third Age</a> 3019</li>
<li>3019 in the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Age_ede9.html" title="Third Age">Third Age</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Explain_your_languages" id="Explain_your_languages"></a></p>

<p>Especially, don't just say "Elvish" when referring to language. Most names are <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quenya.html" title="Quenya">Quenya</a> or <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindarin.html" title="Sindarin">Sindarin</a>. This information should be provided when available. If it's in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i> and you don't know which Elvish language it came from, it was <i>probably</i> Sindarin. Other possibilities include <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westron.html" title="Westron">Westron</a> (the Common Speech), <a href="../../../k/h/u/Khuzdul.html" title="Khuzdul">Khuzdul</a> (the language of the <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf_%28Middle-earth%29_7673.html" title="Dwarf (Middle-earth)">Dwarves</a>), and <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valarin.html" title="Valarin">Valarin</a> (the language of the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valar.html" title="Valar">Valar</a>).</p>
<p><a name="Capitalize_consistently" id="Capitalize_consistently"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_Guidelines_for_Middle-earth_articles_7c50.html" title="Edit section: Capitalize consistently">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Capitalize consistently</span></h2>
<p>The following terms should be capitalized when referring to a race or a member of the race:</p>
<ul>
<li>Valar (singular <i>Vala</i>)</li>
<li>Maiar (singular <i>Maia</i>)</li>
<li>Istari (singular <i>Istar</i>)</li>
<li>Nazgûl, Ringwraith(s)</li>
<li>Hobbit(s)</li>
<li>Dwarves (singular <i>Dwarf</i>)</li>
<li>Elves (singular <i>Elves</i>)</li>
<li>Men (singular <i>Man</i>)</li>
<li>Orc(s)</li>
<li>Balrog(s)</li>
<li>Warg(s)</li>
<li>Eagle(s) (especially when referring to the Eagles of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manw%C3%AB.html" title="Manwë">Manwë</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proper_noun.html" title="Proper noun">proper nouns</a> and ought to be capitalized whenever they appear, including in titles of articles. The exception is <i>men</i>, which can be used to refer to a male of any race. (Lowercase <i>men</i>, for example, could include both adult male Elves and adult male humans.) Capitalized <i>Men</i> refers to <i>human beings</i> and is represented by a completely different word in Tolkien's languages.</p>
<p>Associated adjectives (<i>Dwarven</i>, <i>Elven</i>) are also capitalized, but some words like <i>wolves</i> and <i>dragons</i> usually are not.</p>
<p>There are other words that are usually capitalized within the context of Middle-earth (but not elsewhere), such as "Trees" when referring to the <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_Trees_of_Valinor_a1c2.html" title="Two Trees of Valinor">Two Trees of Valinor</a>.</p>
<p>It is especially important to be <i>consistent</i> within an article.</p>
<p><a name="Formatting:_bold_and_italics_with_names" id="Formatting:_bold_and_italics_with_names"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_Guidelines_for_Middle-earth_articles_7c50.html" title="Edit section: Formatting: bold and italics with names">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Formatting: bold and italics with names</span></h2>
<p>This seems to come up more with Middle-earth articles than in many other areas, probably because so many characters and places have multiple names.</p>
<p>Anything that would normally be italicized should generally be italicized in Wikipedia articles. (For Middle-earth articles, this especially includes book titles. Segments of the various <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_History_of_Middle-earth_ca50.html" title="The History of Middle-earth">The History of Middle-earth</a> books should generally go in quotes.)</p>
<p>It is '<i>not</i> necessary to italicize the first appearance of a name within an article. ("Beren was the son of <i>Barahir</i>.") It <i>is</i> a good idea to italicize words when they are referred to <i>as words</i>. ("The word <i>athelas</i> means...") Sometimes quotation marks help to keep long phrases connected in a translation, however.</p>
<p><b>Bold text</b> should be used, as per <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia convention</a>, for the first appearance of the article title within the text. (It's also good to avoid putting any links in this first appearance, although with the sort of names we end up with it's often tempting.)</p>
<p>Bold text should also be used for any alternate names or terms that refer back to the title of the article. It should <i>not</i> be used for unrelated names. ("<b>Beren</b>, the son of Barahir, was later called <i><b>Erchamion</b></i>." rather than "<b>Beren</b>, the son of <b>Barahir</b>...")</p>
<p>Again, what is important here is some degree of consistency, both within an article and so that others can more easily understand our articles.</p>
<p><a name="Categories" id="Categories"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_Guidelines_for_Middle-earth_articles_7c50.html" title="Edit section: Categories">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Categories</span></h2>
<p>Try to use the most specific possible sub-category of <a href="../../../m/i/d/Category%7EMiddle-earth_d3f4.html" title="Category:Middle-earth">Category:Middle-earth</a> (unless an article doesn't fall into any of the sub-categories, in which case it should go in the primary Middle-earth category).</p>
<p>If in doubt as to the appropriate sub-category (for example, was Elf X actually Sindarin?), place the article in the more general category so that someone else can make the call. The more general category should also be used if the information simply isn't available (say, for instance, that Elf X lived in Rivendell--so he might even be one of the few remaining <a href="../../../%C3%B1/o/l/%C3%91oldor.html" title="Ñoldor">Ñoldor</a>--but we have no idea what he was doing prior to the Third Age).</p>
<p><a name="Consider_significance" id="Consider_significance"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_Guidelines_for_Middle-earth_articles_7c50.html" title="Edit section: Consider significance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Consider significance</span></h2>
<p>If there isn't enough information to make a decent article, <i>don't create the article</i>. Consider adding to an existing article. Consider merging a <a href="../../../t/o/l/Category%7ETolkien_stubs_6386.html" title="Category:Tolkien stubs">Tolkien stub</a> into an existing article.</p>
<p>If you <i>know</i> that a subject is so minor that it's never going to deserve an article, don't link to it, either. Linking encourages someone to come along and fill the gap - is it a gap that needs to be filled? (If so, link away! But we don't really need an article about Beren's mother, do we? All that we know each other is likely already in the articles about <a href="../../../b/e/r/Beren.html" title="Beren">Beren</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barahir.html" title="Barahir">Barahir</a>, and if it's not, we can add it there.)</p>
<p><br />
Tiny, stub-like articles on inconsequential Middle-earth figures or topics don't really accomplish anything other than to annoy other Wikipedians who are less interested in Middle-earth than we are. The information is also more <i>useful</i> if it is contained in the relevant "parent" articles. I might want to look up the name of Beren's mother, but I'm probably not going to be searching for Emeldir.</p>
