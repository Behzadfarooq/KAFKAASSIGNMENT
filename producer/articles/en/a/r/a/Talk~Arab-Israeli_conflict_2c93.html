<dd>That's fine, but this is, as the title accurately suggests, more a survey of the military conflicts involving the two countries.

mikka and Tewfik have good ideas about reorganizing the article. Any Israel-Lebanon relations article would have to start from 1948 and include not just the numerous conflicts, but also as Tewfik stated, the ceasefire agreements, peace proposals, informal diplomatic positions (including Israeli-Phalangist relations most likely), unofficial trade, the Good Fence, the Security Zone and the SLA and Hezbollah. What is now <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel-Lebanon_conflict_a95d.html" title="Israel-Lebanon conflict">Israel-Lebanon conflict</a> could probably either redirect to the expanded article or to a specific section of the article dealing with the conflicts (assuming the article is organized with "conflict" as a sub-topic). There should probably also be an Israeli-Palestinian relations article since the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is actually just a part of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Also the interaction between Israel and the Palestinians is not just about conflict, there is also trade, peace proposals and other aspects to Israeli-Palestinian relations that are little known about because a lot of focus is on the conflict. Other articles could also be created including Israel-Egypt relations, Israel-Jordan relations and Israel-Syria relations with the first two having a lot more to detail than just conflict, e.g. tourism between Egypt and Israel and Jordan and Israel, cooperation between Jordan and Israel with regards to the Dead Sea, trade, former peace proposals, current peace treaties, diplomacy etc.208.131.191.252 16:30, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hate to barge in but there is a fundamental problem. I have read about ten lines of the article and have found a problem! This conflict did not start recently... not even AD, read the story of Isaac and Ishmael, and as both Jews and Muslims believe this was the beginnings of this conflict it would be decent of us all to put in what THEY believe and have consensus on... it must be right as they don't have consensus on much else.......</p>

<li>Good comment, and one we've heard before. However, technically, your analysis is not correct. Since the vast majority of the Zionists are actually Ashkenazi Jews, if you check your bible (Genesis 10), you will see that Ashkenaz was not a descendent of Shem. Therefore, the Zionists running Israel today who call themselves Jews are actually non-semitic, i.e. they are not descendents of Shem. Actually, they are converts to Judaism from the Khazars of the 8th century. You may also want to look up Rev. 2:9 and Rev. 3:9. Also, Isaac was not Jewish: he was a Hebrew. The word Jew is not mentioned in the Bible until 2 Kings.%%%% Sorry, wrong button 71.132.205.244 17:33, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree. One must also see the resemblence between the words "Palestine," modern enemies of the Jews, and "Philistine," enemies of the Jews since as early as Exodus. Same people. The Romans gave the Philistines the Jewish land out of rage and spite (giving land to one's enemies). Nowadays, mainly because of this, we can't have a Coke on our flight! Talk about the war of milennia. What has it been, 4000 years now? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidS888_aea2.html" title="User:DavidS888">DavidS888</a> 22:00, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with this guy- the cassus belli here is the expulsion of Hagar from Abraham's camp, in biblical lore... or, if you'd like on we could all agree on, the Quran's command that none but Muslims-(Ishmaelites)- shall hold the middle east. 75.183.149.139 03:35, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The history of conflict between the Israelis and Arabs is not as ancient as frequently believed. The Jewish people were conquered by the Romans and ceased to exist as an independent Jewish state long before the advent of Islam and the Arab conquest of the Middle East in the seventh century. After Islam emerged as a political and religious force in seventh century Medina (now part of Saudi Arabia), the Muslim and Jewish people did come into conflict in the Arabian Penninsula. However, the nexus, if any, between that early conflict and the present Arab-Israeli conflict is remote at best. Both groups have much in common. Both believe that they are descendants of Abraham and they are both monotheistic people. Many Arabs presently live comfortably as citizens of the State of Israel with few restrictions. In fact, at least on the surface, it is part of what the two sides have in common that lies at the heart of the current conflict. Both sides have long-term, historical ties to the disputed land that neither side is willing to relinquish. Simply put, the present conflict between the two groups revolves around a claimed right to the Holy Land and control of Jerusalem. Jews and Arabs consider Jerusalem to be a sacred site. In the seventh century, Arabs built sacred sites on top of the ruins of the most sacred Jewish site in Jerusalem. Competing claims to Jerusalem may well prove to be the impossible to resolve aspect of the conflict as the underlying land dispute, as discussed below, was wholly unnecessary. Because of the importance of Jerusalem to both sides, under the original United Nations mandate seeking to peacefully partition the land, Jerusalem was designated as an international city administered by the UN. That partition attempt by the United Nations was rejected by several Arab states and they attacked the nascent Jewish state of Israel in an expressly stated attempt to destroy it. Israel prevailed, but its existence has been vehemently opposed by many in the Arab and Islamic World with the result that several subsequent wars and violent skirmishes have ensued. These continued conflicts further deepened the dispute and added additional territory to the original land dispute. The underlying root cause of the conflict, other than the obvious territorial dispute, like so many issues related to the conflict, is highly contested. There are many theories as to the root cause and little consensus. For example, some believe that the root of the conflict is a direct result of Imperialism. Adherents to that view contend that after the British took control of the land following a mandate from the League of Nations to administer the land, that they mismanaged the competing claims to the land. They point out that the British used a small force to keep the peace without working to create a national government to administer the region and give the people a voice in deciding their own future. Without strong central authority and a viable plan to transfer control to the inhabitants and to peacefully resolve their differences, if possible, factions emerged both to protect and organize their respective groups into a cohesive community. Each side wanted, at a minimum, autonomy and was displeased with British governance. Arabs complained to the British about Jewish immigration and sought to curtail that immigration as much as possible. The Jews complained to the British about the limits placed on Jewish immigration and that the British were not only not defending them from Arab violence, but were hindering their ability to protect themselves from Arab aggression. Both sides contended that the British were biased against them and had broken promises to give them control of the land. No one disputed that Palestine, the Roman name for the land, was also the Promised Land. But to whom was it promised? "The Jew, who came first? Or the Arab, who was there last?" (Quoted from Lightning Out of Israel referenced below) It was an impossible problem for the British or anyone else to resolve considering that there had been a continuous Jewish presence in the land for thousands of years, much longer than the Arab presence; yet, the Arabs were the majority population. Both sides were willing to fight for the land and members of both sides attacked British soldiers or each other. Britain eventually came to understandably realize that it could not resolve the conflict and decided to withdraw from its mandate. The United Nations had to attempt to resolve the problem and legitimately attempted to do so. The eventual two state solution was not a mediated solution between the affected inhabitants; however, it was decided by the United Nations after considerable analysis and debate and a mediated resolution was impossible to obtain. The Arab nations were unwilling to recognize the legitimacy of Israel and sought to supplant Israel with some type of Arab or Palestinian state. Many disagree with the allegation that the root of the conflict arises from Imperialism and attribute the root cause of the problem to Islamic anti-Semitism with its origins dating back to the rise of Islam in the seventh century. Several verses from the Koran, such as chapter 2, verses 61 and 65; chapter 3, verse 71; chapter 4, verse 46; chapter 5, verses 60-65, and 78-82; and chapter 7, verse 166 assign negative attributes to Jews. In addition, the type of institutionalized discrimination mandated by the Pact of Umar applied to Jews throughout the Islamic World to one degree or the other over the centuries inevitably led to deeply ingrained feelings of a natural right to Muslim authority over any Jews living in the Middle East or North Africa. Muslims also developed an abiding belief in the supremacy of Islam as a result of its early conquests and centuries long position as a dominant religious and political force in the Middle East and beyond. The relative decline of Islam as a dominant military and political force has ultimately engendered in the Islamic World a deep seated desire to regain Islam's past glory. The presence of Israel, a Jewish state and democracy, in the heart of the Islamic World is very difficult for Muslims to accept. It is very difficult for Muslims to reconcile Israel's presence and its regional military supremacy with the prevalent Muslim view that, as recipients of Allah's final revelation, that no Muslims should be subject to the political supremacy of a Jewish state. It followed that, regardless of the small size of Israel and the vastly larger land mass of the surrounding Arab lands, from the Muslim perspective, Israel's existence was a cancer in the heart of the Islamic World. Because the source of the conflict may well be deeply ingrained in the centuries old religious and political experience of the Islamic World, full resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict has defied all attempts. Many analysts, including Henry Kissinger, have concluded that the Arab-Israeli conflict is incapable of any foreseeable, permanent resolution and that all that can be achieved is some degree of crisis management. The attribution of Imperialism as the alleged source of the Israeli-Arab conflict also fails to account for the fact that the United Nations had thoroughly investigated the conflict prior to voting to recognize Israel and partition that portion of Palestine not already assigned to Jordan, an Arab state and monarchy, into separate Jewish and Palestinian homelands. Such diverse countries as the United States and U.S.S.R., bitter cold war opponents at the time with divergent interests, both voted for the partition and to recognize Israel as a nation which suggests that the partition was as objectively fair as learned minds could determine. Proponents of the view that the root cause of the conflict stems from deep-seated animosities point out that, at the time hostilities commenced, the land was far from its historic high population levels and the existing high population level today. There was, therefore, no legitimate reason for the fervent Arab opposition to continued Jewish immigration. They further point out that the Jewish immigrants toiled hard to reclaim lost agricultural land and develop the land and their efforts were raising the standard of living of both Jews and Muslims, as well as health standards and life expectancies. Jewish efforts were benefitting all of Palestine's inhabitants. They also point out that Israel's fair treatment of its Arab citizens proves that Arabs had no reason to fear Jewish immigration and statehood. Whatever the original origins of the conflict may be, it is clear that the conflict seems to be gaining in intensity for many reasons. There are Palestinians who were displaced during the conflict and their desire to return to their former property within the borders of modern day Israel has certainly contributed to the conflict. Similarly, the conflict resulted in the voluntary and involuntary expulsion of Jews throughout the Islamic World and the ingathering of many of them to Israel. That population infusion of displaced Jews into Israel, the Arab states' considerable reluctance to reciprocate and accept large numbers of Palestinians as welcome fellow Arabs and citizens, as well as Israel's demand that any right of return granted to Palestinians must involve a comprehensive, permanent peace, has also contributed to the ongoing nature and exacerbation of the dispute. A fundamentalist Islamic awakening or revival has added additional religious fervor to the conflict. Some Jews and Christians also believe that God promised the land to the Jews and that Israel's borders should be expanded to their ancient boundaries, or at least to include Judea and Sumeria (commonly referred to as the West Bank), further adding to the conflict. Palestinians also become enraged when Jewish settlers take up residence in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. It is anticipated that rising population density in the region will add further demands to the limited land space and already strained water supplies and potentially deeply exacerbate the conflict.</p>

<p>arab-israeli wars make no sense, nor crusades. here is proof: by definition, the koran and new testaments form portions of the talmud, if the talmud is defined as the sum of the spoken words of the greatest rabbis<br />
one could define the greatest rabbis to be the men who use the torah to influence the world most greatly<br />
because mohammed and jesus followed moses' teachings, we are all one<br />
likewise, hinduism is analagous to judaism, and confucianism and buddhism derived from it</p>

<p>[Not hugely strong feelings ahead]... It seems to me that this merge only creates a longer article, while replacing a passable summary with quite a bit of reading. It's also possible, even likely that other sections could emerge in the main article, such as <i>Superpower Involvement</i>, <i>Popular Portrayals</i>, <i>Refugees</i>, <i>Relation to Other Conflicts</i>, and the so-called satellite states: Turkey, Iran, Ethiopia. Once anyone of those issues were added, we've have a too long article and have to split again: with the best way being to abstract history into its own page. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarwil_fe69.html" title="User:Carwil">Carwil</a> 16:31, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate your effort. Unfortunately that image still has major problems:
<ol>
<li>Why Lebanon is the same color as the West Bank?</li>
<li>I understand that this is just an outline, but you are proposing to switch from a better quality map to a _much_ worse one. E.g. compare the maps of <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bank_e8a4.html" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and their outlines on your map. The <a href="../../../g/a/z/Gaza_Strip_3c76.html" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a> is missing entirely.</li>
<li>The conflict has nothing to do with Africa. It is the Arab League states vs. Israel. IMHO, the difference in color between the Arab states that have warred and that have not should not be significant, because they are not the third side in the conflict. They were/are still in conflict, just by other means. (see <a href="../../../a/r/a/Image_talk%7EArab-Israeli_Map1.GIF_2167.html" title="Image talk:Arab-Israeli Map1.GIF">Image talk:Arab-Israeli Map1.GIF</a> and archives of this talk page where this has been discussed in lentgh)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Also, a couple of minor notes: an inset with the location on the world map would be nice. The status of W. Sahara needs to be verified. And green is a poor choice for Israel, as it is the commonly accepted color of Islam. Blue would be more preferred. Perhaps converting this map GIF→PNG would be easier.

I really cannot understand why you have a problem with the current border as its not as if it makes it hard to read or anything. Furthermore, the image you attempted to replace it with was obviously inferior in many ways.

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of World War II the conflict became a major international issue. Great Britain, the United Nations along with the United States, and the USSR were determined to initiate a two-state solution. The UN mandated partition was put into effect in 1948, but was rejected by the Arab states and was the beginning of the first major Arab-Israeli War. Israel was able to achieve a decisive victory. Today many parts play major roles in the conflict among those are the Quartet on the Middle East. The conflict included a great number of major wars including the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, 1956 Suez War, 1967 Six Day War, 1970 War of Attrition, 1973 Yom Kippur War, 1982 Lebanon War, as well as a number of lesser conflicts. In the late spring of 1967, Gamal Abdel Nasser pushed tensions to the brink again until, responding to the mounting threat, the Israelis unleashed a devastating preemptive air attack. <b>Superb</b> intelligence, planning, and execution resulted in the swift destruction of the air forces of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, accompanied by <b>equally successful</b> blitzkriegs on the ground. The "Six-Day War" ended with Israel in possession of the West Bank and Golan Heights in addition to the Sinai. Arab-Israeli combat was now sophisticated enough for the world to pay attention to its military lessons, and observers noted how tanks and planes still dominated modern warfare. In the aftermath of the 1967 disaster, Nasser took a different tack, harassing the Israelis with raids and artillery strikes in what became known as the War of Attrition. Arab revenge of a sort came in 1973, when Egypt and Syria struck in unison on Yom Kippur. Strategic and tactical surprise, combined with an overwhelming ratio of forces, led to initial Arab victories in both theaters. Nevertheless, Israeli counterthrusts regained the lost ground and more, and the war stopped when the superpowers intervened to prevent further Arab losses. <b>Once again the world learned military lessons,</b> this time about how surface-to-air missiles and antitank weapons could humble even Israeli planes and armor. In the course of these conflicts, many Arabs were displaced from what is now Israel, and many Jews were displaced from what is now Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, the Palestinian Territories, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen.</p>

<p>In reference to this passage- "The UN mandated partition was put into effect in 1948, but was rejected by the Palestinians in collusion with newly formed Muslim neighbor states of Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. These countries, in collusion with the Palestinians, and with a view to enlarge their land holdings, attacked the newly formed Israeli state with far superior numbers and equipment.

<p>Why is there so much emphasis about the religious aspect of the conflict in the lead? As far as I know, the origins of the wars had nothing to do with the fact that Israel is a Jewish state, nor the fact that Arab states are majoritarly muslims. It wasn't either a consequence of an Islam-Judaism conflict. So I'll remove these terms from the lead since they are not relevant to the subject. <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedar-Guardian_25dc.html" title="User:Cedar-Guardian">CG</a> 21:41, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right. There is too much mention of Judaism and Islam. Some mention should remain, however, since it is key to understanding the conflict. <a href="../../../i/_/m/User%7EI_m_dude2002_9fa4.html" title="User:I m dude2002">I m dude2002</a> 20:57, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a reader who is (admittedly) not as familiar with the history and depth of the conflict, I feel that it is important to have a small section about the extent of various factors, such as a religion, culture, ethnicity, oil, money, etc. A series of bullet points (with links obviously) would be appropriate.

<p>The influx of Jews alarmed Palestinian leadership, and Muslim religious leaders helped to foment hatred which led to periodic violence:</p>
<p>"As long as the terrorist activity was directed only at Jewish targets, the Mufti, as well as the British administration saw nothing wrong with this. On the contrary, it fell in line with prevalent anti-Jewish policy of the time; the Mufti encouraged it and apparently extended financial aid to al-Qassam and his organization."</p>
<p><br />
Actually,</p>
<p>the Jews and Muslims were for the most part, living peacefully together. even to the extent that they would watch each other's children when they would go worship. Then the Zionists showed up and began a campaign of terror, which all three major religions in the area had a problem with. As a matter of fact, real Jews wanted nothing to do with the Zionists. It wasn't until Hitler started his holocaust that the Zionists were able to capitalize and get desperate fleeing Jews to finally hijack ALL RESIDENTS OF PALESTINE and create a 'Jewish' state. (which was actually a zionist state, since the Jews originally wanted nothing to do with it.)</p>

<dd>There have certainly been acts of terror on the part of Israeli Jews over the years. That cannot be denied. However, when one compares the Israeli community with the Arab community, it is clear to see that Arabs are the ones who most often resort to terrorism in pursuing their aims. Whether this is justified or not is a different issue, but it is clear that there have been more Palestinian, Lebanese, Egyptian, Saudi and Jordanian terrorists than Israeli ones (per capita... overal.. or whichever way you want to look at it).</dd>
<dd>Hman, I understand that you object to some of the things that the article mentions. But the reality of the situation is that Israel and Israelis are much more self-restrained in their response than their Arab counterparts. It isn't POV to state reality. <a href="../../../i/_/m/User%7EI_m_dude2002_9fa4.html" title="User:I m dude2002">I m dude2002</a> 20:56, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I m dude2002, thank you for your respectful rebuttal to my statement. However, I have to strongly disagree with you. If one were to draw a conclusion based solely on the popular media, then surely, what you say is true and the arabs are the biggest terrorists in the world. But the reality is that settlers have been terrorizing Palestinians the entire twentieth century. There is alot of written media and filmed footage which can be obtained if one digs a little deeper than FOX news or CNN. When three Israelis are killed in a suicide bombing, then it is plastered as breaking news on all media outlets. When a band of settlers violently terrorizes a Palestinian village until they pack up and leave and go live in tents in the desert, you may be lucky to read about it on page 40. So, this results in skewed views such as yours. I don't mean this as an insult. I'm just pointing it out and encouraging you to look beyond the monopolized American and British media sources. It isn't POV to state reality&#160;? Let's first define reality. hman0217 16:49, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jayjg, that is not exactly where I found the quote but, out of respect for the encyclopedia I will only quote from primary sources. In the meantime, you continue to negate my removal of 'and with a view to enlarge their land holdings' in the next paragraph. This is supposedly sourced from the opinion column of the LA Times, which is hardly a scholarly credible source. Furthermore, I went to the source and this statement is not even included. My edits should not be the only ones singled out for scrutiny. Then again, that is par for the course with this entire conflict. I will be back. hman0217 20:55, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the thoughtful response.They are all strong POVs. I don't understand why every time I delete the state 'with a view to enlagre land holdings', which does not exist when one goes to the link of the source(which happens to be an opinion column), this gets placed back in. Is this claim not controversial&#160;? I will quote from primary sources and say where I got them. It is my expectation however, that with solid backing for my statements (saying where I got it), my additions will enjoy equal weight with the opinion column of the LA Times as well as a book written by a highly biased pro-Israel author. hman0217 7:10, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article needs a major face lift. But it's clear there's an editting war in progress, of which I feel that I have been guilty. Perhaps it might be best of all the editors involved in this article discussed what they wanted the article to look like before they editted it.</p>
<p>There's a reason this article is crappy in spite of the fact that there is very much good information to be had about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the conflict should be broked down by time period, with each period receiving its own mention of acts of aggression (and calls for peace) on both the Arab side and Israeli side.</p>

<dd>An influx of Jewish immigrants into the Palestine, at this time a British <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandate.html" title="Mandate">mandate</a>, created tensions between the Jewish population, most of which had long been exiled from the area, and the Arab population, which had resided in what is now Israel for over a thousand years.<sup id="_ref-Sela_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Sela" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>These tensions became increasingly great as Jewish militia groups fought for independence from the United Kingdom.

<dd>In 1965, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon commenced construction which would divert the course of multiple rivers so that they would not flow into Israel.

<dd>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a> of that year, Israel sent almost all of its planes on a secret and preemptive mission in Egypt, in order to respond to what Israel perceived as continued acts of aggression by its largest Arab neighbor. The <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_Air_Force_4b7e.html" title="Israeli Air Force">Israeli Air Force</a> (AIF) dealt a heavy blow to the Egyptian airforce while its planes were still grounded, but in doing so essentially declared war against the Egypt and its allies--Syria and Jordan. When Jordan declared that it had officially joined the war, in spite of Israeli calls for neutrality, the IAF turned eastward and destroyed much of the Jordanian Air Force, in whose fate the Syrian airforce and Iraqi airforce (which aided the tripartate alliance) followed soon thereafter.

<dd>On October 21, 1967, an Egyptian torpedo boat sank <i>The Eilat</i>, and in June of the following year, Egypt began bombarding Israeli positions on the east side of the Suez Canal.

<dd>Meantime, in Jordan, <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Hussein_5bce.html" title="King Hussein">King Hussein</a>'s agreement to the Rogers Plan constituted a recognition of Israel, in violation of the <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khartoum_Resolution_24da.html" title="Khartoum Resolution">Khartoum Resolution</a>.

<dd>Good point. Perhaps the article should remain as much of a summary as it is now, but cover a broader span of the conflict. It seems to cover the very beginning in great depth, and the very end in great depth, but not a lot in the middle. <a href="../../../i/_/m/User%7EI_m_dude2002_9fa4.html" title="User:I m dude2002">I m dude2002</a> 01:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright. I cut the history by <i>a lot</i>. I know it looks much longer than the version which it replaced. Bear in mind, however, that that version was three solid blocks of text, whereas this consists of many small paragraphs. I therefore estimate that this is somewhere close to twice the length of the previous version, which is not immensely beyond what you suggested. If something in this version seems unecessary or POV to you, please feel free to discuss it (or, if you feel an urgent need, remove it, and we can discuss it ex-post-facto).

<li>The conflict "required international involvement to seek and promote a peaceful resolution" - This sounds as if it got already resolved. There is plenty of evidence to the contrary, that the international involvement actually made this conflict worse.</li>

<dd>Humus, I agree with some of your points. But as for the first one, I think the question of why the conflict is going on is crucial to the article. Yes... it's important that we objectively look at reliable historical sources. But if we don't evaluate the causes behind the Arab-Israeli Conflict, this article is of little use to readers who want to know the causes behind it. Of course, there are two sides to this: what causes the Israelis to feel threatened and what causes the Arabs to feel threatened may or may not be legitimate concerns, but they are crucial to understanding the conflict. <a href="../../../i/_/m/User%7EI_m_dude2002_9fa4.html" title="User:I m dude2002">I m dude2002</a> 02:51, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
