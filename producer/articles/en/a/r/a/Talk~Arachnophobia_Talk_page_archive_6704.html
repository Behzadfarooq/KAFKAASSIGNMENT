<p>"Arachnophobia is, in many cases, the result of a traumatizing encounter with spiders in one's early childhood, though the experience may not be remembered."</p>
<p>Is there any evidence for this? It sounds like simplistic Freudian dogma to me. Perhaps it should be expressed more hypothetically. 195.212.29.83 13:33, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right. It does sound dubious. I always thought it was generally just a lifetime of cultural conditioning and societal influences, but I have no sources to back this up. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBennyD_5595.html" title="User:BennyD">BennyD</a> 06:53, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally my arachnophobia is caused by traumatic experience - however is it accurate to claim that it's the case for everyone?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I cannot personally remember anything that caused my arachnophobia, be it a childhood experience or anything else. But I personally know a few arachnophobic's who' phobia was caused by a traumatic experience. Such as my friend who's father killed a rather large spider on her pillow one night, she woke up to him killing it right next to her face... As for the theory on "Traumatic Childhood experiences" causing phobias, its not so much a "Fredian dogma" case as it seems. There seems to be a high number of cases in which fear is learned through either association with something else that's scary (Such as loud sounds) or more commonly it seems, through learned behavior as a small child or even as a baby. I remember watching a show on The Science Channel about phobias where they took a small child and give him a rabbit, which he played with. Then they held the rabbit to him and made loud noises and scared the child with mask (Note this was an experiment conducted probable before 1950). After they sacred the child with the various things and the rabbit, they handed him just the rabbit, to which he screamed in fear. It also seems phobias are a learned behavior where children will see someone, usually a parent or sibling, react badly to something, and thus see's that thing or object as something bad or to be feared. I assume this is where my phobia comes from, as both my parents did not like spiders, and I am a 5'10" 315lbs guy who screams like a nancy boy at the sight of a spider. So these seem to be the two main causes of phobias for people. Early childhood trauma and Learned Behavior, which the second of the two, seems to have far more evidence. It could be argued that for the case of Learned Behavior, a majority of our learning basic skills is done within the first 3 or so years of our life. Seeing someone older react to something harshly, may trigger a fear. The same can be said for learning a language, babies learn to talk through observation, and the same could be said for a fear. It should also be noted that babies are normally afraid of nothing physical. Place a small child with a snake, spider, lizard, dog, cat, anything, and that child will not show fear, assuming the animal doesn't hurt it.--<a href="../../../a/z/s/User%7EAzslande_9d17.html" title="User:Azslande">Azslande</a> 13:59, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Surely you could have a traumatic experience with almost any animal or object? This hypothesis does nothing to explain why a fear of spiders should be so much more common than almost any other fear.</p>
<p>By contrast, people I know with a phobia to dogs remember clearly the incident that caused it (usually involving getting bitten). I'm convinced that the extremely high incidence of arachnophobia requires a far more subtle explanation - hypothecating hundreds of millions of isolated (and conveniently repressed) incidences of 'childhood trauma' is at best improbable.</p>
<p>I certainly know my own phobia is nothing to do with conditioning - all I remember is my parents telling me not to be so silly! By contrast my parents would react with disgust to flies and ants in the house, and whilst I don't exactly welcome them in, I have no phobia of them. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKisch_3350.html" title="User:Kisch">Kisch</a> 23:24, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm an arachnophobe- a 40 year old chap who's absolutely terrified by large spiders, although bizarrely not small ones- there seems to be some kind of size above which they suddenly become terrifying. I just found this page because I just had to deal with a huge spider in my kitchen btw- something which always involves staying at a conisderable distance, I'm simply too scared to get up close. Hadda kill it with a very long bit of wood&#160;:) Anyway- I'm a lifelong arachnophobe, so is my sister. Neither of our parents are, and think we're daft. Neither of us had any specific traumatic experiences that we can recall (just thinking, it's possible my (older) sister taught me her fear by example???) but it seems to me that the traumatic experience reasoning is circular. You need to already be scared in order to be traumatised, surely? If you're not an arachnophobe, presumably as a baby you wouldn't mind, say, a huge spider crawling into your cot- you wouldn't find the experience traumatic so couldn't get traumatised and so on.82.71.30.178 23:07, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>...and eerily enough, just after posting that a large Crane Fly flew into the room. I've always been terrified of them as well, but of late had reduced that fear to a minor annoyance with them- to the point that I'd just grab them out of the air. Except right now, apparently still aroused by the encounter with the spider, suddenly I was too frightened to approach the Crane Fly, something I was fearless enough to do last time one flew in. Hmmm, fascinating... 82.71.30.178 23:12, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I remember when my arachnophobia kicked in quite vividly. As a small child, I used to climb trees when I was at my grandmother's - kids do that. Several years later (I was 8 or 9), I decided to climb an old pine tree which my friends and I had so much fun on. Then, close to the top, when I squeezed my head through some branches, right there in front of my face, a few centimeters away, was a thick web with hundreds and hundreds of little spiders crawling on it. Instantly I got the feeling of those little bastards crawling all over my face... I never climbed a tree again, and I vacuum each and every spider I see in my house since (after, of course, gathering the strength to come near it). I know it's irrational, but I can't help it. I've seen the horrors of war, I've seen people in my squad blown to pieces by artillery fire (and I've had them die in my arms), but place a spider on me, a grown man, and I'll start crying and hysterically screaming. --89.172.10.207 22:03, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Spiders are on the very top, as a matter of fact, they are number one on my list of fears. I don't fear much,but spiders and I just don't get along. I was bitten twice and I have the scars to show for it. Every time I see a spider I freeze up and shreak!!To be honest with you I would highly appreciate it,if you would be so kind as to remove those eecky photos of those horrible spiders!!Thank you!!(user:Amber Gates)4:17a.m.,13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
