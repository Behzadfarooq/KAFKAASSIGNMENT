<p>Dear Aramgutang</p>
<p>I know that this iamge is declared as copyright free on the page, but I just thought it would be nice to ask you if it is ok / let you know how I was planning to use it. I am working on a materials science teaching and learning package (TLP), for the UK centre for materials education, as part of the doitpoms project <a href="http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, to devolop completely copyright free, interactive materials education packages. This image makes a good basis for a worked example question. If you could just let me know if there would be any problem using the image I would be very grateful.</p>

<p>I am trying to get an idea what do you have in common with <a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabib_5b29.html" title="User:Tabib">User:Tabib</a>, playing role of Armenian guy at the same time. I get a feeling that there is something here that I don't quite understand. First of all, do you really speak Russian? Second, why you choose so obscure and anti-Armenian user name? <a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovoam_02c5.html" title="User:Rovoam">Rovoam</a> 22:39, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think I have much in common with Tabib, and I disagree with most of his beliefs and contributions to Wikipedia. However, I do believe in Wikipedia's NPOV policy and that "history is a lie agreed upon" (--Voltaire), and thus that arguments should always be presented in the form of "this is what these people believe happened and this is what these other people believe is true" on Wikipedia, avoiding concrete statements of fact about any past event. Also, I am not "playing the role" of an Armenian guy, I am in fact Armenian, born and raised in Yerevan, thus I could (and still can) speak Russian in addition to Armenian from a very early age. Since my real name is Aram, a common Armenian name, I find the username Aramgutang to be a funny combination of my name and the word "orangutang". --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAramgutang_2d19.html" title="User:Aramgutang">Aram</a><b><strong class="selflink">գուտանգ</strong></b><a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 00:15, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It sounds like it really does not matter much to you if history facts would be told based on Tabib's writings and not on <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strabo.html" title="Strabo">Strabo</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Plinius Secundos</a>, <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy.html" title="Ptolemy">Clavdius Ptolemeus</a> writings... But... why referencing the above mentioned history sources should be prohibeted? <b>Do <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strabo.html" title="Strabo">Strabo</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/i/Pliny_the_Elder_bac4.html" title="Pliny the Elder">Plinius Secundos</a>, <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemy.html" title="Ptolemy">Clavdius Ptolemeus</a> support pro-Armenian point of view?</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why should we allow Tabib to present Azeri point of view and call it NPOV, not even trying to say that there are also other points of view, which are based on well known historical facts?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Should Wikipedia become Azeripedia or even Turkipedia? Is Wikipedia a good place for promoting Turkic and anti-Armenian propaganda? <b>Is this what you call NPOV?</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>From what you just stated above, I understand that because the "history is a lie agreed upon", we don't have to try to do any historical research at all, and Azeri lie is the best lie ever. If your statement is true, what are you doing here, in Wikipedia? Don't you think you simply waste your time? I thought, we are here to learn something new and to share our knowledge with others. I don't mind excepting any truth (Arminian or non-Armenian), but I don't want lie, especially as a part of someone's propaganda (which has been created in purpose)!</dd>

<dd>You have to understand that I know very little about history, and it was never a subject that interested me. Thus I would have a hard time debating about historical facts, and I generally prefer not to get involved in things I know nothing about. I prefer to contribute to Armenian bias in Wikipedia constructively by writing articles about places in Armenia or important Armenians, rather than arguing endlessly with Turks or Azeris trying to push their agenda. Again, it's not that I agree with their version of history, it's that I don't know or care enough about history to argue with them. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAramgutang_2d19.html" title="User:Aramgutang">Aram</a><b><strong class="selflink">գուտանգ</strong></b><a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 14:47, 16 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a few photos of Armenia. I can't believe it, but I don't have one of Khor Virap (I have a picture of a bad view from it.) I added a photo of a little model of the monastery I have.</p>
<p>I will look through my collection to find photos of other places and landmarks and get back to you. <a href="../../../d/m/n/User%7EDmn_b398.html" title="User:Dmn">Dmn / Դմն</a> 16:51, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have just returned from my trip from Armenia and now I'm writing some articles about it into Slovenian (sl:) Wikipedia. Among other photos I also have a few from Khor Virap (not very successful, though, and the Ararat was not visible through clouds) but unfortunately at Geghard my camera's batteries emptied so if you are ready to share at least one with me. Otherwise thanks for correcting my contribution to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mer_Hayrenik_c6bd.html" title="Mer Hayrenik">Mer Hayrenik</a> (obviously I do not speak Armenian). If you manage to find any errors at the Armenian alphabet at <a href="../../../../sl/a/r/m/Armen%C5%A1%C4%8Dina.html" class="extiw" title="sl:Armenščina">sl:Armenščina</a> (I prepared it just before traveling there) feel free to drop remarks at its discussion ("pogovor") page. Maybe I can ask you about one detail about the alphabet I'm not quite sure about. If somebody doesn't do it with better photos I will add mine to your Armenian landmarks articles ASAP.</p>
<p>BTW for some other purposes I also "composed" a character converting script and it's usable for Wikipedia, too. It is available <a href="http://members.lycos.co.uk/forumchars/main.html" class="external text" title="http://members.lycos.co.uk/forumchars/main.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and you also have "keyboards" with many European (and Armenian, too) languages characters. PHP source code is available upon request. --<a href="../../../f/p/g/User%7EFpga_1a64.html" title="User:Fpga">Fpga</a> 07:26, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, yes I also added some non religious facts to your <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanahin.html" title="Sanahin">Sanahin</a> article. --<a href="../../../f/p/g/User%7EFpga_1a64.html" title="User:Fpga">Fpga</a> 07:30, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just uploaded my photos to <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khor_Virap_c031.html" title="Khor Virap">Khor Virap</a>. However I have no idea about their layout... --<a href="../../../f/p/g/User%7EFpga_1a64.html" title="User:Fpga">Fpga</a> 09:36, 19 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm afraid that what I wrote under <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Sevan_789c.html" title="Lake Sevan">Lake Sevan</a> in Armenian script is actually a town, not the lake. So if you can take a second and check this out... What about words containing 'և', is this letter replaced by 'եվ' in Western Armenian? Unfortunately I don't have any photos from <a href="../../../g/e/g/Geghard.html" title="Geghard">Geghard</a> as my camera batteries were empty while being there&#160;:-( --<a href="../../../f/p/g/User%7EFpga_1a64.html" title="User:Fpga">Fpga</a> 06:25, 26 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm writing an article (with photos) about Odzun, a well known church just above Alaverdi, and I don't know how to write it in Armenian script. Probably it can't start with 'Ո' as in that case it would probably be "Vodzun" while the letter 'Օ' is probably younger than the church and reserved for the words of foreign origin. --<a href="../../../f/p/g/User%7EFpga_1a64.html" title="User:Fpga">Fpga</a> 09:16, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Sevan_789c.html" title="Lake Sevan">Lake Sevan</a> in Armenian written as Սեվանի լիչ (western) and Սևանի լիչ (eastern) or should չ be replaced by ճ? BTW, <a href="../../../o/d/z/Odzun.html" title="Odzun">Odzun</a> is finnished from my side. --<a href="../../../f/p/g/User%7EFpga_1a64.html" title="User:Fpga">Fpga</a> 11:01, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I don't iknow if you have noticed my article about a <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khachkar.html" title="Khachkar">khachkar</a> which is probably the last one with my photos from Armenia. Maybe it would be interesting to write the word in Armenian script (2 possible letters for 'ch', 'k' and 'r' give 2^3=8 possible combinations) and if you have any objections against its transliteration into English (or anything else inside the article), please let me know about it so that I can update Slovenian article. --<a href="../../../f/p/g/User%7EFpga_1a64.html" title="User:Fpga">Fpga</a> 12:41, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>With regards to your Unicode conversion script: I don’t see the need for it. All current browsers I know of will already convert characters outside of the webpage’s encoding into numeric references. Am I missing something here, or is this only intended for really archaic webbrowsers of the Mosaic generation, such as Netscape (pre-Mozilla) and MSIE≤4&#160;?

<dl>
<dd>I understand now: I meant that if I type the <i>actual characters</i> (e.g. <b>Какой-нибудь текст в Кириллице</b>), if the page encoding does not support it (and then no matter what encoding is used), it will be changed into numeric references. I was <i>not</i> talking about typing e.g. <b>Êàêîé-íèáóäü òåêñò â Êèðèëëèöå</b> and then relying on the encoding magic to transcribe them into Russian. I now understand what you would use your script for — but as I generally type the characters directly it is not something I’d ever need. Thanks for clarifying!

<p>Hi, I see you've edited the <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_a51f.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> article. There is a fierce dispute over the contents of this page right now and I have coaxed the disputants over to the talk page and am attempting to get them to work together. They have begun working together (a little). I am serving as an unlicensed mediator. The ground rules I set in order to get them to stop reverting each other were that I would lock down the main page and perform any agreed-to edits; so far there have been no agreements — and both parties are preparing their own versions in their user space. The only changes I have made so far to the article are the removal of the contentious bits. My 'lock-down' and authority in this matter is, of course, entirely a bluff. If you visit <a href="../../../n/a/g/Talk%7ENagorno-Karabakh_05f4.html" title="Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh">Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, you'll find my <i>rules</i> — one of which is a promise to recuse myself upon request; anyone's request. This whole process has been brought to a fair number of people's attention and I've gotten no requests yet, so I infer a tacit approval.</p>
<p>I'm going to have to revert your changes in order to maintain my arrangement with the disputants. I promise that I will get your changes into the article again (I'm aware of quite a number of short comings to the current placeholder page). I would really welcome your participation on the talk pages (<i>pages</i> is more accurate; it's 180K and counting). Thanks for your understanding and sorry, really sorry, about the revert. —&#160;<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavenbelle_b624.html" title="User:Davenbelle">Davenbelle</a> 14:21, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aramgutang - you wrote: <i>I would like to suggest that the Czechia-geo-stub be unprotected, because even if the edit war continues and escalates, it will not affect the readers looking at the articles with the stub message a great deal. The current protected message box is big and unsightly and may lead readers to think that the article itself is protected. What's even worse, the talk page link in the message box points to the article's talk page, instead of the template's talk page.</i></p>
<p>The protection message should have been on the template's talk page (where it is now). What the reader sees is irrelevant as far as stub templates and categorisation are concerned. Repeated changing of stub categories requires a lot of work from stub sorters. For every edit that is being made by NoPuzzleStranger and (his probable sockpuppet) Starky to change a stub category, 101 are currently required by stub sorters to revert it, since every article in the category requires a null-edit to move it to the correct categorisation. For that reason the protection is necessary - stub sorters are overworked enough without having to perform massive extra duties every time a stub template is moved. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 02:50, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aram,</p>
<p>Today Rovoam vandalized the N-K page again. He disappeared for a while after his username and some of the IPs he operated under were blocked. I had a little hope that he's gone for good, but unfortunately, this wasn't the case. I am afraid that this person, even if blocked, will return from time to time and acting under various IPs will vandalize the N-K page. I will revert all his vandalisms (be it explicit or implicit) and I know that many other editors will do the same, as they did before.</p>
<p>The page version which is in place is certainly not that bad in terms of neutrality and accuracy, although it certainly needs further improvement. And we both agreed on this important point. If the current content, despite all of its deficiencies, is generally acceptable to both you and me, then I believe there can be only two reasons why the current version is not acceptable to Rovoam: 1) he wants the page to reflect one-sided nationalist propaganda, and/or 2) he vandalizes the page simply out of feeling of revenge and personal enmity against me. Most probably both factors are applicable.</p>
<p>Aram, I want to suggest you cooperation over Nagorno-Karabakh page. Let’s join our efforts to protect Nagorno-Karabakh page from nationalist propaganda and vandalism (whether from Azeri or Armenian or even “neutrall” sides) and also to improve it further to reflect both viewpoints equally and accurately. Certainly this doesn't mean that we will ignore third party opinions, but I believe if we can achieve a consensus between ourselves, then third parties will support our decision too.</p>
<p>I am being completely serious and sincere, this is no April day joke. I believe we, you and me, need no mediators for that. The only thing we need to deal with this problem is good will, deferential attitude and honest conduct. In my opinion, all other differences can be solved provided these preconditions exist. (btw, I believe same is true for wider Karabakh conflict). I have seen all these qualities in you during our previous discussions in <a href="../../../n/a/g/Talk%7ENagorno-Karabakh_05f4.html" title="Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh">Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh</a>. That;s why I believe we can come into terms with you and not with Rovoam.</p>
<p>Rovoam knew history well, but he was not honest and constantly manipulated with facts and opinions. If not these intentions he would be very useful for Wikipedia. On the other hand, I know you are not a historian, and may not have enough knowledge of the issue. I realize that this may be a disadvantage for you and perhaps even a deterring factor for you to accept my suggestion, but still I believe, you can detect truth from lie and differentiate between NPOV and POV. Also if needed, you may conduct a small research on some points which you deem contentious and learn both viewpoints on that particular point. On my turn, I would gladly help you with anything I can, for example by providing links to various pro-Armenian and pro-Azeri online sources on history, politics etc. concerning the conflict.</p>
<p>Certainly, we both have our personal views, I have my own biases, of which I may or may not be aware of. For example my views regarding history of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Armenian-Azeri conflict, “Armenian genocide” etc. may drastically differ from yours or many other’s views. And this is normal and should be treated as such. Every person has his own personal views, beliefs and biases. But, in my view, what is more important is not to become a prisoner of one’s own biases, to remain open for outside ideas and finally, to be honest in one’s actions. I haven’t seen these qualities in Rovoam, who played every possible and impossible trick to push for his bias and discredit me. But I have seen all these qualities in you. That’s why I trust you and call for your cooperation.</p>
<p>If interested, please, write me at tabibhus(at)gmail(dot)com. We can also discuss how to proceed further in the talkpage. For example, please, let me know what would you add/remove/change in the page. Maybe we can even incorporate some of Rovoam’s earlier edits mentioning author’s of antiquity, perhaps this may calm him down a bit...

<dd>Ok, agreed then, we'll proceed in talkpages. I hope you wouldn't mind me also dropping you emails from time to time&#160;;-). Thus, Talk:N-K/Aram&amp;Tabib (or any other name) or User talk:../N-K could be the options to consider. When you have time, please create a subsection you prefer and let me know. Aram, I also want to say once again that it may not be an easy task for us, we may disagree on many issues, we may dispute, but I am confident that we can solve all our differences through deferential and honest conduct of discussions and we'll find mutually acceptable formulations on each contentious issue. I really do believe this. Best wishes. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabib_5b29.html" title="User:Tabib">Tabib</a> 05:11, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>'ve noticed that you've been uploading pretty much all of your images to Wikipedia, rather than Wikimedia Commons. Please consider uploading them to the latter instead, since that is the method now recommended by Wikipedia, it avoids redundant image copies on different language servers, and provides an appropriate context for a large amount of pictures on the same topic (thus avoiding "additional photos" sections, such as the one in Blackberry). Oh, and great job with all the photos, keep it up! --Aramգուտանգ 12:28, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is there any particular reason why Wikipedia is recommending uploading to the commons? And how exactly does it provide an appropriate context for a large amount of pictures on the same topic (do you have any examples?).</dd>
<dd>Do you think its a bad idea having "additional photos"?</dd>
<dd>When you insert an image from the commons to a page in the English Wikipedia, do you still use the "Image:Image.jpg|thumb]]" format?</dd>
<dd>The main reason I don't particularly want to change over to the commons is because when you click on an image you only see the image. To see the description you have to rederict to the commons page.</dd>

<p>Aramgutang- i think your work on the Hawaiian baby woodrose entry has been great. As you can see, i've organized everything in the hallucinogens category into their respective sub-categories to make it a bit more specific and reduce clutter. Hawaiian Baby Woodrose is already in the hallucinogens category by virtue of it's being in the <a href="../../../l/y/s/Category%7ELysergamides_358a.html" title="Category:Lysergamides">Lysergamides category</a>, a sub-category of hallucinogens; general <a href="../../../c/a/t/Help%7ECategory_8000.html#Conventions_and_project-specific_settings" title="Help:Category">policy</a> is to not have an item in both a higher category and a sub-category .

<p>Sorry about the repeat. <i>"are all lysergamides necessarily hallucinogens?"</i> is something i've been taking into account, and over the next few days am going to add another category for most of those, eg, a hallucinogenic tryptamines category as a subcategory of both tryptamines and hallucinogens, with the tryptamines category no longer a sub-category of hallucinogens.

<p>Hi Aram,</p>
<p>Glad to hear from you and congrats with your graduation. I completely understand your situation, I myself am very busy at work these days and in the coming month as well, so I dont have much time left for Wikipedia. Unfortunately, this is the time, when various sorts of vandals (esp. Rovoam and perhaps, that banned Baku Ibne/LIGerasimova and since recently, <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPantherarosa_c18e.html" title="User:Pantherarosa">User:Pantherarosa</a>) start attacking me again, erroneously thinking that by such malicious acts they can get me down.</p>
<p>I believe the N-K entry has become rather objective and factually correct. All these discussions/disputes have actually helped the development of this entry. Certainly, it doesn't mean that we cannot improve it even further by adding new info and working out on new formulations. I do not think that one can seriously think that Rovoam can contribute to Wikipedia. Frankly, after seeing all his actions, I genuinely think, this person is not quite mentally healthy. But, in any case, in case you have some time and willingness, please, visit Nagorno-Karabakh/Temp. This has been set by Tony for users to introduce changes they prefer and discuss them in advance before making edits. So, I would suggest you using that too for your edits. My best. I am really glad that I have at least one Armenian counterpart with whom I have normal relationships&#160;;-)--<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabib_5b29.html" title="User:Tabib">Tabib</a> 13:42, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The edit I made to the Armenia article from 40% to 90% is much more accurate and the number is very close to being 90% if not that. By the way I am also Armenian born in Yerevan.--<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoosh88_7095.html" title="User:Moosh88">Moosh88</a> 19:54, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I agree, that's why I kept it&#160;:) Good to see a fellow native Armenian on Wikipedia, as opposed to members of the Diaspora. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAramgutang_2d19.html" title="User:Aramgutang">Aram</a><b><strong class="selflink">գուտանգ</strong></b><a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A"></a> 00:13, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, there is just something good about being an Armenian born in Armenia, LOL. But anyways I was wondering if you have any sources for el_c. I found one but it might not be enough for him, so if you could post one too one the Armenia talk page that would be great. By the way there are some really good Armenian sites on the web, if you'd like me to give you the url just let me know.--<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoosh88_7095.html" title="User:Moosh88">Moosh88</a> 01:57, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like you to comment regarding Moosh88, the "historian," and his last answer on my talk page. Had the word been written in English, obviously the guy would have lost any credibility he had, and been warned by administrators, or even getting an Arbcom cases against him. I wondered if I should simply edit his message, by having a translation of the word in parentheses, or simply delete the entire stuff, as if nothing happened. It is a pitty, that in a site, where people are supposed to be grown up individuals, one can get attacked this way, for something that he doesn't even know the reason for. That makes me wonder if Wikipedia should not have an ignore list, and members could actually decide whom to block from their talk pages.

<dd>I don't think you can compare his cases with Rovoams. Rovoam was behaving at the beggining, he was an univolved party, who was neither Azeris or Armenian and whom got angered by an Azeris nationalist, and could not digest Admins being blind enough to not realise that a political scientist of the republic of Azerbaijan, working for an organization that concerns Azerbaijani political parties, and author of a propaganda website could come here and use Wikipedia space as a continuation of his website. Rovoam losses, was not only his fault, some Admins are also to be blamed there, Rovoams loss of control was understandble due to the circonstances, many Admins only have seen his rv wars, and judged him from it. You can't compare him in anyway to Moosh88; Moosh88 was rude for no understandble reason. I've spent dozens of hours on fighting POV pushers at the Armenian genocide website, I have created two articles as extension of that entry, I have 3 others pending. The guy come in and ask me to answer to some accusations of me being anti-Armenian. Would you seriously answer to such questions, if someone was to ask you this? And then, he finish the discussion by calling me a "boz." <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><font color="blue"><i>Fadix</i></font></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix"><sup><font color="green">(My Talk)</font></sup></a> 16:57, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The article is not one sided it just shows you the facts and gives very good reasons as to why it is that way. At the end of the article the author even states that most jews in the u.s. know nothing of it. It's not like he is preaching hate, he just wants Armenians to be informed of this treachery my some jewish lobbying groups and for Armenians to change it. I do agree with you that Armenia has other problems to worry about, but the Genocide is not something to be taken lightly. And for many diaspora Armenians it is the most important issue. Send me an e-mail something at [removed to avoid spam - see page history if needed] I would like to discuss this and other things with you in a more private fashon.--<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoosh88_7095.html" title="User:Moosh88">Moosh88</a> 05:33, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there. I apologize for my extremely belated reply; I've been largely inactive lately, although I hope to change that over the next few weeks. To answer your query, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Artificial_crystals.jpg" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Artificial_crystals.jpg" rel="nofollow">your mystery specimen</a> is <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bismuth.html" title="Bismuth">bismuth</a>, which is <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trigonal.html" title="Trigonal">trigonal</a> in structure. The labyrinthine habit and oxidated layer this element develops is quite attractive, making synthetic crystals popular collector's pieces. Wikipedia's article on the subject would be greatly enhanced by your photo.</p>
<p>As an aside, I'm quite impressed with your article on the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verneuil_process.html" title="Verneuil process">Verneuil process</a>! That's one of the topics I had meant to address before going AWOL (as many gemmology-related articles pointed to it), but you've handled it wonderfully.

<p>Barev Aram, I would really like your help in keeping an eye on user baku87. He is from azerbaijan and he recently joined wiki and is now adding baised edits to articles, mainly the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Armenia_34b0.html" title="Military of Armenia">Military of Armenia</a> article and the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Azerbaijan_e66f.html" title="Military of Azerbaijan">Military of Azerbaijan</a> article. I hope you will be able to help me with this problem, which has been escalating. Now they have three pro azeri users ganging up on me and trying to start a wiki war, which is always useless.</p>
<p>I also think that baku87 may have a sockpuppet, the new user's name is druffc. He just joined, and he edited some things on the Military of Armenia article which he claimed as being POV, but then added azeri POV. I am hoping you will take time to look at this problem and if it needs be, protect the Military of Armenia from edits.</p>

Anything you can do, no matter how small will help.

I can understand your frustration with wikipedia, I feel the same way majority of the time, but we can't let the azeri-turk coaltion dictate how Armenian related article will written and then not allow anyone to edit their baised articles.

<dd>It was nice to actually have some text to work with inside wiki for once, considering how old the project nowadays it was fairly shocking how bare the Geography of Costa Rica category was - about 20 articles below the top level stuff, half of them stubs as of last week. -- <a href="../../../s/f/n/User%7ESfnhltb_bab6.html" title="User:Sfnhltb">Sfnhltb</a> 18:49, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for contributing Image:Acherontia atropos.jpg and Image:Death's Head close-ups.jpg to Wikipedia. I am afraid the images will likely be deleted soon, unless they are relicensed. (Wikipedia currently does not allow images licensed only for non-commercial use.) In case of the second image, you claim that you have made it using images "from various sources", which brings a question whether you are in a position to submit it under any license. For details, see <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy</a>.</p>

<p>It has been ages since these citations have not been verified. Verification is needed. If not delete the material. the amount of time granted has been generious.
