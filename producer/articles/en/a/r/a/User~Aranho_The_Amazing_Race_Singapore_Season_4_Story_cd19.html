<p>Phil: Welcome back to The Amazing Race Season 4. This is Bishan Stadium, the home stadium of the Home United FC. Standing right in the middle of the stadium, 8 Teams of 2 are waiting for my signal to go.</p>
<p>Phil then turns to the contestants.</p>
<p>Phil: In just a few minutes, you’ll be leaving on a race around Singapore. The race is divided into many legs. At the end of each leg of the race, there is a Pit Stop. 5 of these Pit Stops are elimination points, so you need to get to them as fast as you can because, if you’re last, you will be eliminated. Now, you may think you know this race &amp; how to play the game, but I’m here to tell you that in this race there will be surprises that you will never expected. When I give you the word, you can run over to your bags and read the clue on top of your luggage. What happens after that is completely up to you. The first team to cross the finish line will win $1 million.</p>
<p>And the teams cheered.</p>
<p>Phil: Is everyone ready?</p>
<p>Teams: Ya!</p>
<p>Phil: Alright. Singapore is waiting for you. Good luck…Travel safe…Go!</p>
<p>And off the teams go. Team 4 reaches their bags first, followed by Team 5(2nd), Team 6(3rd), Team 8(4th), Team 1 &amp; Team 2(5th) &amp; Team 3 &amp; Team 7(6th). The teams opened their clue and it reads:</p>
<p>Bradley: Walk to Bishan Swimming Complex…</p>
<p>Phil: The Teams now must walk to Bishan Swimming Complex and get inside the building to get their next clue. What they didn’t know is that the teams must swim across the swimming pool to the opposite side of the pool to get the clue from Ang Peng Siong, Singapore’s best swimmer &amp; was once the world’s fastest swimmer over 50m freestyle.</p>
<p>The teams now are walking their way to the swimming complex. The teams entered the building but they could not find the clue box. Brandon then suddenly saw Ang Peng Siong on the other side of the pool.</p>
<p>Brandon: Hey Malcolm, I saw Ang Peng Siong on the other side of the pool. I think the clue is with him.</p>
<p>Malcolm: I think so too. But the only way to reach him is to swim across cause the side of the pool is out of bounds to everyone.</p>
<p>Team 5, without taking off their clothes, put down their bags and take off their shoes and they started to swim across the pool. The other team saw Team 5 swimming across the pool.</p>
<p>Kenneth: What the hell they are doing?</p>
<p>Aran: Nigel, I remember in Season 10 of The Amazing Race US version that the teams will receive their clue from someone after swimming across the sea. Team 5 seems to be swimming across to the other side of the pool to get the clue from that person maybe. That person looks familiar.</p>
<p>Nigel: Then why don’t we swim across then?</p>
<p>Aran: Go idea.</p>
<p>Team 2 then do the same thing. They put down their bags and take off their shoes and started to swim also.</p>
<p>Aran: Nigel, just to warn you, I’m not that good with swimming.</p>
<p>Nigel: Never mind, I’ll help you if you’re in trouble.</p>
<p>The moment Team 2 got into the water; Team 5 had already reached to the other side of the pool. Ang Peng Siong: Congratulations, here is your clue. Don’t open it until you get back to your bags.</p>
<p>Team 5: Thanks.</p>
<p>The other teams saw Team 5 got their clue and they then started to swim. Team 2 receives their clue next, followed by Team 6, Team 4 &amp; Team 8. Ryan from Team 3 reached to the other side of the pool but he could not receive the clue until Aron reached to the other side of the pool. Team 7 got their clue next followed by Team 1 &amp; Team 3. Team 5 reached to the other side of the clue before Team 6 got their clue.</p>
<p>Malcolm: Take any of the marked bicycles…</p>
<p>Phil: Once the teams get their next clue, the teams will have to take any of the marked bicycles and make their way to Bishan North Community Centre and find the main office to get their next clue.</p>
<p>Brandon: Alright, let’s go!</p>
<p>Malcolm: Why don’t we wait for Team 2 first? Aran knows the way, maybe.</p>
<p>Brandon: Then we shall wait.</p>
<p>Team 2 got to the other side of the pool a minute later after Team 5 opened their clue. Team 2 then opened their clue and read the clue.</p>
<p>Brandon: Aran, can we follow you?</p>
<p>Aran: Sure! But don’t blame me when I get lost.</p>
<p>And Team 5 followed Team 2 to their next destination. Team 5 &amp; Team 2 got their clue.</p>
<p>Nigel: Aran, want to use the Fast Forward?</p>
<p>Aran: No.</p>
<p>Nigel: Then how about you Brandon?</p>
<p>Brandon: We are not going to use also.</p>
<p>Nigel: Okay then we’ll be doing the Detour.</p>
<p>Phil: A Detour is a choice between 2 tasks, each with its own pros and cons. In this Detour, the teams will have to choose between 2 tasks that make a person healthy, To Get Healthy or To Get Fit. In To Get Healthy, teams must go to the Vegetable Plot located in Bishan Park 2 and each team member will have to eat 1kg of fresh organic lettuce. After eating the lettuce, the farmer will give them their next clue. In To Get Fit, teams must go to the Multi Purpose Field and each team member must successfully score 5 goals into the football goal post. They will have to do the Penalty Shoot-out way. After successfully score 5 goals, the invigilator will give them their next clue.</p>
<p>Aran: So Nigel, what you want to do?</p>
<p>Nigel: I’m afraid that you can’t score well, so let’s do To Get Healthy.</p>
<p>Aran: Okay loh. How about you Brandon?</p>
<p>Brandon: I have already discussed with Malcolm and he agrees to do To Get Healthy.</p>
<p>Aran: Okay then let’s go.</p>
<p>Team 6, Team 4 &amp; Team 8 later arrived.</p>
<p>Dhinesh: Gopal, want to use the Fast Forward?</p>
<p>Gopalan: No. Bradley, how about you?</p>
<p>Bradley: We are not going to use the Fast Forward. We all can do the Detour right?</p>
<p>Mark: You’re right! One of the Detour tasks is about soccer and we all are good at soccer right?</p>
<p>Dillion: Ya, you’re right! Hey, I got an idea. How about we all team up and become one big team?</p>
<p>Kenneth: Ya, good idea.</p>
<p>Dhinesh: Hey Halo Team, which Detour task are you doing?</p>
<p>Aran: Who’s the Halo Team?</p>
<p>Dhinesh: Your team lor.</p>
<p>Aran: We are doing To Get Healthy. Anyway, are you guys ganging up to become one big team?</p>
<p>Dhinesh: Ya.</p>
<p>Aran: Oh no. Just like the Six Packs in Season 10 of the US version of the Amazing Race.</p>
<p>Mark: What Six Packs?</p>
<p>Aran: In Season 10 of The Amazing Race US version, three different teams gang up to become the Six Packs because one of the team, The Cho Brothers, wanted to help the other 2 teams, the Kentucky &amp; the Alabama, because the other 2 team are the weaker teams, just like you guys but you all gang up because all of you are good at soccer.</p>
<p>Bradley: You really know so much.</p>
<p>Team 7, Team 1 &amp; Team 3 later arrives.</p>
<p>Nicholas: Hi guys. Party ah?</p>
<p>Brandon: Sorry, no party. We all just talk only. Anyway, Team 4, 6 &amp; 8 gang up to become one big team and Aran’s Team is nicknamed Halo Team.</p>
<p>Gopalan: That’s true. Anyway, why don’t you 5 teams gang up too? 3 against 5, this is going to be exciting!</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Set ah!</p>
<p>Ryan: Come on let’s take our clue first.</p>
<p>And Team 7, Team 1 &amp; Team 3 read their clues.</p>
<p>Wei Xiong: We’ll be doing To Get Healthy.</p>
<p>Aron: We’ll be doing Healthy too.</p>
<p>Anderson: Also the same thing.</p>
<p>Ryan: Let’s go then.</p>
<p>Aran: Wait first. Team 4, 6 &amp; 8, sure you guys want to do To Get Fit? If you want to do that, you guys have to cross the road and some more; it is further from here if I’m not wrong. It’s going to cause you to lost time.</p>
<p>Bradley: You got a point. Hey, let’s do Healthy ah.</p>
<p>Mark: Okay loh.</p>
<p>And they all got on to their bicycle.</p>
<p>Malcolm: Hey Aran, you know the way, right?</p>
<p>Aran: Maybe. I may have to check the map.</p>
<p>Bradley: Never mind, you just lead the way.</p>
<p>Aran: Okay loh. We all get lost, not my problem.</p>
<p>And off they go. They all then arrive at the junction of Kallang Park Connector and a bridge to Bishan Park 2. Instead of going straight, Aran makes a right turn to Kallang Park Connector.</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Aran, why you go there? It’s here, just cross the bridge.</p>
<p>Aran: But this way is nearer. If any of you want the Fast Forward, just cross this bridge and find your own way.</p>
<p>Kenneth: Fine, we’ll follow you then.</p>
<p>They then arrive at the next bridge. They then cross the bridge and they make their way to Vegetable Plot.</p>
<p>Aran: Told you.</p>
<p>They then started eating the lettuce. Team 8 finished the task first, followed by Team 4, Team 2, Team 1, Team 5, Team 7, Team 6 and Team 3.</p>
<p>Kenneth: Proceed to Longhouse Food Centre…</p>
<p>Phil: The teams now must proceed to Longhouse Food Centre, the first Pit Stop of the race around Singapore. Teams must take a marked taxi at Bishan Park Car Park and the teams must direct the taxi driver where to go to reach the Pit Stop. The last team to check in here may be eliminated.</p>
<p>Mark: Come on, let’s go!</p>
<p>Since all the teams completed their task at almost the same time, all of them are now running their way to the taxis.</p>
<p>Aran: Uncle, exit this car park and turn left. When you reach the first junction, take a left to Marymount Road. Continue going straight to the 4th junction and turn right to Marymount Lane and turn right again to Upper Thomson Road. I will tell you where to stop after you enter Upper Thomson Road. Okay uncle?</p>
<p>Taxi Driver: Okay.</p>
<p>Nigel: Aran, you know the way very well.</p>
<p>Aran: Well, I studied the street directory.</p>
<p>About 4 minutes later…</p>
<p>Team 2’s taxi entered Upper Thomson Road and Aran looked for the Longhouse Food Centre. Aran then found the food centre.</p>
<p>Aran: Uncle, stop here. Wait for us, okay?</p>
<p>Taxi Driver: Can.</p>
<p>Aran &amp; Nigel, together with the other teams, dash to the Pit Stop, which was located at the mini car park outside the food centre. The first team arrived at the Pit Stop, followed by the next team and so on so forth. When all the teams reached the Pit Stop, Phil began to talk to the teams.</p>
<p>Phil: Okay, will all the teams please step off the mat except Bradley and Dillion.</p>
<p>And all the teams, except Team 4, step off the mat.</p>
<p>Phil: Bradley &amp; Dillion, you’re Team number 1! As for the winner of this leg of the race, each of you will receive S$10 000 which you can enjoy at the end of this race. Dhinesh &amp; Gopalan, come on in. Dhinesh &amp; Gopalan, you’re Team number 2. Come in Aran &amp; Nigel. Aran &amp; Nigel, you’re Team number 3. The rest of the teams, come on in. Kenneth &amp; Mark, you’re Team number 4. Anderson &amp; Nicholas, you’re Team number 5. Brandon &amp; Malcolm, you’re Team number 6. Kai Kein &amp; Wei Xiong, you’re Team number 7. Aron &amp; Ryan, you’re the last team to arrive. I’m sorry to say but you both are eliminated.</p>

<p>Phil: The Longhouse Food Centre is the first Pit Stop of the race around Singapore. Teams arrived here for a predetermined rest period. Bradley &amp; Dillion, who arrived at 3.24 pm, will depart at 3.24 am.</p>
<p>Dillion: Make your way to Punggol Park Community Centre to get your next clue. You are not allowed to take any form of transport except MRT &amp; walking. You will receive S$15 for this leg of the race. Okay, let’s go.</p>

From Longhouse Food Centre, the teams have to walk along Upper Thomson Road, turn left to Marymount Lane, cross the road to Bishan Street 21 &amp; turn left to Bishan Road to Bishan MRT Station. Upon arriving at Bishan MRT Station, the teams found out that the MRT Station was closed and it will only open at 5.30 am. The teams have no choice but to sleep outside the MRT Station for the night.

From Buangkok MRT Station, the teams have to walk along Sengkang Central, turn left to Buangkok Drive and turn right to Hougang Avenue 10 to Punggol Park Community Centre. Upon arriving at the community centre, the teams found out that the community centre won’t open until 9.30 am. The teams have no choice but to wait till it open. At 9.30 am, the community centre opened and the teams got their next clue.</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Follow the marked route to your next destination.</p>
<p>Phil: Teams now must follow the marked route to this small section of Lorong Buangkok to get their next clue.</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>Aran: Come on Nigel, we have to go to the main road.</p>
<p>The teams then followed the marked route which starts from Hougang Avenue 10. The team then has to keep on going straight to Punggol Road, take a left to Sengkang East Way, turn right to Jalan Merbu and turn right again to Lorong Buangkok where they found the route marker at the end of the road.</p>
<p>Anderson: Go to Sengkang Fire Station…</p>
<p>Phil: The teams now must go to Sengkang Fire Station to receive their next clue.</p>
<p>Nicholas: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>Aran: Nigel, we have to take a taxi because the fire station is far away. Hey, there’s a taxi. Quickly, flag it down!</p>
<p>Team 2 managed to flag the taxi and they are on their way to the fire station. The rest of the teams also take a taxi to the fire station. Team 4 got there first and they receive their clue.</p>
<p>Team 4: Roadblock. Who want’s to get hot?</p>
<p>Bradley: I want to get hot.</p>
<p>Phil: A Roadblock is a task which only one team member may perform. In this Roadblock, the team member that is going to perform must choose one of the firefighter, wear the firefighter’s suit and, with the help of the firefighter that person chooses, successfully extinguish a common household fire. After extinguishing the fire, the firefighter will give them their next clue.</p>
<p>Dhinesh: Roadblock. Who want’s to get hot? Gopalan, I think you should do this because you join Scouts, right?</p>
<p>Gopalan: Okay, lah.</p>
<p>Malcolm: Roadblock. Who want’s to get hot? Me.</p>
<p>Aran: Roadblock. Who want’s to get hot? I want to get hot.</p>
<p>Anderson: Roadblock. Who want’s to get hot? Me.</p>
<p>Mark: Roadblock. Who want’s to get hot? I want to get hot.</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Roadblock. Who want’s to get hot? I want to get hot.</p>
<p>And off the teams go. The performer then chooses his firefighter, wears the firefighter’s suit and they goes to a wide open space where they saw 7 huge household fires. They then attempt to extinguish the fire. After about 10 minutes, Team 7 managed to extinguish the fire and they received their clue. Kai Kein then takes off the suit and run back to Wei Xiong.</p>
<p>Wei Xiong: Make your way to Buangkok MRT Station…</p>
<p>Phil: Teams now must make their way to Buangkok MRT Station. Opened in 15 January 2006, this location is the next Pit Stop in the race around Singapore.</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>Team 6 completed the Roadblock next, followed by Team 1 &amp; Team 5. By the time Team 1 completed the Roadblock, Team 7 have already reached the Pit Stop.</p>
<p>Phil: Kai Kein &amp; Wei Xiong, you’re Team number 1! As for the winners for this leg of the race, you will receive 8 movie tickets to the premiere of Spider-Man 3 at Golden Village @ VivoCity, Singapore’s largest cinema. Better still, you’ll be watching the movie in the IMAX Theatre located inside the cinema. You can enjoy the prize after the race.</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Spider-Man 3 huh? Not my type of movie but I’ll still watch it anyway.</p>
<p>Team 8 completed the Roadblock next. By the time Team 8 completed the Roadblock, Team 6 have already reached the Pit Stop, followed by Team 5 &amp; Team 1. Team 4 &amp; Team 2 completed the Roadblock last. By the time Team 4 &amp; Team 2 completed the Roadblock, Team 8 reached to the Pit Stop next. Team 4 &amp; Team 2 are now racing against each other to the Pit Stop. Phil them saw the teams running to the Pit Stop. Both of the teams are running to the Pit Stop and the 6th team reached the Pit Stop first then the last team arrived just 1 second after the 6th team.</p>
<p>Phil: Aran &amp; Nigel, please step out of the mat. Bradley &amp; Dillion, you’re Team number 6. Aran &amp;</p>
<p>Nigel, please step in the mat. Aran &amp; Nigel, you’re the last team to arrive.</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Phil: The good news is that this is a non-elimination point. Even more good news, you can keep all your money and belongings. You will also receive the normal amount of money at the start of the next leg of the race. However, you guys have been marked for elimination, which means that if you guys don’t arrive first at the end of the next leg of the race, you will receive a 30 minutes penalty upon reaching the Pit Stop.</p>
<p>Aran: Well, at least we’re saved from today’s elimination.</p>

<p>Phil: The Buangkok MRT Station is the second Pit Stop of the race around Singapore. Teams arrived here for a predetermined rest period. Kai Kein &amp; Wei Xiong, who arrived at 10.35 am, will depart at 10.35 pm.</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Make your way to the Control Tower located at Singapore Changi Airport by taxi. You will have zero dollars for this leg of the race. Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, Team 6 departed next, followed by Team 5 at 10.41 pm, Team 1 at 10.42 pm, Team 8 at 10.45 pm, Team 4 at 10.51 pm &amp; Team 2 at 10.52 pm. At 11.02 pm, Team 7 arrived at the Control Tower.</p>
<p>Wei Xiong: Make your way to Changi Chapel &amp; Museum &amp; search the whole building for your next clue. Alright, let’s go.</p>
<p>The other teams later arrive at the Control tower and they then proceed to Changi Chapel &amp; Museum. Since the Museum was not opened, all of the teams will have to wait. At 10 am, all of the teams entered the museum. Minutes later, Team 4, Team 6 and Team 8 found the next clue, followed by the rest of the teams.</p>
<p>Dhinesh &amp; Gopalan: Make your way to Changi Village and find a POSBank ATM and, using the credit card and the credit card’s password provided, withdraw S$50 which to use for the rest of the race. After withdrawing the money, proceed to the Historical Site of Beach Massacre to receive your next clue. You are not allowed to take a taxi and hitch a ride to Changi Village.</p>
<p>Gopalan: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>And off the teams go. The teams have no choice but to take a bus. The teams then cross the Upper Changi Road North to Bus Stop B09.</p>
<p>Aran: Damm! We just miss the bus to Changi Village! Now we have to wait for a long time.</p>
<p>Nigel: What do you mean?</p>
<p>Aran: What I mean that there is only one bus numbers from here to Changi Village and that is bus No. 2. Bus No. 2 has an interval of 24 minutes according to that bus signpost. The bus that we missed is bus No. 2 so we have to wait for another 24 minutes for the bus to come.</p>
<p>Bradley: Shit man. We have to wait for a very long time. 25 minutes later, the bus arrived and all of the teams boarded the bus. The bus driver then closed the door and off the bus go.</p>
<p>Aran (whispering to Nigel): Hey Nigel, after we reached Changi Village, we all run to the ATM because I know where it is. Okay?</p>
<p>Nigel: Alright.</p>
<p>Brandon: Hey Halo Team, what are you guys talking about?</p>
<p>Aran: We are talking about what to do next.</p>
<p>When the bus nearly reached Changi Village, Team 2 prepared to get off. The other teams then follow suite. The bus turned left to Changi Village Road and stopped at the nearest bus stop. The door opened and Team 2 quickly dashed out of the bus.</p>
<p>Aran: Nigel, follow me!</p>
<p>Team 2 then turn around and dashed across the road without looking out for cars.</p>
<p>Brandon: Wah Lao! Are they THAT crazy before?</p>
<p>Mark: No, not in my class before. But they seem to know where they are going. Come on guys, let’s follow them BUT with caution.</p>
<p>And the teams follow Team 2. Unfortunately, the other teams lost sight of Team 2.</p>
<p>Dhinesh: Damm! They really can run FASTER than us especially Aran.</p>
<p>Anderson: You don’t know ah? Aran passes his NAPFA Test.</p>
<p>Dhinesh: I know. But I beat him in NAPFA Test.</p>
<p>Team 2 then reached the ATM and they withdraw their money. They then walk to the Historical Site and they found the next clue. By the time they found the next clue, the other teams had already withdrawn their money.</p>
<p>Aran &amp; Nigel: Roadblock.</p>
<p>Aran: Who’s ready to dig?</p>
<p>Phil: In this Roadblock, one of the team members must choose one of the seven 3.5 m x 3.5 m digging spots and dig 40 cm deep to search for a small souvenir. Once that team found it, they will then exchange it with the surfer for their next clue.</p>
<p>Aran: I am.</p>
<p>Aran then chooses Digging Spot 4 and, with the mini spade provided, started digging for the souvenir. 14 minutes later, the other teams arrived at the Roadblock.</p>
<p>Brandon: Hey Aran, you just dash across the road without looking out for cars ah?</p>
<p>Aran: Who says I never look out for cars?</p>
<p>Malcolm: Brandon.</p>
<p>Aran: Brandon. Hmm. Never mind, just go and do your Roadblock.</p>
<p>Here are the team members that are doing the Roadblock:</p>

<p>Aran: Hey Brandon, I think we are looking for a mini surfboard souvenir because we have to exchange the souvenir with the surfer, right?</p>
<p>Brandon: I think you’re right.</p>
<p>One hour later, none of the teams found the souvenir yet.</p>
<p>Gopalan: Hey Dhinesh, I’m tired. I’ve been digging for so long but found nothing. How about quitting?</p>
<p>Dhinesh: Just keep on trying. Maybe you can find it.</p>
<p>Gopalan: HELLO! This is barely 15cm deep. That fucking souvenir is buried 40cm deep in the sand and you expect to find it easily?</p>
<p>Dhinesh: No. But I got an idea, since it’s hot out here, how about some shade?</p>
<p>Gopalan: Hey, good idea! Come, let’s get some.</p>
<p>Dhinesh: Hey, can anyone get us an umbrella?</p>
<p>One of the beach-goers: Here, have mine.</p>
<p>Dhinesh: Thanks. Here Gopalan, hope this helps.</p>
<p>Gopalan: It’s perfect. Hey guys, how about getting a shade for yourself?</p>
<p>The other teams: Ya, good idea.</p>
<p>And everyone got their own shade.</p>
<p>Two and half an hour later…</p>
<p>Nicholas: That’s it, I’m quitting.</p>
<p>Aran: Hey Nick, if you quit, you will receive a 4 hours penalty or more.</p>
<p>Nicholas: I don’t care man. I’m tired, my hands are blistered and I’m looking for a fucking souvenir that is buried 40cm deep in the sand! I’m quitting and I don’t care want you guys say. Come on Anderson, let’s go.</p>
<p>Brandon: Since when did Nicholas start to say vulgarities?</p>
<p>Aran: I don’t know. I’m not in his class. If I find Shawn next year in school, I will ask him, okay?</p>
<p>Anderson: Well Nicholas, I can’t force you. Come on, let’s get our next clue. Proceed to the Pit Stop at the entrance of Changi Airport Terminal 2. Last team to check in here may be eliminated. Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p>And off they go. At 11.49 am, Team 1 arrived at the Pit Stop.</p>
<p>Phil: Anderson &amp; Nicholas, you’re Team number 1. However, since you did not complete the Roadblock, you will receive a four hour penalty. This means that you will have to wait beside me until the penalty runs out. If any team arrive at the Pit Stop before your penalty runs out, your team’s position will be one place lower and the team that arrives before your penalty runs out will be one place higher. Please stand beside me and wait till you’re penalty time runs out.</p>
<p>Three hours later…</p>
<p>Kenneth: I give up.</p>
<p>Mark: Sure you really want to give up?</p>
<p>Kenneth: Ya.</p>
<p>Mark: Never mind. I can’t force you anyway. Bye guys.</p>
<p>The Other Teams: Bye.</p>
<p>And Team 8 got their clue. Six minutes after Team 8 left…</p>
<p>Bradley: Hey Gopalan, why don’t we just quit?</p>
<p>Gopalan: Okay lor.</p>
<p>Team 4 &amp; Team 6 then receive their next clue.</p>
<p>Team 4 &amp; Team 6: Bye Guys.</p>
<p>The Other Teams: Bye.</p>
<p>Four minutes after Team 4 &amp; Team 6 left…</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Hey, why don’t we just quit?</p>
<p>Brandon: I’m quitting. How about you Aran?</p>
<p>Aran: Even though I quit, my team will still be eliminated.</p>
<p>Brandon: Oh ya hor. I forgot. Anyway, good luck.</p>
<p>Aran: Thanks.</p>
<p>And off the teams go. At 2.19 pm, Team 8 reached the Pit Stop, followed by Team 6 at 2.26 pm, Team 4 at 2.28 pm, Team 5 at 2.30 pm and Team 7 at 2.35 pm.</p>
<p>At 4.50 pm…</p>
<p>Nigel: Aran, I think we all just give up.</p>
<p>Aran: Hey Nigel, don’t forget about the time penalty. If we give up now, we will receive a four and a half an hour penalty and we will be eliminated. Anyway, I have found the souvenir and…hang on…I’VE FOUND THE SOUVENIR!</p>
<p>And everyone cheered. Aran then exchanges the souvenir for the clue with the surfer. Team 2 later then arrives at the Pit Stop.</p>
<p>Aran: Hi Phil. Are we still in the game?</p>
<p>Phil: Well Aran &amp; Nigel…you’re…Team…Number…ONE! As for the winners for this leg of the race, each of you will receive a Sony Ericsson W300i Walkman® Phone with Portable Speakers MPS-60, Bluetooth™ Headset HBH-610a and Music Cable MMC-60 which you can enjoy after this race.</p>

<p>Phil: The entrance of Changi Airport Terminal 2 is the third Pit Stop of the race around Singapore. Teams arrived here for a predetermined rest period. Aran &amp; Nigel, who arrived at 5.19 pm, will depart at 5.19 am.</p>
<p>Aran &amp; Nigel: Make your way to the main office @ Bukit Timah Community Centre and collect your next clue and your cash which to use for the rest of the race.</p>
<p>Aran: Come on, let’s take a taxi.</p>
<p>Aran then flagged a taxi down. Team 2 then boarded the taxi.</p>
<p>Aran: Uncle, can you take us to Bukit Timah Community Centre?</p>
<p>Taxi Driver: Where is that?</p>
<p>Aran: Do you have any street directory?</p>
<p>Taxi Driver: Yes, I do. Here it is.</p>
<p>Aran: Thanks. Wait first ah. Here is it uncle.</p>
<p>Taxi Driver: Oh. That Community Centre is near Ngee Ann Polytechnic. I know where already. So, do you want to take the PIE or ECP?</p>
<p>Aran: PIE la.</p>
<p>And off they go. Team 1 departed next at 5.22 am, followed by Team 8 at 6.19 am, Team 6 at 6.26 am, Team 4 at 6.28 am and Team 5 at 6.30 am. At 6.24 am, Team 2 had already reached the CC.</p>
<p>Aran: Oh nuts. It does not open until 9 am. We will meet the others again.</p>
<p>By 7.39 am, all of the Teams arrived at the CC. At 9 am, the CC opened and everyone rushed in to get their next clue and their cash.</p>
<p>Brandon &amp; Malcolm: Make your way…</p>
<p>Bradley &amp; Dillion: …to Bukit Timah…</p>
<p>Kenneth &amp; Mark: …Nature Reserves Visitor Centre…</p>
<p>Aran &amp; Nigel: …to get your next clue…</p>
<p>Dhinesh &amp; Gopalan: …Caution: Yield Ahead.</p>
<p>Anderson &amp; Nicholas: Okay, let’s go</p>
<p>And off the teams go. All off them are now taking a taxi to the next checkpoint.</p>
<p>Bradley (while in the taxi): We are planning to Yield the Halo Team because Aran know how to go from places to places.</p>
<p>Aran (while in the taxi): We are planning to Yield the Soccer Boys (Team 4) because they are not friendly to the Prefects (Team 5) since Day 1.</p>
<p>Nigel (while in the taxi): You know Aran, I got a feeling that someone is planning to Yield us.</p>
<p>Aran: You know Nigel, think all of the other teams are planning to Yield us because of me.</p>
<p>Nigel: Why is that so?</p>
<p>Aran: I’m smart at maps.</p>
<p>All of the teams reached to the Bukit Timah Hill Car Park and they are now running to the Yield. Team 4 got there first and the other teams have to wait until Team 4 decides whether they are going to Yield or not.</p>
<p>Bradley: We decided to Yield the Halo Team.</p>
<p>Aran: Damm fuck!</p>
<p>Phil: When a Team got yielded, that Team have to wait at the Yield, turn the hourglass and that team can only continue until the sand runs out.</p>
<p>And Team 2 turned the hourglass. The other teams entered the visitor centre and searched for the clue box.</p>
<p>Brandon: Malcolm, I found the clue box!</p>
<p>And they opened their clue.</p>
<p>Brandon: Roadblock. Who love hide n seek?</p>
<p>Phil: In this Roadblock, one of the team members must find the following huts located in the Bukit Timah Hill: South View Hut, Catchment Hut, Dairy Farm Hut, North View Hut, Seraya Hut, Tiup Tiup Hut, Jungle Fall Hut and Summit Hut. Once the performer found one of the huts, the performer will then receive a stamp from the forest ranger sitting in the hut. After the performer have all eight stamps, the performer will then go back to the visitor centre and exchange it for their next clue. The other team member that is not performing must wait at the visitor centre until his team member returns.</p>
<p>Anderson: I love the game.</p>
<p>Dillion: Me.</p>
<p>Malcolm: I.</p>
<p>Dhinesh: Me.</p>
<p>Mark: I love hide h seek.</p>
<p>And off the teams go.</p>
<p>Aran: Hey Nigel, I think this is the Roadblock because look, only one team member is going into the jungle.</p>
<p>Nigel: If it is the Roadblock, who do you think should do it?</p>
<p>Aran: You.</p>
<p>Nigel: Okay lor.</p>
<p>After the sand runs out, Team 2 then got their next clue. Nigel is doing the Roadblock.</p>

<p>After Anderson got their clue, Team 1 opened their clue.</p>
<p>Anderson: Proceed to The Old Ford Factory and collect one of the departure cards found on the marked pillar and follow the instruction on the card. Okay let’s go.</p>
<p>And off the teams go. Team 1 reached to the factory first and took the 8 am departure time. They then turn the departure card around and…</p>

<p>Dhinesh: Come on, let’s find Phil. Oh look! There’s Phil! Come on, let’s check in. And the other 5 teams watch while Team 6 is running towards Phil.</p>
<p>Phil: Dhinesh &amp; Gopalan, you’re the last team to arrive at The Old Ford Factory. Even though this is not a checkpoint, you both are eliminated.</p>
<p>Dhinesh: What?! You’re got to be kidding.</p>
<p>Phil: No, I’m not. I said at the start of the race that there will be some surprises.</p>
<p>Bradley: I didn’t expect this to happen.</p>
<p>Aran: Well Bradley, I do expect this to happen. And I also expect an Intersection clue.</p>
<p>Dillion: What’s Intersection?</p>
<p>Aran: Watch The Amazing Race 10 on YouTube to find out.</p>
<p>Brandon: Well, let’s relax for now and I hope we could sleep well tonight because this building gives me the creeps…</p>
<p>Aran: …EVEN though the government renovated it to make it not so scary.</p>
<p>At 8 am the next day, Team 1 and Team 5 continue their race. They then take a taxi to Newton MRT Station. At 8.30 am, the rest of the teams take a taxi also to their next location. At 8.32 am, Team 5 reaches the MRT Station first. They entered the MRT Station and found the next clue.</p>
<p>Malcolm: Make your way to Istana Kampong Glam and search the whole garden for their next clue. You are only allowed to take the MRT to Your next location. Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>Before Team 5 continues their journey, Team 1 later collects their next clue. At about 8.56 am, the rest of the teams collect their next clue.

<p>°While during the Roadblock, Nigel &amp; Bradley throw up at their 5th plate and 7th plate respectively.</p>
<p>After completing his Roadblock, Nicholas got their next clue.</p>
<p>Anderson &amp; Nicholas: Ride on the DHL Balloon and find the marked building. After finding the marked building, search the lobby of that building to get your next clue.</p>
<p>Anderson: Okay, where is that DHL Balloon?</p>
<p>Nicholas: Andy, the balloon is just up there.</p>
<p>Anderson: Okay. So there it is. Now, we just need to go there…</p>
<p>Nicholas: Take a taxi lor.</p>
<p>Anderson: Okay.</p>
<p>And they take a taxi to the balloon. Four minutes later, Team 8 got their next clue, followed by Team 4 and Team 2. At 10.02 am, Team 1 reached the balloon. Unfortunately, the balloon is already up in the air. They have to wait until 10.10 am for the next ride. By 10.10 am, Team 1, Team 4 and Team 8 rode on the balloon.</p>
<p>Bradley: Wow. What a nice view. Oh look! There’s the Halo Team.</p>
<p>Mark: That’s just too bad. They missed the ride four minutes ago.</p>
<p>Nicholas (shouting at Aran): Hi Aran!</p>
<p>Aran (shouting at Nicholas): Hi. I hope you guys enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p>Dillion (shouting at Aran): We did enjoy ourselves Aran.</p>
<p>Aran (shouting at those up in the balloon): Hey, look for the marked building. Don’t just waste your time taking to me.</p>
<p>Kenneth (shouting at Aran): We already found the marked building.</p>
<p>Anderson (shouting at Aran): The building looks like the National Library, Aran. Oh, our ride is over. It is time to go down now.</p>
<p>And the balloon descended. When the balloon reached the ground…</p>
<p>Bradley: Hey guys, do you know where is the direction to the marked building?</p>
<p>Mark: Darn it! Now we have to ride the balloon again. And the next ride is at 10.25 am. I might as well listen to my MP3 while waiting.</p>
<p>At 10.25 am, all of the teams, including Team 5, are riding on the balloon.</p>
<p>Aran: Wow. The view is damm beautiful. And the marked building is the National Library.</p>
<p>Bradley: Then, can we follow you?</p>
<p>Aran: Sure. And EVERYBODY will plan to YIELD me AGAIN! Am I right, Bradley?</p>
<p>Bradley: Well…It depends.</p>
<p>After the ride, everybody is making their way to the National Library. When they reached the library, Team 5 found the clue box first.</p>
<p>Brandon: Detour. Search For It or Sit Back And Relax.</p>
<p>Phil: In this Detour, teams will have to choose between two tasks, Search for It or Sit Back and Relax. In Search for It, teams will have to go to the New Bugis Street and find the marked stall. After finding the stall, each of the team members must eat ten seeds of the durian. After completing the task, the stall owner will then give them their next clue. In Sit Back and Relax, teams will have to make their way to the Drama Centre located inside the National Library and watch a short video. After watching the video, the teams will then have to answer ten questions related to the video. If all of the answers to the questions are correct, the staff will give them their next clue. The video will be repeated once every five minutes.</p>
<p>Anderson: We’ll do Sit Back and Relax.</p>
<p>Aran: We’ll do Sit Back and Relax.</p>
<p>Bradley: We’ll do Sit Back and Relax.</p>
<p>Brandon: We’ll do Sit Back and Relax.</p>
<p>Mark: We’ll do Sit Back and Relax.</p>
<p>And they proceed to the Drama Centre. When they enter the theatre, they were greeted by a staff from the library. The staff then gives a sheet of questions to each of the teams. The teams then sit down in to the different location of the theatre. The lights in the theatre became dimmer. The screen then started playing the usual “3, 2, 1” starting sequence.</p>
<p>Malcolm: They are playing the MrBrown show.</p>
<p><b>Note: I will not be showing this part of the story because this part of the story may , to some, contains parts that may be under racism, politics and other things that are disturbing to others.</b></p>
<p>And the show ends. The lights then became brighter and everyone in the theatre cheered. They then answer the questions on the paper the staff gave them earlier.</p>

<p>Phil: Masjid Sultan is the fourth Pit Stop of the race around Singapore. Teams arrived here for a predetermined rest period. Mark and Kenneth, who arrived at 11.19 am, will depart at 11.19 pm.</p>
<p>Mark &amp; Kenneth: Take a taxi to VivoCity, the largest shopping mall in Singapore, and find the wading pool to receive your next clue. You have S$15 for this leg of the race.</p>
<p>Mark: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>And off they go. Team 2 departed next at 11.20 pm, followed by Team 5 at 11.21 pm and Team 4 at 11.22 pm.</p>
<p>At 11.50 pm, all of the teams reached VivoCity. Unfortunately, the shopping mall is closed and won’t be open until eight in the morning the next day. At 8 am, the mall opened and they all go to level three of VivoCity where the wading pool is located. When all of the teams got to the wading pool…</p>
<p>Bradley: Why must the clue box be put in the middle of the wading pool?</p>
<p>Aran: I guess we have to enter the pool.</p>
<p>And they take off their socks &amp; shoes and walk over to the clue box.</p>
<p>Brandon: Caution: Yield Ahead. Roadblock: Who is starving?</p>
<p>Phil: In this Roadblock, the teams will have to go to the Kopitiam Food Court and one off the team members will have to eat ten bowls of Tau Suan to receive their next clue.</p>
<p>Aran: Come on! Let’s go to the Yield first!</p>
<p>Instead of deciding who should do the Roadblock, all of the teams are running to the Yield to Yield another team. Team 2 reached to the Yield first.</p>
<p>Aran &amp; Nigel: We choose to yield…no one.</p>
<p>Brandon &amp; Malcolm: We chose not to Yield.</p>
<p>Kenneth &amp; Mark: We choose not to Yield.</p>
<p>Since Team 4 arrived at the Yield last and they also used the Yield earlier in the game, they can’t use the Yield.</p>
<p>Aran: I’m doing the Roadblock.</p>
<p>Mark: I’m doing the Roadblock.</p>
<p>Brandon: I’m doing the Roadblock.</p>
<p>Bradley: I’m doing the Roadblock.</p>
<p>After Aran ate his fourth bowl, everyone was shocked at Aran’s eating speed.</p>
<p>Bradley: Hey Aran, you can really eat very fast sia.</p>
<p>Aran: Tau Suan is one of my favourite desserts. Some more, the dessert is in liquid form, that’s why I can eat so fast.</p>
<p>At 8.20 am, Aran completed his task and Team 2 got their next clue.</p>
<p>Nigel: This is an Intersection…</p>
<p>Phil: An intersection requires each team to pair up with one other and perform all tasks and make decisions together until further notice. Should there be no other teams present when a given team arrives at the Intersection route marker, they must wait there until another teams arrives. Teams are free to choose their partner team if multiple teams are present.</p>
<p>Nigel: …Do not open the Detour unless you have another group partnering you.</p>
<p>Aran: I knew this will come. Now we have to wait.</p>
<p>Brandon: Hey Aran, why are you still here?</p>
<p>Aran: The next clue is an Intersection.</p>
<p>Brandon: What’s that?</p>
<p>Aran: It is a next part of the race where two teams have to work together until further notice.</p>
<p>Brandon: So that’s what it is.</p>
<p>After Team 4, Team 5 and Team 8 got their next clue, Team 2 &amp; Team 5 and Team 4 &amp; Team 8 pair up with each other for the next part of the race. They then open the Detour Route Information.</p>
<p>Dillion: Detour: Rap This or Sell That</p>
<p>Phil: In this Detour, teams will have to choose between Rap this or Sell that. In Rap this, the teams will have to go to the St. James Power Station, Singapore’s first coal power plant, and find a marked bar. Once they found it, those teams will have to write a rap about their race around Singapore. They will then have to rap the rap they wrote. If the DJs are happy with the rap those team have wrote, then the DJs will give them their next clue. In Sell that, the teams will have to go to the Giant store located in Vivomart and, using their marketing skill, sell 40 Nutella Hazelnut Spread to receive their next clue from the staff.</p>
<p>Brandon: Come on, let’s do Sell that.</p>
<p>Aran: Okay. Follow me, I know where Vivomart is.</p>
<p>Bradley: Let’s do Rap This.</p>
<p>Mark: Okay lor. Hey Halo Team? What task are you guys doing?</p>
<p>Aran: Sell that. What are you guys doing?</p>
<p>Mark: Rap This. Good luck.</p>
<p>Aran: Same to you. Okay come on, let’s go.</p>
<p>And off they go. Team 2 &amp; Team 5 found the Giant Supermarket and they enter the store. The teams search the store for the Nutella Section and they found the Nutella Section at the bottom of the travellator.</p>
<p>Aran: Hey guys, how about a buy two get one free offer?</p>
<p>Brandon: But we will have one extra Nutella.</p>
<p>Aran: Give that for free lor.</p>
<p>Nigel: Still, that is a good idea. Come on, let’s start selling.</p>
<p>Over at Team 2 &amp; Team 5, they have found the power station. They also found the bar. The teams then sit outside the bar writing a rap.</p>
<p>Bradley: Hey, where did we go around Singapore ah?</p>
<p>Mark: Let’s see. The places are HarbourFront, Kampong Glam, Bukit Timah, Changi, Buangkok and Bishan.</p>
<p>Bradley: Where did we go first?</p>
<p>Kenneth: I think Bishan.</p>
<p>Bradley: Okay, how about we start the rap like this: We start the race in Bishan. We met Peng Siong, and it was fun.</p>
<p>Mark: Hey, that’s good! Write that down. Next is Buangkok.</p>
<p>Dillion: How about this? Next we rode a train to Buangkok. OH NO, there’s fire but it was put out.</p>
<p>Bradley: Good one. I’ll write that down. How about Changi?</p>
<p>Kenneth: How about this? We then took a taxi to Changi; we entered the airport but did not fly to other country.</p>
<p>Mark: That’s good. Write it down.</p>
<p>Bradley: Next is Kampong Glam.</p>
<p>Mark: How about this? The next destination is Kampong Glam. We have a heritage tour and its sure fun.</p>
<p>Bradley: Good one. I’ll write that down. HarbourFront is next.</p>
<p>Dillion: I got one. Our next destination is HarbourFront. We relax in the pool under the sun.</p>
<p>Bradley: And we shall end the rap with this sentence: We are here singing a rap to get our next clue, or we will drown in the pool.</p>
<p>Mark: Good one! Now let’s complete that rap and get our next clue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile…</p>
<p>Aran: Lelong! Lelong! Buy 3 get 1 free! 1 Nutella for three dollars! 2 for five fifty!</p>
<p>Brandon: Hurry, hurry! Only fifteen left!</p>
<p>Meanwhile…</p>
<p>Bradley &amp; Mark: We started the race in Bishan. We met Peng Siong, and it was fun. Next we rode a train to Buangkok. OH NO, there’s fire but it was put out. We then took a taxi to Changi: we entered the airport but we did not fly to other country. The next destination is Kampong Glam. We have a heritage tour and its sure fun. Our next destination is HarbourFront. We relax in the pool under the sun. We are here singing a rap to get our next clue, or we will drown in the pool.</p>
<p>DJ: Nice rap! Here is your next clue.</p>
<p>Bradley: Thanks.</p>
<p>And they got out off the power station. Meanwhile…</p>
<p>Malcolm: Yes! We’ve done our task!</p>
<p>Staff: Here is your next clue.</p>
<p>Aran: You teams now do not need to work together anymore. Go to the Sentosa Express Sentosa Station for your next Pit Stop. Last team to check in here, may be eliminated. Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>And off all the teams (including Team 4 and Team 8) go.</p>
<p>Aran (whispering to Nigel): Hey Nigel, follow me. I know where the station is.</p>
<p>And they run to the station.</p>
<p>Phil: Aran &amp; Nigel, you’re Team number one! Guys, congratulations, you’re the first team to make it into the finals three and you’re in the running to win one million dollar prize. As for the winners for this leg of the race, each of you will receive a set of Windows® Vista, Microsoft®’s latest Window®’s system. You guys can enjoy the prize after the end of this race.</p>
<p>Team 5 later arrived at the Pit Stop.</p>
<p>Phil: Brandon &amp; Malcolm, you’re Team number two! You are one of the final three teams to be racing to win the S$1 million prize.</p>
<p>The third team then arrived at the Pit Stop.</p>
<p>Phil: Bradley &amp; Dillion, you’re Team number three! You are one of the final three teams to be racing to win the S$1 million prize.</p>
<p>Since Team 8 is the last team to arrive, they have been eliminated.</p>
<p><a name="Part_Six" id="Part_Six"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranho_The_Amazing_Race_Singapore_Season_4_Story_cd19.html" title="Edit section: Part Six">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Part Six</span></h2>
<p>Phil: Sentosa Express Sentosa Station is the fifth and final Pit Stop of the race around Singapore. Teams arrived here for a predetermined rest period. Aran &amp; Nigel, who arrived at 9.16 am, will depart at 9.16 pm.</p>
<p>Aran: Take a Sentosa Bus to Sentosa and then make your way to the Merlion in Sentosa to receive your next clue.</p>
<p>Nigel: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>And off they go. Team 5 departed next at 9.19 pm and Team 4 departed at 9.22 pm. All of them are now waiting for the Sentosa Bus to stop at the bus stop B01 along Sentosa Gateway. When the bus arrived, all of the teams boarded the bus to Sentosa. All of the teams then alighted at the Visitor Arrival Centre. Since there are no bus services operating within Sentosa going to the Merlion, they have no choice but to walk to the Merlion. At 9.54 pm, everyone reached to the Merlion.</p>
<p>Dillion: Roadblock: Who got stamina?</p>
<p>Phil: In this Roadblock, one of the team members must walk up to the mouth of the Merlion and then abseil down the Merlion to receive their next clue.</p>
<p>Aran: I have.</p>
<p>Bradley: Me.</p>
<p>Brandon: Me.</p>
<p>The performers then run up the stairs in the Merlion to the mouth of the Merlion. Since Aran got to the mouth of the Merlion first, he was the first person to abseil the Merlion.</p>
<p>Aran: Oh my goodness. It is so high. I don’t know whether I can do this.</p>
<p>Bradley then reach to the top next and he have to abseil down the second available line. Brandon later reaches to the mouth of the Merlion and he have to abseil down the only line available. Aran started to abseil down the Merlion, followed by Bradley and Brandon. Aran was the first to abseil down the Merlion first.</p>
<p>Aran: Ride on the Carlsberg Sky Tower and find the marked building to receive your next clue. Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>Bradley then completed the task and Brandon completed the task last. All of the teams are making their way to the sky tower. All of the teams then got onto the spinning observation deck and they try to search for the marked building.</p>
<p>Malcolm: Why must it be at night? It is not THAT easy to search for the marked building at this time of the game.</p>
<p>Dillion then spotted the Route Marker flag on top of a building.</p>
<p>Dillion: Hey Aran, I’ve spotted the marked building!</p>
<p>And everyone rushed over to Dillion.</p>
<p>Dillion: It’s over there.</p>
<p>Dillion then pointed to the building at the bottom of the sky tower.</p>
<p>Aran: Pass me a map of Sentosa. Okay. Starting at the roundabout, follow the road to the junction of two or three roads. There. The building is Sentosa 4D Magix.</p>
<p>When the spinning observation deck touches the ground, all of the teams are running to the marked building. True enough, the marked building is Sentosa 4D Magix.</p>
<p>Nigel: Detour: Physical Climb or Human Search.</p>
<p>Phil: In this Detour, teams will have to choose between Physical Climb or Human Search. In Physical Climb, teams will have to go to the Imbiah Falls and rock-climb up the fall to receive their next clue. In Human Search, teams must go inside Sentosa 4D Magix and search for the whole theatre for their next clue whiles the movie, Pirates 4D, is playing.</p>
<p>Nigel: We’ll do Human Search.</p>
<p>Bradley: We’ll do Human Search.</p>
<p>Malcolm: We’ll do Human Search.</p>
<p>When all of the teams enter the theatre, the movie is playing. While the teams are searching for the clue, everyone is being sprayed and blow at. At 10.41 pm, Bradley found the next clue.</p>
<p>Bradley: Walk to the Southernmost Point of Continental Asia to get your next clue. Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>At 10.42 pm, the other teams found the next clue. At 11.07 pm, all of the teams reached at the next checkpoint.</p>
<p>Brandon: Search the whole of this island and find one of three different departure times &amp; your next clue. Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>Now, let’s fast forward to 8 am.</p>
<p>Malcolm: Make your way to the Civilian War Memorial. Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>They then walk to Bus Stop B12 along Tanjong Beach Walk and they waited for the Yellow Service (a bus service operating within Sentosa) to arrive. When the bus arrives, they boarded the bus and are on their way to the Visitor Arrival Centre. By the time Team 5 reached the Visitor Centre, Team 2 left the campsite next at 8.15 am. They then, fortunately, take a taxi to their next location. When Team 5 flagged down a taxi, they saw Team 2 in the taxi. At 8.30 am, Team 4 left the campsite and they also took a taxi to their next checkpoint. At 9.31 am, all of the teams, somehow, reached at the war memorial at the same time.</p>
<p>Aran: Uncle, wait here ah.</p>
<p>Dillion: Uncle, wait here. I’ll be back.</p>
<p>Malcolm: Uncle, can wait for us? We’ll be back.</p>
<p>And all of the teams run to the memorial.</p>
<p>Aran: Your next clue is located at the receptionist counter of one of the tallest building in Singapore.</p>
<p>Phil: The teams now must find out what is the tallest building that has their next clue, and that building is the Republic Plaza.</p>
<p>Aran: Damm it! The only tallest building I know is the Republic Plaza. I’m not sure whether this building has the clue.</p>
<p>Nigel: Let’s try our luck.</p>
<p>Aran: Okay.</p>
<p>All of the teams then run back to their taxi.</p>
<p>Aran: Uncle, go to Republic Plaza.</p>
<p>Brandon: Uncle, follow that taxi (Team 2’s).</p>
<p>Bradley: Follow that taxi (Team 2’s).</p>
<p>And off they go. When they reached to the next checkpoint, all of the teams asked their taxi driver to wait until they are back.</p>
<p>Bradley &amp; Dillion: Roadblock: Who’s got the power?</p>
<p>Nigel: Me.</p>
<p>Dillion: I got the power.</p>
<p>Malcolm: I have.</p>
<p>Phil: In this final Roadblock, teams will have to go to the Swissotel the Stamford. Once there, one of the team members must run up the marked stairs to the top of the building. After the performer reached to the top of the building, that performer must abseil down the hotel to receive their next clue.</p>
<p>And all of the teams went back to their own taxi. When the teams reached the hotel, all of the teams asked their taxi driver to wait. The performers then run up the stairs to the top of the hotel.</p>
<p>Here are the team’s positions:</p>
<table class="wikitable">
<tr>

<p>When Malcolm completed the task, Team 5 received their next clue.</p>
<p>Brandon: Make your way to the Fountain of Wealth to get your next clue which is located in the middle of the fountain.</p>
<p>Malcolm: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>And off they go. Two minutes later, Team 4 received their next clue and Team 2 received their next clue one minute later after Team 4 receives theirs.</p>
<p>At 10.43 am, Team 5 reached to the fountain.</p>
<p>Brandon &amp; Malcolm: Walk to the finish line located in the Padang, but before you proceed to the finish line, walk to the CityLink Mall and find a marked stall located in the mall. After finding the stall, collect an envelope from the cashier and it is then you can proceed to the finish line.</p>
<p>Malcolm: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p>By 10.51 am, all of the teams are now searching along CityLink Mall for the marked stall.</p>
<p>Bradley was walking pass the Adidas’s Store when...</p>
<p>Bradley: Dillion! This is the marked store!</p>
<p>They then entered the store and asked the cashier for the envelope.</p>
<p>Cashier: Here is your envelope. Do not open it unless instructed by Phil.</p>
<p>Bradley: Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p>And off they go. Meanwhile, while Team 2 was just a few meters away from the Adidas Store…</p>
<p>Aran: Nigel, is that Bradley &amp; Dillion?</p>
<p>Nigel: Yes! Come on, let’s enter the store.</p>
<p>And Team 2 entered the store.</p>
<p>Cashier: Here is your envelope. Do not open it unless instructed by Phil.</p>
<p>Nigel: Okay.</p>
<p>When Team 2 left the store…</p>
<p>Aran: Hey Brandon, it’s in here!</p>
<p>And Team 5 collected the envelope. All of the teams now are racing towards the finish line. When the teams got out of the mall, they saw Phil and the other eliminated teams at the middle of the field.</p>
<p>Bradley: Dillion! Let’s run!</p>
<p>When the teams entered the Padang, all of the team members put down their bags and they are now running towards Phil. The leading team then stepped onto the big mat.</p>
<p>Phil: Congratulations Bradley &amp; Dillion, you’re the winning team of this season of the race! As for the winning team of the race, you guys just won one million dollars!</p>
<p>And Team 4 cheered.</p>
<p>Phil: Aran &amp; Nigel, you’re the first runner-up and Brandon &amp; Malcolm, you’re the second runner-up. But guys, there is still one more prize to give out. All of you (Team 2, Team 4 &amp; Team 5) please open the envelope you guys received from the Adidas Store. If your envelope contains the golden Adidas logo, please inform me.</p>
<p>And the teams opened their envelope. Team 5 has the golden Adidas logo and they informed Phil.</p>
<p>Phil: Well Brandon &amp; Malcolm, you guys just got yourselves one hundred dollars worth of Adidas vouchers each which you can enjoy at any Adidas stores in Singapore. Well, the race has come to an end, but my Amazing Race journey has not ended as I have to flyover to the US for The Amazing Race Eleven. Buy guys.</p>
<p>Every team: Bye Phil!</p>
