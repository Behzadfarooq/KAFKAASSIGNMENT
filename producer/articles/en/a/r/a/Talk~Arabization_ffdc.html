<p>Guy, I realize you don't like Arabization, but adding such obviously inappropriate categories as "ethnocentrism" is ridiculous, and removing well-established facts about how it happened is frankly unhelpful. The genetic, linguistic, and cultural evidence all point towards the obvious conclusion - already drawn by Ibn Khaldun - that most modern <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arabs</a> are Arabized descendants of their countries' original inhabitants. (The genetic surveys alluded to in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber.html" title="Berber">Berber</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian.html" title="Palestinian">Palestinian</a> are a good place to look.) - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 03:52, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I neither like nor dislike Arabization. I was merely offering historical information on the subject. Arab migration is closely tied to the Islamic culture that was spread at the advent of Islam in late 660s. The reason I included imperialism catagory is because Arab traders spread Islam to Africa (which isnt imperialism), but when it was enforced after conquest of African nations by Arab armies, the states conquered slowly had to adopt Arabic and Islam as their religion, culture and language. This is cultural imperialism, and imperialism as is defined in the broad catagories assigned under the names. It is "ethnocentrism" only because cultural imperialism is included there, and it is under imperialism for the purpose of when vassal states were conquered. It doesnt mean that the Arab language religion and culture was spread by warfare, but we both know that during the expansion of Islam, conquest was a big part. Arabization and Islamization (for lack of a better word) are closely linked. <a href="../../../g/u/y/User%7EGuy_Montag_3a27.html" title="User:Guy Montag">Guy Montag</a> 10:29, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The category imperialism does not apply to Arabization. Arabization was done in areas that weren't even part of the Islamic empire, for example, after the caliphate fell. I have no idea how ethnocentrism applies either, as Arabs adopted much knowledge from other ethnicities and Arabic even has many loan words from different languages. If you want to add a section on Arabization by force in ancient times, go right ahead, but cite your sources.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a> 13:31, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not going to passionatly argue about this. All I can say is that there is alot of important information missing from this article, and in its current form there is something wrong with it. I have requested a 3rd opinion on the subject and I wont be making any edits until I see that opinion written down in talk.</p>

<dd>It seems to me that "ethnocentrism" is entirely wrong. I don't think we apply that to any other armed migrations of peoples. Most of the Arab migrations didn't even push out the pre-existing populations, and while they often (but not always: think Spain) imposed the Muslim religion, often the result was a syncretic Islam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Imperialism" is trickier. Certainly in the days of the unified caliphate, it would apply. After that, it gets subtler. However, to deliberately pick a very contentious example, I would say that the category would be apply to that if and only if it applies it to Zionism. (I see both as instances of settler colonialism; whether or not that is imperialism is an open question.) My own feeling is that I wouldn't use the term "imperialism" either for Zionism or for (post-caliphate) Arabization, and while I'd have no personal objection to it being applied evenhandedly to both, I think it is simpler just to leave it off of this page (which is a mixed bag in that respect: caliphate and later) and attach it to the pages related to specific empires. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 17:25, May 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Alright, that is understandable. The problem I had with this article was in how to specifically define the term Arabization as a migration or as a formal or informal government policy (see <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russification.html" title="Russification">Russification</a>) after the conquest of other states asimposed on the conquered subjects. If it has to do with passive migration, then I was wrong, if it has to do with both, than something should be noted.</p>

<dd>... Hmm. I mwouldnt' say "passive", but would you call the German migrations into Europe "imperialist"? The one modern case mentioned about Saddam's Iraq is another matter, but it's pretty tangential to the main topic of the article. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:46, May 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wouldnt call them imperialist, unless you are talking about the Goths or the Visagoths. I call it pillaging, looting, and raiding&#160;:). The confusion was because of the term. I confused it with the same meaning as Russification.</p>

</dl>
<p>Flat out wrong, even according to other Wikipedia pages (check "Aramaeans" for example). None of these groups originated in or even passed through the Arabian peninsula, to the best of our knowledge. The Semitic peoples arrived in the Middle East from Africa via Sinai, then spilt into two groups - the West Semites, which include the Canaanites and later Israelites and Judeans - and the East Semites, who comprised of the Akkadians and later Assyrians and Babylonians. Arabs come from a third branch, the South Semites, and were probably a later migration since:</p>
<p>A) Arabic is in the same language group (South Semitic) as a few African languages such as Amharic,</p>
<p>B) settlement or even long-term survival in the arid Peninsula is impossible without camels, which were not domesticaed until centuries later (which also makes the claim of pre-Arab peninsular migrations completely illogical), and</p>
<p>C) the first mention of Arabs is in the Battle of Karkar, around the 9th Century BCE, where they are mentioned along with the relatively recently domesticated camels, long after the other groups were already firmly established in the region.</p>
<p>As for the Aramaeans, they probably came from Mesopotamia, possibly from the former kingdom of Mittani. No evidence has arisen to suggest an Arabian origin. I therefore suggest that this entire sentece be deleted. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.155.189.49 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.155.189.49_36f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.155.189.49">contribs</a>) 14 March 2006.</small> <small>"8th Century BCE" changed to "9th Century BCE" by Naughtius Maximus (<a href="../../../n/a/u/User_talk%7ENaughtius_Maximus_ac61.html" title="User talk:Naughtius Maximus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Naughtius_Maximus_f6fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Naughtius Maximus">contribs</a>) <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_19.html" title="March 19">19 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</small></p>

Arabised-Arabs can signify arabs who speak other <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afro-Asiatic_languages_1e35.html" title="Afro-Asiatic languages">Afro-Asiatic languages</a>. They are "Arabic speakers". They are regarded as Arabs in contemporary times." --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 18:10, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's now musch shorter, but still dubious: "The term 'Arabised-Arabs' has historically been used to signify Arabs who are descendants of Adnan, the son of Ishmael and grandson of Abraham." I doubt that this is an historical meaning of "Arabised-Arabs". The people with this legendary descent are simply known as "Arabs". "Arabised-Arabs", insofar as it is used, refers to people who <i>lack</i> this ancestry but have culturally become Arab, no? - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 22:11, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not very familiar with the traditional genealogy of the Arabs. I was always taught that Arabs were descendants of Ismael, and that was it. But since my start in Wikipedia, I have come across a very complex theory. The theory is that northern Arabs known as Adnanites descendend from <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan.html" title="Adnan">Adnan</a> and they settled in Mecca. They are known as Arabized Arabs (al-Mustariba). Southern Arabs who descend from <a href="../../../q/a/h/Qahtan.html" title="Qahtan">Qahtan</a>, brother of Adnan, are considered to be of pure origin (al-Ariba). More is explained in the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> article but the information is mostly unsourced. Anyhow, I think it is best that we consult with an expert on this subject, so I'm adding the 'expert tag'. --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 07:19, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that Khoikhoi has asked for a citation for "Countries and territories that are traditionally thought to have gone through Arabization include <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algeria.html" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tunisia.html" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libya.html" title="Libya">Libya</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_%28region%29.html" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a>, <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>." It's going ot be very hard to find a lot on line, because most online uses of "Arabization" will be about recent Arabization policies, not about the 7th and 8th centuries. At a quick check, looking online will require searches like <code>Syria "7th century" Arabization -kurds</code>. I don't have time to follow up right now, but this may help anyone who is trying to find appropriate citation. Khoikoi, you might want to try following this up yourself. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:16, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Saddam Husseins strategy in al-Anfal campaign was not fuelled with an intention to "Arabize" Kurdish-speaking groups in Kirkuk. He was in fact trying to spread out the opposers of the solidarity of the state. If the rebellion against him wasn't staged for political and economical gain by the Kurds, the Anfal campaign wouldn't have come to fruitition, thereby debunking any claim that it was "forced" Arabization. I think we need to revise that section. 213.42.2.11</p>
