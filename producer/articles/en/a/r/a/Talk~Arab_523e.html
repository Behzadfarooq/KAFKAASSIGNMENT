<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EArab_523e.html" title="Edit section: Who is an Arab?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Who is an Arab?</span></h2>
<p>No one knows that answer. This piece in the article goes in circles as it bring it right back the the question:</p>
<p>"Race: While the term “Arab” does not refer to a particular race, the majority of Arabs are categorized as Caucasians or “white” as the term is used in the United States.[citation needed] According to the U.S. census bureau, white is defined to include people with ancestral origins in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The Middle East and North Africa also has people who are black. Although these people refer to themselves as Arabs they are not considered White as their ancestral origins are not from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa. Examples of Arabs who are not White are Sudanese Arabs who are considered black Africans."</p>
<p>Now we all should know that North Africa is the home of the black man and that any people who look black or what people have come to think of as an 'arab' look are really just mixed-race peoples with the 'black African' base. Also, those who look white are European captives,;slaves from Europe.</p>
<p>This piece I grabbed from the article is odd and is a fine example of the confusing BS which is all about taking the black man out of historic interaction and mixing with Europeans. How can a 'black' man in North Africa who 'feels that he is an arab' not be considered white because "ancestral origins are not from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa?" Was the piece not taking about 'blacks' in North Africa? If not from there, where are they from? They are from Africa and anyone white is not native. The history ir very clear despite having to dig for it a lot. There was a whole lot of mixing going on, but the blackness STILL rund deep in North Africa, Egypt and Libya in particualr, while still visible even in Tunisia and Algeria, arguably the whitest nations in Africa, outside of European domination in Southern Africa. There are still to this day clearly black(those who you would not question or make excuses about) Africans in Algeria and Tunisia. Do some research. Arab is no race.--69.182.212.22 04:52, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just want to make a precision, as i am moroccan i can say that north africa is the land of only berbers and arabs,...the black people was brought by slavery..even if they speak arabic or bereber now.., it's too obvious that the sahara desert separate north africa population from the subsaharan africa..--<a href="../../../y/u/n/User%7EYunis79_9871.html" title="User:Yunis79">Yunis79</a> 14:52, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Alarm: The statement " arabs are not of homogenonous ethnic origin" is not correct. It should say " citizens of Arabic countries are not of homogenous ethnic origin"</p>
<p>First:</p>
<dl>
<dd>peoples of Arabic countries have the highest level of J1 Haplogroup ( semetic ancestry of both Arabs and jewsish Cohanim)and also DYS388-17 ( dubbed the marker of the arabs(exclusive to the arabs, not found in any one person claiming to be non arab any where in the world).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Second:</p>
<dl>
<dd>samples are taken from arabic countries randomly without checking if person claims to be an Arab or not?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Third:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is known that 20% of citizens of Arabic countries are not Arabs ( turkish, greek, armenians, maronites, kurds, gitanes, Cercassians, Chechenians, etc) These people deny vehemently that they are arabs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fourth:</p>
<dl>
<dd>still 80% of citizens of those countries are arabs according to CIA fact book online.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sixth:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Even with all the biased sampling noted above( in genetical studies) the Arabic populations have the highest J1 in the world, that makes them( ie the citizens in general) the most pure nation in the world.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Seventh</p>
<dl>
<dd>In hundred comparative studies done recently, strata were copared from people who claim to be Jewish Ashkenasim, Ashkenazi cohenite, sephardi cohenite, etc etc) compared to random samples referred to as ( Lebanon sample ) ( syria samples, Palestinians sample, etc). This kind of sampling is against statistic analysis sampling methodology conducted any where in Public Health research.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I suggest the statement to be adjusted as Above " citizens of Arabic countires ". Other wise the original staement " arabs are not of homogenic ethic origin" is not referenced by any scientific study ( where sampled people state to be Arabs, not just Lebanese etc)</p>
<p>Thanx Adam( new user). Arabs are the children of Ishmael (end of Story), you want evidence? Bible Quran and New testament ( historical writings of the semites as valid as Herodotus historian of the Greek. I don't see why don't accept all the evidence. Do you want a proof that the sun is really the sun and not the moon?</p>

<p>A lot of people have been citing the Torah and Qur'an on the talk page. It should be said that using religious books (even ones with some amount of verifiable historical fact) as reference material for an article about race/ancestry is completely inappropriate.</p>

<p>This article posted simply to explain the arab definition, it was poorly formatted, I agree as I am a new member, but the topic was mainly to explain the different between the real arab and the arabised Arabs. Since there is confusion of understanding the Arabic definition, those informations are useful to make things clear. The article was sourced by a noble arab family web site at <a href="http://www.harthi.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harthi.org" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> , <a href="http://www.harthi.org/ArabTree-I.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harthi.org/ArabTree-I.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and book called ( <a href="../../../m/u/a/Muallaqat.html" title="Muallaqat">Muallaqat</a>) for Imru'u al Quais taking about anthology of pre-Islamic Arabic literature. thanks and i'm always yearning to extend informations for this wonderful web page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry: but there is no mention of Sam and Ham etc in the Quran?, not even in any reliable Hadith, so plaese cut and in Quran.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Islam believes the Genesis part of the Biblr ( especially the geneology part ) is fabricated in later times. Many scientific researchers share the same belief ( even jesus and John the baptist) and the Dead Sea Scrolls Righteous Teaches ( most likely jesus himself)</p>
<p>Quran says that Noah talked to his son to jump on the boat but God drawned him any way).</p>
<p>Again here are more grievous mistakes:</p>
<p>Aribh arabs: refer to proto arabs ( bedoin) who are not settled in villages and cities ( mentioned in Quran and rophet to denote hard hearted arabs who are low in belief The Bedoin and no body else. Again Qahtanites are not Ariba Arabs. The best arabs are Qahtanite. Qahtan and Adnan were tow sons of Kedar the son of Ishmael. Qahtan left to Yemen, while Adnan stayed in Mecca.</p>
<p>Majority of Arabs in arabic countries are decendents of Qahtan ( Qays and Lakham), they made the second immigration wave in 11th to 14th centry after the Adnanites were killed in wars of conquest and also by the Mongolians ( up to Tamerlane 1400 AD) and Crusaders.</p>
<p>I am afraid you mix Qahtanites Arabs with a tribe in Saudi Arabia who are of lower status but not Yemenites ( like Qahtanites). They are purely from Najd middle platue of Saudi arabia, No Qahtanites exist out side the borders of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Almustaeriba is not Mustaeriba Arabs ( where did you add Arabs here) Mustaeriba are non arab people who speak arabic ( even fluently) but easily recognized in their speech as non arabs( even after millenia), neither Mustaeriba wanted to become arabs, nor can fool arabs that they are arabs.</p>
<p>The more I read this article the more I sense it is written in Whole by nonarab with an agenda to demean the Arabs. Should't this article be written by Arabs, and non arabs can write their opinion in a down the page section called critique. Is warren Christofer Jesus christ?</p>
<p>Does a man named Adam Al-Qahtani means he is the ancient Qahtan himself, or that only his tribe Qahtani are the decendents of Qahtan or exclusively the ancient Qahtanite? Is Rod Stewart King Stewart the first?</p>
<p>AlQahtani tribe in saudi arabia has nothing to do with the Qahtanites ( half the Arabs who dwelled in Yemen and decendents in Qahtan)</p>
<p>Also Adnan is not the son of Ishmael, he is son of Kedar ( Qaidar-- in Arabic) the second son of Ishmael. Ishmael had 12 sons, non of them named Ishmael. Adnanites and Qahtanites are the decendents of Kedar who alone of all his brothers stayed in Mecca and entrusted himself with guarding the Kaaba and hence the Kedarites became the most prominent of all arabs. Arabs arranged their clans based on marriages from sons of Qahtan and Adnan ( just like what is happening in Saudi Arabia where King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud had children from all tribes of Suadi arabia to unite the kingdom in his children ( all brothers)...You also mix ancient adnanite tribes with new arabic ones Alanasi is the tribe of king of Saudi arabia) hardly a adnanite, Bani Khaled a qahtanite tribe raised to prominence by being chosen by the Ottoman empire to transport logestics ( food arms etc) on behalf of the sultan). Banu tamim an old arabic tribe were not noble among the adnanites, they were from the Eastern Arabs ( sons of the 12 son of Ishmael), they rebelled against the Prophet ( later became Kharijites and even shia) . They were persecuted by Abu Bakr succer of Prophet, by not allowing tthem to ride horses or donkeys in their own land while other arabs ( westerns of Mecca area) can, as a punishment for becoming Kharijites ( rebels on Prophet and later khalifs), Kaab was a noble tribe.</p>
<p>No arab would dream to claim he is adnanite these days but some from Hadramut ( Adnanite compared to Qahtanites in North yemen.</p>
<p>However both Qahtanites and Adnanintes are brothers and nobles, not Ariba ( qahtanites) and Mustaeriba( adnanite as you claim). Other people who could be Adnanites could be found in Pakistan and even cicily. The adnanites spread world wide. When their numbers fell sharply during Mongol invasion, a new immigration wave from Yemen ( qahtanites) spread to the current arabic countries as far as Morocco. Actually Morroccan are mostly Yemenites still have memories of their latest immigration fresh.</p>
<p><br />
By the way, when did Ishmael learn arabic, Before he was two months old? so what did he speak before that? Hebrew?.</p>
<p>I don't think you believe the corrupted version in the bible in genesis where Hagar put her son ( 13 years according to the corrupted bible) and then she carries him across the desert ( how old was she according to the bible 60 years old?, and then she puts him on the ground and the boy cries ( thirteen years old boy) because he is thirsty, and then his mom the 60 years old search for water while the 13 years old boy sitting on the ground crying?</p>
<p>Did your mother hold you on her shoulder when you were 13 years old?.</p>
<p>Ishmael if was 13 years old should he hold his frailing mom ( 40 to sixty years old ) on his shoulders, and she should feel tired and thirsty and week before he does. I remember when I was 13 years old I would pass the whole day playing soccer only to remember at the evening that I did not eat or drink at all since wakeup.</p>
<p><br />
Arabs believe that Abraham took Hagar and her 2 month old and left them in arid desert on command of God. Baby crying and moving his tiny feet aon the sand water started seeping under neath him, while his mom was chasing Mirages on tow sides. When a passing tribe were passing by found the by now flowing well, the tribe loved Ishmael and highly regarded him as a good omen and later became their Holy man, king, any thing he wants made by them. You should write this story here any arab knows it even by more details than you can remember.</p>

<p>Arab (noun) - descibes a person of Arabic descent.</p>
<p>Historically, an Arab is descendant from one of two sons of the Prophet Ibrahim. The other son's linage is claimed by the Jews</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The word "Historically" is innapropriate here, as no verifiable "historical" data is available. To be precise, Arabs originate from Arabia. According to both the Koran and the Torah, Abraham or Ibrahim was born in the city of Ur (now part of Iraq). He travelled to Canaan where he had two sons: Isaac and Ishmael. According to the Torah, Isaac begat Jacob, who begat the entire nation of Israel. According to the Koran, Ishmael lived on, but his legacy was unclear until 2,000 years later, when the prophet Muhammed was told by Allah that there existed a prehistoric, but dormant religion known as Islam. This religion was told to Muhammed...and the rest is history.<a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoomis51_de2c.html" title="User:Loomis51">Loomis51</a> 23:52, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A massage to Loomis: The bible continues that Ishmael had 12 sons and God will make leaders of them ( leaders of what) what about God promise to Abraham that he will make a great nation from his son Ishmael and that they will fill the earth like sand ( does this refer to jews who are 8 million or Arabs who are 400 millions, what do you think?). Not only Muhammad say jews chanded the original religion. Samaritans say so about jews. Karaite jews say that about the jews, Essenes jews say that too, Christians say that too and so on. when did you arrive from Mars, Mr Loomis?</p>

<p><i>The Berber peoples of North Africa, for example, though often called Arabs by Westerners, are language of the country in which they live as a result of the Arab expansion.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Never have I heard anyone refer to the Berbers as being Arabs. Should this be removed?</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>There is a difference between someone who is of pure Berber stock, and someone who's ancestry is a mixture of Arabs and Berbers. The vast majority of the Magrib is of the latter category and consider themselves Arabs as do other Arabs. In any case I believe that the three categories on Arab geneology given in the articl are a little faulty. See my note below.&#160;:)</p>
<hr />
<p>CCC Clarification. Arab people have a great affinity to their language, and they classify themselves according to their shared language. A Berber's (Amazigh's) first language is not Arabic, hence they are not Arab. Disregarding the intermingling &amp; mixing of the two groups their are many studies that show that Berber &amp; Arabs do share common ancesters. The confusing part is the word Caucasian, people forget that the majority of genetic research do not seperate Caucasian from Semitic. So when you read research that says Berber are significantly Caucasian it would read the same way for an Arab. Many people disregard old Berber tribal oral traditions that state they have an origin in Yemen. Many just say that all those tribes invented those stories to join the elite groups, but this shows the little knowledge they have of Berber tribal societies that pride themselves and their autonomy throughout history. And strangely enough DNA tests place Berber most closely to Yemeni Arabs. Long ago Yemen did not speak Arabic and would have traveled to North Africa thousands of years before Islam &amp; Arabic, hence they (Yemeni) were not Arab yet. When the second wave of Yemeni people went to North Africa bearing Islam and Arabic they met their cousins the Berbers (non-Arabs). But they shared an understanding of common heritage. This is in general and does not negate the historical facts of Europene blood entering here and there, nor does it negate the fact of pure black african entering from the south. But essencially they &amp; Arabs &amp; Phonecians have much in common. by BB</p>
<hr />
<p>Another misconception is the notion that Arabs started with Ishmael. When in actuality Arabs started much more before Ishmael. They started not long after Noah &amp; Shem. Ishmael was not an Arab by blood &amp; learned Arabic from the tribes he lived with who had been speaking Arabic as it was already well established. Ishmael then intermarried with Arabs and so did his children and on &amp; on, then merging with the Arab people, to a point its hard to tell who is an Ishmaeli Arab from a Pure one. by BB</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nobody knows what Ishmael or Abraham spoke in what language. There was a proto arabic language. They might even spoke Aramaic or Canaanite language ( similar to arabic as evidenced in Tel Merdoukh library (Ebla 2300 BC)( names like Ishamel and David were in the Ebla library)</dd>
</dl>
<p>how do you know he learned arabic and what did he speak before that, how do you there was arabic language? there is no evidence of arabic language and arabs before 1600 BC, Is there? what is your evidence. Did the Coco ( Bird on the window) tell you that or did you see it in a revelation? slow down</p>
<hr />
<p><i>Racially, an Arab is a person of Arabic descent, whose original ancestry comes from the Arabian Peninsula. Arabs are a Semitic people, who trace their ancestry from the ancient patriarch Abraham.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see how this makes sense. The Arabs are racially very mixed, as they're descended from a mixture of conquored/assilimated peoples and millions of slaves from throughout the Old World.
<dl>
<dd>This applies better to the Islamic faith, which claims its founders were descended from Ishmael. --<a href="../../../t/y/d/User%7ETydaj_1a42.html" title="User:Tydaj">Tydaj</a> 00:12, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Arabs are racially classified as White.</i></p>
<p>Um. Which classification scheme are we using here? Because by language, Arabs are <a href="../../../s/e/m/Semitic.html" title="Semitic">Semitic</a>, as the article makes clear; by "<a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">race</a>", they are "<a href="../../../w/h/i/White_race.html" title="White race">white</a>", yes, but we all know <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nothing.html" title="Nothing">how much that means</a>. --<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Mirv</a> 08:43, 24 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Arabs are classified as white, no matter what their color is. Most Arabs are light brown in color, although there are many light complexioned Arabs and black complexioned Arabs. They are all called white because there is no official racial catergory for "<a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Eastern_4973.html" title="Middle Eastern">Middle Eastern</a>"</p>
<p>You guys are using obsolete and oversimplified definitions of race. The old Caucasoid, Mongoloid and Negroid groups (White, Yellow, Black) were popular ways of looking at race decades ago. These have all been debunked and have little genetic basis. You can't just define a race by being white or not, it is much more complicated than that.- Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg 10:24, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p><br />
Yea thats right, because Arabs, Persians, and Indians may be "caucasoid" but they're clearly not "white".</p>
<hr />
<p>Actually Arabs are white. The caucasians ( europeans) who consider themselves white are actually red with unclean skin ( black freckles)</p>
<p>This is what ancients described the Goths (Gog) ancesters of current day Europeans</p>
<hr />
<p>Berber are the Vandals a tribe of the Goths. They lived firstly on the Baltic shore and emigrated with the Goths through Europe during Volkerwanderug period, Vandals ( Berber) settled finally inSpain and moved to North Africa but the Visigoth ( Western Goth drove them out of spain. Berbers ( vandals continued to live in North Africa and raided the Irtalian peninsula until Roman Emperor Justinian sent armies to North africa to subjigate them, however they syrvivved in the mountains untill arabs came.</p>
<p>The Berber have high concentration of Blue eyes and fair hair 20%, they have a genetic marker ( Haplogroup) that is found just recently to be the same as the marker ( ancestry of the Europeans R2b. Their marker was included with the markers of subsaharan africans ( Phutians Nigeria) for the sake to create a marker of Africa large enough to call it Africa Marker. Nothing further from the truth. Don't trust researchers but read carefully their studies ( they come with conclusions like what their payees expect to see) to keep the money flowing</p>

<p><i>such as the Maronite Christian Arabic-speakers of Lebanon, or the Arabic-speaking Copts of Egypt, or Arabic-speaking Jews, reject this definition, wishing to identify not with a group defined by language but with a narrower one defined by religion or shared communal history.</i></p>
<p>Huh? First of all, the classification of "Arab" is not based on language (at least, not anymore...there was a period when this kind of Arab Nationalism was popular during the Ottomon period, but not anymore). Second, only an extreme fringe of Civil War-period Maronites reject the label of "Arab". I myself am a "Maronite Christian Arabic-speaker of Lebanon" and I take offence at such a claim. The only real, modern definition of an Arab is someone who is a citizen of an Arab League nation. --Jad 13:03, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi Jad. Though I wrote most of that paragraph, I sympathise with some of your objections to it... I mentioned that some Maronites reject the label "Arab" because I've actually talked to several such people; but I agree, we should make it much clearer that this is an extremist minority. As for the "Arab = speaker of Arabic", though, I think that makes a lot more sense than "Arab = citizen of Arab League nation"; if you call a <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berber.html" title="Berber">Berber</a> or a <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinka.html" title="Dinka">Dinka</a> or a <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurd.html" title="Kurd">Kurd</a> "Arab", the substantial majority of them (though not all) would strongly disagree, and conversely, the Arab minority in southern Iran or southeastern Turkey or Chad is no less Arab for having happened to fall outside the borders of the Arab League. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 19:10, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>True, but I think we need to add both definitions: the sociopolitical as well as the ethnoliguistic, because, as you just pointed out, neither is enough as a definition. Maybe we should distinguish between Arab peoples and Arabic peoples, the first refering to the political definition, and the second referring to the linguistic definition. In this way, the minorities in Iran, Turkey and Chad would be Arabic minorities, and not Arab. I know that this may seem like a frustrating play in semantics, but I think that its the only way to deal with the two point of views while mantaining NPOV. Is that alright with you?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, why don't you expand the part on the minorities within Arab nations, and add that part on Arabic minorities within non-Arab nations?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hmmm... How about something like this:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There are three factors which play varying degrees in determining whether someone is considered Arab or not:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Political: whether they live in a country which is a member of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_League_2a91.html" title="Arab League">Arab League</a>.</li>
<li>Linguistic: whether their mother tongue is <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>.</li>
<li>Genealogical: whether they can trace their ancestry back to the original inhabitants of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabian_Peninsula_3421.html" title="Arabian Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The relative importance of these factors is estimated differently by different groups. The third factor was the original definition used in medieval times, but is usually no longer considered to be particularly significant. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 20:18, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>Ok:</p>
<p>According to Habib Hassan Touma (1996, p.xviii), "The essence of Arabian culture is wrapped up in:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Arabic language...</li>
<li>Islam...</li>
<li>Tradition..."</li>
</ul>
<p>Maronites do not practice Islam. Not Arab. Simple.</p>
<p>On its formation in 1946, the Arab League defined an "Arab" as follows:</p>
<p>"An Arab is a person whose language is Arabic, who lives in an Arabic speaking country, who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arabic speaking peoples."</p>
<p>Maronites speak Arabic, but their liturgy is in Aramaic, and they often speak French and English fluently, and often primarily. And their sympathies typically lie with the nation of Lebanon first, and secondly with the WEST. Therefore, not Arab. These are westernized people who worship Christ and who happen to have adopted Arabic due to proximity and previous invasions. How does this make them arab?</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>A few clarifications. Number 1, most Maronites concider themselves Arab. Number 2, to classify a people by a political statement is baseless. Number 3, Arabs feel an affinity to their language. Essencially I have found a trick that always works. I have always found that if a person's grandparents speak Arabic at home (first language) as well as parents (first language) as well as themselves...they they regard themselves as Arabs. It has never failed.</li>

<p>Do you think we need to add a section on what "Arabized" means? For example, I know that the Christian Spaniards during the Arab conquest of Spain were considered to be Arabized, and now there is a word in English to describe them (Mozarabs)which comes from the Arabic word for Arabized (Musta'arab).

It would be better to comment on the Arabized Arabs such as the Adanite branch (rather than the qahtani Arab pure branch) the Vast majority of the Arabs are Adanite (from Adnan)TheLibyan</p>

<p>This article strikes me as needing a lot of improvement. Some things I immediately notice:</p>
<ol>
<li>It mentions two traditional groups, the "original Arabs" and the "Arabacized Arabs" but what about the well known third group, the "extinct/lost Arabs"? More detail about the ancient clans in all these groups would be useful.</li>
<li>Jewish tradition does not say that Ishmael is the ancestor of the Arabs, it says he is the ancestor of the Ishmaelites a people who had disappeared from history by the time of Solomon. Josephus says that he was the "founder" of the Arabians but does not use the word for ancestor and calls the Ishmaelites _an Arabian people_ indicating that he was aware of other Arabians. Arab historians had various opinions regarding Ishmael, several producing mutually contradictory attempts at linking Adnan to him while others rejected such genealogies. All this should be mentioned for both completeness and neutrality. Similarly the highly conjectural nature of the equation of Joktan with Qahtan needs to be mentioned for the sake of neutrality (Hebrew form of Qahtan is Kachtan unrelated to Joktan.)</li>
<li>Regarding early references to Arabs and Gindibu it should be pointed out for the sake of completeness and neutrality that there were several different words in ancient inscriptions and in the Bible commonly translated as "Arab" or "Arabian" but that they are not necessarily all the same group (in the Bible we have `arvi, `arviyi, `arvi'i, `aravi, `araavi) and moreover the meaning of the words translated "Arab" or "Arabian" were not always the same (desert dwellers, mixed people, eloquant/pure, person from Arabaya in Assyria, person from the Syrian desert, person from the Arabian peninsula) - its complicated so one is tempted to ignore these subtleties but we need to rise above that.</li>
<li>More info on modern groupings/divisions amongst the Arabs, lingusitic, "ethnic", cultural etc.</li>

<dl>
<dd>Its not a minority view, its a scholarly view based on what is actually said by historians (mainly Arab historians). Unfortunately it is a topic that has become tangled up with fundamentalist Christian polemics against Islam which has politicized the subject and made people defensive of points of view which in reality have little bearing on religion. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuratowski%27s_Ghost_768e.html" title="User:Kuratowski's Ghost">Kuratowski's Ghost</a> 23:43, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That could be interesting, yes; <a href="http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/History/pre-islamic.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bismikaallahuma.org/History/pre-islamic.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> is a good source for that.</li>
<li>Arab tradition says Ishmael was ancestor of the northern ("Arabized") Arabs. Jewish tradition says that Ishmael was ancestor of the Ishmaelites, identified already in the Bible with Midianites; as the Arabs become more historically prominent, it tends more and more to identify the Ishmaelites with Arabs, and the Josephus quote you allude to is useful information on that subject, though I would think a detailed investigation of the term "Ishmaelite" and its shifts would belong in <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishmaelite.html" title="Ishmaelite">Ishmaelite</a>. Calling the Ishmaelites "a people who had disappeared from history by the time of Solomon" seems somewhat ahistorical, given that the existence of Solomon itself is in question. The equation of Joktan with Qahtan is of course most probably nonsense (did either even exist?), but it's nonsense with a long pedigree. I think "identified with" already makes its conjecturality reasonably clear.</li>
<li>Certainly some uses of the term Arab may be generic rather than specific. That applies not only to the fifteenth century BC, but to the fifteenth century AD! The case of Gindibu seems reasonably clear, being confirmed by the etymology of the name, and is generally cited.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Its not clear to me at all, one expects similar names by virtue of the fact that Semitic languages were spoken all over the Middle East. As the stub on Gindibu notes nothing more is known about him and his Arabs. The name of his people could mean any of a number of things, I don't see how it can be said with confidence that it denotes the same people who emerged as the Arab nation in Late Antiquity in the Arabian peninsula proper with a name meaning "pure" or "eloquant", to me its more likely a reference to the people of the Syrian desert in general (Biblical `Arvim) who are described in the Bible as being a mingled people. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuratowski%27s_Ghost_768e.html" title="User:Kuratowski's Ghost">Kuratowski's Ghost</a> 00:42, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Is the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian_Desert_1d32.html" title="Syrian Desert">Syrian Desert</a> really that specific of an area?

<dd>The people of the Syrian Desert have been termed Arabs since at least Assyrian times, and have spoken languages more closely related to Arabic than to any other Semitic language since the earliest attested inscriptions there (at least the 6th century BC, for <a href="../../../l/i/h/Lihyanite.html" title="Lihyanite">Lihyanite</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thamudic.html" title="Thamudic">Thamudic</a>.) I'm not sure what it would mean for a name in the 10th century BC to denote "the same people who emerged as the Arab nation"; the word "Arab" even <i>today</i> doesn't primarily denote the descendants of those people, and its application across time is more relevant than unprovable questions of ancestry. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 00:57, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To get an understanding of what I'm going on about bear in mind that there are many examples of different ethnic groups in history with similar names who are not necessarily always closely related, think of how many designations are derived ultimately from the Sanskrit word Sindh: Sindhu, Sinti, Hindu, Hindustani, Indian, Indonesian, West Indian, East Indian, Red Indian! Similarly think Roman, Romanian, Romansch, Rhomaic, Roman Catholic, Holy Roman and Romany (note the last isn't even related to the others it just looks the same). Something similar is going on with the various words carelessly lumped under the single transation "Arab" without any real concern for what is meant and how the terms evolved over time in form and meaning and if they are all even related to each other. Its sloppy scholarship to ignore this. One would be laughed at if one tried to portray all the peoples I mentioned above as single "Indian" and "Roman" nations. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuratowski%27s_Ghost_768e.html" title="User:Kuratowski's Ghost">Kuratowski's Ghost</a> 01:25, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But there is no single "Arab" nation to portray. Never has been. As for relation, the linguistics is the key; see below. I do see your point about the dangers of an uncritical identification of groups with similar names as similar, but in this case both the linguistic evidence and the location help avoid the problem. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 01:35, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>However, the article should probably have more on the early attestations of the Arabic language, those being a more certain indicator, and later on the traditional histories of the <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghassanid.html" title="Ghassanid">Ghassanids</a> and their like. Heck, it should have a real history section; that's the most obvious gap!</p>
<ol>
<li>Maybe. Linguistic doesn't belong here - see <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varieties_of_Arabic_d0dc.html" title="Varieties of Arabic">varieties of Arabic</a> - but certain ethno-cultural divisions, especially the basic one between Bedouin and settled folk, might be worth discussing. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 23:58, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Aha... "The earliest attestations of Arabic are a number of proper names borne by leaders of Arab tribes mentioned in Neo-Assyrian texts. While some of them bear Arabic names, others have names that belong to a group of dialects now called Proto-Arabic or Ancient North Arabian." (p. 74, Edward Lipinski, <i>Semitic Languages: Outlines of a Comparative Grammar</i>, 2nd ed., Orientalia Lovanensia Analecta: Leuven 2001.) I knew I'd track down the source I was half-remembering. It's not in this source, but I have also read that Gindibu is among the latter, the term <i>jundub</i> (grasshopper) being specifically Arabic rather than Semitic. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 01:07, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>HHHH Here is a clarification. The original Semitic people came from Arabia, they moved north and east. After time, the Semitic people devised many dialects of "Semitic". Those dialects became known as "Languages" after diversification. Ishmael with his mother moved to the Arabic concentrated area. Ishmael learned Arabic and married an Arab girl. He begot Arab children from their mothers side. Those children again married Arab. This continued until those children became a big tribe called Quraysh or Quraish, reknowed for the perfection of their dialect of Arabic &amp; for being a strong and honored tribe among the Arabs. Their DNA would have been diluted nearly completely by the Arab tribe Ishmael joined. But as we know the Y chromasome is passed down by the father. Hence it is relavent to state that Quraysh's male population would have had a great affinity geneticly to Ishmael, the non-Arab. Yet Maternaly they would have had a greater affinity to the other Arab tribes. by BB</p>

<dd>Yes Jayjg, that is true if we see it from the side of a Jew identifying him/herself (though there are <i>Asian Jews</i> and in other contexts <i>French Jews</i>, <i>Moroccan Jews</i>, etc...) You can read in the article the questionable Hadith stating that an Arab is anyone speaking Arabic or who learned it. I think with the appearance of Islam, the notion of being an Arab changed. As far as I know, Arabs consider Jews who speak Arabic as Arabs.

<dd>Well, I know a number of Arabic speaking Jews, and they don't consider themselves to be Arabs. I think we should let people self-identify.

<dd>They can be anywhere since it is not important where they live. Some Shanghai Jews are being found in Shanghai, Vancouver... As far as I know, a valid Jewish marriage can only exist between two Jews and that's why I wonder from where came Thai Jews! They have surely converted to Judaism and therefore the ethnicity basis is questionable. <i>Mihu Yehudi</i>? Acording to WP, the word Jew is used in a wide number of ways, but generally refers to a follower of the Jewish faith, a child of a Jewish mother, or someone of Jewish descent <i>with a connection to Jewish culture</i> or ethnicity; and often a combination of these attributes. As long as there are conversions, the ethnicity have a fragile ground. -- Cheers <a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF">Svest</a> 21:47, 15 September 2005 (UTC) <a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange">&#160;<sup><i>Wiki me up™</i></sup></font></a></dd>

<dd>Is Thai Jews even a common phrase or ethnicity? I assume they are the small number of Jews born in Thailand.

<dd>Yes, Thai Jews are Jews born in Thailand or in any other place that are of Asian ethnicity, exactly Thailand. Of course they are only a few. The point Jayjg is that having Jews from Asian background bring a question mark to the theory about the ethnic identity. As I said, Jews in practice are not of a ONE ethnicity.

<dd>This is irrelevant. The fact that there may be Thai Jews (BTW this is an unsubstantiated allegation please give some source) does not change anything. It remains to be seen if they are converted to Judaism or people from Jewish descent as most traditional form of Judaism generally do not accept conversions on a large scale. At the end Jewish identity is based on ethnicity because it's the way they see it. As Jayjg pointed, ultimately the identity of a human group is based on how they themselves define it. Moreover this thai group needs to be numerically relevant, a few tens of people is not going to change the Jewish identity--<a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquitor_1cfe.html" title="User:Equitor">equitor</a> 05:33, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>God there was an edit conflict, I almost lost my text&#160;:)&#160;!</dd>
<dd>Jayjg, I didn't meant that oriental Jews were Arabs, on the contrary. I wanted to point at the article inconsistency. You need to know that while Christianity is a religion, Estern Christianity (or Christianiti<b>es</b> to be more accurate) is similar to Judaism on this level because it's closely related to ethnicity and that is its most striking characteristic vis-à-vis of western form of Christianity. This is even true for the Eastern European Churches. An Armenian (who is not an Arab but it's an example of Eastern Christianity) is part of the Armenian church (which is base on ethnicity). Maronite are also an ethnic church, same for Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac/copts etc... They pre-existed the Arab presence in the Middle East and had their own distinctive language until recently (and some Christians groups still speak their own language that is different from Arabic). Unlike Judaism, conversion to these Churches are not discouraged but are very rare which means that these churches are largely based on ethnic identities that predates the Arabic/Islamic conquest of the region.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While some Levantine Christians (especially the Greek-Orthodox and this might explain your bias since you may be more familiar with Palestinian Christians, see link C) not all Christians in the Middle East are defined by Michel Aflaq, Edward Said and George Habash. In fact, most of them reject Arabity as an ethnic identity even if they speak dialect of Arabic (which is a weak claim since spoken dialects still retain much of the original Aramean/Syriac language, perhaps as much as classicla). Some so-called Arabic Christians did not even abandon their pre-Arabic language! Iraqi Christians have a distinct language that was also talked by Jewish see.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This sentence ('Arabic Christians') is not anodine since it justifies a controversial Arab nationalistic claim. Actually, the whole concept was invented by nationalist like Aflaq. They tried to recategorize various prearabic people (including the Berbers and the Kurds) as Arab. The people in question (be it 'Arabic Christians' are other) are denied the right to define their own cultural inclination. A very interesting parallel can be made with the English-Irish relations (there's plenty of other examples). Irish people were a celtic/gaeilic people that was conquere by the English crown. Their original gaelic language was progressively replaced with English (although they kept a strong gaelic accent as we all know). Nevertheless, the Irish retained their own identity despite the English attempts to assimilate them. They are not English period. This is evident today but was not so clear in the past (to some English imperialist). While I do not deny that there are Arab Christians, you cannot put an Arab label on all the Christian communities in the Middle-East (and this is what the article does). Nationality/Ethnicity is not only a matter of language.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The point is that while Christianity is not ethnic, some Christians groups/churches are indeed based on ethnic identity. And if there's arab-speaking jews, then it must apply for other ethnicities.</dd>

<p>It is true that the traditionally there are three (3) genealogical categories of Arabs. But I believe that the three you have given are severly flawed. As an Arab living outside the Arab World I have thought about this question to no end. As a result I have read anything that has to with Arabs and Arabic (thats how I became aware of this websit). So if the editor of this article finds no contradiction with the categories below I hope he/she will make the necessary amendments. 1. The first category is known in Arabic as 'ARAB BAD'EH (which roughly means, Originating Arabs). These Arabs were and are the Arabs of Yemen. They were not all destroyed as the article suggests. The people of Thamud and Ad were only two groups of this people and not the entire people. In any case it should be stated that the in Quranic stories (those of Ad and Thamud and the rest) God always saves the righteous and smites only the wicked. These Arabs trace their heritage to Qhatan. 2. The second category is known in Arabic as 'ARAB 'ARBAH (literally Arabizing Arabs). These are the arabs of the northern part of the peninsula. They are the children of 'Adnan. Incidently 'Adnan and Qhattan were brothers and the decendents of Sam (Shem in Hebrew and in the Bible) son of Nuh (Noah). They were the sixth generation of Nuh (Noah). I thought greatly about the difference between this category and the first and I believe, as their name suggests, that the second category refers to the Bedouins of the peninsula, whom are unlike the Arabs of Yemen who have alway been sedentary. The last part is just educated conjecture on my part. 3. The third category is known in Arabic as 'ARAB MUSTA'RIBAH (MU.STA.'RIB.AH which means Arabized Arabs). This group (probably the largest) makes up all the ethnic mixturs of the Arabs. Further these people can be divided into two main groups. First they would include Arab-Greek, Arab-Roman, Arab-Persian and other mixtures that were present before Islam and inhabited the very northern parts of the peninsula and the lands of the "sham" (i.e. Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine). Second they would also include those mixtures that arose after Islam, and inhabit mostly North Africa. In this last sub-category you can include Arab-Hemitic (Egyptians and I guess Lybia), the Famous Arab-Berber of the Maghrib (Algeria, Tunis and Morocco) also I have seen Maur (Mauritania)and African (the Sudan) as additional subcategories.</p>
<p>In any case these categories are outdated. They would only be of significance to students of history who would care to study how Arabs viewed themselves through out history. In today's world no Arab goes aroud identifying him/her self with the the three adjectives listed above. I think the defination at the top of article "[an Arab is] someone who considers himself to be an Arab (regardless of racial or ethnic origin) and is recognized as such by others" is best defination any of us can give.</p>

<dd>It ignores no such thing. It clearly states that is TODAY that those Mizrahim from Arab countries are not considered Arabs, but that this was not the case at one time in the recent past. As for the Farhud, it was a tragic even in the history of Iraqi Jewry, but one cannot ignore the fact that it was one event (which itslef was not a manifestation of local politics, but the result of Nazi idealogiees being grounded in Iraq by Nazi German emissaries). Ashkenazi Zionists like to emphasize on the Farhud, and turn it into the Holocaust of the Middle East. Arab nationlism did at one stage (and even today among liberal Arab nationalist, and even the official declaration of the PLO) included "Arabs of the Jewish faith", but this was compromised by the intrusion of Zionists (European Jews) into Iraqi Jewry (and all non-European Jewry for that matter) who were in fact anti-Zionists. <b><a href="../../../a/l/-/User%7EAl-Andalus_6db0.html" title="User:Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> 17:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</b>.
<dl>
<dd>Even Mendes himself lists many other factors besides the Farhud which contributed to this, and not all were the result of Nazi influence. These included dismissals of Jews from government posts, and bombings against Jews and Jewish institutions in the 1930s, a government initiated "official anti-Jewish policy of controlled oppression and discrimination" in the 1940s, and the "arrest and execution of the millionaire businessman, Shafiq Ades... an assimilated Jew unsympathetic to Zionism." Even if your source were a good one, it is entirely unreasonable to make such partisan use of its contents. Goodoldpolonius2 complained vociferously about this above as well. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:11, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Mendes does state that there were other factors besides the Farhud, but that one is the most cited by Ashkenazi Zionists. The dismisals of Jewish civil servants was the direct result of Nazi propaganda having reached the Middle East (since much of the region was at that time under colonial occupation of one or another European power). All of those events - the dismissals, the Farhud, etc - are the result of the introgression of European ideologies (Nazism and Zionism). As for the bombings, I don't believe you even have the audacity to mention them, being that the consensus (outside Zionist apologetic circles, of course) attributes them to small undergroud Ashkenazi-led Israeli Zionists networks in Iraq. A claim that most Iraqi Jews to this day protest against the state of Israel.</dd>
<dd>That the Iraqi "<i><b>goverment initiated "official" anti-Jewish policies</b></i>" is a fact that no one will deny, but you seem to forget that for the most part, it was also at the persistance of Israeli (Ashkenazi) Zionist emmiseries that these policiees were formulated to have the Jews of Iraq in an exodus to Israel. Of course, neither are we going to deny that to a certain extent, Iraq also wanted to rid itself of those few Zionist, but they were under the impression that most would not leave, at least not the majority who were anti-Zionists and an integral part to Iraqi Arab society and nationhood.</dd>
<dd>You are probably well aware that these tacticts were not new. They had been used by Zionist even against their fellow European Jews. Making pacts with several goverments around the world, getting them to enact anti-immigration laws for fleeing European Jews, or pressuring them to refuse entry of Jews fleeing persecution in Europe, so as to have as many of these Jews to go to Palestine. Chaim Weizmann "<i>One cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in Europe</i>". They were opportunistic parasites, willing to participate in the Nazi murder of millions of Jews in their demented quest to create their secular anti-Jewish State of Israel. Had it not been for the Zionists, even the Holocaust that befell European Jewry would not have been on the scale it was. When they were not merely participating in the killings (as in Europe), they were the ones actually setting off the bombs at synagogues and cafés (in Iraq, Egypt, etc).</dd>
<dd>How many time did the Zionists refuse the transportation of European Jews to safety in countries willing to absorb them, just because they would not relocate to Palestine, and thus sentencing hundreds of thousands to Jews to death (including the almost enitre Jewish population of Hungary). And now today, the Zionists have the audacity to propaganda that if Israel had existed at the time of the Holocaust it never would have happened, forgetting that the persecution (which because of the Zionists turned into the that massive murder, the Holocaust) was an integral part in the process of the estamblishment of the Zionist State (even Herzel acknoweladged this in <a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Judenstaat_5621.html" title="Der Judenstaat">Der Judenstaat</a>). <b><a href="../../../a/l/-/User%7EAl-Andalus_6db0.html" title="User:Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> 03:10, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</b>.

<p>All of this is due to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Herzl_50f5.html" title="Theodore Herzl">Theodore Herzls</a> doctrine of Zionism described in <a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Judenstaat_5621.html" title="Der Judenstaat">Der Judenstaat</a>, which has changed over the years from the original thesis, though people argue in what ways. He argued that Jews in Europe would never be safe without their own state. In Europe, religion is in many ways ethnicity, especially in the baltic states. The European mindset pervades modern Zionist thinking. This includes the idea that every ethnicity deserves its own state. The fact is before Rabbi Avraham Yitzhak Cook and those like him became champions of Zionism, many religious orthodox jews thought the idea of a Jewish State blasphemous since God was to provide it, without human interfernce. The Jewish national identity is an evolution of the exclusion Jews encountered as minorities in various societies.

<dd>Putting aside the Mizrahim and Teimanim, if a Jewish mother bears a daughter with a non-Jewish Arab father, that child is Jewish. If this child in turn bears a child with another non-Jewish Arab father, that child is just as Jewish, yet also Arab. That Arab and Jewish are mutually exclusive terms is a fallacy. That the identification as such is these day a limited phenomenon (following the cultural cleansing of Arab Jews in Israel subsequent to their absorbtion and continued modern politics) is another kettle of fish altogether. So to say that "<i>culturally, a Jew can be considered an Arab but <b>never ethnically</b></i>" is untrue. A Jew <b>can</b> be an Arab either in culture, ethnicity, or both, and still remain 100% Jewish.

<p>CCCC Clarification. Actually a Jew (ethnically) and an Arab (ethnically) can be the same person. How?!?! You may ask HOW!?!? Well its very simple. Jews follow "Matrilineality" which is a system in which one belongs to one's mother's lineage. And Arabs follow "Patrilineality" which is a system in which one belongs to one's father's lineage. Hence. IF the FATHER is an Arab and the MOTHER is a Jew, then the child would be an ARAB JEW.&#160;:-D by BB</p>

<dd>Race can be a complicated topic with this issue as there are modern perspectives (Euro-American, African American, and Mideastern/North African/Arab-Berber) and ancient ones. Mostly, it is believed that the Muslims (Moors is just a derivative of the term Muslim) of Spain were largely of Berber extraction, but led largely by the Arabs who had recently conquered them and then Caliphs ruled Spain. There were, what we'd call today 'black' rulers of Spain though, notably the <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almoravides.html" title="Almoravides">Almoravides</a>. The Arab-Berbers did view sub-Saharan people as different from themselves, but weren't strict when it came to mixed people or intermarriage (as neither were Northern Europeans until the modern era really). An interesting book on the subject is one by Bernard Lewis (can't stand the guy mostly, but he's written a few books that aren't bad) called 'Race and Slavery in the Middle East'. He uses native sources so European misinterpretation and race is not a problem when he discusses the region (including North Africa). Mostly, non-Muslim blacks were viewed as alien similar to Slavs, while Muslims who were sub-Saharan varied in their level of acceptance in society. The Berbers generally regard sub-Saharan people as different, but this again varies. The Tuareg are clearly largely of sub-Saharan background for example. The rendering you are referring to sounds like some of the Afro-centric stuff written on the subject, which takes the opposite position of the old white supremacist views that sought to portray all important peoples of the past as Northern European in appearance (including Jesus the Levantine Jew). In my opinion, both extreme positions are inaccurate and genetic tests show who the Berbers and Arabs are related to and the African component is substantial in some places, but overall I'd say North Africa is not African culturally so much as Southwest Asian, if we're comparing to areas outside of North Africa that is. Ultimately, one has to keep in mind that continents don't equal one culture or people. Eurasia is a vast supercontinent with massive diversity and China and India border each other with the Nepalese and Tibetans overlapping a little. Similarly, I'd say the Maghrib is more or less an extension of the modern Middle East, while Mauretanian, Sudan, East Africa show a high degree of overlap. Having been to the region and known many people from the region and studied the area in grad school, these would be my conclusions. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 00:55, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>The Conquerors Were Moors</b></p>
<p>The Islamic conquerors of Spain &amp; Southern Italy were called Moors. We must delve more deep into the question "Who were the Conquerors?" instead of just one term (Moor) that describes them. History has been recorded on both sides of the fence. Arabs, Berbers &amp; to a lesser extent West Africans are those very Moors. West Africans played a vital role during surges in history, yet the Arabs &amp; Berbers were in it for the duration.</p>
<p>Back to the point about the Conquerors, they in general divided their Army into 3 seperate nearly equal in size entities. One was called the Yemeni Army (an all Arab Yemeni group). Second was the Amazigh Army (an all Berber group). And third was called the Arab Army that comprized of Arabs from the 4 corners of the empire but also contained at different times "West Africans". This third group although called the Arab group could be understood to be an all inclusive group of any Muslim of any nationality/ethnicity. And just as in pecking order the spoils went first to the Arabs then the Berbers.</p>
<p>Another point is that a very light colored Arab still possesses genes for an easy tan. And those that traveled and fought in the Sahara, didn't have cars as they do today, soldiers that were in the gleeming sun all day (on camel or horseback) was hardly "white". Even today a Moroccan Arab that spends all his days at the beach soakin in the rays resemble dark brown Brazilians.</p>
<p>The ever tanning Arab sweltering in the Sahara, was symbolized in the eyes of the Europe during the dark ages as a "Dark Face" or "Black" and were used in a derogatory mannor similar to derogatory terms used today against Africans. by BB</p>

<p>Hello guys, over all, I did not get it. Arab is a person whose race and ethnicity is Arab or his or her language is Arabic. For example, I wonder how Egyptians can be called Arab while ethnically they are absolutely not related to Arabic peninsula. Same case with Syrians. I am afraid they are not Arabs. If they are Arab, so who are the people that were living in Yemen? However that I appreciate Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Egyptian culture, I am not sure if they are real Arab. However, being Arab is not necessary a pride or shame. I did not mean this at all. I wanted just to clarify the discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think you'll find that the majority opinion out in the world is that an Arab is one who speaks Arabic, is from the middle east and is ( in a circular way ) seen by other Arabs as an Arab. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 21:45, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Also, self-identification is key, perhaps it is the most important in identifying who is an Arab and who is not. I don't think anyone who is from the "Middle East" is considered an Arab by others, maybe people from the "Arab world", but then again you have significant non-Arab minorities living there who do not want to be labeled Arab. Also, I don't think there is an answer to "Who are the original/real Arabs." I have heard different theories, one theory is that the South Arabians (Yemenis) are the true Arabs and other Arabs are the decendants of Arabized people (including the prophet Muhammed) (see <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan.html" title="Adnan">Adnan</a>). And then another theory, which is completely opposite, in that Yemenis were Arabized by northern Arabs. Anyway, it is not important to get caught up in this, we choose to call ourselves Arabs regardless of our roots, and many will be offended when their Arabness is questioned. --<a href="../../../i/n/a/User%7EInahet_e93c.html" title="User:Inahet">Inahet</a> 23:03, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have to agree with this, I don't think it's right to use the term 'Arab' for all of Middle East. Further, I also think the definitions under 'geneological' and 'linguistic' can be debated. For example, someone who lives and was born in Mexico, but technically their origins 10 generations ago are Arab, does that make them Arab also? Or someone who lives in Iran and their first language is arabic, are they also Arabs? <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:Io_Katai" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:Io_Katai" rel="nofollow">Io Katai</a> 06:26, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"some Arabs can traced thier names back to Noah." (No comment needed.)</li>
<li>"The Arabs originally came from Petra" (!!!!)</li>
<li>". The term Arabised-arabs is also used for defining the arabs whom spoke other languages than ancient Arabic (semetic languages in the Middle-East such as Phoenician, Assyrian, Akkadian, Aramaic etc. and hametic (Ham son of noah) languages such as Egyptian, Berber or Tamazight and some African languages)." (this reflects some extreme Arab nationalists who pointlessly redefine "Arab" to mean "speaker of any Afroasiatic language")</li>
<li>"Biblical tradition: in the Biblic context someone who is a descendant of Abraham through his son Ishmael, and his sons Medan and Median." The Bible has no relevance to the question of who is an Arab; it only rarely even uses the term, although Christian and Jewish tradition identifies the Ishmaelites with the Arabs.</li>
<li>"According to Islamic tradition an Arab is a person descending Isma'il (Ishmael) son of The Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham)." Wrong. According to Islamic tradition, the northern (musta`riba) Arabs are descended from Ishmael; the southern ones aren't.</li>

<p>Because it statemeants were unfounded. The bible does not refer to the Arabs as descendants of Ishmael. "Ishmaelites" and "Arabs" are mentioned seperately in the bible without any hint that they are both one in the same. The tradition that identifies the two with each other is a much later one (originating, I believe, from Iosephus). I have no idea were to the claim that the Medan and Median were forefathers to the Arabs, but it's definetly not the bible. Harvest day fool 17:27, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>There are many mistakes with this map. For one, Eritrea and Somalia are not Majority Arab states. There aren't any Arabs native to Somalia, and Eritrea only has the less than 1% Rasha'ida immigrants from the late 19th century in the country. Moreover, the "strong Arab influence" in the region should be limited to the northern Eritrean coast (i.e. areas north of <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massawa.html" title="Massawa">Massawa</a>), <a href="../../../d/j/i/Djibouti.html" title="Djibouti">Djibouti</a>, the Somali</i> coast<i>, the <a href="../../../o/g/a/Ogaden.html" title="Ogaden">Ogaden</a> region in Ethiopia, and the area around Harer.

Other areas aren't properly light Green. Moreover, non-Arabs in Sudan extend much farther north than that (<a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Sudan_c018.html" title="Southern Sudan">Southern Sudan</a>, the autonomous region, itself extends farther north, and non-Arabs live outside of the strictly defined region). All of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darfur.html" title="Darfur">Darfur</a> and Western Sudan aren't Arab. Furthermore, Western Sahara is not considered "Arab" by its inhabitants, but rather "<a href="../../../s/a/h/Saharawi.html" title="Saharawi">Saharawi</a>.' <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauritania.html" title="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>, too, is not completely Arab.

The labelling of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad.html" title="Chad">Chad</a> as majority Arab is incorrect. At most, it can be said to have "Arab influence" in a few of its Northern areas, but I would leave that out as well. Note that all of my definitions of "Arab influence" for the Horn are rather loose. Most of these aren't "strong," but actually rather weak. I would leave out the "Arab influences" part (hard to define anyway), and simply go with ethnic Arabs. It's also not relaly necessary since the article <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> is on the people, not on their influences, and "Arab" influences in this article seems to be "Muslim" influence, and the two cannot be equated. Also note that the <a href="../../../b/e/j/Beja_people.html" title="Beja people">Beja</a> are shown on the map as being Arab, which they are not.

<dd>روى الحافظ ابن عساكر قال جاء قيس بن مطاطية إلى حلقة فيها سلمان الفارسي وصهيب الرومي وبلال الحبش فقال&#160;: هؤلاء الأوس والخزرج قد قاموا بنصرة هذا الرجل يعني محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم فما بال هذا وهذا ؟ مشيرا إلى غير العرب من الجالسين فقام إليه معاذ بن جبل رضى الله عنه فأخذ بتلابيبه ثم أتى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فأخبره بما قاله فقام النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم مغضبًا يجر رداءه حتى أتى المسجد ثم نودى الصلاة جامعة، فاجتمع الناس فخطبهم قائلاً&#160;: (( يا أيها الناس إن الرب واحد، وإن الدين واحد، وليست العربية باحدكم من أب ولا أم وإنما هي اللسان، فمن تكلم العربية فهو عربي )) .</dd>

<p>The previous paragraph read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Qurra Bin Isa Al-Wasiti narrated to us from Abu Bakr Az-Dzuhli narrated to us from Malik Bin Anas from Abu Salama Ibn Abdur-Rahman who said: Qays Bin Mattatiyya came to a circle in which were sitting Salman the Persian, Suhayb the Roman, and Bilal the Ethiopian, whereupon he said: People! The Lord is One and the Father [Adam] is one. Being an Arab is not, in any of you, inherited from father or mother but it is only the language that is spoken (Innama Hiya Al-lisan). So, whoever speaks Arabic then he is an Arab." Then Mu'adzh Bin Jabal stood - still holding the other's collar - and said: 'What do you order us to do with this hypocrite, O Messenger of Allah?' He replied, 'Leave him to the Fire.' And Qays was among those who committed apostasy during the Ridda, at which time he was killed." This however is not a sound Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad, rather a statement of a religious hypocrite, Qays Ibn Matatiya.</dd>

<p>Ahlan wa sahlan. I think the top-right box is a mess. First, it has doubtful figures; among others, 15 million Arabs in Iran! (it was just reverted down to 4 million this morning, after I asked for evidence, and right now to 3 million!); 12 million in Brazil, and so on. Furthermore, there is a problem in counting among "Arab populations" just any immigran people in the world who may have some Arab origin among their ancestors, even when most of them have lost all connections with their original language (Arabic) and cultures; one typical example being Brazilian Arabs here numbered to 12 million, although probably their vast majority only speak Brazilian Portuguese (which is contradictory with the row in the same box saying explicitly that the sole language spoken by Arabs is 'Arabic') and have been assimilated to the Brazilian meltingpot (see <a href="../../../a/r/a/Talk%7EArab_Brazilian_4e1f.html" title="Talk:Arab Brazilian">my discussion there</a>). Knowing this, can we really say there are 12 million Arabs in Brazil, and put them on just the same level of 'Arabhood' as the Arabic-speaking populations from Morocco to Iraq? At least things should be made clearer. (incidentally, Brazil belongs in <i>Latin America</i>, but presently it looks as if it did not). Finally, why mention among <i>Regions with significant Arab populations</i> Iran or Turkey or USA (which only have less than 4 million each), and not mention Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Yemen etc.?? If what is meant is <i>Regions with significant Arab populations <b>outside Arabic-speaking countries</b> (??)</i> then this should be made clear, and Egypt or Saudi Arabia should then be listed out. That box is still pretty messy. <a href="../../../w/o/m/User%7EWomtelo_3406.html" title="User:Womtelo">Womtelo</a> 14:41, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I had put the Guardian's criticism in the article. And it's a valid critcism that the book lumps all Arabs together. There is an overall tone of criticism of the Arabs, which Patai apparently feels is justified. Finally, he was definitely pro-Israeli (he also wrote <b>The Jewish Mind</b>, but I haven't gotten that yet.) I still think it belongs here, but let's think on this a day. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimesa_b510.html" title="User:Simesa">Simesa</a> 18:15, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dear Simesa, I am sorry to tell you that you wasted your time reading this book. The best way you can come to <b>close</b> understanding the <i>Arab Mind</i>, is by sitting and talking with an Arab by a cup of coffee/tee, or even better, find an Arab girl/boy friend, but not by reading a book as you did&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/i/d/User%7EJidan_3a52.html" title="User:Jidan">Jidan</a> 20:42, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Jidan. This book may be cited somewhere in Wikipedia, but does not necessarily deserve the privilege of being cited under 'Arab'. I've just added (on <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a>) an internal link to "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a>", which is relevant -unfortunately- as a general notion related to Arabs, just as Anti Semitism is related to Jews.

<p>I'm sorry, but my experience is that it is quite possible to learn about others by reading. My reading of <a href="../../../m/y/e/Myers-Briggs_f3e6.html" title="Myers-Briggs">Myers-Briggs</a> has been extremely rewarding. The novel <i><a href="../../../s/h/o/Shogun_%28novel%29.html" title="Shogun (novel)">Shogun</a></i> is all about the Japanese culture and its clash with the Western culture. I'm not expecting fluency with the culture, but, say, enough to understand the motivations behind geopolitics. Second, although the book finds that traits seen as common to most Arabs are not productive in a Western-dominated world, I don't agree that that is necessarily the same as being anti-Arab. Patai may be strongly pro-Israelli but the only place I saw it in his book was where he theorized that the Arabs were using Israel as an excuse not to face their internal problems (my reading indicates that their hatred runs much deeper). Third, "privilege" is baloney - Rule #1 is <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>: present the unfavorable along with the favorable, with cites for both.

<dd>Simesa, I understand what you mean and you are of course right about <i>present the unfavorable along with the favorable</i>. The thing is, the author of this book is not a neutral observer, he is an ultra-Zionist, pro-israeli supporter. Meaning there is some self-interest conflict.

<dd>This book is notable because, as New Yorker contributor Seymour Hersh said, "The Patai book, an academic told me, was 'the bible of the neocons [neo-conservatives in the U.S. government] on Arab behavior.'" <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/040524fa_fact?040524fa_fact" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/040524fa_fact?040524fa_fact" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> Hard for a non-fiction book to top that kind of power.

<p>Shouldn't the part about "tracing lineage back to Noah or Adam" be removed? From a non-religious standpoint there's no evidence these religious characters have even existed.

<p>Surely this can not be correct: "...who built up one of the oldest centres of civilisation in the Near East beginning around 800 BC." Didn't the Summerians and other fertile crescent peoples have "centres of civilisation" well before 800 b.c.? Like at least 3000 b.c.? Aren't they also in the Near East?

<dd>Says who? Prove it - besides, this may be a very sketchy link based on the fact that prior to the Reconquista, there was a lot of Arab and Spanish mixing. When the Spanish colonized south America, they would have brought this blood with them, but I think the word descendent should be reserved for those who <i>claim</i> arab ancestry. Other wise, whether you look at it from a science or a religious point of view, we all have blood relations, few nations have not met other than for war. <a href="../../../t/o/u/User%7ETourskin_1665.html" title="User:Tourskin">Tourskin</a> 22:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Says who?? I'm not talking about immigration from the time of Columbus. Many Arabs emigrated to Latin America in the 19th and 20th Centuries. Most of these Arabs were Christians, Druze, Alawites, Jews and other minorities.</p>

<dd>Apparently you do not know no thing about Syria and Iraq. Read about Iraqi and Syrian families the majorities are of Arab descended although some are mixed.

<p>i think that yemen should not be regarded as a complete arab nation, that is an old myth. Their language even has alot of pre-arab words, more than any others in eastern arab countries. I also think that jordan and syria should be regarded as completly arabs (except the kurdish populatin in syria ofcourse). These three countries actually have the most pure ethnic arabs. Yemen does not at all. It was a major hub, it was not arab before the islamic explosion and there is alot of african blood there. Where saudi arabia has retained its arab identity except in in mecca and medina. jordanians too. For whoever says that syrians have crusader blood. They dont have that much really. They have lighter skin because of turkish and kurdish mixture. Western iraq is also very ethnically arab. Please change!</p>
<p>How can Jordan be completely Arab when the majority of Jordanians are of Palestinian descent. Jordan, Syria and Iraw should be considered to have both ethnic and cultural Arabs.</p>

<p>In the first section (Defining Arab) it is stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identity: someone who considers him or herself to be an Arab regardless of racial, religious, or ancestral origin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes no sense. I agree with the other 3 categories but claiming you are something doesn't make it true without fact behind it (ie ethnic, religious and ancestral origins).</p>
