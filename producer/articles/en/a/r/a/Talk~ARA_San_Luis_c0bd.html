<p><a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a>, please stop the sistematic removal of every single reference to the name <i>Malvinas</i> from every single article. In the context of a submarine of the Argentine fleat that participated of the Falkland war, it is imperative to have a reference to the Spanish word. A reader not completelly in the subject might ignore the Spanish name, what might prevent him from reaching more information say, while searching the internet. This is not an article about something that concerns only to the islands, but much more to Argentina, where Spanish is the official name, and where the islands are known as Malvinas. Thus, a simple reference of the Spanish name together with the English one is not only acceptable, but necesary. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a><small>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarianocecowski_943c.html" title="User talk:Marianocecowski">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marianocecowski_7d10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marianocecowski">c</a>)</small> 14:36, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no offical English name for the ships- so of course not. However the Falklands War, while known as the Guerra de las Malvinas (or whatever) in Spanish, is known as the Falklands War in English, and by no other name. We do not put in Spanish translations for other English terms in the article I note. It doesn't matter what your motives are- it is clearly wrong. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 15:40, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The insistance on the use of the word Malvinas is in support a territorial claim, which is going nowhere. The term is certainly used in Argentina for and by countries which support illogical irredentism, like Spain - however its not a valid alternative name because the people of the Falkland islands reject its use totally. The use of foreign language names is always questionable, and in the case of 'Las Malvinas' offensive. I note a story about the Falkland Islands I wrote picked up by an Argentine newspaper simply replaced the name and did not give any alternative. And that was in their English edition. --<a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a></p>

<dd>Man, we've discussed this a thousand times. <i>Malvinas</i> is way older than the Falklands War, and has been used by countries supporting and not supporting the Argentine claim; it's just the Spanish name, derivated from the French one. As in any territory that has been occupied by other nations, former names or names in those other languages are to be provided. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a><small>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarianocecowski_943c.html" title="User talk:Marianocecowski">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marianocecowski_7d10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marianocecowski">c</a>)</small> 09:09, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Whatever</b>, you would not dictate to the Chinese that their capital is called Peking, or that the Indians should call Mumbai something else. The Falkland Islands are named that because they are British and the people who live there use that name <b>and no other.</b> This is the English language wikipedia and although it may explain curiosities, if you went to the Spanish language version and renamed Espana with its 'correct' English name it would not last long.

<dd>The 'dispute' is a paper tiger, used to distract attention from more immediate issues. However I note the UN C24 use the form Falkland Islands (Malvinas) which is the ISO designation and on this occasion it may defuse the situation. That some people call the territory that is a matter of fact however wrong that is, and the battle needs to be taken to international organisations rather than here. --<a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a></dd>

<dd>As of 2006, I dont know what you mean with more immediate issues. As is written in the Argentine Constitution the claim will never end. The World (even the US!) states them as <i>Administered by UK, claimed by Argentina</i> but I agree that we cannot do much more here and the ISO solution is appropiate, helping people to find not only british sources <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJor70_336f.html" title="User:Jor70">Jor70</a> 14:37, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not relevant- in English they are always refered to as the Falkland Islands, and the war as the Falklands War. Of course the Falkland Islands article has a whole section to deal with the naming issue, as appropiate. But it is not appropiate to list the fact that they are referred to as the Malvinas in each and every article that mentions the Islands. What is so special about the ARA San Luis article that requires that badly written footnote? <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 15:22, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>The thing that is relevant is that it is causing a dispute. So, in order to solve the dispute an encyclopaedic compromise is needed. The article is a free standing article. Therefore solving the naming issue in it is wholly relevant. Unilaterally removing it may be bold, but it is not appropriate. Let's not get another revert war started over this. phrase it better by all means, but note the building consensus here, please. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 15:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It requires something, and a footnote, especially in smaller font, is an excellent, encyclopaedic, NPOV, and insignificant way of achieving it. How do I know it requires something? Because I an English, because I dislike the Argentine claim to sovereignty, and dislike unlawful invasions. But I accept that one way of keeping the peace is to allow those who need to see the name "Malvinas" present and explained in a flat manner. And I know it to be necessary because we would not otherwise be discussing it instead of rewording a rather poorly worded article. The task is to write encyclopaedic articles, not to get involved with POV stuff. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 15:46, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's only being added because the sour faced argies/argie lovers on here have got a serious axe to grind, with anyone who refers to it by it's correct name in the context of ENGLISH language wikipedia, the Spanish language ARA San Luis article can have Malvinas coming out of its arsehole but here as you can tell it is reffered to as the Falklands, as stated; the article isn't Falklands/Malvinas war it's Falklands war. Notice how something like the P-80 Shooting Star article just says Korean War, it doesn't say Korean War / 조국해방전쟁; 祖國解放戰爭 / 한국전쟁; 韓國戰爭 / 朝鲜战争; 朝鮮戰爭, wind your fucking necks in. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_nothing_a319.html" title="User:King nothing">King nothing</a> 15:54, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the necesity of a refence to the <i>Malvinas</i> name within the article even though it is not an article about the islands itself, I think it provides crucial information to the reader that might want to search more information about the topic (in this case a battleship). Otherwise, he/she might not be able to find relevant articles from Argentine sources, leaving him/her with only a small sub-set of the existing articles on the net he/she might be interested to read. The compromise of a small-font footnote seams to me both harmless and appropiate. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a><small>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarianocecowski_943c.html" title="User talk:Marianocecowski">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marianocecowski_7d10.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marianocecowski">c</a>)</small> 06:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is complete rubbish.

<dd>Gibraltar was an interesting place to follow the conflict as we had both sides presented via the BBC and TVE. Today its simply a matter of chosing a satellite TV channel and one can watch whatever, but then we got the same bit of film shown repeatedly.
