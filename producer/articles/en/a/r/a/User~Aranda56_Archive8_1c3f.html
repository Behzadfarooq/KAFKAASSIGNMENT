<p>I am not sure what to say. I think in the times here, that you have been a great contributor to the community despite your young age. I certainly appreciated your presence greatly. You should not feel unworthy or unappreciated, for I am sure many people share my feelings.</p>
<p>However, as you've alluded to before, these are also times for you to concentrate on your studies. If that's what you'll be doing in the time that you're spending away from here, then that is time well spent. I do hope that you do not simply leave, however, but come back here to visit and help from time to time -- but right now, studies should be first priority. If there's anything I can help with, feel free to leave me a message on my talk page or send me an e-mail. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 07:28, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd like for you to know that I feel none of those things about you. I want you to be here, I don't hate you, and I think you are worthy of adminship.

<p>Hey, Aranda56, I wanted to thank you for your support of my (unfortunately unsuccessful) <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Matt_Yeager_6f76.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Matt Yeager">request for adminship</a>.

<p>Hi, just wanted to thank you for voting on my RFA, which went through with a count of (58/0/1), far better than I'd expected.

<p>The Wikiproject No Ads, created as a backlash against the <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_1-Click_Answers_172e.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/1-Click Answers">Answers.com deal</a>, has served an important function in providing a space for users to express their disagreement with the Foundation proposal. While the current controversies about userboxes raise questions about political and social advocacy on Wikipedia, there should be greater flexibility regarding advocacy <i><b>about</b></i> Wikipedia in the Wikipedia namespace. Reported and linked by Slashdot and other press sources as a unique and spontaneous occurence in Wikipedia history, it has apparently had some impact as, despite being scheduled to begin in January, not a peep has been heard about the trial and proposed sponsored link since the deal's controversial announcement months ago. Currently, however, there is <a href="../../../m/i/s/Wikipedia%7EMiscellany_for_deletion_Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_No_ads_e460.html" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:WikiProject No ads">an attempt to delete the project or move it off Wikipedia altogether</a>. Since the Foundation has provided no additional information and has not attempted to answer the specific questions that participants in the project raised, it is unclear if the Answers.com deal has been abandoned or simply delayed. Until the situation becomes more clear, I believe the group should still have a place in the Wikipedia namespace.

<p>Why have you reverted the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Davidian_0995.html" title="Branch Davidian">Branch Davidian</a> article? Probably, you thought I was trying to get away with gutting the page, but there has been no vandalism; all of the material I removed from B_D is now at <a href="../../../w/a/c/Waco_Siege_817d.html" title="Waco Siege">Waco Siege</a>. Nor is this some sudden move. Someone else proposed it <a href="../../../b/r/a/Talk%7EBranch_Davidian_4f4c.html#Content" title="Talk:Branch Davidian">months ago</a>, and I added my agreement on January 20. Then, to make sure nobody missed it, I added a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Talk%7EBranch_Davidian_4f4c.html#Moving_to_WACO_SIEGE_Soon" title="Talk:Branch Davidian">headlined section</a> on the Talk page ten days later, telling people I was going to make the move, and asking them to speak up if they opposed it. If you don't think the section on the standoff should be moved, why didn't you speak up then? If you think there should be more time for objections to be raised, how much longer?</p>
<p>I am not a "vandal." If you've been following my edits to the page, you can see that I haven't been capricious or malicious. Check my contribs. In the description of my edit, I said, "REMOVED MATERIAL TO WACO_SIEGE," and in my changes I said in italics, "For more information, see <a href="../../../w/a/c/Waco_Siege_817d.html" title="Waco Siege">Waco Siege</a>," so you could have gone to W_S and seen that it was all there. The only changes I made were in the intro paragraph, to make it fit the opening of an article rather than the middle of an article, and turning the subsections into editable sections. I copied it over faithfully, even factually incorrect information and slanted POV that goes against my own POV, so that there would be continuity in the history when I make my edits.</p>
<p>If you really don't think it's a good idea to open the Waco Siege article, I'd like you to make your case on the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Talk%7EBranch_Davidian_4f4c.html" title="Talk:Branch Davidian">Talk: Branch Davidian</a> page, rather than branding it as "vandalism." Peace and AGF. --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWacoKid_d7ce.html" title="User:WacoKid">WacoKid</a> 06:07, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, now that I understand your objections better, I am re-editing the article to leave more information about the standoff, hopefully enough to meet with your approval. However,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) I still don't think you should have used the "rvv" code for your edit. First, it's inaccurate, since it wasn't vandalism. Second, it gave no information about the actual reason for your reversion, and thus no guidance to me about how I could accommodate you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) There also is an alternative way you can handle this. If you felt that I had left too little information about the siege in the article, <i>you</i> could have added back enough information to meet your satisfisfaction, rather than doing a full revert. You can also adopt this approach if my next edit is still too brief for your liking. After all, how am I supposed to know just how much information you believe is "enough?" Especially since...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) We may have a difference of opinion on how much the BD article should say about the siege.</dd>
<dd>a) One reason for the move is that the siege controversy is a black hole, and that moving the most controversial issues to another page will hopefully free the BD page to go deeper into the history and faith of the Branch Davidians. In this respect, I would like the BD page to say as little as I can get away with about the siege. The more that gets said, the greater the chance of crossing someone's political tripwires, and ending up with two hotly disputed pages rather than one.</dd>
<dd>b) I feel that the siege should be kept in perspective, as a key event, but not as the main focus of the article. With the siege getting disproportionate attention in the BD entry, other sections of the article were seeing little development. While the short paragraph I left may seem undercooked, that is not out of place in an article where other aspects are underdeveloped. That is, one of my concerns is not just how much the BD article should ultimately say about the siege, but that what it says be kept in proportion to the rest of the article. As more is added to the entry about other subjects, it may be appropriate to say more about the siege.</dd>
<dd>c) I also felt that the move was something that was being talked about, but that no one was actually stepping forward to do. Thus, I felt that the most important thing to do was to get it done, and if I left the BD article covering the siege too briefly, to worry about that later.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't want this to turn into a revert seesaw. My next edit will leave a bit more about the siege, but if you're still dissatisfied, I think you should add in what you think is missing, rather than making another total revert. Only you know exactly what level of detail you want and which facts you believe to be the salient ones. I don't want to grope around, being reverted, until you feel I "get it right." Also, since there seems to be no disagreement that Waco Siege will become the main article for the siege, the longer the BD page remains in its old state, the greater the chance that people will make edits to a section that is now deprecated, and will ultimately disappear. --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWacoKid_d7ce.html" title="User:WacoKid">WacoKid</a> 19:53, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Today three weeks have passed since I was granted access to the administrator toolbox. During this time I have made use of it in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protections and unprotections: <b>1</b></li>
<li>Blocks and unblocks: <b>4</b></li>
<li>Deletions and restorations: <b>69</b></li>
<li>Rollbacks: <b>246</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I've found that the rollback tool is much more useful than I'd thought for vandalism patrol. In fact it makes that task so easy that I've been doing it more than before. On the other hand I've been surprised by how little the blocking tool is needed. Having done a significant amount of vandalism patrol I have still only blocked one solitary vandal. The great majority of addresses which send out a vandal edit do so only once. Those who do it more often usually stop after a warning or two. Only rarely is a block actually needed and in those cases someone usually beats me to it.</p>
<p>As a side note I haven't retired from writing articles either. I'm still hoping to bring <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freyr.html" title="Freyr">Freyr</a> up to featured status but even though I've already performed more edits on it than on <a href="../../../h/r/a/Hrafnkels_saga.html" title="Hrafnkels saga">Hrafnkels saga</a> back in the day, a lot of work remains to be done. Community expectations for featured articles have gone up and so have my own ambitions. I'm currently waiting for a couple of books I ordered to arrive and then I may be able to make the final push.</p>
<p>I'm trying my best to live up to the trust you showed in me by supporting my RFA. If ever you feel uncertain whether I'm using the admin tools in the best interests of the project, let me know. I am at any time willing to relinquish the mop and reapply for it to address concerns people have and ensure that I'm not using the admin tools without being trusted to do so. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 22:28, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw that you were still stressed. I just wanted to let you know that your contributions to our encyclopedia and our community are very appreciated. However, if you need a Wikibreak, I certainly don't think anyone will stop you.

<p>My friend, are you tired? because I am. In the last 5 hours I have been on Wikipedia, mainly because of this guy attacking Iranian articles. I would like to invite you to have a look at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-03-02_Persian_people_2961.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-03-02 Persian people">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-03-02 Persian people</a> sadly it is very doubtful that this dispute will be resolved, even though majority agree on the matter, its basically <a href="../../../a/u/c/User%7EAucaman_0f93.html" title="User:Aucaman">User:Aucaman</a> who does not give up, even after the dispute is being discussed, he has started a sudden attack on yet another page, this time <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian peoples</a>.</p>
<p>Beside that, it is on that webpage, under <b>Issues and Aspirations</b>. First mention of 'PKE' --Kash 04:01, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Heh that was fast. Whos muslim? I am not, and I don't think anyone else involved in the dispute is.. its between few editors with no mention of religion anywhere..--Kash 04:06, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks..I'd also invite you to have a look at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_Cases_2006-03-02_Persian_people_2961.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-03-02 Persian people">Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Cases/2006-03-02 Persian people</a> and comment, thank you --Kash 04:12, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Howdy Aranda,</p>
<p>Can you provide a URL for the copyvio assertion on the named article? The format for using db-copyvio is {{subst:db-copyvio|url=http://whatever.com/}} It appears that you simply marked it as db-copyvio. Thanks! - ~~~~</p>
