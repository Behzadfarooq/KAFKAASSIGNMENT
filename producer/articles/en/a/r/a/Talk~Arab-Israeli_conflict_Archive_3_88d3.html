<h2><span class="mw-headline">Husseini &amp; Riots</span></h2>
<p>ZERO thinks maybe Haj Amin el Husseini did not lead the riots of the 20's and 30's. However, I can find articles on history like this one (with Bibliography and Notes) which say that he did?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pogledi.co.yu/english/bh4145.php" class="external free" title="http://www.pogledi.co.yu/english/bh4145.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.pogledi.co.yu/english/bh4145.php</a></p>
<p>"The Mufti instigated and organized Muslim riots against Palestinian Jews in 1920,1921,1929,and 1936,which resulted in hundreds of deaths."--from the article written by Carl K. Savich.</p>
<p>Savich is a graduate student in the History Department at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan. He received his BA from the University of Michigan. He has been a contributor to Ancient Serbia (Stara Srbija), The Voice of Ravanica, Liberty (Sloboda), The American Srbobran, The Detroit Free Press, The Detroit News, The Macomb Daily, Foreign Policy, and The Oakland Post. He has a journalistic, academic, and legal background and is currently on the staffs of Liberty (Sloboda) and The Oakland Post newspapers, of which he is an editor. His areas of interest and expertise are history, political science, and law.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I never heard of Savich. I based my opinion (less black-and-white than summarised here) on the evidence given at the official enquiry after the 1929 riots, including the response made by the Jewish Agency to the enquiry report, all of which I have read. Evidently Savich has not. On the matter of incitement, the Mufti was blamed for contributing to the general atmosphere but the conclusion was that "<i>no connection has been established between the Mufti and the work of those who either are known or are thought to have engaged in agitation or incitement.</i>" As for the charge of leading the riots, the evidence is the opposite: "<i>After the disturbances had broken out the Mufti co-operated with the Government in their efforts both to restore peace and to prevent the extension of disorder.</i>" A better case can be made for the Mufti's leadership in the 1936-1939 revolt. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 01:40, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Rather than declare "all of which I have read. Evidently Savich has not." perhaps you may with to read Savich's work and bring quotes from the British Enquiry. Already the British had sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment for his role in the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem_pogrom_of_April%2C_1920_c097.html" title="Jerusalem pogrom of April, 1920">Jerusalem pogrom of April, 1920</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Samuel_9ad2.html" title="Herbert Samuel">Herbert Samuel</a>, the high commissioner and a Jew, dropped the charges against Amin al-Husayni and appointed him the grand mufti of Jerusalem in 1921, thereby positioning the Mufti to continue his previous activities. Zero0000, citations please. Others would like to read the source material you quote from as well. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneVoice_d152.html" title="User:OneVoice">OneVoice</a> 15:40, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I brought quotes from the enquiry report already. They are in italics above and were copied by me directly from the conclusions section of the report. Since you are wondering if this enquiry whitewashed the Arab role, here are some more extracts from the conclusions section: "<i>The outbreak in Jerusalem on the 23rd of August was from the beginning an attack by Arabs on Jews for which no excuse in the form of earlier murders by Jews has been established. The outbreak was not premeditated. [The disturbances] took the form, in the most part, of a vicious attack by Arabs on Jews accompanied by wanton destruction of Jewish property. A general massacre of the Jewish community at Hebron was narrowly averted.</i>" --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 11:38, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Mufti and the disturbances in the 20s and 30s</span></h2>
<p>My thoughts:</p>
<p>1. The 1929 riots, it seems, were rather spontaneous. Less an organized thing than a spontaneous spurt of violence, somewhat like the pogroms of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>2. The 1936-39 riots, on the other hand, seem to have been a very organized and directed campaign. Chances are, the Mufti and the Arab High Committee were behind them, aided and abetted by the Germans. (No evidence on the German bit, but it seems likely.) In fact, I would go so far as to say the situation was stirred up by the Germans in the beginning, with the Mufti as a Nazi puppet. -<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenta_b06b.html" title="User:Penta">Penta</a> 20:24, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>One Voice, who are you kidding? Do you know the history of the Notrim, HaShomer, and other self-defense organizations that emerged during Ottoman times? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 13:30, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, Danny, I do know the names. Faisal was an established Arab authority. Would you characterize the actions taken prior as Arab policy (which authority) or as brigandtry by individuals and groups. How do we include both aspects in the historical overview. It currently is a black-and-white depiction of a multi-shaded history. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneVoice_d152.html" title="User:OneVoice">OneVoice</a> 13:53, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>He was a foreigner from the Hejaz. The fact that he was appointed by the British to be king of Syria and then Iraq does not make him a legitimate spokesperson for the <i>falahin</i> who actually lived in Palestine, any more than the feudal landowners in Damascus and Beirut could legitimately sell their "tenants" land. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 14:03, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are at least two issues here. The easier one is ownership. Ownership is either established by force or in civilized societies by legal means. Ownership allows one to use, rent, or sell ones possession. The renters do not have to agree. It may not be fair, moral or preferable, but it is legal. The opinion, desires etc of the tenants does not have legal standing. If you are arguing for abrogation of the legal system, that would be a different matter.</p>
<p>The other issue is the status of Faisal as a leader vis a vis other Arabs. This is certainly a more difficult issue and one that plagues Arab states to this day...the lack of representative government that works for the population as is common in the West. A much more involved issue. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneVoice_d152.html" title="User:OneVoice">OneVoice</a> 15:00, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>A very minor point. The article appears not to be grammatically correct in some respects, e.g., "Israelis do not view the building of house and stores in Israeli settlements as an act of war" -- Why isn't it "houses"? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a></p>

<p>"Arabs maintained they fought a defensive war, as Israel intended to expand its territory beyond that mandated by the U.N" -- Let me see if I get this right:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have or have not the Arabs reject the UN 1947 partition plan? Have or have not Israel accepted it?</li>
<li>So, the Arab nations knew the Israel's <b>intention to expand</b>. Naturally, their five armies <b>preemptively</b> invaded to prevent those nasty Zionists' expansion? Correct?</li>
<li>And despite of the above and their openly genocidal rhetoric, we prefer to call this a "defensive war" here?

<p>So, <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> claims my contributions are <i>excessively propagandistic</i>, and <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDissident_e7c0.html" title="User:Dissident">Dissident</a> that they are <i>pro-Israeli propaganda</i>. Let us go through this point-by-point:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>1948</b> or <b>1948-1949</b>: it is a simple, proven fact that the fighting lasted until January 1949. Try Google on that or visit your local library.</li>
<li><b>Arab-Israeli War</b> or <b>Israeli War of Independence</b>: I do not consider this a major issue, but Wikipedia uses the term 'War of Independence' for many (all?) other wars which have led to a country’s independence. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wars.html" title="List of wars">List_of_wars</a>. So why should Israel get a special treatment? Also, the page <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_Arab-Israeli_War_5e85.html" title="1948 Arab-Israeli War">1948_Arab-Israeli_War</a> claims that the Arab term for it is 'al Nakba', but the <a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakba.html" title="Nakba">Nakba</a> page itself defines it as the <b>outcome</b> of the war, not the war itself. And, if Nakba were really the term for the war itself, the page should redirect to <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_Arab-Israeli_War_5e85.html" title="1948 Arab-Israeli War">1948_Arab-Israeli_War</a>, as the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_War_of_Independence_b2a8.html" title="Israeli War of Independence">Israeli_War_of_Independence</a> does. The way it is now, Wikipedia is biased towards Arabs, since the same war is referred to by a 'neutral' and a pro-Arab term, but not by an Israeli one.</li>
<li><b>Began after the declaration</b> or <b>Began as a joint Jordanian, Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese and Iraqi attack</b>: For all consecutive wars, Wikipedia described how it started. Why not for the first one? Just to favor the Arab POV?</li>
<li><b>According to Israel, the war resulted from Arab rejection</b> or <b>Arabs had rejected</b>: It is not only 'according to Israel', it is a well-established fact that Arabs rejected the partition plan. Again, see a search engine or your local library.</li>
<li><b>in which Israel was formed out of part of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a></b> or <b>proposed establishment of an Arab and a Jewish state in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a></b>: The UN did not establish Israel any more than the Arab state. It actually did not have the power to establish any state, just to propose a solution.</li>
<li><b>Arabs maintained they fought a defensive war</b>: They maybe claim that today. I have never seen such a claim being made at the time of the war. See also comment by <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus_sapiens</a> above.</li>
<li><b>drive the Jews into the sea</b>: Well documented quote, see standard literature, e.g.Collins &amp; Lapierre: O, Jerusalem.</li>
<li><b>About 2/3 of Palestinian Arabs fled</b> and <b>the Arabs expelled or killed all Jews</b>: Does anyone challenge this? Two sentences further, a former edition claims that 600,000 Palestinians left. This is roughly 2/3 of the population, see UN survey. Concerning the Jews, please give me one Jewish settlement which survived under the Arab rule in Palestine.</li>
<li><b>but that changed after the Six-Day War</b>: This is to put the prior statement into context. I agree that it could have been done better. I propose the following, new formulation: In few cases, (e.g. in Morocco) local Arab governments strongly encouraged Jews to stay, and some Jewish leaders (e.g. in Haifa) encouraged Arabs to stay. Is this OK?</li>
<li><b>The fighting ended…</b>: As for all consecutive wars, it is interesting to know how it ended.</li>
<li><b>withdrawal</b> or <b>expulsion</b> of the UN peacekeepers: The forces did not withdraw of their free will, but were ordered to do so by Nasser.</li>

<li><b>1991</b> or <b>1987-1993</b>: simple facts, easy to check. Also, the beginning and the end are no less relevant than for other wars.</li>
<li><b>IDF's response was widely criticized world-wide</b>: this statement is so general that it can as well fit to any other war. Furthermore, it is irrelevant for the understanding of the uprising, unless the author wants to suggest that the criticism influenced the outcome of the uprising. In that case, the claim should be substantiated.</li>
<li><b>The Gulf War</b>: I think I explained sufficiently why it counts as an Arab-Israeli war.</li>
<li><b>Most leaders</b> or <b>Some voices</b>: If they are really leaders, and form a majority, how come that the terror still exists? True, there are public figures condemning terror, but they do not lead anyone. And, considering all public figures in the Palestinian society, they are definitely not a majority.</li>
<li><b>both counterproductive, and more importantly, wrong</b> or <b>some even consider it morally wrong</b>. The former wording implies that everyone who rejects terrorism does it for moral reasons. I do not see this claim supported by evidence. Does anyone have any quotes?</li>
<li><b>renewed Israeli invasion</b> or <b>al-Aqsa Intifada</b>: The former is excessively Arab POV, blaming squarely Israel. It implies that without the 'invasion' the support for terror would be lower, but avoids mentioning that the 'invasion' followed terrorism (so that actually terrorism produces support for terrorists). My wording is neutral, it gives the context but does not put blame on anyone.</li>

<p><br />
I am away from home and can only offer a brief comment. The edits made by anon represent the mainstream Israeli historiography and cannot be presented as if they are neutral facts of which there is no dispute. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The war started with the invasion of the Arab states.</b> At this point of time the Israelis-to-be were already in control of a substantial fraction of the area allocated to the "Arab State", and nearly half of the refugee problem had been created already. Many events of key importance to the Arab perspective, such as the Deir Yassin massacre, had already happened. One reason the start of the war is dated to May 15 1948 is to remove the Palestinians from the story. It is an opinion and not a fact that the war started in May 1948.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Israel accepted the UN resolution and the Arabs rejected it.</b> Well, Israel <i>said</i> that it accepted the resolution; that much is plain fact. However, behind the scenes, Israel was making plans to take more territory than alloted, including all the areas where there was any Jewish settlement and all of Jerusalem. Israel was also discussing with Transjordan their mutual interest in <i>preventing</i> the formation of an Arab State and had a semi-agreement to that end. So it is an opinion and not a fact that Israel accepted the UN resolution.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The UN "did not have the power to establish any state"</b>. Maybe so, there is still legal argument on that point. It is certainly not an accepted fact.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>drive the Jews into the sea</b> I don't think these exact words were used in 1948, but anyway it is quite easy to quote Zionist leaders on the desirability of expelling the Palestinians. Such quotation competitions make bad history.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>please give me one Jewish settlement which survived under the Arab rule in Palestine</b>. There were none, but why didn't you reveal that there were hardly any Jewish settlements that ended under Arab control? The Etzion bloc (where there was one <a href="../../../k/f/a/Kfar_Etzion_massacre_9555.html" title="Kfar Etzion massacre">massacre</a>) and the Jewish part of the old city (where there wasn't) were almost everything. Did you mention the more than 400 Arab villages that were completely depopulated and the dozen plus massacres of Arabs? So your edit here tells just one side of a two-sided story where most of the misfortune was on the other side.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Arabs maintained they fought a defensive war</b>. I would not use that wording myself, but the image of fighting a defensive war was the one presented in 1948 as can be seen from reading newspapers at the time. The Arab states claimed to be intervening to protect the Palestinians from dispossession. Whether you accept the claim or not, that is what they claimed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The (UN) forces did not withdraw of their free will, but were ordered to do so by Nasser.</b> This is misleading since the UN presence was always by Egyptian invitation. One can ask why the UN didn't just move to the other side of the border. To save you the trouble of answering: it was because Israel had always refused to allow UN forces on its territory. So we could alternatively describe the situation as Egypt adopting the stance that Israel already had. That would be a POV of course, but so is yours.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Gulf War</b>. Saddam Hussein attempted to make it part of the Israeli-Arab conflict but failed. I'm not totally opposed to it being listed here, but on balance I don't think it belongs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Jewish refugees from Arab countries</b>. Your timing is way off; there were no substantial Jewish refugees from other coutries until some time later. Your choice of words is also POV. The attempt to establish an equivalence between Arab and Jewish refugees is pure POV that does not survive a critical analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 13:22, 21 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The comments by <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> represent Arab historiography, on occasions not even mainstream, but excessively revisionist, and cannot be presented as if they are neutral facts of which there is no dispute. Point by point:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>The war started with the invasion of the Arab states</b> was not my wording. The wording before my edit -- and to which Zero reverted - was: 'Began after the declaration of the State of Israel on May 15, 1948'. I did not change the date; obviously it is Zero's intention to do so. I just added <b>how</b> the war started, since the information is provided for all consecutive wars. I do not deny that even before that date there were occasional fightings. Zero might know that Arab rioting started immediately after the adoption of the UN partition plan, and that Arab forces entered the Mandate territory even before the war. However, occasional fightings preceded almost any other war: 1956, 1967, 1982, as well as many modern wars around the world. Following Zero's logic, we couldn't pinpoint the beginning of any of these.</li>
<li><b>Israel was making plans to take more territory than allotted.</b> I'm impressed by Zero's mind reading capabilities, especially since these minds are long dead, but this is the Arab narrative. Zero's insinuation that Israel just <i>said</i> to accept the partition, but in fact rejected it goes along the lines of <i>Jews are liars</i>. Israel was preparing for defense, that's for sure. If they would have attacked Arabs if the Arabs had accepted the resolution is pure, unsubstantiated speculation. Considering the balance of power and the losses Israel suffered, not very convincing. On the contrary, there are indications that Israel was not interested in territorial expansion. After the war, when the balance of power shifted towards Israel, Moshe Dayan, according to his own memoirs, wanted to exploit Jordan's non-compliance with the armistice agreement to start a war and conquer more territory. The idea was rejected by Ben Gurion on the grounds that Israel should concentrate on building the country, not on making wars.</li>
<li><b>The UN did not have the power to establish any state</b> is not the wording I used in the article, so the discussion about it is off-topic. See the UN Charter. The crucial point is that the UN did not establish Israel any more than it established the Arab state.</li>
<li><b>drive the Jews into the sea</b> is, up to translation ambiguities, the exact wording, I gave a reference. An arab page <a href="http://www.albawaba.com/phorum/read.php3?f=3&amp;i=65330&amp;t=65330" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.albawaba.com/phorum/read.php3?f=3&amp;i=65330&amp;t=65330" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> says <b>Throw Jews into the sea</b>, which is essentially the same. You can also check Al-Jazeera. Possible quotes from Zionist leaders, calling for expulsion of Arabs certainly did not form the mainstream policy, considering that hundreds of thousands of Arabs remained in Jewish areas.</li>
<li><b>Did you mention the more than 400 Arab villages that were completely depopulated and the dozen plus massacres of Arabs?</b> I did not mention specifically neither Jewish nor Arab settlements. I also did not discuss how many of the Arabs followed the calls of their leader to flee and fled without seeing a Jewish soldier, or how many were expelled in the course of fighting. Such details should be handled in the separate article about the 1948 War. My wording was: <b>About 2/3 of Palestinian Arabs fled</b> and <b>the Arabs expelled or killed all Jews</b>. I can reword it to <b>About 2/3 of Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled</b> and <b>the Arabs expelled all Jews</b>. OK?</li>
<li><b>the image of fighting a defensive war was the one presented in 1948 as can be seen from reading newspapers at the time</b>. This is taken out of context. BTW, I do not know of any country ever admitting to fight a war of aggression, so the statement, even if correct, has zero information. But the full context is: <b>Arabs maintained they fought a defensive war, as Israel intended to expand its territory beyond that mandated by the U.N.</b> I would like to see evidence for the claim that Arabs just wanted to defend the territories allotted to them by the UN partition plan.</li>
<li><b>One can ask why the UN didn't just move to the other side of the border.</b> The answer is: because there was no agreement on that. <b>the UN presence was always by Egyptian invitation</b>. No, it was by Egyptian consent, at best. It was established by a UN resolution, but ended by the Egyptian order. So the wording <b>withdrawal</b> is misleading.</li>
<li><b>Gulf War</b>: if you are not completely opposed, than let it remain listed. I believe that launching missiles at another country amounts to a war.</li>
<li><b>Your timing is way off; there were no substantial Jewish refugees from other coutries until some time later</b>. It is not my wording!!! <b>You</b> reverted my edit to this wording, which has existed before!!! So don't blame me for it! <b>The attempt to establish an equivalence between Arab and Jewish refugees is pure POV</b>. As far as I am concerned, the wording in the point 5 above is sufficient . We can also move the question of refugees to a separate article.</li>

- I'm fairly sure that it is forbidden for Jews to buy, sell, or own property in Jordan and Jordan is largely considered on of the mroe moderate countries in the region.

<p>There are plenty of sources giving lower figures, and some giving higher figures. I think the problem is that there is no agreement on the definitions, especially of who is a Palestinian, also of whether to count Palestinians who are eligible for Jordanian citizenship but didn't officially take it up, and importantly because the Jordanian government regards the issue as sensitive enough to suppress the necessary details from the Jordanian censuses. So people employ various guessing methods. My suggestion is that we quote an academic source on this question. In "The Palestinian-Transjordanian Rift: Economic Might and Political Power in Jordan" by Yitzhak Reiter, The Middle East Journal. Vol. 58, 2004; pg. 72-92:<br />
"<i>The rate of the Palestinian population in Jordan is a controversial and debatable issue in Jordan since figures broken out by ethnic denomination have never officially been published. The estimates vary between 38-83% according to the estimator's extraction. Most scholars in the field estimate the Palestinians as constituting between 50-60% of the Jordanian population.</i>"<br />
Can we agree on that? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 15:52, 1 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Plenty" and "some": can you give any figures? Ditto for "most scholars". As the evidence now stands, I believe that 60% is justified. It is inside Reiter's estimate (the mean of 38% and 83% is 60.5%), as well as Islamic Relief's and Jordan Times'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You need an actual objection. None of those numbers are Reiter's estimate; they are his report of what other people have estimated. Since he is an expert in the subject far more qualified than you or I to make such a summary, we could do worse than accept his opinion. If you want to know who "most scholars" are, you can write to him. I'll give you one, Asher Susser: The Palestinians in Jordan: Demographic Majority, Political Minority (reprinted in Minorities and the State in the Arab World, Ofra Bengio and Gabriel Ben-Dor (eds.), Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc., 1999):<br />
<i>"After the annexation of the West Bank the Palestinians had a two-thirds majority in the kingdom. Palestinians constantly migrated from the West Bank to the East Bank (the administrative and economic center), and in the wake of the 1967 war another 300,000 Palestinians left the West Bank and Gaza for the East Bank. In the East Bank alone the Palestinians totalled approximately half of the population. Since the return to Jordan of another 230,000 to 300,000 Palestinians from the Gulf in 1990–1991, they are now definitely a majority of just over half."</i><br />
Canned bio of Asher Susser: senior research fellow at the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, a former head of the center, and associate professor in the Department of Middle Eastern and African History at Tel Aviv University. He specializes in the history and politics of Jordan and the Palestinians and religion and state in the Middle East. He is author of <i>Between Jordan and Palestine: A Political Biography of Wasfi al-Tall</i> (1983, in Hebrew), <i>The PLO After the War in Lebanon</i> (1985, in Hebrew), and <i>On Both Banks of the Jordan</i> (1994) and coeditor of <i>At the Core of the Conflict: The Intifada</i> (1992, in Hebrew) and <i>The Hashemites in the Modern Arab World</i> (1995).<br />

<p>I have just read this article.

<p>Indeed you are correct in your reading, Josiah. The PLO is under tremendous pressure from the Israelis and also from 'extremist' internal groups like Islamic Jihad and Hamas and paradoxically the pressure is making Arafat make the government more hardline, as there is no political gain in the current situation for Arafat to have doves in his administration and if he has hardliners, they can at the very least put on a strong face against all their opponents.

<p>"Most Palestinian groups in opposition to PLO have declared that the only long term solution to the Middle East conflict is the elimination of the state of Israel." I dispute this characterization. What is the source? This is just more Zionist propaganda, "They want to throw us in the sea!" BS.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">International "War on Terror" against International islamist movement</span></h2>
<p>The world war between international Islamists seeking to expel Israeli and American occupation of the Middle East is an extension of the Arab Israeli conflict. Netanyahu recently claimed on US TV that Israel's war is now America's war. "It is a war between civilization and those who would like to see a return to the medieval ages. They're nuts. It's not going to happen and we have to stop them." The 9/11 attacks were in retaliation for US support of the racist Jewish state, its occupation of palestine and oppression of the Palestinian people as well as the occupation of military bases in Saudi Arabia to contain and siege strangling Iraq. The War on Terror is intended to crush militant opposition to US and Israeli hegemony over Palestine and Mideast oil supplies.

</ul>
<p>By Ori Nir October 8, 2004</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — With their countries mounting parallel military offensives against terrorist strongholds in Iraq and Gaza, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and Israeli Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a high-powered White House meeting Monday.</p>
<p>Moments after the talks, reporters asked Netanyahu if Rice had urged Israel to demonstrate restraint during its operation in Gaza. The Israeli leader lifted his index finger and replied with satisfaction: "Not in one word."</p>
<p>The meeting appeared to back up the assertion by Israeli and American officials that the White House essentially endorses the current offensive in Gaza. This view appeared to gain credence Tuesday, when America exercised its veto at the United Nations Security Council to defeat a resolution condemning Israel's actions in Gaza..</p>
<p>According to this view, the Bush administration has concluded that America has a significant interest in ensuring that an Israeli pullout from Gaza is not perceived in the Arab world as a victory for terrorist groups. The fear is that such a perception would embolden the forces targeting American soldiers in Iraq.</p>
<p>The Forward has learned that, in both military and political circles, Israeli and American officials recently have discussed the issue and concluded that the best course is for Israel to conduct punishing military operations against terrorists and their infrastructure as it withdraws from Gaza."</p>

<dd>Israel was not allied with the United States in its war on Iraq, nor has it take part in any military action against Iraq.

<dd>Are you claiming that Israel and the US are not allies? Israel was in an official state of war with Iraq when the US attacked Iraq. Did you forget that? Are you claiming that Israel has not contributed in any way, such as missile technology, ammunition, intelligence, access to facilities, training, etc for the US war on Iraq and Afghanistan? You know they (or is it "you all"?) have. Is Israel affiliated with <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaida_a98c.html" title="Al-Qaida">al-Qaida</a> then? Are you claiming that the War on Terror is not relevant or related to the Arab Israeli conflict despite the stated motives of al-Qaida that I cited in my edits, the "declaration of war against the Jews and Crusaders"?

<dd>Al Quaeda has many beefs relating to Andalusia, Crusaders, etc., and though it has recently played up the Palestinian conflict in a bid to garner more world support, the Sept 11 attack was still an attack on the U.S., not Israel. In response the U.S. and allies attacked Afghanistan and Iraq.

<dd>Of course, that's the official hasbara line from Tel Aviv central office. But if opposition to Israel is only a "recent" goal of Islamist doctrine, how do you explain al-Qaida's Declaration of War against Americans (Crusaders) and Jews (Israelis) dating back to 1996 and 1998 long before the 2001 WTC attacks? "But by the Grace of Allah, a safe base is now available in the high Hindu Kush mountains in Khurasan, where - by the Grace of Allah - the largest infidel military force of the world was destroyed. And the myth of the superpower was withered in front of the Mujahideen cries of Allahu Akbar (God is greatest). Today we work from the same mountains to lift the iniquity that has been imposed on the Ummah by the Zionist/Crusader alliance, particularly after they have occupied the blessed land around Jerusalem, route of the night-journey of the Prophet (ALLAH'S BLESSING AND SALUTATIONS ON HIM) and the land of the two Holy Places. We ask Allah to bestow us with victory." I guess that was just a head fake, huh? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 03:19, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Still waiting for Jayjg to justify his heavy handed edits and reverts</span></h2>
<p>The article intro states "Some groups fear that the Arab-Israeli conflict is a part of (or precursor to) a wider clash of civilizations between the Western World and the Arab or Muslim world. Animosity emanating from this conflict has caused numerous attacks on supporters (or perceived supporters) of one side by supporters of the other side in many countries around the world." The Arab-Israeli conflict clearly involves the USA and combatants beyond the Arab world, and even beyond 9/11, including Iran, Afghanistan, Europeans who attack Israeli interests, Islamists attacking US and allied interests in Africa and Asia, and American Muslims who are in prison for supporting groups opposed to Israel, etc. It is important to document the link between the Arab-israeli conflict and the world war against "terrorism"; which, of course, is why you insist on censoring it. Instead of constantly butting your head against the revert button like it's the Wailing Wall, why don't you "improve" it with your usual Zionist POV slant? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 03:13, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarifications</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am coming from a disinterested point of view. I know almost nothing about this conflict, other than it is highly controversial and it's been going on for a while. I would ask for people's patience with the following questions, as I am but an ignorant fool on this issue. I also know that as this is such a "hot" issue some (possibly) may take offense at my questioning. For those people, I do not mean to take offence. Now that my disclaimer is given: for my own understanding, could I have some clarifications for some parts of the article?</p>
<p>Under the section "Reasons for the Conflict":</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Israeli views</span></h3>
<p>Many experts in Islamic society, including Muslims, Christians, and Jews, hold that one of the primary religious reasons for continued Muslim Arab hostility towards Israel is that <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_law.html" title="Islamic law">Islamic law</a> forbids Jews or Christians from being considered equal to Muslims. Although the countries surrounding Israel have secular governments (including Egypt, Jordan, Syria, the Palestinian Authority, and Lebanon), Israelis claim that these ideas still prosper on the basis of nationalism, much like the anti-Semitism in 19th century Europe.</p>
<ol>
<li>Could someone tell me which experts in Islamic society hold the position that Islamic law forbids Jews or Christians from being considered equal to Muslims?</li>
<li>What does "Israelis claim that these ideas still prosper on the basis of nationalism, much like the anti-Semitism in 19th century Europe" mean? This is not clear to me. Also, who are the most prominent proponents of this position?</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Islam, Jews and Christians and other non-muslims must accept the status of dhimmis if they want to live with Muslims. Islamic law allows Muslims to kill Jews and Christians in Arab lands who refuse to accept this status. Moreover, this status was upheld numerous times by Islamic scholars and implemented by Islamic rulers. Some Muslims declare, however, that this image is created falsely by passages that are taken out of context. (See Talk page).</p>
<ol>
<li>Where does it say in Islam that non-muslims must accept the status of dhimmis if they want to live with Muslims?</li>
<li>Where does it say in Islamic law that Muslims are allowed to kill Jews and Christians in Arab lands if they refuse to accept the status of dhummis?</li>
<li>Which Islamic scholars upheld the status of dhimmis? Did/have all Islamic rulers implemented this status?</li>
<li>What does "this image" in the sentence "Some Muslims declare, however, that this image is created falsely by passages that are taken out of context."? Further to this, which Muslims declare this? If they declare this, what passages do they say have been taken out of context?</li>
</ol>
<p>At stake is the very existence of the state of Israel. Israelis regard many of the Arab criticisms against the state of Israel as threats to the state's existence, and point out that against the multitude and power of the Arab states, there is only one Jewish state, which, as they feel, should behave vigilantly, and in particular never give up if bullied.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which Arab criticisms of the state of Israel are being talked about here?</li>
</ol>
<p>Liberal Israelis oppose settlements, believing that they thwart peace efforts. However, most Israelis do not view the building of house and stores in Israeli settlements as an act of war, and believe that disputes over land do not justify terrorism and mass-murder, but rather need to have politically negotiated solutions. This view is regarded as a farce by Palestinians as Israel's leadership continues to reject recent offers of peace and continues to build settlements on Palestinian land.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which liberal Israelis oppose settlements?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some Israelis fear the consequences if they decide, or are eventually forced, to dismantle settlements. Some settlers may resist by force, creating a risk even of civil war. When Israel withdrew from settlements in the Sinai Peninsula in the early 1980s, moderate clashes between the Israeli Defense Forces and settlers occurred. Those settlers amounted to but a tiny fraction of the settler population in the West Bank. A recent survey by Peace Now indicated about two thirds of the settlers would comply with an order to evacuate, if issued democratically by the government.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is said that some Israelis fear the dismantlement of settlments. This is obviously an identifiable people group. Which Israelis are being referred to?</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="Palestinian_views" id="Palestinian_views"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Palestinian views</span></h3>
<p>Palestinians feel that the Jewish state of Israel was established under conditions that were deeply unfair to them. Some Palestinians do not oppose a Jewish state as such, but all Palestinians feel that it should not have been established at their expense. They argue that after World War II - and, indeed, after World War I - the world allowed a state for Jewish people in Palestine to be made without much concern for the existing Arab population. Many Palestinians were forcibly expelled from Jewish-controlled areas before and during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war (see Palestinian exodus.) Those who remained in Israel face some discrimination. Palestinians claim that they are denied many job opportunities, as many jobs require previous military service, and only Jews and some other groups, such as Druze and Bedouins, can serve in the IDF.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which Palestinians do not oppose a Jewish state?</li>
</ol>
<p>Palestinians cite many reasons for the lack of support of their cause in the Western world. One such reason is racism; while stereotyping of many other groups is no longer rampant, Muslims and in particular Arabs continue to be victimized by crude attacks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are there any particular instances that can be cited of attacks on Muslims due to racism?</li>
</ol>
<p>Palestinians claim that they have International law on their side. To take a few examples, UN General Assembly Resolution 194 calls for refugees wishing to live in peace with their neighbors to be allowed to return to their homes, or to receive compensation if the don't wish to return. UN Security Council Resolution 242 calls for Israel to withdraw from territories occupied during the Six-Day War. The Fourth Geneva Convention forbids an occupying power from settling an occupied territory with its own population. General Assembly Resolution 446 has declared that the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are illegal. However, there are doubts as to whether the return of refugees is compatible with the continued existence of the state of Israel, and the preservation of a "just and lasting peace" in the region.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who doubts wheter the return of refugees is compatible with the continued existence of the state of Israel?</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2002, Saudi Arabia offered a peace plan in the New York Times, as if it were an original idea. The UN's resolutions call for withdrawal from occupied territories in addition to full recognition of Israel by the whole Arab world. This proposal was backed by some in the Arab World, but the Israeli government rejected this proposal. The same proposal also got criticsm from other Arabs. Therefore, it fell to the wayside.</p>
<ol>
<li>Was the peace plan <i>really</i> written in such a way that it was an original idea? Is this NPOV?</li>
<li>Which Arabs backed the peace plan?</li>
<li>Which Arabs criticised the peace plan?</li>
</ol>
<p>Many Arabs deny that historical grounds can justify the existence of a Jewish nation today. They hold that events that happened thousands of years ago do not justify evicting the Palestinians from what they see as their homeland.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are there any prominent Arabs who can be cited to have denied that historical grounds can justify the existence of a Jewish nation today?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some Arabs maintain that there is nothing wrong with Jewish immigration into Palestine, in itself, any more than there is with Jewish immigration into any other part of the world. But most of the Jews arriving in Palestine did so with the intention of taking it over and establishing a Jewish majority state. Most Arabs maintain that Israel's settlement policy is a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and constitutes a violation of international law. Thus they claim, because of its expansion of settlements, Israel has the majority of responsibility for the failure of the peace process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which Arabs maintain there is nothing wrong with Jewish immigration into Palestine?</li>
<li>The next sentence: "But most of the Jews arriving in Palestine did so with the intention of taking it over and establishing a Jewish majority state." is unclear. Is this a general statement that most Jews who arrived came with the intention of taking over, or is this the views of those "some Arabs"?</li>
</ol>
<p>Moderate Palestinians realize that their cause may be thwarted by extremists within their own ranks; an issue that is mirrored in the Israeli camp. Many view the conflict as essentially extremist vs. moderate, as opposed to Israeli vs. Palestinian. Pro-Israeli advocates often assert that two sets of views exist from the same speaker, with a tolerant view usually expressed in English, and an anti-peace view usually expressed in Arabic, with pro-Arab advocates making similar charges. Palestinians do not deny that they would have preferred that modern Israel had never been created. However, they accept its existence today and call merely for a state of their own.</p>
<ol>
<li>Can the allegation that "Pro-Israeli advocates often assert that two sets of views exist from the same speaker, with a tolerant view usually expressed in English, and an anti-peace view usually expressed in Arabic, with pro-Arab advocates making similar charges." be clarified? Firstly, which Pro-Israeli advocates have claimed this? Secondly, is there any basis to this claim (i.e. is there any documented evidence for this)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Today, many Palestinians realize that an equitable arrangement for all involved parties requires dialogue with both the Israeli side and the international community. Some in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) have accepted the right of Israel to exist within the borders prevailing prior to the Six-Day War. However, representatives of the PLO (and in particular Yasser Arafat himself), have also declared at times that they intended these statements as purely political steps, and that ultimately the peace process with Israel is only a temporary measure; they say that their ultimate goal is still the destruction of the state of Israel. In support of their claims, the PLO never updated its formal statement of policy, the Palestinian National Covenant to reflect their recognition of the State of Israel; it still calls for the destruction of Israel. Although Arab representatives often deny these declarations, they cause great concern among the Israeli public.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which members of the PLO have accepted the right of Israel to exist within the borders prevailing to the Six-Day War?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some Palestinian voices reject terrorism as a solution. They hold that terrorist killings of Israeli civilians are counterproductive, and some even consider it morally wrong. Unfortunately they seldom occupy a position of importance in the Palestinian Authority (PA). Arafat, under massive pressure from the Israeli government and their occupation of Palestinian territories, has recently fired moderates when they have spoken out against suicide bombings. Thus, their voices are unheard over the Palestinian street's overwhelming support for suicide bombings - at 60%, according to recent polls. However, support for Hamas was consistently below 10% prior to the al-Aqsa Intifada. The ongoing standoff has hardened views on both sides.</p>

<li>"Some Palestinian voices reject terrorism as a solution." Which voices?</li>
<li>"Arafat, under massive pressure from the Israeli government and their occupation of Palestinian territories, has recently fired moderates when they have spoken out against suicide bombings." Which moderates were fired? When did this happen?</li>
</ol>
<p>In accordance with their peoples' opinions, some Palestinian and Arab leaders from around the world, have stated they believe the Palestinians are justified in carrying out terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. Some Arab and Muslim countries, as well as groups like Hamas, Hizbollah and Islamic Jihad disagree with any form of peace process, and hold that terrorism against Israel is right and just. The relationship between the PLO and Hamas seems to signify that the PLO itself does not oppose this attitude.</p>

<li>Which Palestinian and Arab leaders have stated they believe the Palestinians are justified in carrying out terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians?</li>
<li>Which Arab and Muslim countries disagree with any form of peace process, and further hold that terrorism against Israel is right and just?</li>
</ol>
<p>Many Arabs declare the Israeli government is not automatically responsible for the crimes of individual Israelis (ironically, the militant Palestinian organizations fail to make this distinction when it comes to Israelis). They claim that the same standard should be applied to the Palestinian Authority. Palestinians further feel that the world should also react against the silent violence of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and the daily humiliation this leads to for the Palestinian population. Israel, however, claims that this does little to explain why the Palestinian Authority has not arrested a single Hamas official of importance since 2000, although they did arrest many prior to that.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Comment</b>: "(ironically, the militant Palestinian organizations fail to make this distinction when it comes to Israelis)" seems incredibly POV to me. Shouldn't this be rephrased?</li>
<li>What does "Palestinians further feel that the world should also react against the silent violence of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and the daily humiliation this leads to for the Palestinian population." mean? I do not know what "silent violence of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza" is talking about. Could we clarify this statement?</li>
<li>"Israel, however, claims that this does little to explain why the Palestinian Authority has not arrested a single Hamas official of importance since 2000, although they did arrest many prior to that." Maybe I'm missing something here, but this statement does not appear to follow from the previous sentence. These appear to be two unrelated ideas... shoot me down on this one if you like because I'm sure I'm missing something.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many Arab publications claim Zionism to be worse than German Nazism. Many Arabs believe Israel practices a form of apartheid against the Palestinian people, worse than that practiced by South Africa, and that Zionism is a form of colonialism. Israelis reply that this claim is hypocritical, since Arabs have created twenty two Arab states, in some of which the remaining Jews are discriminated against. Palestinians hold that the existence of other Arab nations is irrelevant; they want to have the land they owned back, rather than being forced to throw themselves on others' charity in foreign countries. Probably 50%-60% of Jordanian population is ethnically Palestinian (former refugees and their descendants; estimates vary widely) but the country is ruled by the native Hashemite Bedouin family. In the 1970s, the PLO attempted to launch a coup against the Jordanian monarchy, which led to death of some 20,000 Palestinians and the expulsion of the PLO from Jordan.</p>

<p>The evidence is provided in the stated motives for the 9/11 attack (to liberate Palestine from the Zionist Crusader alliance) and in the US motives to attack Iraq in order to "protect our friends in the Middle East" i.e. Israel who Saddam Hussein threatened. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 05:49, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The U.S. was protecting its friends the Saudis, Kuwaitis, and other oil rich Arab emirates in the Middle East. Saddam was no significant threat to Israel before the first Gulf war, and certainly not afterwards. As for the putative reasons for the 9/11 attacks, there were more than one, and the "Israeli" one was an ex post facto sop to get worldwide Arab support. In any event, attacks on the U.S. are not attacks on Israel, nor part of the Arab-Israeli conflict, since Israel is not a proxy for the U.S., nor is the U.S. a "Zionist Occupied Government" proxy of Israel. Rather, 9/11 was one skirmish in the war of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a> on Western culture. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 21:24, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are correct that the US is protecting Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf emirates (for oil) - but it is also protecting Israel (for political reasons). Saddam's Iraq was a threat to Israel, especially if Iraq developed nuclear weapons or other means of achieving military parity with Israel. Israel and Iraq were at war, remember. The underlying conflict with Iraq stemmed from its rejectionist stance and threats to Israel; the same reasons why Iran and Syria are in the sights of US military, economic, and diplomatic pressure. The US has long committed itself, in both Democratic and Republican administrations, to maintaining Israel's military superiority over its neighbors and the Gulf Wars I and II are the ultimate culmination of that commitment. You shouldn't deny it just because it cost the US a 9/11; instead be proud of the successful "special relationship" built up over the years between the US and Israel.</dd>
<dd>There were three stated Islamist motives for the 9/11 attacks; US forces desecrating Saudi Arabia, US siege of Iraq, and US support for the Israeli occupation of Palestine. These motives were described long before 9/11 so they were not "ex post facto sop" as you and other Zionist apologists claim. The details have been expounded since at least 1996 in Osama bin Laden's Declaration of War. So you are dead wrong on that count. The attacks on the US were a direct response to US military and economic support for Israel's occupation of Palestine (in addition to the stationing of troops in Saudi Arabia and the siege of Iraq).</dd>
<dd>Whether you believe that to be a real motive or not, it is the declared motive and it is a motive that impels attacks on both the US and Israel so it is a reality even if you wishfully imagine it to be a fantasy. Why did the US attack Iraq if Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11? Precisely because of the growing threat to Israel - and also to regional energy supplies. These two US interests are very strong.</dd>
<dd>The entire conflict with Iraq and the stationing of US troops in Saudi Arabia represented a commitment to safeguarding Gulf oil supplies - but why? Because Iraq was at war with Israel and the US could not allow a militant anti-Israeli regime to seize those energy supplies which would give it significant leverage over industrialized nations, including the US, Israel's main supporter.</dd>
<dd>Of course, extremist Zionist propaganda doesn't permit discussion of the linkage between 9/11, the Iraq war and Israel but the facts are apparent to anyone who doesn't eat hasbara for breakfast. --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 02:00, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Iraq was no threat to Israel, and years away from developing any nuclear weapons. Iraq and Israel have theoretically been at war since 1948, but practically speaking Iraq hasn't been able to carry any war to Israel for 20 years or more, except perhaps through funding of terrorists. Arab conspiracy theorists like to tie everything to Israel, and their imaginings that all American policy revolves around it, but the fact is that the U.S. was protecting its own interests, not Israel's, by attacking Iraq both times, for all sorts of reasons, including stabilizing its oil supply. Iraq's occupation of Kuwait had nothing to do with Israel, and its likely occupation of Saudi Arabia next had nothing to do with Israel either, and everything to do with Saddam's megalomania and empire building. Bin Laden's original "Declaration of War" focussed on the U.S., not Israel, and when Bin Laden just weeks ago admitted (or claimed) the attacks, he modified his excuses and P.R. attempts to woo the Arab world. However, his fantasies and justifications have nothing to do with the reality that the attack was part of the war of Islamism on Western culture, with the U.S. as its prime expositor. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 03:14, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, your theories are interesting and, of course, twisted through the usual hasbara lens. I know that we actually agree and you are playing your usual role and there is no point discussing it with you because you argue for Israel not for the truth but anyway, someone else might read this and appreciate it. Prior to the Iraq War were you saying "Iraq was no threat to Israel," and were you so much more prescient than the CIA and unconcerned about the threat posed by an Iraq that was "years away from developing any nuclear weapons"? Or is that just a Zionist "ex post facto sop" now that the WMD theory has been exposed as the war propaganda it always was? You admit that "Saddam's megalomania and empire building" was an issue. Here we agree. Saddam was building an empire to confront Israel and so of course Americans and Israelis knew that he had to be stopped. Hence the WMD canard. Even if you believe that "9/11 was one skirmish in the war of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a> on Western culture", you also believe that Israel and the US are one side of that battle and so 9/11 and the Iraq war are extensions of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The opening paragraph of the article even alludes to the connection: "Some groups fear that the Arab-Israeli conflict is a part of (or precursor to) a wider clash of civilizations between the Western World and the Arab or Muslim world. Animosity emanating from this conflict has caused numerous attacks on supporters (or perceived supporters) of one side by supporters of the other side in many countries around the world." --<a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlberuni_e425.html" title="User:Alberuni">Alberuni</a> 03:54, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Evidence that the 9/11 attacks and Iraq war are directly related to the Arab-Israeli conflict:</p>
<p>" <b>Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the man who conceived and directed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, was motivated by his strong disagreement with American support for Israel,</b> said the final report of the Sept. 11 commission. <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/mld/heraldleader/news/nation/9222612.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kentucky.com/mld/heraldleader/news/nation/9222612.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>"In the video, <b>bin Laden said he decided to attack the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1982 after the invasion of Lebanon by Israel,</b> which he claimed was backed by the U.S. Navy. "And as I was looking at those towers that were destroyed in Lebanon, it occurred to me that we have to punish the transgressor with the same" he says, "and that <b>we had to destroy the towers in America, so that they taste what we tasted and they stop killing our women and children." He underscored it was U.S. foreign policy that led to the 9/11 attacks,</b> saying, "Bush says and claims, that we hate freedom, let him tell us then, 'Why did we not attack Sweden?'" " <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/29/binladen.tape/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/29/binladen.tape/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<p>" "We fought you because we are free ... and want to regain freedom for our nation. As you undermine our security we undermine yours," bin Laden said. .... "God knows that it had not occurred to our mind to attack the towers, but <b>after our patience ran out and we saw the injustice and inflexibility of the American-Israeli alliance toward our people in Palestine and Lebanon, this came to my mind</b>," he said. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137095,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,137095,00.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>
<p>It is the emotions generated by this long cycle of shuttle diplomacy - of expectations raised and hopes dashed - that ordinary Arabs talk about when they say they understand why Al Qaeda terrorists hate the US. It is a hatred that Osama bin Laden expresses in fierce terms. His videotaped statement of Oct. 7 ends with these words: <b>"Neither America nor the people who live in it will dream of security before we live it in Palestine."</b> <b>Translation: The US will be subject to terrorist attacks as long as it allies itself with Israel. Indeed, the danger might continue as long as Israel exists.</b>... Still, <b>events of Sept. 11 and their aftermath have focused Americans' attention on their nation's ties with Israel to a degree not seen since the Arab oil embargo of 1973.</b> "The American public is now waking up to the cost of the relationship with Israel," <b>says Professor Lukacs. "This is a question that has never been addressed in the past." <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1026/p1s1-uspo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1026/p1s1-uspo.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></b></p>
<p><b>War Launched to Protect Israel</b> - Bush Adviser <b>Iraq under Saddam Hussein did not pose a threat to the United States but it did to Israel, which is one reason why Washington invaded the Arab country,</b> according to a speech made by a member of a top-level White House intelligence group. WASHINGTON, Mar 29 (IPS) - IPS uncovered the remarks by Philip Zelikow, who is now the executive director of the body set up to investigate the terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001 -- the 9/11 commission -- in which he suggests <b>a prime motive for the invasion just over one year ago was to eliminate a threat to Israel, a staunch U.S. ally in the Middle East.</b> Zelikow's casting of the attack on Iraq as one launched to protect Israel appears at odds with the public position of President George W. Bush and his administration, which has never overtly drawn the link between its war on the regime of former president Hussein and its concern for Israel's security. The administration has instead insisted it launched the war to liberate the Iraqi people, destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and to protect the United States. ”Why would Iraq attack America or use nuclear weapons against us? I'll tell you what I think the real threat (is) and actually has been since 1990 -- it's the threat against Israel,” Zelikow told a crowd at the University of Virginia on Sep. 10, 2002, speaking on a panel of foreign policy experts assessing the impact of 9/11 and the future of the war on the al-Qaeda terrorist organisation. ”And <b>this is the threat that dare not speak its name, because the Europeans don't care deeply about that threat, I will tell you frankly. And the American government doesn't want to lean too hard on it rhetorically, because it is not a popular sell,”</b> said Zelikow. The statements are the first to surface from a source closely linked to the Bush administration acknowledging that <b>the war,</b> which has so far cost the lives of nearly 600 U.S. troops and thousands of Iraqis, <b>was motivated by Washington's desire to defend the Jewish state.</b> The administration, which is surrounded by staunch pro-Israel, neo-conservative hawks, is currently fighting an extensive campaign to ward off accusations that it derailed the ”war on terrorism” it launched after 9/11 by taking a detour to Iraq, which appears to have posed no direct threat to the United States. <b>Israel is Washington's biggest ally in the Middle East, receiving annual direct aid of three to four billion dollars.</b><a href="http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=23083" class="external autonumber" title="http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=23083" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Causes of September 11</span></h2>
<p>Alberuni, I hope you don't mind if I respond to some of the points you made about September 11 being an extension of the Arab-Israel conflict. I don't believe the Arab-Israel conflict had anything to do with that, and here's my reasoning:</p>
<p>The main mileposts on the road to September 11 were: (a) the millions directed to bin Laden and other Islamist groups by the CIA to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world, which made the Islamist movement powerful; (b) the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam and the subsequent stationing in Saudi Arabia of American troops because of that; (c) the further growth in Islamist ideology caused by Americans desecrating (as they saw it) the keeper of the holy places; and (d) the American support for the regimes in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, which are regarded by the Islamists as puppet regimes.</p>
<p>There's no evidence that the issue of Palestine has been anything other than a powerful rallying cry for the Islamists, just as the economic sanctions against Iraq turned that country into a rallying cry too, even though the Islamists hated Saddam. These issues are flags that people wave. But the flags are not the underlying causes of the Islamist war with America.</p>
<p>An excellent book on this subject is <i>Unholy Wars</i> by John K. Cooley, a former ABC News Middle East correspondent. He traces the entire relationship between America and Islamism, and the consequences of it, right up to September 11. He calls it "a strange love affair which went disastrously wrong: an alliance, during the second half of the twentieth century, between the United States of America and some of the most conservative and fanatical followers of Islam." He traces how this relationship stemmed from the start of the American-Soviet Cold War in 1946 and President Truman's perception that the Soviet Union was the principle threat to American interests; and how during the 50s and 60s, the adminstrations of four further U.S. presidents (Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon) were faced with finding a way to defend American interests against the Soviets in the Middle East and South Asia.</p>
<p>The question was asked: Who is the principle enemy of our enemy, communism? And the answer was that the Muslim religion, which was fundamentally anti-communist, could be "harnessed as a mighty force to oppose Moscow in the Cold War," as Cooley puts it. Cooley traces how that "harnessing" took place: how the Islamists were used to fight America's proxy wars; how and why the relationship broke down; and how that led to September 11, 2001. Although the state of Israel was something America did want to protect, all of the above would have happened even if Israel had not existed. This was a war between the world's two great superpowers, a battle left over from the Second World War, with Islamists used by America as the foot soldiers, because neither side could afford the devastation of a direct confrontation. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 02:13, Nov 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Comment: As I tried to describe in the article WTC &amp; Bin Laden there are of course links between all these events - but I think it is stupid to say "Ah, the Arabs thought they are used in Afghanistan and then turned against their masters” – this is nonsense. We need to understand the entire agenda: Freeing Muslim countries and giving them back honour and pride as it was in the past – and on the other hand the US who want control all major resources and contain major possible enemies or system competitors. This gives the clash.</p>
<p>Of course, US-Israeli links due to given security contracts as well as Jewish Lobby in the US increases and focuses the conflict. If somebody believes the main and single agenda of Bin Laden is Israel, why didn’t he blow up Tel Aviv? This is just one, maybe now the best selling story to get supporters.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WTC &amp; Bin Laden</span></h2>
<p>Please keep in mind that Bin laden haven't had a revelation after fighting against Soviets in Afghanistan and kicking them out and then just turning against the US. And he is surely not such a big strategist that he thought, ok, lets fight the Soviets, then we keep Afghanistan, lets use this as a base and then we do our main work which is the fight against the US.</p>
<p>Bin Laden has a red line in his life and that is getting foreign power and foreign un-Islamic rules our of Muslim land to free the Muslim people and to give them a chance to have a life according the Koran. That’s the reason he supports fight’s all over the world and is personally involved in the main conflicts, which comprise – of course Israel as culmination point.</p>
<p>He is quite smart using this conflict and hate the US gained over supporting Israel and the – as he thinks – fallen regimes of Saudi Arabia and Egypt – and all the hate inside the people in this depressed region to position himself and his liberation activities, which are far more than just Israel and Jerusalem. As he himself stated: Even unbeliever in Saudi Arabia are considered as occupation of holy land.</p>
<p>Resulting – the agenda is bigger – the selling story is focussed and clever – the US answer more or less logical – democratisation or even more participation of the masses in the Arab world as a possible valve or channelling frustration into constructive civilisation building.</p>
<p>But, to be realistic, with this point of view you will easily find a next conflict where unbeliever have their dirty feet on Islamic land. So solving the Israeli conflict will just point the focus of the extremist groups to Kashmir, or to Thailand, or the Philippines or even China.</p>
<p>That’s why China and Russia do not vote for UN backed intervention: To have free hands in crack down their own Islamic extremist groups without international TV journalists. Unlike the US they have more to lose than just two towers, the integrity of their land.</p>
<p>So bad news for the world and all who think this will be over within a couple of years – this will last centuries and running out of Oil of these people will even make thinks worst – because of lacking visions of civilised existence in wealth and pride.</p>

<dd>Actually, I "multi-edited" because I was carefully examining each of your edits, and NPOVing them, with reasons given for the changes. On the other hand, your reverts were simply blind reverts. As MPerel points out, your edits were often quite biased, and if you look at the edit history of individual edits you'll see why. For example, Bin Ladin's declaration of war listed the primary reason as the American presence in Saudi Arabia, it wasn't just American aid and pressure that turned back the Arab Armies in 1973, the PLO semi-independent state in Lebanon which shelled civilian targets is not an "Israeli claim", the first Intifada did not start because the UNGA declared the occupation illegal (that was an irrelevant statement), Bin Ladin's attacks were on America not Israel, etc. As well, you need to let Israel state it's own case, not the case you would like it to make; the don't make the case that they are supported by the "world's only superpower", replacement of Israel with a different state is indeed its destruction, etc. Finally, your excuses for fundamentalist Islam are most dismaying; dhimmis did not have to wear special identifying badges in order to "avoid offending Muslim sensibilities". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 06:09, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My edits aren't in the least biased. They are not pro-Zionist, though, so I can imagine that you see them that way. Bin Laden's declaration of war gave several reasons, including the occupation of Palestine. The American aid and pressure thing was simply a rewrite into better English. The PLO "semi-independent state" is a Zionist claim, not an actuality. I added the bit about the UNGA because the article as it stood made it sound as though the Palestinians were just uprising with no reason, whereas in fact their right to their territory has been recognised over and over by the world barring Israel and the US. Bin Laden's attacks are *part* of the conflict. I remind you that this is an article that has a map that implies that Mauretania is a party to the conflict. The article says nothing about "special identifying badges". This is what I think you would describe as a "straw man".<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 08:09, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dhimmi</span></h2>
<p>Abdel, you were asking for a reference for the <i>dhimmi</i> claims. I've added Benny Morris, who is a history professor at Ben-Gurion University. He addresses only the history of the dhimmi from around 630 to the 1940s. So far, I haven't found anything on the current legal situation of non-Muslims in Muslim countries, but you're welcome to add something if you feel there is positive material that should be there to provide a balance. All you have to do is make sure you take your material from a reputable publisher (e.g a mainstream newspaper, an academic journal, book or similar. If you look around, there are likely to be Arab academics who have addressed this issue. Or possibly the U.N. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 09:24, Dec 22, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oy vey! It's Benny Morris again. Perhaps you should read some other people, Slim! The whole idea of "dhimmitude" is based on the writings of Bat Ye'or, a rabid anti-Arab, and has become a pillar of hasbara. Historically, subjugated peoples were not treated equally to Arabs but this should be compared with the treatment of Saxons by Normans, except the Arabs actually allowed the dhimmi to keep their lands. We don't refuse to go to France because of our experiences, of course, nor are we occupying Normandy. The levy on them is understandable in the context of being a conquered people. Yes, they were banned from carrying weapons (not surprisingly, since they were the "enemy") and they were not allowed to sell alcohol to Moslems (a terrible burden that, being forced to respect Moslem customs). At times in distant history, the burden on dhimmis was harsher, but the general rule was that they lived side-by-side with Moslems unmolested (something that was not at all true the other way round!). None of it amounts to very much. Your description of Moslems "rising up" against Jewish communities does not even begin to look at the circumstances of these actions, but simply reports them as fact. Do you know the circumstances or are you simply content to report what an <i>Israeli</i> historian writes? <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 22:50, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um, they were the "enemy" after living among Muslims for hundreds of years? And Benny Morris is a highly respected scholar and historian; why do you imagine he bases his ideas on Bat Ye'or? Anyway, your POV apologetics are interesting, but, unlike Slim, you don't appear to have any sources to back them up. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 22:55, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given that Benny Morris has written about the details and background of the conflict, and given that he's an academic, he's a very good source to use. The reason I like Bennis Morris as a source for Wikipedia, is that he has tried to straddle both sides of the debate. I suggest you give him a try, starting with <i>Righteous Victims</i> to read his analysis of how the history of the dhimmi directly led to today's prevalent attitudes on both sides. And as Jay says, if you have other sources to add, by all means do so. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 21:53, Dec 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But please note: be bold in updating pages does not mean that you should make deletions to long articles on complex, controversial subjects with long histories, such as Israeli-Palestinian conflict or Abortion. In many such cases, the text as you find it has come into being after long and arduous negotiations between Wikipedians of diverse backgrounds and points of view. An incautious edit to such an article can be akin to stirring up a hornet's nest, and other users who are involved in the page may react angrily. If you encounter an article on a controversial subject that you would like to edit, first read the comments on the talk page and view the Page history to get a sense of how the article came into being and what its current status is. If you are an experienced wiki-ist, you will probably have a good sense what will be accepted edits, and which edits should be discussed first. If you are new to wikipedia, or unsure how others will view your proposals, and you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, you should either: 1. If the material in question is a sentence or so in length, copy it to the Talk page and list your objections there. 2. If the material is longer than a sentence, list your objections on the Talk page but leave the main article as it is. Then, wait a bit for responses. If no one objects, proceed. But always move large deletions to Talk and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page. Also, show respect for consensus. Avoid making major changes to an article if a vote (or poll) is currently in progress about whether those changes should be made, especially if there is no clear consensus shown by the vote.</p>

<p>We are dealing with an Arbitration case which involves editors to this and related pages. While the decision is not final, one problem that was noted was edits which made controversial changes to most sections of the article, no references offered, see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_HistoryBuffEr_and_Jayjg_Proposed_decision_decc.html#Extensive_rewriting_by_HistoryBuffEr" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/HistoryBuffEr and Jayjg/Proposed decision">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/HistoryBuffEr_and_Jayjg/Proposed_decision#Extensive_rewriting_by_HistoryBuffEr</a>. What I am proposing there (applying only to those before the Committee) is that changes be limited to one fact and be supported by a readily available reference in English. I think the evil to be avoided is bombarding the other editors with a mass of edits, either all together (in one edit) or over a short period of time. That way others have a chance to consider the edits and not feel the whole article is turning to shit, unless closely monitored (and reverted frequently). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:47, Dec 22, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would strongly oppose a policy that "changes be limited to <b>one fact</b> and be supported by a readily available reference <b>in English</b>." References in other languages should be entirely acceptable, and limiting changes to one fact at a time makes it virtually impossible to make any major edits, which many of the pages surrounding this conflict need.

<dd>But the problem is not whether changes can be sourced. The Zionists can always find someone who has said what they want said; there is a whole industry devoted to saying it. And to be fair, the other side can easily do the same. Most of the fighting is over the spin that is put on the article. And what about those events where references disagree? You'd think we could put both POVs, but the POV pushers are intent on not allowing opposing views at all. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 22:58, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, would you agree that an edit which changes almost every paragraph in the article in a POV way will be reverted? A result which will occur no matter how "good" the numerous changes are. I don't think this notion needs to be restricted to "one fact", but if references are provided for a series of related changes, if changes are too extensive it becomes difficult to evaluate what is happening. As do references to books and websites in Arabic or Hebrew. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 16:46, Dec 22, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>References in Arabic and Hebrew do make life a bit more difficult, but there are enough speakers of both languages on en that translations offerred can be cross-checked, and that is more appropriate than just banning their use, since not all information is available in English. I do agree that "an edit which changes almost every paragraph in the article in a POV way will be reverted", but what counts as such is hard to determine... My experience with <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabra_and_Shatila_Massacre_a601.html" title="Sabra and Shatila Massacre">Sabra and Shatila Massacre</a> leads me to suspect that such a policy would be misused to excuse reversions of contributions that actually significantly improved an already POV but supposedly "consensus" article. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:07, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, the POV pushers keep putting in original research and unsubstantiated personal opinions, e.g. about right-wing Americans, dhimmi clothing designed to avoid offending the sensibilities of Muslims etc., which makes it hard for the editors who are trying to render the articles to NPOV to do so. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 03:56, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. The POV pushers put in stuff about people thinking there is a "clash of civilisations" without substantiation, mentioning dhimmi "dress codes" that did not exist except briefly in particularly repressive regimes (whereas dhimmi <i>were</i> expected to conform to Muslim norms of dress) in an attempt to smear <i>all</i> Arabs, and quoting extensively from single sources in sections that claim to represent a diversity of views.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 04:39, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Relation with 'Arabs'?</span></h2>
<p>Here are some things which I will like to change. May be in first step just one proposal. It is stated in article that</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"... conflict in the Middle East regarding the existence of the state of Israel and its relations with <b>Arab</b> peoples ...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I won't get into the 'Israel' part, because its acceptance or interpretation is very disputed. But label of Arab is not true. Let me give you example.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a person with jewish ancestry(Any other non-Arab ancestry can also be sited) in Palestine/ Israel, he converts to Islam (now he is not an Arab right) (Or may be his parents converted to Islam) during war he leaves his land but now can't come back. He is in conflict but he is not 'Israeli' neither he is 'Arab'. Non-Jew term if can't be replaced with Arab at least it should be mentioned somewhere to make the claim 'politically correct'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Same goes for Greek Christians and other refugees.</p>
<p>'Arab Israeli' conflict term is mostly applicable but this is not 'technically correct'. Plus there is no relation with 'Arab ancestry' with the conflict. Whatever ancestry you have if you are accepted as 'jew' you are one side of the conflict, if you are not accepted as 'jew' ancestry or religion) you are on the other side.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So this factor should also be mentioned</dd>
</dl>
<p>What about changing too</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"</i> "... conflict in the Middle East regarding the existence of the state of Israel and its relations with <b>non-Jews predominantly Arab</b> peoples ... "</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can I make this change? Or correction?</p>

<p>I would go further. There are Jews on the side of the Palestinians (see <a href="../../../n/e/t/Neturei_Karta_f0d9.html" title="Neturei Karta">Neturei Karta</a>) and even, sadly, Arabs on the side of Israel (eg the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Lebanon_Army_fc3f.html" title="South Lebanon Army">South Lebanon Army</a>. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 15:38, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as right to return is concerned, yes, but as regards the accuracy of the term "Arab-Israeli Conflict", which is the issue I thought you were addressing, this illustrates that the conflict is strictly speaking neither Arabs vs. Israelis nor Arabs vs. Jews. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 15:51, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mustafaa, I'm glad to see you here. I'm sure things you help calm things down, and ensure NPOV editing, as is your wont.

And there are non-Jew non-Arabs on both sides. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 15:58, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course they include 'Israel' It is such a debatable term, they say it exists for thousands of year that's why they are here in first place! Second term 'independence of Israel' is used not 'creation'. So if I get independent it means I exist before independence but only before I was 'captured'.
<ul>
<li>Second Point is that have u seen that massacre page it has looooong paragraph on background section. If it is there, why not here&#160;?</li>
<li>Third Title says Israel<b>i</b> not Israel. Israel might be questioned but what about Israeli?</li>
<li>Forth there are claims like 'State based on ethnic and religions claims thousands year old' So history is <b>must</b> mention here for background.</li>

<dd>Mizrahim were brought from Arab/Muslim lands and settled in those communities in the desert, in border towns, or in remote areas, often on confiscated Palestinian land, and usually they were confronted by Palestinians because they were on the borders. Meanwhile, 70% of the Ashkenazim who arrived in the ‘50s were settled in Tel Aviv, so later when their children inherited property in Tel Aviv, an apartment or a house might be valued at $300,000 while a property in a Mizrahi community might be valued at $30,000.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changes and explanations</span></h2>
<p>I think following are two rules here</p>
<ol>
<li>if you see some ‘POV’ in ‘claim’ don’t change it. Answer it at end in response.</li>
<li>If you see some thing wrong with response, improve the claim.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let me make some changes and try to explain it here</p>
<ol>
<li>it is being claimed that many ‘Arab countries’ never had ‘direct’ conflict, the note is removed without siting reason. the note exlains the same thing as earlier note negaties so it is simple response. Given response but don't remove.</li>
<li>’Anti Sentiment increase’ is different claim then , ‘effects of historic protection’ and as they are 'claim' not facts, please answer them by response not by edit. anti-sentiment and protections are totally opposite phenomenon can't be mixed.</li>
<li>Attack on army is not a claim, claim is that ‘legitimate attack’ (note claim not fact)</li>
<li>Claim is not they use voilance for independence but that others have used the same too. ('Claim here too')</li>
<li>No mention of saying Arab say in title as we already know that this section is claimed by arabs or all above may be changed by ‘claimed by Israeli’.</li>

<p>So please be careful in editing ‘claims’ which may be seen as ‘POV’ better method is to give a ‘response’ that’s the reason we have chosen two sides claim different. Because we are considering both as POV.</p>
<p>What one sides claim is not expected to taken as fact.</p>

<p>1/ You insisted on "traditional". So, traditionally, the dhimmi were those who had accepted Muslim rule rather than be slaughtered. 2/ The dhimmi were allowed to keep their land precisely because they had accepted dhimma. 3/ Elie Kedourie is a "historian" with no mention of his ethnicity or religion, and yet Muhammad Hamidullah is a "Muslim scholar". 4/ You moved the quote from Hamidullah to the end of a list of antiArabisms, where I had interposed it. And you added a "however". This is clearly intended to bias the reading of this part of the article. 5/ Cite Morris. If he says the Muslims "rose up" against the Jews (a bizarre reading since uprisings are generally against rulers) you won't mind quoting his saying so. If he did not, and this is a POV wording not of his invention, then you'll agree that my rewriting is far more acceptable. 6/ There is nothing to suggest that Harun raised heavy taxes "on behalf of" the vizier, which implies that the vizier prompted it. Please give your source for this edit.</p>

<p>3. Do a search on Muhammad Hamidullah. He was one of the great Muslim scholars of the 20th century, and that's how the links describe him. He was a lawyer, professor, translater, author, linguist fluent in dozens of languages, etc. He's described as a Muslim scholar here and all over the web because that's what he was.</p>
<p><i>I know who he is. You have ignored the point I made, which is that you do not refer to others in the article by their religion or ethnicity.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I refer to him that way because that is the way he is most commonly referred to, as a simple Google check will show you <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22Muhammad+Hamidullah%22+%2B%22Muslim+scholar%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22Muhammad+Hamidullah%22+%2B%22Muslim+scholar%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>, followed by "Islamic scholar" <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22Muhammad+Hamidullah%22+%2B%22Islamic+scholar%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2B%22Muhammad+Hamidullah%22+%2B%22Islamic+scholar%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> I didn't make it up. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 05:36, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>4. Nonsense. The structure of the article is to give the position of the people stating it, then give countering positions. Since Hamidullah's position counters those of the earlier people, it goes at the end.</p>
<p><i>When has that ever been the idea of this or any other article?</i></p>

<p>5. Slim had the book, and she quoted him. Since you've never read it, you shouldn't speculate about what it actually said, and change things according to your opinions.</p>
<p><i>She did not quote him saying they "rose up". I assume she cannot. She replaced the part about Spain (not in the area, and not on the map), which has absolutely nothing to do with the conflict the article is about, but does smear Arabs quite nicely.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, he certainly didn't say your amazingly POV whitewash, "there were conflicts between Muslim and Jewish communities". A pogrom in which hundreds of Jews are murdered by Muslims is not a "conflict between Muslim and Jewish communities". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 05:36, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>6. A deputy vizier is an advisor to the vizier; he is appointed by the vizier, and does everything on the vizier's say so. If you like, though, we can take the whole apologetic out, since the only point of it was to provide an excuse for the killing of hundreds of innocent Jews; what is your source for it in the first place?</p>
<p><i>It provided context. I know you don't like anything that suggests that Arabs are not bloodthirsty anti-Semitic murderers who will kill Jews at the drop of a turban, but the context is important.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>It was your typical attempt to insert POV in order to excuse cold-blooded murder. Or perhaps you think that if a Jewish vizier is disrespectful to a Muslim women, then it justifies murdering hundreds of Jewish men women and children in response.

<dd>Dr Zen asked above for a quote from Benny Morris. I didn't think this much detail was necessary, but as it's been requested, I've put it in, and there is more of it if required. I also added that Morris is from Ben-Gurion University, and I added his book to the "further reading" (or whatever it's called) section, but there should probably be a References section, where we can list our references when we make insertions. If everyone makes sure they have a reference for their insertions, that will reduce disputes. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 05:08, Dec 23, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your quote is entirely disingenuous. You have replaced material about areas that are not connected with this conflict and you do not substantiate the contentious phrase "rose up". So, in fact, you've made the article even more strongly POV, although to your credit, it's stated as Benny Morris's POV and not yours. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 05:26, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not disingenuous. It is the passage I was citing (but not quoting) when I wrote the "rose up" sentence. You didn't like that, and asked for a quote. So I have supplied the quote. If you feel another expression is better than "rose up," by all means add it. I'm not sure what you mean by "you have replaced material about areas that are not connected . . . " I have not replaced anything. Earlier on this talk page, Abdel asked for a source for the dhimmi passage, which I had not written. I therefore provided Benny Morris as a source, and I wrote a couple of paragraphs summarizing his views. You questioned those paragraphs, asking for a direct quote for the "rose up" claim. So I have provided the direct quote. Perhaps I should scan the entire book into the Talk page? I don't know what else to call it if not "rose up against," but I'm not wedded to that expression, so by all means find a more accurate one if you want to. There were attacks on Jews. Jews were killed, sometimes in their thousands. Jewish buildings were set on fire.

<p>Thank you. I am about to create a References section, which at the moment will sadly only contain two references, but hopefully it will grow, as that is the surest way of ending disputes that I know of — always cite sources. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 05:42, Dec 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>As it happens, I do not agree. It's rather easy to find sources that agree with one view or another. I believe it's best to include as many views as possible and to present them as views (I'm not sure about referencing them all because in a large article one will end up with a long list of references -- but the references are for <i>us</i> not the reader; in other words, I think you should put Benny Morris in the references if you really think he is useful further reading, but cite him here on the talk page if you simply want him to back your POV). I think it helps to present "facts" as neutrally as possible too and for all to accept that facts do not necessarily become any more "factual" just because somebody, anybody says so. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 05:50, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We should follow Wikipedia policy, which is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. These policy pages have to be read in conjunction, not as separate policies.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Sorry, what's your point? There are different levels of verifiability, as the policy points out, and different ways to cite sources. I'm entirely conversant with the policies. Perhaps you feel every single claim in the article should be sourced with full references. If so, get cracking. I disagree, of course. I don't believe for instance that you need to source that the Middle East has seen a conflict. You can state that as a fact. Nor do you need to show that it has in fact been the centre of diplomatic and media attention for years. This is not disputed. Referencing these claims would make the article unwieldy, if not unreadable.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>The sources are for the readers, not for us, so that they can easily check what we say. Not everything can be referenced, as you say, but any contentious claim must be referenced, and the more contentious it is, the more reputable the source should be. Any claim that another editor challenges must be referenced or removed. The burden of proof is on the editor who inserts the claim, not on the editor who challenges it. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. This means, as you know, that even if we personally know something to be true, we can't include it in Wikipedia unless it has been published somewhere already. (The only exception to this would be if we were referring to primary source material like trial transcripts, but that gets tricky because the other editors and the readers wouldn't have access to them, but these exceptions are rare and needn't trouble us with this article.) So the key is: provide good references — academics on any side of the debate are the best thing; reputable journalist are next best; political leaders, United Nations, government bodies, and so on. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 06:37, Dec 23, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>I don't see how any of that contradicts what I said. I suggested that we ought not to weigh down the article with references for everything (a different matter to suggesting that we should not source everything -- you are conflating the two) because it is simply not reader-friendly. It is readily verifiable that Hamidullah said what I claim. I gave the full quote and the magazine in which he said it. It is not a particularly useful piece of further reading, and as such, I think it can safely be omitted as a reference. By the way, I cannot find anything in the policy that gives a hierarchy of sources. I think clearly that in different cases different sources will be best. Benny Morris is not, in fact, a primary source on 15th century Morocco. A 15th century Moroccan would be! Do you see?</i> <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 07:16, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure what you mean. I know Morris isn't a primary source. I didn't say he was. Wikipedia uses mostly secondary sources. Wikipedia itself is regarded as mostly a tertiary source, though sometimes we do analyse primary source material, but it's less common. (I asked you before how historians and journalists use information differently, and you never did get back to me on that, so maybe the above is part of that discussion.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm also not sure how you're distinguishing between a source and a reference. Perhaps if you explain your terms and your concerns, I'll know better what you mean.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A reference is a piece of work referred to by the author(s) in the creation of the article, so if you referred to the Hamidullah article, you have to list it as a reference. At the very least, you have to list it in a References section at the end of the article, but if the material you used from Hamidullah was in any way contentious, the sort of thing people might question/challenge, or is a quote, then you must refer to it inline as well, for example by writing in brackets (Hamidullah, 2000). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">Slim</a> 20:29, Dec 23, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
