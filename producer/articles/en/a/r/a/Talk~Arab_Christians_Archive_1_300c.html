<p>I deleted "Still, Arab Christians in today may decend from Arab christians of pre-Islam era, who manly concentrated in the area known today as Jordan." as I do not know where the evidence for a Jordanian concentration comes from. Christianity before Islam was widespread before the rise of Islam throughout the Byzantine Empire, so I would not say it was concentrated in Jordan. There were numberous early Christian communities in the countries that surround Jordan as well. I think the article already notes that modern Arab Christians are descended from pre-Islamic Christians. Let me know if I'm missing something here.</p>

<dd>What on earth do you mean the Christian Palestinians aren't Arabs? Have you ever talked to any of them? Here in Syria as well there are probably well over a million Arab Christians. You seem to be bent on getting some ideological grievance of yours onto Wikipedia instead of looking at facts. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 10:28, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem with you people is that you dont know the difference between identity or ethnology. The "Palestinians" cannot be arabs. It is historical ethnical cultural wrong to say that they are arabs. The only reason they claim that they are arabs is due to the fact that they are both moselms (that is the only combining factor). Whearas the name arab and palestinian have nothing in common, neither racial, cultural nor tradition (exept the islamic tradition). the reasons palestinians say they are "arabs" is merly political. and politic ideology isnt welcomed here in wikipedia, here we speek of scientific facts and strife for historical accuracy. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuryoyo_55dc.html" title="User:Suryoyo">Michael</a> 11:50, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: christian palestinians dont have much chance of saying other things, for example in the syriac orthodox curch , the patriarch stated that we all are arab? wich is laugable for the reason that I personally met him and he clerly stated that we are not(statement was based on political reasons). Thus again, political statements nor ideologies must not be applied in these articles wich requires objectiviness and to be accurate. And if you are interested on understanding the arabification of minoritys and how ethnicy and identity intermingels please got to your nearest university and take some crash course to learn more. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuryoyo_55dc.html" title="User:Suryoyo">Michael</a> 11:56, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And about the christians from syria? are you speaking of the melkites? or wich christian group? all I have to do Is to ask to go and read about the history of the curch that you claim is Arab here in wikipedia and please check if they claim themselves as arabs. <a href="../../../s/u/r/User%7ESuryoyo_55dc.html" title="User:Suryoyo">Michael</a> 11:58, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I live in Syria and get to talk to quite a lot of Syrian Christians. And I also know quite a few Palestinian Christians. Now, almost all of them - maybe all of them - are Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Protestant or Maronite, but they all think of themselves as Arabs. Of course the Greek Orthodox Church is not an Arab church (in fact its lacking high Arab officials in Palestine is a frequent complaint of its Palestinian members) but its Syrian and Palestinian members are Arabs and in my experience pretty much always think of themselves as such. If you cannot find any evidence for your anti-Arab jihad could you please call a halt to it? <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 12:08, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Still you havent read a thing about them, What they call themselves in Syria (muchabarat) and the arabization is at its peak is not presicely what I call objective. If you want the truth then you have to go beond your own experiance and believes, eventhough sometimes it hurts to realize somethings that you didnt expect. Like the fact that maronites, melkites, syrian orthodox are <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriacs.html" title="Syriacs">Syrians</a>. Oh well, I wont waist my time to explain to you why the arab identity is based on a lie, nor will I distrubt your dream on that above mentioned are arab christians, you can have your arab dream. altough the arab ideology is now almost complete in those areas to. And there will no longer be any chrisitian left in those areas but only in footnotes. And if you dont believe that then you only have to go to websites that provied statistics about populations in countrys.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Embarrasement and Shame on the Syriacs here</span></h2>
<p>Who are you Chaldeans and Syriacs to be designating whose Arab and whose not in this entry? Have you never heard of the Arab nationalistic founders of various Palestinians groups and Lebanese pan-Arab orthodox groups? Still if many Arab Chirstians "do not consider themselves arab" its does not matter becase they are not ethnically Arab. I was especially outraged when you an extremist user said on thsi page that Palestinians and Lebanese Christians are NOT arabs. There is no difference in the ethnic and genetic makeup between Muslim Lebanese and Christian Lebanese. They are the same people you retard. I am a Lebanese and Palestinian Chirstian and I am PROUD to be an Arab. It is outrageous, it as if being an Arab is an insult or something, this is how some users make it soud! Pure racism and denial. So you extremists out there stop skewing information: Wikipedia should not bow to couple of bias people and compromise the factuality of this article simply because they ask for it. Even Chaldeans, whether you like it or not, to your great surprise guess what: you are arabs. Your have been so assimilitaed into Arab culture and society over the centuries from Lebanon to Iraq that you are considered as Iraqi Christians or Arab Christians. And i am not going to say "no offense" because if you do take offense then you are a racist and should not be editing this article. I know btw, countless Chaldeans who admit to being Arabs (still if they do not admit, like the Sirs here, they still are). So stop this nonsense and be logical and fair. This is propostrous and outrageous so to all anti-Arabs out there, you may have your opinions but keep them out of the pages and keep the facts straight. And, there is a lot of bias on Syriac and Assyrian related articles here. Many changes are bound to come. --<a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDoge120_c29f.html" title="User:Doge120">Doge120</a> 05:53, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">SHAKIRA and her ETHNICITY</span></h2>
<p>Every time i check Shakira's wikipage, her ethnicity has been changed! What is wrong with people? When it is written she is "Lebanese", almost instantly it is corrected to "Catholic Lebanese". What is the big deal? It seems there are some obsessed Christians who cannot bare to think that Shakira is associated with Lebanon (an arab country). In actual fact, Lebanon is a very diverse country with a great demography- to enlighten yourself, check out the Lebanon wikipage. And in response to a previous comment on this page ("Recent Edit"Drdr1989), it is not true when its written that Catholic Lebanese are not arabs. In actual fact they are. The vast majority of Arabs in the United States are in fact Christian, not Muslim. There are indeed many thousands of Christian Arabs in the world, so it should not be assumed that Arabs are always Muslim. Shakira is of Lebanese descent and when she descirbes it, you never hear her add in ..."but im Catholic". She is proud of her Arab hertiage and demonstrates this by influencing her choice of music, lyrics and dancing (the song 'Ojos Asi' and her frequent bellydancing in her music videos).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in response to a further comment (by She Mourns 01:22, 22 July 2006 (UTC)): Please do not generalise when you say the Christian Lebanese are of "Phoenician, aramaic, greek..." descent. I am indeed a Christian Lebanese along with 30% of the population of Lebanon and would identify myself as Arab; because i speak Arabic, live in an Arab country, practise Arabic traditions and customs and conform to the Arabic culture. And although a lot of us Christian Lebanese have "Phoenician, aramaic, greek.." and so forth blood, in the centuries the Arabs have occupied Lebanon, the mix over and cross-breeding (as i put it) of Arabs and non-Arabs is particularly high and many Christian Lebanese (and Syrians, Egyptians and so forth) have Arab blood. Please try and understand this, and to help you understand visit the Wikipage on Arabs, to check out "who exactly is an Arab?" and what identifies one as Arab; and Shakira (or her father as it is) would definately come under a few classifications. Just as one can be a Jew but not actually follow Judaism, an understanding of the etymology of a word has to take place before people start to panick over such labelings.</p>
<p>People need to relax and stop obsessing over her ethnicity. If it is written that she has Lebanese blood, than this is the truth. If it is written she is has Catholic Lebanese blood, then this is also the truth. It is up to people who read the page to read about Lebanon too. However, those who wish to disassociate Shakira with her Arab ancestry are illogical and will fail, and if they were true fans of the singer, would not be so sensitive in having her real ethnicity detailed.</p>

<dd>"identify myself as Arab; because i speak Arabic, live in an Arab country, practise Arabic traditions and customs and conform to the Arabic culture. " - well guess what buddy; I speak <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syriac.html" title="Syriac">Syriac</a>, practice Assyrian traditions and customs and conform to the Assyrian culture. Thus I identify myself as Assyrian. The Christian arab nationalist here need to get this into their melon; not everyone in the middle east is arab. Thats like saying all of Europe is made of "white people". <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 14:13, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apologies to [Chaldean]for what he percieves as my Christian Arab Nationalist tendencies. I am not making generalisations that everyone in the Middle East is Arab and im sorry if thats what you thought. I acknowledge the ancient minorities such as the Syriacs and how they do not identify as Arab but lots of Christians particularly in Lebanon and Palestine do. The purpose for the section on Shakira was in response to some negativity regarding the subject on her discussion page on wikipedia and i wanted to see some responses to this on this wikipage. No offence caused. By the Christian Arab 13:37 25 August 2006</p>

<dd>I dont argue the fact that Christians in Palestine and Lebanon are considered arab. But when you say there are 300,000 Christian arabs in Iraq, thats an insult. Christians in Lebanon speak arabic and acustome to arab community, its not the same with us in Iraq and Syria. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 19:09, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
