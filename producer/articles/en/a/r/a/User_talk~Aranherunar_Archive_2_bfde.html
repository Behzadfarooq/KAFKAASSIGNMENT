<p>I had made my point clear. "I agree with LDHan. People are talking Mao Zedong, a Han Chinese person; Puyi, a Manchu Chinese person; Bill Clinton, an Anglo-Celtic person. So why just around China. Wouldn't it be necessary somtimes to distinguish Han Chinese from other ethnic groups in the US? I think there is no need to rephrase the sentense. The only thing we need to do is to delete "around". If people can distinguish Han Chinese from other minorities in China, they naturally can distinguish Han Chinese from other ethnic groups in the world, of course not just around China." This view is also accepted by other editors. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdipedia_6886.html" title="User:Edipedia">Edipedia</a> 15:15, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it is accepted by other editors, how come you broke the 3RR in less than forty minutes, hmm? Your claim was also invalid because I definitely didn't, well, "accept" it.</dd>
<dd>I have explained over and over why the term "around" is used, and so have many other editors. I'm not sure I understood you completely this time, but Bill Clinton is not even a Chinese - we just call him an Anglo-Celtic person. The term Han Chinese, as said in the article, is used to distinguish the Han people from other Chinese minorities, and these minorities, usually Chinese, seldom appear outside the Chinese sphere of influence. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranherunar_05c3.html" title="User:Aranherunar">Aran</a>|<a href="../../../a/r/a/User_talk%7EAranherunar_ee4b.html" title="User talk:Aranherunar">heru</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aranherunar_c9f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aranherunar">nar</a> 15:22, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I requested the page for protection, you requested to unprotect it, and then made four edits against consensus to be reverted by two other users.

<p>According to <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing warnings</a>, "after a reasonable time has elapsed, archiving one's talk page, including the vandal warning, is acceptable." According to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_pages_8576.html#Etiquette" title="Wikipedia:Talk pages">Wikipedia:Talk pages#Etiquette</a>, "Others delete comments after they have responded to them." and "Actively erasing non-harassing personal messages without replying (if a reply would be appropriate or polite) will probably be interpreted as hostile."</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/e/q/User%7EHeqong_bd76.html" title="User:Heqong">User:Heqong</a> was blanking the entire page and not merely removing warnings. Given that the page was of moderate length, and some editors in good standing actively remove completed discussions from their talk pages, it was appropriate fo Heqong to do this. Furthermore, only a small proportion of the page consisted of warnings and Heqong did not seem to be purposely ignoring other users or refusing to respond to their comments. The page was blanked long after the warnings had been posted</p>
<p>Based on my understanding of the policy, it is fine to archive one's talk page via blanking, but it is not fine to selectively remove warnings from a talk page, especially if this is done out of anti-social tendencies or spite, as evidenced by a vindictive edit summary such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alanmak&amp;diff=50504471&amp;oldid=50472135" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alanmak&amp;diff=50504471&amp;oldid=50472135" rel="nofollow">"Delete shit"</a>. Just because a page contains warnings does not mean it can never be archived. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 12:18, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Blanking of a talk page does not constitute destruction of evidence because the page history is being preserved. If Heqong were to move the talk page to a subpage, and then request the subpage be deleted in order to erase the page history, then we should be concerned. In any case, if page blanking somehow disrupts the arbcom evidence gathering process (which is already over), then it is up to arbcom (and not us) to take action. But I don't think it has, or is being, disrupted since arbcom evidence pages often link to page history and diff links, with the view that current versions of pages are always changing. The evidence has been already presented at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Heqong_Evidence_ef44.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Heqong/Evidence">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Heqong/Evidence</a>, and arbcom is currently in the voting phase, based on the evidence provided on that page. Nowhere on that page is the current version of <a href="../../../h/e/q/User_talk%7EHeqong_1896.html" title="User talk:Heqong">User talk:Heqong</a> linked.</p>
<p>By "long after the warnings had been posted" I did not mean it as a matter of months. I meant it as a matter of days. Normally, when users purposely try to blank and ignore warnings, it is done immediately, within hours, or at least by the next time they log in. It is not done after six days of active editing and active discussion on the very same talk page.</p>
<p>The particular post, which you claim did not receive a response from Heqong, was responded to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58495406" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bonafide.hustla&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=58495406" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Although many of the posts concerned Heqong's behavior, most were not actual "warnings for vandalism". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Heqong&amp;oldid=69195020#Personal_attacks" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Heqong&amp;oldid=69195020#Personal_attacks" rel="nofollow">This</a> was an actual warning, issued by an administrator warning of an impending block. Most of the other postings did not qualify as such. Regardless, I really don't see how the blanking was done to deliberately mislead other editors or to ignore the warnings. Heqong simply blanked his pages and left, which is entirely permissible.</p>
<p>Your creation of a separate archive was unnecessary and unneeded. The archive already exists in the page history. The page history is linked from the talk page itself, via the "history" tab. Anyone seeing a blank page will know a history exists, and will go there if the need arises, as any blank page without a history would qualify for speedy deletion. If you truly remain concerned that the page blanking might disrupt the arbcom case, the make it known <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Heqong_fe85.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Heqong">here</a>.--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 13:53, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Therefore keeping an 'S' is the correct thing to do under the style guide unless the topic under discussion relates to some region with a particular dialect of English that spells it differently. In fact, the style guide suggests finding a different word that doesn't have semantic or spelling variation - in this case I doubt there is one, so the word needs to stay.

<dd>Scott Davis, thank you for your clarification. I have failed to make my point clear so far, again. Please note that the words "Civilisation" and "Civilization" <b>are both</b> British English (though it sounds strange. Perhaps it's a mistake in Wiktionary). Civilisation is simply a far, far less common variant of Civilization. In fact, you can see from the edit history that many people feel that "Civilisation" is a <i>wrong spelling</i>. This is not the matter of dialects - as I have exemplified on Beneaththelandslide's talk page, "I" is a variant of "Aye"("Yes") but it is nearly never used. The same case is with Civilisation/Civilization. Civilisation is very rarely used, and many think it is actually a wrong spelling.</dd>
<dd>The text being the same does not justify reverting the edit again and again, because there's plenty of versions you see actually use the word "civilization", but are reverted by Cyberjunkie. I simply find the reverting to be very unnecessary. The policy is used so that edit wars over spellings would not happen - and though the users who changed the spelling are not following the style policy, reverting them makes it worse, because somebody will change it back, and it will be reverted again(actually, about half the edits in the page history are changing "civilisation" to "civilization" or vice versa). To prevent this happening, I have added a note telling users not to change the spelling again - which is promptly removed without discussion, and deemed as "silly", a word which I rather "dislike".</dd>
<dd>In conclusion, changing it from "civilisation" to "civilization" is <i>not according to the policy</i>, as I fully understand, but only if they are treated as two dialects of English, which they aren't, and therefore the style guide should not be considered. Moreover, changing it back over 10 times does not help anybody. I would have thought an admin would have enough sense to understand that (or read my comment, which explains it), instead of classifying my comment as nonsense and ignoring it.</dd>
<dd>Again, I hope I do not sound "rude and nonsensical" in this reply.<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranherunar_05c3.html" title="User:Aranherunar">Aran</a><a href="../../../a/r/a/User_talk%7EAranherunar_ee4b.html" title="User talk:Aranherunar">heru</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aranherunar_c9f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aranherunar">nar</a> 02:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Scott Davis, actually I find this comment "stop rudely harassing other users" to be directed to me rather than an action - because I have never done such a thing as "rudely harassing other users". If Beneaththelandside feels harassed, that's fine, I apologize for leaving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beneaththelandslide&amp;diff=69824745&amp;oldid=69743533" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beneaththelandslide&amp;diff=69824745&amp;oldid=69743533" rel="nofollow">this note</a> in his user talk page, which he may somehow intrepret as "rude harassment". As he had said "users", I assume he meant Cyberjunkie as well, which I do not find that I am "harassing" and have to disagree with Beneaththelandslide, because Cyberjunkie is perfectly capable of speaking for himself whether it is a harassment or not, and whether I shall "stop" it. As I understand from Cyberjunkie's note on his user page, "...if you disagree with something I have done, or if you would like assistance, leave a message on my talk page", that this sort of "harassment" considered by Beneaththelandslide, which is a discussion on edits, is acceptable to Cyberjunkie. Again I apologize for the harassment if it really did annoy Beneaththelandslide, but have to warn Beneaththelandslide so that he will start to judge others' actions with the correct wording. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranherunar_05c3.html" title="User:Aranherunar">Aran</a><a href="../../../a/r/a/User_talk%7EAranherunar_ee4b.html" title="User talk:Aranherunar">heru</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aranherunar_c9f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aranherunar">nar</a> 03:10, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I realized I have overreacted by warning the user for his comment, and was going to remove it when I found out that it had already been removed by the user itself, with the edit summary "rmv crap". This is a serious breach of Wikipedia rules, including offensive edit summary and removing warning on own talk page. As I was going to remove the warning anyway, the violation of the second rule will not be accounted for. I have reverted the change since he does not seem to have any regret with his offensive accusations while all I did was leaving a note on his talk page. Feel free to comment.</dd>
<dd>As for the "civilisation" and "civilization" matter, I perfectly understand that to change the "s" into "z" or vice versa is not necessary and may cause an edit war, and editors should not do so, which is why I left a note "Please do not change the spelling of the word" on the talk page, then to be promptly removed as "silly".

<dd>The warnings are far from "petty" and "inappropriate" - and if they are so, as I said, please rebute them, not remove them. Your edit summary, "rmv crap", etc., is far from being civil. However, you have decided that everyone else is an idiot and you are above rules because you have been here "for over a year", and removed the warning over 5 times repeatedly, which made the matter much worse.

<dd>Yes, I was going to remove that NPA warning, which I deemed unnecessary until then. However, an abusive edit summary, under any circumstances, no matter you are right or not, is completely unacceptable. I would have thought you had more sense than that. Your removal of warnings is completely childish. Rather than telling me to spend my time contributing to Wikipedia, why don't you? The removal of warnings is completely unnecessary. They do not in any way hinder your ability to contribute. Instead, you have decided to start an edit war on the warnings. This is completely immature, forgive my frankness, and I would suggest you to stop it right away before an admin has to come to solve this dispute which isn't needed at all.

<dd>As a note, the original NPA warning, which I deemed unneccessary, has been removed. My warning is now of abusive edit summary, not being incivil, and of removing warning from your talk pages. I noticed you said you found the warnings to be an insult - and I would have to say I find the comment "silly", "crap" etc. to be insulting as well.</dd>
<dd><i>The above comment is written before I saw user Beneaththelandslide's reply.</i></dd>
<dd>Re: Yes, you can say absolutely the same thing, you can say you believe you did not violate the rules, whatever, but removing the warnings is frowned upon. You should leave the warning there along with your reply to it, and when people wants to check your past warnings, they will see that and they will see your reply. They can come to a conclusion themselves. Instead, you have chosen to remove the warning over ten times without a particular reason except "rmv rubbish", "rmv crap", etc. I find your behavior very immature for an active contributor like you, but anyhow I will remove the warnings after reconsideration. I believe you have enough sense and experience to understand the policies, and, after all, it's only a misunderstanding. Again, you might not take in this suggestion, but please try to be civil in your discussions from now on. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranherunar_05c3.html" title="User:Aranherunar">Aran</a><a href="../../../a/r/a/User_talk%7EAranherunar_ee4b.html" title="User talk:Aranherunar">heru</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aranherunar_c9f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aranherunar">nar</a> 07:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there Aranherunar. Don't get too strung up about this. It's generally considered rather robotic and impersonal to stick a templated warning on the page of another user who is established and trying to contibute in good faith. From my personal experience it seems to irritate people a lot more than having an exchange of words, even when the words may be harsher. People seem to routinely delete robot statements but seem to keep rather pointed comments which are not templated. In any case, the best way is just to have two minutes to leave them a personal note (I do this even for guys who make religiously inflammatory comments and real personal attacks like calling each other "terrorist"). As for Beneaththelandslide, he holds himself to high article standards and doesn't mind getting as good as he gets, so dont' worry if he says "rv bad edit" or "rv badly phrased" - he is a good guy, and there is a difference between commenting on the quality of the edits and commenting on the editor themselves, although if heavy language were used, it would be concerning. As for the issue with cj, it was probably the caps, which may intimidate a few people. And by the way, the reason Ghirlandajo is in trouble is because there isn't a group of admins who share the same POV that he does. Some admins who have the right connections more or less just rain down whatever they like....<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 07:16, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. I believe the matter is solved already, but anyway there's a point I have to say. I did not exactly "stick a templated warning" - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beneaththelandslide&amp;diff=69963423&amp;oldid=69963010" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Beneaththelandslide&amp;diff=69963423&amp;oldid=69963010" rel="nofollow">the actual "warning"</a>. It <i>was</i> a note with a subst. of a warning message which I put there to sum up my previous paragraph. The second warning subst. is added after the user reverted my edit, and I <i>have</i> also left a personal note before that. I apologize if this seems to offend him, but I also find the words "silly", "nonsensical" etc. quite offensive when I had made thousands of edits in Wikipedia and my edits have seldom been deemed unnecessary or false, and definitely not "silly".

<p>please show me where I have made a personal attack, so I may know where I have crossed the line, as I do not believe I have.</p>
<p>If you are refering to the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Talk%7EExtermination_through_labour_c1ce.html" title="Talk:Extermination through labour">Talk:Extermination through labour</a>, that is not a personal attack, if you will notice, I have cited on <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalibutt_9a46.html" title="User:Halibutt">User:Halibutt</a>'s talk page where he has made unreferenced POVed statements in an article. And when I removed them, he reverted my work then stated that in order to remove unreferenced conjecture: <i>"If that is false - please be so kind as to provide some source to state clearly that..."</i> <a href="../../../g/e/r/Talk%7EGerman_17th_Infantry_Division_ed32.html" title="Talk:German 17th Infantry Division">Talk:German 17th Infantry Division</a>. By that reasoning, anyone can post anything they want and not have to cite it (against wikipedia's policy of "no original research").</p>
<p>So, since it cannot seriously be the above case, please state where I have personally attacked someone.</p>
<p>If anyone should be blocked for Personal Attacks, it is Halibutt, claiming foul and attacking my character throughout wikipedia, using the tu quoque fallacy continuosly, rather than maturely discussing the matter he contines to attack me, claiming my only contributions are edit wars.</p>
<p>for instance, here on the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolish_September_Campaign_a86a.html#Comments" title="Talk:Polish September Campaign">Polish September Campaign, comments section</a> where he states, <i>"Jadger, thanks for changing yet another discussion into your I don't like Halibutt campaign."</i> or perhaps this, also on the same talk page: "<i>Don't get me wrong, Jadger, but I have yet to see you actually write any article on the matter, while most of your edits are either related to removal of some facts you're uncomfortable with (German WWII war crimes) or names switching (as is the case here). Why not focus on something more constructive?</i>"</p>
<p>now, which is a personal attack, citing where a person has made an error, or claiming they are trying to suppress claims of atrocities? I think the latter, as you probably do as well.</p>

<p>that was not an insult, if you will note, I was giving an example of the fallacy called "begging the question", to show that his attack upon me was not only unjustified, but also a personal attack, here it is:<a href="../../../j/a/d/User_talk%7EJadger_c60f.html#Extermination_through_labour" title="User talk:Jadger">User_talk:Jadger#Extermination_through_labour</a><i>"Then perhaps you could tell me why do you believe black people should be exterminated? //Halibutt 12:26, 17 August 2006 (UTC)"</i></p>
<p>I was not attacking Halibutt, just showing that his personal attack upon me was a logical fallacy and that there are multiple forms of the same thing used by children in elementary school.</p>
<p>I notice you have only warned me, perhaps you should warn Halibutt as well, since he is the one that was not giving examples of logical fallacies, but actually insulting me.</p>

<p>then why have I been the only one warned? when I have obviously taken offence to his slander against me. Especially since you have obviously taken my remark in question out of context, and not even quoted the full sentence, but only parts. One can do that for anyone and make them sound as personal attacks, for instance someone can say "I support the recent government initiatives to stop child molesting" and another person can pretend that they said "I support.... child molesting", much like you have done here, you have taken it totally out of context.</p>
<p>you said:<i>The user you are arguing with being uncivil does not justify you being uncivil</i> can you clarify that please, it reads as if Halibutt has special privileges and shouldn't be questioned for his revert wars or personal attacks upon others.</p>
<p>you said: <i>Please keep cool and try to make the discussion on-topic - i.e., about improving Wikipedia, not about the social life of a person</i> so how does Halibutt's statement <i>"Then perhaps you could tell me why do you believe black people should be exterminated?"</i> improve wikipedia? and why does he get off scott free? if you notice, the personal attacks started from him well before the statements in question.</p>

<p>what mistake? you mean instead of trying to get the discussion back on track I should simply cry foul before he has a chance to? How is mine a personal attack, when I said "this is an example of the logical fallacy...." before the statement in question, while he so blatantly never did such a thing. Not to mention it is not how one means something, but how it is taken to mean that is important, see for instance criminal harassment</p>
<p>I did indeed try to get discussion back on track, as you will notice, I was the one that said: "I would appreciate it if you would be civil, or else I will not continue this discussion." on Hallibutt's userpage.</p>
<p>It takes two to tango as they say, and only punishing one side makes the other think he has free will. you may not think it is punishment to warn someone, but on wikipedia it is like a criminal record, where people like Halibutt will bring it up in a discussion by using a tu quoque fallacy, thus taking the topic off track, I have seen him do it before, on <a href="../../../p/o/l/Talk%7EPolish_September_Campaign_a86a.html" title="Talk:Polish September Campaign">Talk:Polish September Campaign</a> for one.</p>

</ul>
<p>how is that a "perfectly proper and acceptable question"? I have never spoken about black people to Halibutt, or on the wiki for that matter(check my contribs), how does that question ask me to explain my action? the statement you say you warned me about is exactly the same, but it seems now you meant a totally different statement, you said you warned me about my statement in response to his statement about black people.</p>
<p>you said: <i>"What I see in this case is that you posted a personal remark that sounded offensive to Halibutt, he kindly asked you to remove it and argued that it is offensive and slanderous to him,"</i> Now, can you tell me how that is any different from the current situation? I have obviously found his remark offensive, and have asked him to apologise to me, which he has not.</p>
<p>perhaps you should actually read the whole discussion rather then only the parts Halibutt has told you about, it started long before, he was the one that began the incivility long before on talk pages of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_17th_Infantry_Division_5db2.html" title="German 17th Infantry Division">German 17th Infantry Division</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_September_Campaign_01ad.html" title="Polish September Campaign">Polish September Campaign</a> and many others. I do not blame him for becoming incivil, he had firmly lost a debate and so could do nothing else except perhaps admit defeat. My only fault and regret was allowing him to pull me down that moral slope with him.</p>

<p>I am not arguing my statements were not personal attacks, I asked for you to point out which ones you believed are personal attacks, then when you showed me, I pointed out that Halibutt had made that personal attack first, and I was simply replying in kind. I am not arguing that I shouldn't have been warned, I'm arguing that Halibutt should also be warned, for not only antagonizing me but also for making personal attacks, it takes two to tango as they say.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by removing the note that it is called <i>manoeuvre</i> in Commonwealth English, and then leave a reference to the Manual of Style in the edit summary. The MoS advises people which spelling to use <i>according to what the article is about</i>. Since the article refers to something common anywhere, what's wrong with putting a simple alternative spelling beside it? (see <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elevator.html" title="Elevator">elevator</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/p/Tap_%28valve%29.html" title="Tap (valve)">tap (valve)</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Maneuver.html" title="Maneuver">maneuver</a> etc. for more examples) I've no problem with the American spelling being dominant in the article, but surely there's no harm with just saying what the spelling is outside of North America?

<dd>Well, the "other countries" was originally added by another editor to refer to Ireland which isn't in the Commonwealth - I suppose it was a bit confusing. However, the MoS has nothing to say about writing an <i>alternative spelling</i>, which was what I was trying to point out earlier. As for the "two word" rule, what about <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shopping_mall.html" title="Shopping mall">shopping mall</a>? But you're right: the redirect's probably enough. -- <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatgavini_d482.html" title="User:Greatgavini"><font face="Paris"><strong>THE GREAT GAVINI</strong></font></a> {<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGreatgavini_058f.html" title="User talk:Greatgavini">T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Greatgavini_c5ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/Greatgavini">C</a>|<span class="plainlinks" style="color:#002bb8"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Greatgavini" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Greatgavini" rel="nofollow">#</a></span>} 06:32, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
