<p>Can't Israel also be considered part of the Arab world? Arabic is one of the official languages.

<dd>Interesting argument. I don't know if they exactly correspond, but virtually every state described here is a member of the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_League_2a91.html" title="Arab League">Arab League</a> which would be the main point of inclusion in Arab world. Giving some official preference to Islam is also more or less a universal amongst these states. Israel doesn't meet either criteria. Plus, in terms of lifestyle, family structures etc. Israel is much more westernized. One wouldn't describe it as culturally Arab. Palestine is, BTW, included here.</dd>
<dd>Contextualizing Israel inside a "global unit" is quite hard. There is a very nebulous idea, for instance, the Israel could actually join the European Union at some point.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps a line to the effect, "despite historical conflict with the Arab World, Israel actually shares some characteristics with it..." if you can find the spot. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:56, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Very interesting issue you've raised. To include or not Israel you could look into the criteria of inclusion into the Arab world. If it's location or language, Israel meets the criteria, if it's lifestyle or the arab league, it wouldn't. Anyway, I'm not here to judge, and because of the fact that this issue is hard to resolve, please make some reaserches before including this idea.<a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedar-Guardian_25dc.html" title="User:Cedar-Guardian">CG</a> 17:08, 5 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think lifestyle could be a criteria. Lifestyle horizonatally (across the region) and vertically (economic status) is too varied and similar with surrounding non-Arabic speaking people. And if inclusion in the Arab league is a criteria then why not merge with <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_league.html" title="Arab league">Arab league</a>? --<a href="../../../y/o/d/User%7EYodakii_63f2.html" title="User:Yodakii">Yodakii</a> 17:33, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I raise this issue especially to help clarify what "Arab world" means. I haven't found any clear definition what kind of states could be included. Could it be considered a region without definite borders and political divisions: a general region where Arabic-speaking people are predominant? Are there any references that define it? --<a href="../../../y/o/d/User%7EYodakii_63f2.html" title="User:Yodakii">Yodakii</a> 17:33, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, leave it in there. By its membership in the AL I think it qualifies to be in the article, but there should be something on that in the article, if there is not already. Better be inclusive here than not. Maybe the best thing would be to have a map where the coloring could fade out of Arab areas, instead of slavishly following nation borders. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 14:39, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The map does seem rather confusing and confused about what it wants to show the reader/viewer. One Arab League member is not shown, while one non-member is colour-coded. A better way to illustrate the scope of the Arab "World" (its "sphere", as it were) would be to show the Arabian Peninsula in a darker shade, and the remanining Arab-speaking countries in an intermediate tone, while the three non-Arab states that are nonetheless full members of the League are shown in a paler colouring.

<p>I'm sorry, but can we not call the Kurds "a mountain people" What is that supposed to mean? The great majority of Kurds live in cities... SOME Kurds have traditionally lived in mounainous regions, but only because they were forced to retreat there because of conflict, or shepherds migrate there seasonally for their livestock. This does not mean they are some nomadic mountain people, as this suggests them to be. I'm sick of people calling them that. Hopefully this will be the last time people are so ignorant of the Kurds.</p>

<p>After reading this page I wonder why Iran, Afganistan, Pakistan, Turkey and Albania are not considered part of the Arabic world. I understand they are not parties of the Arab Ligu, but aren't they "arabic"? <b>What sets them apart?</b> Possibly if an Iranian/Afgan/Pakistani/Turkish/Alban could answer that'd be the best.</p>

<dd>The countries you just mentioned are not considered Arabic because Arabic is not spoken in those countries. <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian</a> is spoken in Iran, <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu.html" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> in Pakistan, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albanian_language.html" title="Albanian language">Albanian</a> in Albania, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a> in Turkey, etc. <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> is commonly spoken in the "Arabic countries".

<dd>I doubt that this confusion constitutes "the greatest Western misconception" (or non-Western misconception, for that matter). Not all people ("Western" or otherwise) educate themselves; and not all people ("W".o.o.) have Arab people as their main personal or professional field of interest. Many religious Muslims across the globe do memorize multiple phrases in Old Arabic, and visit Arabia. There are Malagasy and Filipino Muslims who believe they are descended from Arabic or Shirazi traders and missionaries (which they may or may not be). <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 14:34, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>What is the lighter shade of green on those two countries on the color-coded map meant to denote? And Why is Saudi Arabia shaded? <b>thanks</b>&#160;:) 203.214.111.235 18:14, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's southern Sudan (which is non-Arab) and northern Iraq (which is Kurdish). Saudi Arabia is not shaded. Perhaps you're thinking of Somalia? Somalia is included in the Arab league and has many cultural ties to the Arab world, but it's population does not speak Arabic as a first language, and could not be considered ethnically/racially Arab. To be honest, there's not much logic to the color-coding right now: southern Mauritania is also clearly non-Arab, and several Sahel states are at least partially Arab in the same fashion that Somalia is (or isn't, depending on your point of view). And then there's the Arab-dominated areas of Iran, Berber regions in North Africa, and the Kurdish parts of Syria, etc. I think it would be better to have one or more of the following options: 1. Arab league members or 2. all countries where a majority speaks Arabic as a first language, and/or it's the main official language, or 3. a color-coding that marks all areas dominated by Arabic-speaking people(s) with no regard to state borders. Of course, in cases 1 and 2 it should be noted that not all of the population of all the colored countries is or considers itself to be Arab. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 18:30, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Should northern Sudan really be colored completely dark green? As far as I know, very little of the population is actually Arab (i.e. Rashaida). Most are ethnically (by this I mean genomically) either Nubian, Arab/African mix, or simply African, but a member of a tribe who simply resembles very superficially Arabs (as opposed to southern Sudanese). By this last group I mean the Beja and various other tribes like them who have been labeled "Arab," when in fact they are simply East African (see the <a href="../../../a/m/h/Amhara.html" title="Amhara">Amhara</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/o/Oromo.html" title="Oromo">Oromo</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somali_people.html" title="Somali people">Somali</a>, and <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigray.html" title="Tigray">Tigray</a> peoples for similar groups that are not labeled "Arab"). Much of Upper Egypt probably falls into this category, too, but I'll leave that for now.</p>

<p>Well the majority of people in Egypt, Morocco, Iraq, Palestine aren't probably "ethnically" Arab, if you mean to say descended from people who migrated from the Arabian penninsula after the Hegira. But as some one who spent time in Khartoum I can tell you that the language everyone speaks is Arabic, and Arabic identity is very much a part of their identity. But then what in god's name is identity. Ahassan05 14:25, 6 April 2006 (UTC)ahassan05</p>

<p>I've corrected the releaser of the full text of the Sykes-Picot Agreement from 'Stalin' to 'Lenin'; every reference I can find on it, including the Wikipedia page on the Agreement itself, says that it was Lenin that released it, and not Stalin.

<p>Please be logical!</p>
<p>Morocco is not an Arab country neither is the so called "Western Sahara"! The "Western Sahara" is a fake case created by the Algeria's Boumedienne complot against Morocco. It happened all in the context of Cold War and Baathism-Arabism sphere. Now, both Cold War and Baathism-Arabism are parts of the past. Western Sahara is called by Moroccans: "Moroccan Southern Provinces". They are and will remain Moroccan and Amazigh in identity.</p>
