	    <p>8th August 2006, Monday, Singapore, 06 45 hours</p>
<p>The citizens of Singapore are enjoying their usual lifestyle. Students are going to school, adults are going to work and some people are still sleeping. Aran and his younger brother, Aron are walking to the bus stop to board a bus to school. While walking, they met Kai Kein.</p>
<p>Aran: Look, Kai Kein is over there.</p>
<p>Aron: Kai Kein!</p>
<p>Kai Kein: You! We always meet together at the same time.</p>
<p>Aran: Yeah, what a coincident to meet you.</p>
<p>And they waited for their bus to arrive. At 06 51 hours, bus service 960 arrived and they board that bus. At 06 54 hours, Aron alighted at the bus stop located beside Newton Hawker Centre.</p>
<p>Aran: Bye.</p>
<p>The bus’s door closed and Aran and Kai Kein are on their way to school. Meanwhile in space outside the Earth atmosphere, a satellite which was circling around the Earth atmosphere crashed into a huge object which was an alien’s spaceship. At 06 57 hours, Aran and Kai Kein reached to their destination. They alighted at that bus stop and walk to school, Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road). While walking to school, they saw Brandon in a distance.</p>
<p>Aran: Brandon!</p>
<p>Brandon then turns around and saw his friends, Aran and Kai Kein.</p>
<p>Brandon: Hey. Why you guys always go to school together?</p>
<p>Aran: Because we met while we are going to school.</p>
<p>And they walk to school together. At 07 12 hours, Aron’s school, Anglo-Chinese School (Junior), started their assembly by singing their country’s national anthem, their school anthem and the pledge. After all these, they then started their devotion. At 07 23 hours, ACS (BR) started their assembly also by singing their country’s national anthem, the pledge and the student’s creed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in space outside the Earth atmosphere, the alien spaceship stopped just outside the Earth atmosphere and the alien spaceship dispatch their smaller spaceships, or rather called the destroyer spaceship, to attempt to destroy the Earth, again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in Singapore, the Singapore Air Force detected a strange object that already entered the Earth atmosphere. The image appears to look like a ship that attempted to destroy Earth years ago. They then send the image to the authorities and the authorities confirmed that the image is the destroyer spaceship. The authorities then send the image to President SR Nathan and the President was shocked. He then ordered the SCDF to sound the “Important Message” signal across the country.</p>
<p>During assembly in ACS (BR), the signal was heard and the principal quickly rush to the administration and quickly tuned to any local FM radio station. He sounded the radio over the PA system and here what the radio station DJ said……</p>
<p>DJ of news radio 93.8 FM: This is an important message to everyone in Singapore. The President of Singapore ordered everyone to evacuate the country in an orderly fashion because the aliens are back again to destroy Earth once again...</p>
<p>Immediately after this message, the principal then rushed back to the assembly area.</p>
<p>Principal of ACS (BR): Everyone, do not panic. Teachers, when the bus arrives to pick us up, bring your class to the respective bus and the bus will bring us to Singapore Changi International Airport and we will board the special flight to somewhere save. This plan was by the President and all principal of the school must follow this evacuation plan.</p>
<p>Benjamin Chou: Aran, what’s happening?</p>
<p>Aran: The aliens entered the Earth atmosphere already and plan to destroy Earth again just like what happened years ago before we were born.</p>
<p>Benjamin Er: So what must we do now?</p>
<p>Aran: The bus that will arrive any time now will bring us to the airport and we will get a free flight to somewhere save without our passport. The free flight is only for all schools in Singapore only. At least we’re saved.</p>
<p>At 07 40 hours, the buses came.</p>
<p>Principal of ACS (BR): Okay. The buses had arrived and teachers, when I call your class send your class to any bus. 1A1&amp; 1A2, board the first bus. 1A3 &amp; 1E1, board the next bus. 1B1 &amp; 1B2 …</p>
<p>Mr. Syn: 1E1, stand up. We’re leaving this school.</p>
<p>1A3, Brandon and Kai Kein are in this class, and 1E1, Aran is in this class, are make their way to their bus. They were about to board the bus when they felt a tremor.</p>
<p>Aran: Oh dear.</p>
<p>The destroyer spaceship arrived and the people around ACS (BR) saw the spaceship. The spaceship blocked the sunlight to reach the ground and that caused darkness, well, not so dark lah, to that particular area. The destroyer spaceship kept on moving until its centre is directly under a school, Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road). After it stopped moving, the students then quickly board on their bus. At 07 48 hours, 1A3’s and 1E1’s bus started moving.</p>
<p>Aran: I wonder how are my parents are doing.</p>
<p>Benjamin Er: Aran, your parents will be okay, so don’t worry.</p>
<p>Their bus entered Bukit Timah Road at 07 52 hours, Sungei Road at 08 06 hours, Ophir Road at 08 09 hours and East Coast Parkway at 08 21 hours. After entering ECP, their bus and the other buses got stuck in the traffic jam.</p>
<p>Aran: Even worse.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Aran’s hand phone rang.</p>
<p>Aran: Hello?</p>
<p>Chai Hock: Aran …</p>
<p>Aran: Dad! I am so glad that you’re alive. What do you want to talk to me about?</p>
<p>Chai Hock: Aran, I have to re-service NS again, so take care of your self. From now until destruction, you have approximately 4 hours and 9 minutes to evacuate the country. Your mother had reached the airport about ten minutes earlier.</p>
<p>Aran: Dad, take care of your self in your re-service, okay?</p>
<p>Chai Hock: Okay. Bye.</p>
<p>Aran: Bye. Okay everyone; I just received a phone call from my dad. He said that the destruction will start in about 4 hours and 9 minute’s time.</p>
<p>The destroyer spaceship was also found on top of UOB Plaza and Singapore Expo Foyer Two, both also will start the destruction in 4 hours and 9 minutes time. Aran already set the countdown time on his hand phone. At 08 42 hours, their bus just pass Katong Park only.</p>
<p>Brandon: Aran, at what time is it going to be when we reach the airport?</p>
<p>Aran: Let’s see, at about 12 25 hours.</p>
<p>Brandon: Great. I hope we could go out of Singapore in time ‘cause 12 25 hours is five minutes away from 12 30 hours, the destruction time.</p>
<p>At 08 45 hours, a helicopter landed at the Istana’s helipad to pick up the President of Singapore, the Prime Minster, the Senior Minister and the Minister Mentor. At 09 32 hours, the bus just pass ECP Police Post &amp; Life Guard Station and the President, the PM, the SM and the MM boarded the helicopter and the helicopter is ready to go. At 09 33 hours, the helicopter lift off and was going to Singapore Changi International Airport. At 12 10 hours, the bus arrived at the airport.</p>
<p>Aran: Finally, we had reached the airport. All we had to do now is to board our plane.</p>
<p>At 12 20 hours, the whole of Secondary One, Two, Three and Four and the President, the PM, the SM and the MM boarded the plane already. Class 5E1’s bus just arrived at the airport at 12 25 hours. Aran checked the countdown time and the destruction was exactly in five minutes time. At 12 29 hours, 5E1 just boarded the plane. At this time, the destroyer spaceship beam door opened and the destroyer spaceship are getting ready to fire the beam. The plane door closed and the plane was about to move when the time is up.</p>
<p>The beam door suddenly has some electricity that looked like lighting coming out from it and going to the centre of the area where the beam shoots out. Seconds later, a greenish-blue beam shoots out and another beam shoots out immediately after the first beam. The moment the second beam touch a building, the top floor of the building blows off quickly then the next floor and the next. This explosion is a quick one.</p>
<p>The Singapore Expo blows off first then Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) 0.2 seconds later and the UOB Plaza 0.5 seconds after ACS (BR) blows off. The powerful explosion sent out a wall-like fire that destroy anything it touches and it could sent a car flying in the air doing back flips and land on the ground with a hard impact. It also sent a people flying in the air which could kill that person either instantly after it touches the wall-like fire or upon landing. The wall-like fire can move along the street faster than a cheetah and move through a building like a bulldozer.</p>
<p>The wall-like fire was moving so fast that the explosion from the UOB Plaza destroys the whole city centre and Chinatown in less than 30 seconds but the fire died out a minute later after the explosion at UOB Plaza. The explosion from ACS (BR) destroys the whole of Newton, Novena, Balmoral and part of Little India, Orchard, Caldecott and Toa Payoh before it died out two minute after the explosion. The explosion at Singapore Expo was so powerful that it last longer than the other. It destroys Simei, Tampines, Bedok, Paris Ris, Loyang, Changi and Singapore Changi International Airport. This explosion lasted for more than three minutes before it died off. At 12 33 hours, the wall-like fire nearly engulf the plane ACS (BR) and the VIPs was on after the plane take off.</p>
<p>Aran: That was a close shave.</p>
<p>The destroyer spaceship stopped shooting out the beams and closed the beam door after the explosion. They then move to another area of Singapore that was not yet destroy. The spaceship that destroys the city centre is now moving to Sentosa, the spaceship that destroys ACS (BR) is now moving to Holland Village, the spaceship that destroys Singapore Expo is now moving to destroy Kovan, the spaceship that destroys Larkin, Johore, Malaysia is moving to Woodlands and another ship was sent to Singapore to destroy Tuas. At 12 34 hours, a total of five destroyer spaceship entered Singapore. The DS at Tuas positioned itself above the Raffles Country Club, the DS at Holland Village positioned itself above Holland Road Shopping Centre, the DS at Sentosa positioned itself above the Merlion, the DS at Woodlands positioned itself above Causeway Point and the DS at Kovan positioned itself above Kovan Mall.</p>
<p>At 12 38 hours, the plane ACS (BR) and the VIPs were in saw the DS.</p>
<p>Mr. President: What the? Look at the size of that thing! It is two kilometres wide!</p>
<p>Aran: Oh dear, I hope the aliens didn’t spot us.</p>
<p>Everyone: Why?</p>
<p>Aran: ‘Cause if the aliens spot us, the DS will dispatch their cruisers and attempt to destroy us. Just like what happens years ago.</p>
<p>MM Lee: Someone tell those pilots to be careful when flying over the DS.</p>
<p>Air Stewardess: I will go and tell them right away, sir.</p>
<p>The air stewardess told the pilot the message from the MM. At 12 39 hours, the plane manage to flew over the DS.</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Thank God we’re saved.</p>
<p>At 12 42 hours, the plane ACS (BR) and the VIPs were on had an announcement.</p>
<p>Pilot: Dear passengers, in a short while, we are going to land at Pulau Sudong. Please fasten your seat belt as we are going to land soon. The principal of ACS (BR) will now speak to his fellow students and teachers.</p>
<p>Principal: Dear students and teachers, after alighting, students, please follow your teachers and teachers; please follow the NS men to the nearest building. This is the end of the announcement. Thank you.</p>
<p>Aran: Finally, we’re going to land but the battle is not yet over.</p>
<p>At 12 45 hours, the plane landed and the passengers alighted. Class 1E1’s form teacher, Mr. Syn, was asked to follow a NS man.</p>
<p>Aran: Dad, you’re here?</p>
<p>Chai Hock: Yes, son. Now, let’s go to the shelter immediately.</p>
<p>Aran: Dad, then how about Aron?</p>
<p>Chai Hock: Oh, his school is also here. In fact, almost every school is here and some schools evacuated to either Malaysia or Pulau Tekong.</p>
<p>Aran: Oh, I see.</p>
<p>ACS (BR) then reach to the shelter at 12 50 hours and they settle there. MM Lee then walks up to the stage and speaks to his fellow Singaporean.</p>
<p>MM Lee: My dear Singaporean, the aliens from another world attacked us again. The trained army will protect us from the aliens but we still have to worry. The DS may travel to this island and destroy us all. So I want all of you to co-operate and move to your respective Shelter Area in an orderly fashion. I do not want anybody to get hurt, you understand?</p>
<p>Everyone: Yes.</p>
<p>MM Lee: Good. Now all of you should receive a slip of paper by now. This slip of paper shows your shelter area. When I dismiss your school, quickly go to your shelter area immediately. ACS (Primary), (Junior) and (Barker Road), go to your shelter now. Geylang Methodist ……</p>
<p>Aran: Shelter Area SA12? Where is that place?</p>
<p>NS Man: Sir, please follow me to SA12.</p>
<p>Aran: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>NS Man: You’re welcome.</p>
<p>And the students go to their Shelter Area. Aran then enters his Shelter Area and in that Shelter Area, he spot Aron, Brandon and Kai Kein.</p>
<p>Aran: Aron, Brandon, Kai Kein!</p>
<p>Aron, Brandon &amp; Kai Kein: Aran! We’re so glad to see you.</p>
<p>They, and the others roommates, spend the day in the Shelter Area.</p>
<p>9th August 2006, Tuesday, Singapore, 01 00 hours</p>
<p>At 01 00 hours, everybody on Pulau Sudong heard a loud explosion. They quickly rush out of their Shelter Area and they saw the explosion from Sentosa, Holland Village and Tuas. The explosion from Tuas destroyed Tuas, part of Tuas South, Gul and Tengeh before it died out three minutes later. The explosion from Holland Village destroyed the whole of Holland Village and part of Commonwealth before it died out two minutes later. The explosion at Sentosa destroyed the whole of Sentosa and Pulau Brani and part of Keppel, Harbour Front, Labrador, Bukit Merah and Mount Faber before it died out two minutes later. The explosion at Woodlands destroyed the whole of Woodlands and part of Kranji before it died out two minutes later. The explosion at Kovan destroyed the whole of Kovan, Serangoon Gardens, Hougang, Sengkang and Paya Lebar and part of Punggol, Yio Chu Kang, Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Toa Payoh, Kallang, Geylang, Seletar, Lorong Halus and Kaki Bukit before it died out five minutes later.</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Damm those mother fucker. They destroyed most of Singapore.</p>
<p>Brandon: I agree, and try not to say that, okay?</p>
<p>Kai Kein: Whatever.</p>
<p>The DS from Tuas is now moving to Jurong Island, the DS from Woodlands is now moving towards Yishun, the DS from Kovan is now moving towards Jurong West, the DS from Holland Village is now moving to Geylang and the DS from Sentosa is moving to a southern island of Singapore called Pulau Sudong.</p>
<p>At 06 50 hours, the SAF then received a message from the USA Air Force. The message says:</p>
<p>Dear Singapore Air Force,</p>
<p>We, the US Air Force, are now going to the Mother ship of the DS using their cruiser. We will give a message if we successful disabled the Destroyer Spaceship’s shield. But once the DS shield is disabled, prepare for an alien vs. human battle on air.</p>
<p>Good luck,</p>
<p>The US Air Force</p>
<p>By 07 00 hours, all DS in Singapore should reached to their next destination and prepare to shoot out the beams. The people on Pulau Sudong were already awakened and they had already assembled at the assembly area. PM Lee then walks to the stage and announce to his fellow Singaporeans.</p>
<p>PM Lee: My dear Singaporeans, today is the 9th of August and we are supposed to celebrate our nation’s independence, but those aliens visited Earth and destroyed our happiness. Now, if the US Air Force managed to disabled the Destroyer Spaceship’s Shield, we will fight back and destroy those DS. Today not only we celebrate our nation’s National Day, but we also celebrate our world’s Independence Day!</p>
<p>And his fellow Singaporeans cheered after the PM Lee’s speech. At 09 00 hours after the people on Pulau Sudong had taken their breakfast, the SAF fighter plane’s pilots had already lift off and the whole bunch of fighter planes prepared to launch their missiles at the DS. At 09 07 hours, the SAF received the message that the DS’s shield are down. The SAF then gave the message to the fighter plane’s pilot to launch their missile at the DS.</p>
<p>One of the pilot aiming at the DS located above Pulau Sudong launch one of its four missiles at the DS. The first missile hit the DS but only its shield. That same person then launch another of its missile and this time, it was a………HIT! The others then launch their missile at the DS. At 09 09 hours, the cruisers then dispatch from the DS and started to return fire. At 09 15 hours, the DS beam door opened and the pilot knows what that means. Their plan is to fire at least one missile at the part where the beams shoot out. The only problem is that only one fighter plane has only two missiles left and the other planes do not have any missiles.</p>
<p>That fighter plane launch one of its missile but that missile hit the beam’s door and not the part where the beams shoot out. He then launches his other missile but that missile is jammed. Now he has only one thing in his mind, to die for his country. The beam door suddenly has some electricity that looked like lighting coming out from it and going to the centre of the area where the beams shoot out. That fighter plane with the missile then quickly rushed to the area where the beam shoots out.</p>
<p>The beam then shoots out and touches that fighter plane. The missile exploded instead of destroying Pulau Sudong, it destroys itself. The DS then crashed into Selat Pandan (Pandan Straits), a strait of Singapore, and the people of Pulau Sudong cheered. By 09 45 hours, all DS from around the world was destroyed and by 10 00 hours, the Mother ship of the DS exploded into smithereens. By 10 15 hours, the battle between the aliens and the humans ended and the Earth was saved once again.</p>
