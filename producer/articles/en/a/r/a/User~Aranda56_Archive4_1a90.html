<p>Hi, Jaranda. I just want to thank you very much for supporting my RfA, and to say also that I hope I'll make a good job of it. I'm supposed to be working on an assignment at the moment, and had been reducing my Wikipedia activity, so delayed thanking people, but I'm finding the new rollback button so easy to use that I'm just keeping Wikipedia open on my browser while working on other things, and I thought I'd like to thank at least a few of those who supported me while I'm here. Cheers. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:02, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd prefer if you would wait a few more weeks before you nominate me.</p>
<p>First, I want to make sure your RfA passes. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_Admin_c8e2.html" title="User:Idont havaname/Admin">One of my user subpages</a> says that I'd prefer to be nominated by somebody who's already an admin, so I want to make sure that you are one before you nominate me. Some people would oppose me if I went against that, or if I changed that page to get around a rule I had made for myself before. It looks like your RfA will pass this time, though. When I added my support vote a few minutes ago, I had an edit conflict with another editor who was giving you their support.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>Also, I have finals in two weeks, so I won't be editing as much during that time. Because of that it would be hard to keep up with an RfA, in case anyone has additional questions to ask me. I already spend a lot of my time here mediating for two editors at <a href="../../../g/o/t/Talk%7EGothic_metal_78d0.html" title="Talk:Gothic metal">Talk:Gothic metal</a> (they've also posted a lot of messages on my talk page), so trying to keep up with that and an RfA would take a lot of time away from studying for my exams. After finals, I'll be here for about 4 days, and then I'm going out of state for Christmas for about a week. While I'm away, I probably won't get to edit very much. I'll post a message on my user page about that, so that no one freaks out or lists me at <a href="../../../m/w/_/WP%7EMW_6ee3.html" title="WP:MW">Missing Wikipedians</a>.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>When I get back, everything should be good to go! Thanks again for asking me about being an admin; that's a job I've wanted for a while now.</p>

<p>I removed the frame inside the infobox for aesthetic reasons. The only reason for a frame around the image is to include a caption... and the caption that was there consisted only of his name. Did you "subst:" a template to make this, or do it all by hand? I would recommend using a standard template of some kind, to reduce the likelihood of errors caused by somebody editing the Steve Nash page. â <b><i><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/"><font color="#006000" title="User:Freakofnurture">F<small>REAK OF</small> N<small>UR<sub>x</sub>TURE</small></font></a></i> <small>(<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freakofnurture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freakofnurture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><font color="#006000" title="User talk:Freakofnurture">TALK</font></a></span>)</small></b> 22:33, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>He could probably make a video based on footage recored before his death.</p>
<p>Besides which, the song is featuring Biggie (presumably then, also with audio recorded before his death), but that doesn't necessarily mean that he's in the video. I didn't revert the edit based on the fact that i dont know <i>anything</i> about the validity of the statement, but i just thought id point out that it IS possible.<a href="../../../j/f/g/User%7EJfg284_447f.html" title="User:Jfg284">jfg284</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/f/g/User_talk%7EJfg284_403e.html" title="User talk:Jfg284">you were saying?</a></sup> 00:13, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>When we've got something that's as obviously garbage as the old version was, could you please wait until after the old article gets deleted before creating the new one? If I vote to keep the article as it now stands, then the old garbage article is permanently available in the edit history. That's not the proper procedure in a case like this -- you actually have to delete the hoax article first, and <b>then</b> you can write up the baseball player. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:13, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hi Jaranda,
<p>Thanks for voting to support my RfA. I wasn't expecting an unopposed promotion (I thought I'd hit some die-hard edit-counters at least) and I'm touched by the trust shown in me. I'll try my best to continue to earn that trust. But first, I'll have to work on not sounding like a politician; that last sentence was awful. Oh well. Let me know when I screw something up with the shiny new buttons. â<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 05:41, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I noticed that you put in an AFD for Eglug just above mine for Skybluz, so I was hoping that you could help me to fix up mine. I put mine in because Skybluz was deleted last week by unanimous vote and then was recreated. I am not 100% sure if it is a speedy, as I don't know if the article content is the same, and it seems to have been written by a different author (although it might just be a sock puppet). Nonetheless, when I followed the instructions for how to relist it, it didn't tell me how to avoid it being listed as the same vote. As it stands, it looks like the vote has been closed! Do you know how to fix this? If you do, please can you help to fix it?

<p>Thanks for your vote and kinds words of support on my RfC...I came to visit your talk page, and noticed you seemed to be having a bit of trouble getting the markup to do what you wanted it to (my interpretation at least)...I added another <b>subst</b>ed {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7EClear_a0ad.html" title="Template:Clear">clear</a>}} tag after your vandalism box up top, and that took care of it...unless you actually <i>wanted</i> your "<b>My</b>" to be on the righthand side of the vandalism box. <a href="../../../t/o/n/Image%7ETongue.png_7663.html" class="image" title="Image:Tongue.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/c/c4/Tongue.png" alt="Image:Tongue.png" width="22" height="22" longdesc="../../../t/o/n/Image%7ETongue.png_7663.html" /></a> Not to kibbitz too much, but if I might suggest something for the future...to make your talk archives' histories more accessible, what I do when I archive pages is <b>move</b> the talk page to the archive location and then remove the redirect so that the new talk page and its history are both clean, making sure to cut&amp;paste any ongoing discussion to the new talk page (this obviously requires a bit of good judgment regarding what should and should not be moved, as well as when is a good time to move stuff around!) ...this works equally well for article talk as well as user_talk pages (although on article talk pages, it's best to be somewhat verbose at the top of the "clean" talk page and the bottom of the "archived" talk page, regarding what's happened to discussion some might (disagree with your view, and) regard as still ongoing...) <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 18:48, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aranda, you and I both know you have poor grammar and spelling... do you by chance have a learning disability? If not perhaps you might want to look into being examined/diagnosed, I have several friends who are diagnosed <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyslexia.html" title="Dyslexia">dyslexics</a> and they tend to have many of the same spelling/grammar issues you do. In particular I am referring to <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysgraphia.html" title="Dysgraphia">Dysgraphia</a>. Just thought perhaps if I brought this up, you might have better luck and an RFA result change next time. &#160;<a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkivar_1b76.html" title="User:Alkivar"><font color="#FA8605"><b>ALKIVAR</b></font></a><a href="../../../a/l/k/User_talk%7EAlkivar_a34a.html" title="User talk:Alkivar">â¢</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/f/f1/Radioactive.png/18px-Radioactive.png" alt="" width="18" height="16" longdesc="../../../r/a/d/Image%7ERadioactive.png_1d91.html" /></a> 03:38, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that Alkivar makes a very good point here and since you are in such a bad school this could easily slip under the radar. I have a friend who is dyslexic and went to Harvard. It has nothing to do with intelligence or lack of it. Clearly you are intelligent. By the way, I don't think you are emotionally unstable I would just rather see you get some more experience editing articles. And I really do think it will help you after school, more than you can ever imagine.</dd>
<dd>Busting vandalism is in your comfort zone. I think you are ready to move out of your comfort zone. I would be happy to help you with ideas or research strategies. This is exactly what you should be getting from your school. It's a crying shame that you get let down by the education system this way. Any way, after the nasty remarks on your page I just wanted to drop by to make sure you don't take it too personally. I respect your work here a lot. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 05:12, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed that the image has no source. The uploader of the image, Nick Tzolov, claims to have taken it. I contacted him asking him to place the correct tag on it (releasing it to the public domain) and he replied saying he would do it, but hasn't done so yet (this was months ago). What do you think we should do about this picture? I'd really like for it to stay in the article, because it's awesome. Should we add the tag ourselves? He has a contact address where it can be confirmed. What do you think? -- <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../p/r/u/User_talk%7EPRueda29_6db3.html" title="User talk:PRueda29">Ptalk29</a></small></sup> 01:38, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am, quite honestly, glad that you decided to stay with Wikipedia. I honestly hope there are no hard feelings over my concerns that I raised in your RfA. I still have a very high opinion of you as a fellow editor on Wikipedia -- an opinion that has not changed since your RfA. If nothing else, I strongly encourage you to keep working, improve as best you can in the areas that I pointed out, and give it another shot down the road. I have little doubt, in my mind, that you will make a good Admin when the time is right. Hopefully, when that time comes, I will be there to throw my support behind you. Until that time, keep editing, keep working hard, and please try to take my comments in your RfA as constructive criticism. Best of luck! --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_Osterman_083d.html" title="User:Martin Osterman">Vortex</a> 18:25, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi JAranda,</p>
<p>Personally, I think it's a shame that spelling essentially defeated your nom. There are plenty things an admin can do that don't require good orthography, and prewritten templates for the most important communications. I have asked the closing B'crat for some explanation, given that Luigi succeeded with a comparable percentage at the same time you were denied. Anyway, don't be discouraged, and I'll be happy to nominate you anytime you like.&#160;:) Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:57, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow, I can't believe your RFA failed again. I don't think you should have to wait until you reach 10,000 edits to become an administrator. You're a great vandal fighter and that's mostly what an admin does. I don't think it was fair that people opposed simply because you have bad spelling or grammar, those things can easily be fixed and no one's perfect after all. If I were you, I'd ask for it to be reviewed or placed back for a revote.</p>
<p>As for the pic, I'll delete it and remove it.

<dd>This has been repeated several times now. The major problem was grammar not spelling. If you read Jorge's writing you'll notice that the syntax in some sentences is very confusing. Another common comment here is that one does not need to be able to spell to be an anti vandalism admin. Personally, I think Jorge should be aspiring to more than just fighting vandalism. Quite a few people were trying to encourage him to edit more rather than just revert. Also the reality is that very few admins ONLY revert vandalism. Communication is a reality in wikipedia, it is important. It is also important in the real world.</dd>

<dd>Jorge take the advice and start getting stuck into editing. The more you write there more you will improve.

<li>I think the 10,000 mark is way too high to try again. Rather than focus on the number of edits, I would first wait three months until the next nomination. Most importantly, I think many people would gladly support you if your use of English was better than it currently is. I mean this in the friendliest of tones, as this is a suggestion and not an attack. Your use of English as your primary language will have a very large effect throughout your life. Here on Wikipedia you're seeing just one outcome of as yet insufficient English skills. In real life, the outcomes are going to be much more significant. Your school may suck, but it is your responsibility regardless of your situation to do the best you can to be the best you can. Having better English skills is part of that, and will go a long way towards a prosperous life.

<p>Hi, Sorry it didn't work out this time round and hope you will hang on in there with us - I'd say in 3 months time with a bit of attention to English you'll be a shoo-in. May sound a long time but it'll pass. Also it may feel like people were being very picky about spelling etc but I guess an encyclopedia depends on English and a musician who missed a lot of his notes would be drawing a lot of flack too. As a practical suggestion, why don't you take a few of the most common comments you make (I don't know what - <i>Reverting vandalism by ...</i> or <i>Please don't bite the newbies</i> or whatever) and put them into a text file so that you can just paste them straight into wiki and there's no spelling needed?</p>

<p>Regarding your recent removal of the Paramounts Arts Center picture in the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashland%2C_Kentucky_63e6.html" title="Ashland, Kentucky">Ashland, Kentucky</a> article:</p>
<p>If you're asking where the source of image is, it looks like it came from <a href="http://www.kaht.com/multiple/mountainmusictrail/paramountarts.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.kaht.com/multiple/mountainmusictrail/paramountarts.htm" rel="nofollow">The Kentucky Arts Heritage Trail site</a>. I'm guessing you removed it since we have no permission to use the image? Fair enough. *wry grin* If I can convince my mom to make use of the digital camera we gave her for Christmas, perhaps we could get some legal pictures up there of PAC and the park. -<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanDuggan_af73.html" title="User:SeanDuggan">Fuzzy</a> 21:44, 9 December 2005 (UTC) (a former Ashland native)</p>

<p>I see your nominated for a potential position at the December Esperanza elections. Just wanted to remind you of something. Before when you left Esperanza, someone, or you, put you under the former members list. If your thinking of running for a position at Esperanza you might want to readd your name to the current members. <a href="../../../s/w/d/User%7ESWD316_5e06.html" title="User:SWD316">SWD316</a> 23:09, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My read of the results is Keep for <i>Contemplating Reiko</i>, and Merge for <i>Reiko Mouryou</i> (note that at least two people who voted Keep also commented elsewhere in the debate to supporting a merge of <i>Reiko Mouryou</i> into <i>Contemplating Reiko</i>).
