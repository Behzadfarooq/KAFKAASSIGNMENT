<p>The Arabic numerals (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) are used worldwide. They were popularized by the arabs, but were originally used by the early phonecian traders.</p>
<p>The phonecian numerals represented the count of angles in each of their symbols. For example, 0 has no angle; 1 has one angle, 2 has two angles, 3 has three angles etc.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.orthohelp.com/number.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.orthohelp.com/number.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthohelp.com/number.htm</a> to see what these symbols look like.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is real or not, but I've read the same in other sources. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkunicorn_25e4.html" title="User:Pinkunicorn">Pinkunicorn</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The "number of angles" theory is old, and proven wrong. For one thing, the modern numerals are derived from a set of symbols that look quite different in places -- and they don't follow the angle rule. So much for that.</p>
<p>The Phoenician comment is completely out to lunch. There's no doubt these days that they were invented in India, brought into Arabic society, and that then the variety of them used in North Africa were picked up by Italians, from where they spread into the rest of Europe.</p>
<dl>
<dd>More likely by the Spanish? <a href="../../../m/f/c/User%7EMfc_c18a.html" title="User:Mfc">mfc</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>If no-one else fixes this one up I'll have a crack at it myself when I get a chance. I've a couple of scholarly works on the history of Arabic numerals in the bookshelves somewhere. -- <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Drye_7d5e.html" title="User:Paul Drye">PaulDrye</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Truth is simple and consistent. It is my belief in life. Just like E=mc<sup>2</sup>. When I found the angle counts theory on the web, it was so simple and consistent that I didn't doubt its validity. I was really interested to know how to disprove it. I know there were many scholarly papers on the topic, but who can tell if those scholars even tried to fit this theory into the other findings.</p>
<hr />
<p>You prove it wrong by showing that the original numbers from which the modern numerals evolved don't follow the angle rule. The original Brahmi numbers don't look a heck of a lot like the modern ones, and only started looking like they do now after many, many regional variations as they migrated west.</p>
<p>People make the mistake of thinking that the modern numerals were imported wholesale from India, which isn't correct. The concept of zero and the positional system were, but the symbols themselves changed over time. The last number to start looking like itself ("5") started looking like that only after it reached Europe! If you're reading a medieval or early renaissance document and you see what looks like an upside-down lower-case letter "h" -- like an open-topped "4" with a round cross-stroke instead of a straight one -- you've got yourself a "5". The Eastern Arabic symbol for "8" looks just like the symbol Western Europeans use for "7".</p>
<p>Another proof is that at least one symbol ("2") has a simpler explanation. In the Brahmi symbol set it looked like "=". Two cross-bars, unattached, which has an obvious origin for meaning "2" --hint: "1" was written as "-". There are then examples of other scripts derived from the Brahmi one, Marathi for example, where all that has happened is that the writer didn't lift his pen between writing the first crossbar and the second one. "=" turns into "z" and from there it's a short jump to "2".</p>
<p>There are many, many numbering systems -- dozens -- that evolved from the Brahmi system, and there are enough remaining documents that you can trace most of the systems through time and space as the characters change shape. The angle theory implies that they sprang from the forehead of some mathematician like Athena out of Zeus, and have never changed since. That's clearly not the case.</p>
<p>(Can you tell that I found my references?) --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Drye_7d5e.html" title="User:Paul Drye">PaulDrye</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The illustrations at <a href="http://www.orthohelp.com/number.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.orthohelp.com/number.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthohelp.com/number.htm</a> were quite convincing. All the counts do match the respective symbols. But those symbols may be just made up to fit the theory. Was phonecian real? How do their numerals look like?</p>
<hr />
<p>The Phoenicians were the people who invented the alphabet, in Lebanon around 17-1500 BC. They didn't use anything resembling Hindu-Arabic numerals, though.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Phoenecians actually started using numerals quite late. In all their early inscriptions (i.e., everything before about 800 BC) they were in the habit of writing the numbers out in words: "Fifty six", not "56".</p>
<p>When they did start using numerals, they borrowed the system used by a number of other peoples in the area. The units are very basic: just vertical hash marks. Three lines for "3": |||. Seven lines for "7", like |||||||. Ten was represented by a horizontal line: "-". "=" for 20, and so on. Interestingly, when the "don't bother picking up the pen" thing kicked in here, the symbol for "20" started to look like a "2" and "30" started to look like a "3", but that's just because similar basic symbols were being used for 2 and 3 in Brahmi. Once you get past "4" and "40", there's no similarity between the signs.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the Phoenicians <b>had symbols for 10, 20, 30...</b>. It was not a positional system. It was basically just Roman numerals with different squiggles. You had a special symbol for twenty instead of writing 2-tens 0-ones like we do. This is just like hundreds of other number systems, and not at all like the one the Indians invented. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Drye_7d5e.html" title="User:Paul Drye">PaulDrye</a></p>
<hr />
<p>One of the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_numerals.html" title="Chinese numerals">Chinese numerals</a> system is positional. Yet, the Hangzhou numerals contain three special symbols for <b>10, 20, 30</b> only for shorthand. No shorthand beyond 30 though. So the use of symbols for 10, 20 etc. can coexist with a positional system. I love wiki wiki, I am learning alot through this type of exchange. Thanks guys!</p>
<hr />
<p>I cannot see the Tamil numerals even in Clearlyu. They come out as squares with question marks. Then there are the Thai numerals, which are different, and the Gujarati numerals, which are mostly like the Devanagari ones except that Guji 9 looks more like Guji L than Nagari 9. Can someone make a graphic chart? -<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierreAbbat_a2d0.html" title="User:PierreAbbat">phma</a></p>

<p>I removed the chart below. First of all, it's <i>way</i> to self-serving, havinf names and URL on the image itself, which really isn't appropriate here.

<p>I edited the following text from the "Arabic numerals" page</p>
<dl>
<dd>In Japan, where the western numerals and alphabet are widely used, the arabic numerals are known as "romanji". Confusingly enough, this translates roughly as "Roman numerals" which conventionally has another meaning altogether.</dd>
</dl>
<p>See "<a href="../../../r/o/m/Romaji.html" title="Romaji">romaji</a>"; it is "roman characters" (cf. "<a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanji.html" title="Kanji">kanji</a>", or "chinese characters").</p>
<p>---mikkalai</p>
<dl>
<dd>This version was incorrect and the next edited version was incorrect as well. Even if it was corrected, "how to say 'roman numerals' in language X" is simply not interesting enough to be included in the article so I removed it. That sort of information is better fit for dictionaries, not an encyclopedia. —<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokek_9e29.html" title="User:Tokek">Tokek</a> 16:51, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I don't think the sentences '"The leftward most digit of a number has the greatest value; this is the most logical arrangement if the number is read from right to left, which is how Arabic is read. However, for those accustomed to reading from left to right, it is less than ideal."' are correct.</p>
<p>Having the most valuable digit on the left means you write that one (the most important first). And, in fact, people writing in Arabic start writing from the right (of course) but when they get to a number then guess how long it will be, leave a gap, then write the number from left to right... <a href="../../../m/f/c/User%7EMfc_c18a.html" title="User:Mfc">Mfc</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>From what I've heard, <i>Classical</i> Arabic said teh equivalent of "two and thirty and three-hundred", thus, the method of writing the smallest digit first would make sense for them <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENik42_afcf.html" title="User:Nik42">Nik42</a> 08:15, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I removed the following sentence from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Early varieties of West Arabic numerals often use the symbol "4" to represent the number five with some other symbol to represent five (often a loop), or had the glyph of the four digit rotated 90 degrees clockwise.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>It doesn't make sense as it stands. It would make sense if the second "five" were replaced with a "four", but that doesn't mean that it would be true. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 12:22, 9 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>In the article it is mentioned:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Theorists believe that this is because it becomes difficult to instantaniously count objects past three.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Which theorists? Is there a cite? Sounds like a "common sense fact" that may not actually be a fact. 01:26, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>We seem to have leap-frog revert problems on this page.

<dd>a) you tried to islamize or arabize this page by changing ethnicities of individuals in articles, b)you outright deleted mentions of key authors c) you entered false information confusing the works of al-kindi with the the works of Al-Khwarizmi d) you conveniently move the references to Hindu-numerals out of sight at the end of the article , no doubt scheduled for a quiet future deletion in the future. e) you obviously do not know your facts on this topic. --Weder4 18:47, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No! I did not make any of those changes. All I did was correct grammar and mis-spellings, and set up a 'History' section. There are many people editing this article. Please check the history of editing.</dd>

<p>If others have made bad edits, please correct them .. one at a time -- but reverting over multiple edits just messes up everyone, and makes no progress.</p>

There is no need for consensus for breaking off part of the article into a subarticle, especially if it is done so in order to maintain order on the main article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article name</span></h2>
<p>I have an important question regarding the name of this article. Why should this page not be moved to <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numerals_48fc.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a>, given the fact that this is how all other encyclopedias (e.g., <a href="http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9367121" class="external text" title="http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9367121" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Britannica</a>) name the article, and this is how it is referred to in modern academic papers. Even on the internet, most sources (e.g. <a href="http://scitsc.wlv.ac.uk/university/scit/modules/mm2217/han.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://scitsc.wlv.ac.uk/university/scit/modules/mm2217/han.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) refer to the numerals as Hindu-Arabic numerals. Even in this article itself (including the controversial new additions), Hindu-Arabic is used all the time. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 07:50, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you call something "controversial" you have to provide evidence that there's a real, reputable controversy. Just because something proves that your biases led you to false and distorted beliefs and you don't like it does not mean it's "controversial", it just means that you were in error, as you had been and as you still are. I have demanded many times that you prove that the additions I made, which reported the scientific consensus and cited reliable sources, were "controversial" by citing evidence. You have not done so. Until you do so I demand that you shut up about it, because I'm not interested in your original lies. Get your sources, and then we'll talk. You should understand that this site - Wikipedia - has policies and you are expected to abide by them; the edit box states in clear terms that "Content... must be based on verifiable sources." Why aren't you abiding by wikipedia policies that "content must be based on verifiable sources"; <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia: Cite sources</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>? Because you know your content consists of original lies.

<dd>I refuse that. I refuse redirects from this article, and especially so given the history of strong biases shown repeatedly by those proposing such redirect. This article is about the Arabic numerals and should remain so, in particular the Arabic Western Numerals; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The Indian Numerals article should be about the Indian numerals, Devanagari and others, १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९, and *NOT* about the Arabic numerals. I wish to redirect all those Hindu nationalist editors on this page to the Indian numerals one because it needs serious work on what should really be its topic. I have made distinction between a numeral system (Hindu-Arabic numerals) and a specific numeral script (Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari, etc). There should be a page for the Hindu-Arabic numerals system that makes mention and links to the various numeral scripts within it, but this Arabic Numerals article should remain to its topic. <a href="../../../c/s/s/User%7ECsssclll_6d0f.html" title="User:Csssclll">csssclll</a> 16:20, 11 December 2005 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Beside this Indophobic rant, do you have any other <b>reasonable</b> argument on why wikipedia should not follow the academic norms about numeral system naming conventions? This article is about numeral system and not a numeral script, a topic which is generally covered in the script articles (eg in <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_script.html" title="Arabic script">Arabic script</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devanagari_script.html" title="Devanagari script">Devanagari script</a> etc). I won't mind renaming it as Arabic numeral script or Arabic numeral symbols, and having an another article called <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numerals_48fc.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a>, with the page <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals.html" title="Arabic numerals">Arabic numerals</a> serving as a disambiguation page. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 16:29, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps we ought to create an article entitled something along the lines of Alternative views on Arabic numerals and move User:cssscll's additions there and then provide a link. If it is a valid alternative view of the history and development of the numerals, it can stand on its own in that article to be evaluated and picked over by thousands of Wikipedians.</p>
<p>I think this approach is currently the best course of action in order to end this constant reverting. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 17:03, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds good. I still think User:cssscll is confused between a <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numeral_system.html" title="Numeral system">numeral system</a> and numeral symbols. He admits that the numeral system is "Hindu-Arabic", while the symbols are Arabic, and I think that's fine. Numeral symbols come packed with a script, and in India itself there are about a dozen variants that look quite different. These symbols are all discussed on the corresponding script pages. This whole series of article here is about numeral systems (see the template on the right of the article.) This article is supposed to (as it did until last month) talk about the Hindu-Arabic numeral system as contrasted to the Roman, Maya or Greek numeral systems. There are dozens of symbol sets that are used to work with this numeral system. We can write a section in this article about the various symbol sets employed to use this numeral system. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 17:16, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we please stop this stupid edit war, especially <a href="../../../p/o/v/Wikipedia%7EPOV_fork_3de8.html" title="Wikipedia:POV fork">POV forks</a>, which are explicitely prohibited by Wikipedia policy? This article is called "Arabic numerals". I don't care what anybody believes about their history, I don't care what their real history is, I don't care if thy came from Mars. <i>Arabic numerals</i> in English are (a) 0123456789 and (b) the numerals actually used by Arabs. There is plenty to write about these symbols without referring to their history. And that is what this page should be about.</p>
<p>I am deleting the POV fork and reverting this article into its last version when it actually described its subject. If the name for the history page that I used is inappropriate, by all means, go and move the page to a more appropriate article (maybe <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numerals_48fc.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numerals">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a> which is now a redirect here?) and <b>continue this debate there</b>. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 17:20, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zocky - I'm attempting to the same thing you are; end this dispute. Note that my fork of the article was not an attempt at a POV fork (which is a guideline, not policy) so much as treating that user's contributions as possibly having some merit and giving them a place to develop instead of shutting them out. If the history article is the more appropriate place, then chop up his contributions and put them there and get rid of the article I created.</dd>
<dd>I don't see anything wrong with creating a sub article to deal with this problem <b>temporarily</b>. I don't support using POV forks as a long-term method of handling the type of information in the article, but I do see it as an effective mechanism for ending this edit-war for the time being. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 17:24, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks like there are two parallel (but mixed up) discussions going on here. What I am talking about is not history at all but about the name. I shifted the history talk on the history page with the hope that here we can concentrate on the present. Isn't this series supposed to be about <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numeral_system.html" title="Numeral system">numeral systems</a> and isn't the numeral system called "Hindu-Arabic" and not "Arabic" which refers to the symbols.

<dd>Finally some progress&#160;:) I think that the series box may be what's causing the problem.

Can we call it <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_5a2e.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numeral system">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a> to avoid misunderstandings like this in the future? The word <i>numerals</i> means <i>symbols used to represent numbers</i>.</p>
<p>BTW, what made everybody decide that exactly this article is the right one to discuss the whole of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system? We also have <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_numerals.html" title="Indian numerals">Indian numerals</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmi_numeral.html" title="Brahmi numeral">Brahmi numerals</a> in this series, both of which are just as (in)appropriate for that purpose. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 18:14, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think there is just a misunderstanding. Most of the "&lt;type&gt; numerals" articles just give what the numeral system is and a brief overview. The history and origin of the numerals is certainly important; but the article giving the discription of what are known as "Arabic numerals" to most in the English-speaking world probably isn't the best place for that. Take a look at the other articles on numerals to better understand this. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 18:20, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sure! No problems. Actually, the confusion stems from the fact that while for example the Roman numeral system corresponds to a unique set of symbols (and so both can be covered in the same article), for the Hindu-"Arabic" numeral system, there are many symbol sets. I guess it would be fine to call it <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system_5a2e.html" title="Hindu-Arabic numeral system">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</a>, as long as the numeral systems table is on that article, the table itself is modified to link to that article, and the Arabic numerals article has a disambiguation line pointing to that article.

<dl>
<dd>To answer <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a>, the reason we ended up discussing all this here is that what is known as "Arabic numerals" is a specific symbol set used to work with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, but the table on the right classified it as a numeral system on its own right. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 18:26, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Maybe include both <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals.html" title="Arabic numerals">Arabic numerals</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_numerals.html" title="Indian numerals">Indian numerals</a> in the template as sub-items of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, to make them more accessible. Alternatively, make a new series box for articles about numerals as glyphs.</li>
<li>We may consider the possibility that various additive systems which basically use 27 letters of the local alphabet to represent 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 20, 30 ... 90, 100, 200, 300 ... 900, are all variations of the same numeral system, especially those that have a common origin. But since articles on them are short and already interlinked, it may not be worth the effort.</li>

Despite user <a href="../../../c/s/s/User%7ECsssclll_6d0f.html" title="User:Csssclll">csssclll</a> behaving in an inappropriate manner, I don't see how his concerns were addressed. His factual changes were supported with <b>valid references to academic papers</b>, and, correct me if I'm mistaken (I couldn't find it anywhere), but none of those who disagreed with him have provided reasonable proof that his research is incorrect. Instead of his points being addressed, they have been side-stepped, and he has been ignored based on his aggressiveness rather than invalid/valid (?) points.

<dd>His concern was, from what I collect, the emphasis on the Indian origins of the "Arabic" numerals. This was due to a misunderstanding about whether this article is about numerals (the symbols) or the numeral system itself. As suggested above, we are planning to have a separate article on the numeral system, and letting this article focus on the symbols. Apart from this, I think user <a href="../../../c/s/s/User%7ECsssclll_6d0f.html" title="User:Csssclll">csssclll</a> had some other issues with <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstriolok_2c26.html" title="User:Astriolok">Astriolok</a>, which has little to do with the problem I was discussing, and which probably they can resolve on this article once both of them are unblocked. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 02:50, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He did a complete revamp of the history section, which had been stable atleast since I've seen it (May 2005.) The reason he cited for this revamp was that the earlier article was false anti-arab propaganda by Hindu nationalists etc, despite the fact that Indian editors had hardly made any contributions to that version of the article. His new edits were disputed by other editors. I haven't seen the authenticity of his sources myself (i am not really concerned much with the history part), but I can see that many of his edits do not conform to the established theory of origin of both the numerals and the numeral system. His sources probably constitute recent theories that are yet to be accepted by a broad community of historians. This debate can however go on, and is not going to be affected by the disambiguation solution arrived at above. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 03:49, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since this is being discussed, I read some of his references. I felt that he quoted many of his sources out of context, picking a line or two that suited him best, and leaving out the rest.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arabic Numerals, what are they?</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a>, Everyone, I suggest the following text:</p>
<p>"This English Language version of Wikipedia article describes and discusses the topic "Arabic Numerals" as defined by standard English Language dictionaries, where it is defined as "Of or pertaining to Arabia or the Arabians. Arabic numerals or figures, the nine digits, 1, 2, 3, etc., and the cipher 0."<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=arabic+numerals" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=arabic+numerals" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It therefore limits description and discussion to the numeral symbols (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 0,) known in the English Language as Arabic Numerals, as well as other Numeral symbols used by the Arabs, such as the Arabic-Indic Numerals."</p>
<p><br />
There already is a page for the Hindu-Arabic Numeral System, There's a page for Indian Numerals, I therefore feel it's reasonable that this article should limit itself to Arabic Numerals as defined above according to an English language dictionary. The article should make references to other Wikipedia articles as appropriate, but should remove all needless information and leave that to other Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>Discuss please. <a href="../../../c/s/s/User%7ECsssclll_6d0f.html" title="User:Csssclll">csssclll</a> (22:51, 13 December 2005 (UTC))</p>

<dl>
<dd>Because Wikipedia should not be limited by other sources does not mean it cannot emulate other sources. Webster decided to segment the number system into different subsections. What we should be discussing/questioning is if the organization that Webster chose to use would be more appropriate in Wikipedia. The fact that it is Webster and not XZY's homepage does suggest that it could possibly be a good organization of content. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrogular_c9a5.html" title="User:Frogular">Frogular</a> 01:16, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This being the English Wikipedia, I think the main issue is what would've been the intent of an English speaking or English reading person when looking up the term "Arabic numerals". Dictionaries are good enough guides to the common usage and meaning of terms, and I really doubt that an average person, in fact, most users of the English Wikipedia, would be intending to look up Devanagari or Tamil numerals when they search for "Arabic numerals". I therefore suggest we restrict this to the Western numerals (1, 2, 3...), which I suspect will be the case for the vast majority, and the Arabic-Indic (Arabic Eastern) ones. It doesn't mean we only write about what would be in a dictionary of course, we can write about them a whole lot more, it just means that we remain focused on them.

<dd>Sure. As you may have noticed, I actually prefer this "revised version" I think you linked to (Peyna's), as evidenced by my edits and reversions, over the other one. This "revised version" though could do with some improvement, I feel most of them would be resolved by limiting the topic to what the term "Arabic numerals" means in English, namely, the numerals 1, 2, 3.... and also those used by the Arabs (Arabic-Indic), but mostly 1, 2, 3..., this would be a good start, and I'll go over the rest of it as you requested over the next couple of days or as time allows.

<dd>If you look at the definition carefully <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=arabic+numerals" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=arabic+numerals" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, it defines "arabic numerals" as "the nine digits, 1, 2, 3, etc., and the cipher 0." This excludes any other Eastern, Western etc. variants. "Of or pertaining to Arabia or the Arabians" is the definition of "Arabic." The way the software for this dictionary is designed is it gives definitions for all possible subsets in the word string. So the page mentioned defines both "Arabic" and "Arabic numeral." I request everyone to please verify all such purported "references" personally. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 01:52, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I also noticed that sloppy reference, but it's still useful to establish what the word "Arabic" means. We have another problem here, and that is that "Arabic numerals" is both an expression that means something else than the sum of its words (i.e. 01234567890), and a regular adjective+noun combination, where it means exactly the sum of its words (i.e. numerals used by Arabs).</dd>
<dd>Maybe we should have a separate article for Eastern Arabic numerals, or maybe we should just write this one clearly to explain both kinds.</dd>
<dd>All that said, there is no definition of Arabic numerals that includes numerals used in Indian scripts, e.g. Devanagari. The only such definition that I could find on the web, in fact, is the one from the old version of this article. See <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=define%3A+arabic+numerals&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=define%3A+arabic+numerals&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> for a sample.<a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 02:55, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I think we should write this one clearly to explain both kinds. After all, the page is about Arabic Numerals. It should make clear that the common meaning of Arabic Numerals refers to the standard 0123 stuff, and include Eastern Arabic numerals as a less common/known type. -<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrogular_c9a5.html" title="User:Frogular">Frogular</a> 04:51, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. I agree with Zocky. Numerals like Devanagari do not belong here.

<dd><b>2</b> is fine with me too, though some things need to be modified. e.g., it says "The Arabic numeral system has used many different sets of symbols." That should go. The article should focus only on symbols 0..9, and maybe a line or two about other Arabic versions of symbols will be acceptable.

I have no problem in saying that the term "Arabic numerals" was originally a misnomer, for example back in the days of Fibonacci and early Europeans who were exposed to them, but the 1, 2, 3, 4 numerals are indeed the Arabic numerals, and they are "visually distinct" from the numerals used in India. <a href="../../../c/s/s/User%7ECsssclll_6d0f.html" title="User:Csssclll">csssclll</a> (01:28, 15 December 2005 (UTC))</dd>

This fact clearly appears in his own favorite reference <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>.

<dd>I agree; actually I see cccsslll and Astriolok/Vertaloni being guilty of this (here and in other edits) where they will cite a source or the same source as someone else and take it out of context enough or ignore part of what the source says and then include some weird version in an article. Personally, I don't prefer either version; I've been going back to what might be called "cccsslll's" version because it is most closely reflects the consensus that this article should only deal with the numerals, not the numeral system or the history. It is certainly in need of extensive editing, but is the closest to the consensus that we reached. Other editors already started cleaning up that version and then some other editors decided just to go back. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 16:12, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, the term "misnomer" is misleading, since it implied "wrong name"; and it is really more of a misleading name. The term "Arabic numerals" by its words might suggest that the Arabs are the origin of the numerals; however, they simply passed the numerals onto Europeans, and Europeans called them Arabic Numerals because that is where they got them from. I also find it hard to believe that they were never "widely" used by Arabs if the Europeans found them useful enough to adopt.</dd>
<dd>The introduction should simply state what the numerals are (0-10). There should be a disambiguation at the top explaining that the article is about 0-10 and not numbers used by arabs and provide alternative articles the person may be looking for (such as the numeral system). Then there can be a small section on "origin" which points to the main article on history and provides a little background. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 16:15, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure, I won't stick to the word misnomer in spite of the fact that the term is considered misnomer. But there is no excuse not to mention in the first line itself that these symbols (0..9) are <b>preferably</b> refered to as "Hindu-Arabic numerals", and are also referred to as "Hindu numerals" and "Indian numerals", although colloquially they are called Arabic numerals for historical reasons. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 16:47, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then this article should be called "Hindu-Arabic numerals" and "Arabic numerals" should be a disambig. I still think the grounds for calling it a misnomer aren't all that great. To the Europeans, the numbers came from the Arabs, so they gave them their name. Thus the name is correct in that it states that the numbers came to the Europeans from the Arabs. It's only an "incorrect" name if you insist that a name must only point to the original origin of something and not an intermediary. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 19:52, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It is a fact that the term is called misnomer by a significant number of people, and our job here is to report that fact, irrespective of whether we agree to it or not. From the very beginning, in fact, I am proposing that if wikipedia has to be correct academically, the article should be called "Hindu-Arabic numerals" and "Arabic numerals" should be a redirect. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>)
<dl>
<dd>I can agree with the redirect; we discussed this before, but I don't recall the conclusion. The fact that a lot of people call it a misnomer does not make it one; we can mention that a lot of people call it a misnomer and provide a cite to information demonstrating that. Just because a lot of people call something something doesn't make what they call it a fact, it only makes the fact that they called it that a fact (confusing enough?) <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 22:07, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&#160;:) I understand what you are saying. It would be okay with me to say that "some people" call it a misnomer to qualify the statement. There are no academicians who are aware of the history of these numerals, and still insist that "Arabic numerals" is not a misnomer. The use of the word "misnomer" is a minor point, however, and a redirect will more appropriately redress the inaccuracy. We didn't conclude on the redirect discussion last time. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 22:19, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

These numerals are known as <i>Arabic</i> and not as <i>Hindu</i> because the Arabs learned them from the Hindus and the Europeans learned them from the Arabs. As the Arabs were astonishing mathematicians while Europe was just emerging from ages of ignorance, the founders of our western civilization simply dubbed them Arabic. Few people resorted to the <i>Hindu-Arabic</i>, more correct, term. For centuries, the <i>Arabic</i> term was more than enough to refer to those numerals, and this has since become an acquired custom, and that which was a misnomer became a traditional, proper name and is not a misnomer anymore. I feel that this misconception must be cleared, but the article does not have to be renamed for that - <b>Arabic</b> is a term in itself, by now. I suggest the inclusion of some enlightening text on the subject, such as</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The term <i>Arabic numerals</i> was at first a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misnomer.html" title="Misnomer">misnomer</a>, since they were developed by <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindus.html" title="Hindus">Hindus</a> around <a href="../../../4/0/0/400_BC_0f79.html" title="400 BC">400 BC</a>. However, because it was the Arabs who brought this system to Europe after the Hindu numerical system found its way to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Empire_bdcb.html" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a>, the numeral system became known as <b>Arabic</b>, which is now a widespread and accepted term."</dd>

<p>as something similar to what <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstriolok_2c26.html" title="User:Astriolok">Astriolok</a> suggested. -- <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubramanian_5fd1.html" title="User:Subramanian">Subramanian</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/u/b/User_talk%7ESubramanian_0843.html" title="User talk:Subramanian">talk</a></sup> 23:35, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Adding some more information. I support <b>Hindu-Arabic</b> as the <b>best</b> name, certainly. The important thing , however, is that due credit is given within the article. If the name is made proper - as Britannica has shown us it can be done without creating any confusion - so much the better. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubramanian_5fd1.html" title="User:Subramanian">Subramanian</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/u/b/User_talk%7ESubramanian_0843.html" title="User talk:Subramanian">talk</a></sup> 02:18, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

I believe the article should be named Hindu-Arabic numerals. It was well known that the Arabs learned the numeral system from Hindus. I think <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Durant_f2f2.html" title="Will Durant">Will Durant</a>, an eminient historian with his eight volume book, the Story of Civilization refers to the numerals as such.

<b>Reply to <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">User:Sam Spade</a>:</b> The google test is not a surprise. These numerals are informally and colloquially known as Arabic numerals in the West, which dominates the number of pages on the internet. As per an editor above, "Arabic numeral" is a very common abbreviation for Hindu-Arabic, but it's not appropriate in the more formal context of the title of an encyclopedia article, which should be more rigorous in reflecting academic norms. By the way, I got 38,500 hits for Hindu-Arabic numerals, but I never said at the first place that "Hindu-Arabic" is more used by common people than "Arabic." <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 00:51, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This again is the issue of a difference between a numeral system and a numeral script or symbols. There's no dispute that the Hindu-Arabic numerals is the preferred term when referring to the numeral system, but the 1, 2, 3 are the numerals widely known in English as Arabic numerals. Even calling the Arabic-Indic numerals the Indic numerals is discouraged by unicode as it leads to confusion with numerals used in India<a href="http://icu.sourceforge.net/userguide/glossary.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://icu.sourceforge.net/userguide/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. The fact remains that 1, 2, 3, 4 are "visually distinct" from the Indian numerals. Say to someone "Arabic numerals" and they'll know exactly what you mean, say to them "Indian numerals" and they'll be left wondering. For what it's worth, my personal preference is the term "Western numerals", as this is much more clear than Arabic numerals, but I refuse, wholeheartedly, to call them Indian numerals, as this is nonsensical and meaningless in general convention. I will not accept an instruction to call a man an ape because he evolved from one, a man is a man and an ape is an ape. I think editors of this article and Wikipedia should just report facts as they are and refrain from trying to change them, if a whole English and European culture calls them Arabic numerals then that's what they are to this culture, that's their name, there's no reason for revisionist activism from another culture. <a href="../../../c/s/s/User%7ECsssclll_6d0f.html" title="User:Csssclll">csssclll</a> (01:59, 15 December 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<li>As you rightly pointed out, this page is about numerals (symbols) and all discussion is about the symbols.

<li>The "google test" is not all that persuasive. There are a lot of terms that have a more popular usage, but we wouldn't make that the "official" title of an encyclopedia article. Especially when the name is ambiguous. Look at <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_American_33b5.html" title="Native American">Native American</a> for an example. A lot of people use the term as a blanket to cover all of the indigenous people of North America, but the article about that group is titled "Indigenous peoples of the Americas," which is certainly a much less widely used term, but it is used because it is the most accurate and most descriptive for an encyclopedia. You'll note that they also have articles of "Indigenous peoples of the United States," "Native Americans in the United States," and other breakdowns. Just because most people call them "Native Americans" or "Indians" doesn't meant that is the most appopriate title for the article about them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">since what are known in English as "Arabic numerals" were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs.</span></h2>
<p>I'll cut a paste from my previous objection...</p>
<ul>
<li>"... what are known in English as "Arabic numerals" were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs.", "In the Arab World—until modern times—the Arabic numeral system was used only by mathematicians. Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population."
<ul>
<li>What reliable sources do you have that they were not widely used by the Arabs? Why don't you cite reliable sources? Here's evidence that they were&#160;: The numerals though were already in wide use throughout the Arab empire, as Avicenna who was born in 980 tells in his autobiography that he learnt them, as a child, from a humble vegetable seller. He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: <i>He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.</i><a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>
<ul>
<li>deeptrivia claimed to have a good source demonstrating that they were not widely used except by mathemeticians and traders. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 03:49, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I request to see this source. I also think that "mathematicians and traders" is widely enough; for God's sake even today illiteracy in rampant even in India itself, I don't expect the illiterates in India today to be using the Hindu numerals in their writings! <a href="../../../c/s/s/User%7ECsssclll_6d0f.html" title="User:Csssclll">csssclll</a> (04:39, 15 December 2005 (UTC))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The very article you cite points out that in the Arab "business community" most people still used finger arithmetic as opposed to the numerals they learned from Indians. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 03:53, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The very article I cite points out the following "Despite many scholars finding calculating with Indian symbols helpful in their work, the business community continued to use their finger arithmetic <b>throughout the tenth century</b>"; that's the 900s!! That's in line with the following: Until Al-Uglidisi's work, written in Damascus in AD 952–953, the Indian numerals and arithmetics required the use of a sand board, which was an obstacle to their use in official manuscripts. As-Suli in the first half of the tenth Century:&#160;:<i>Official scribes nevertheless avoid using [the Indian system] because it requires equipment [like a dust board] and they consider that a system that requires nothing but the members of the body is more secure and more fitting to the dignity of a leader.</i><a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>. In his work cited above, Al-Uglidisi showed required modification to the numerals and arithmetics to make them suitable for use by pen and paper, which was a major improvement. And therefore in line with the above quote where J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: <i>He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables.

<dd>Well, it is already recognized that traders and mathematicians knew about the system. Traders were in fact the first to know such things because they came in contact with the East most frequently. Here, we are talking about widespread use of the system by common people. I mentioned even before this particular discussion started that since I don't have access to that reference any more (it was a book about history of astronomy), I would encourage others to find out citations. I agree that the above passage, which was not intended as a proof by me does not rule out the logical possibility of the numerals gaining popularity in Arabia by the 11th century. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 04:52, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a reference can't be verified by others then it's of no use; it's not verifiable and therefore not reliable. I don't know what you mean by "common people", but I think it's fair to assume that many of them, if not most, were illiterate. The above "passage" is from 662, and therefore is irrelevant as an argument against one from "the beginning of the eleventh century". We don't need to "rule out logical possibility" here, we have evidence from "the beginning of the eleventh century" that the system was "fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader", and I would consider a vegetable trader "common people", just as J J O'Connor and E F Robertson clearly do, and I wouldn't call "the beginning of the eleventh century", in any way, "modern times". <a href="../../../c/s/s/User%7ECsssclll_6d0f.html" title="User:Csssclll">csssclll</a> (05:47, 15 December 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>It seems a fairly obvious conclusion from these sources that these numerals were at some point (after the 10th century) widely used by the Arabs -<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrogular_c9a5.html" title="User:Frogular">Frogular</a> 07:08, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I find <b>serious</b> fault with this phrasing</span></h2>
<p><i>"Instead, they were developed in India by the Hindus around 400 BC. However, because it was the Arabs who brought this system to the West after the Hindu numerical system found its way to Persia, the numeral system became known as "Arabic" [1]. Arabs themselves call the numerals they use "Indian numerals",&#160;?????&#160;?????, arqam hindiyyah)."</i></p>
<p>The phrasing above as written is misleading because it seems to make the mistake of suggesting that the Arabs merely transmitted a system developed completely by the Hindus. Yes, the details belong in the history page, but the leading paragraph on the front article should acknowledge both the Indian origin and the Arab contributions and make that clear and explicit without misleading implications.</p>
<p>For example, from my previous objections:</p>
<p><br />
He notes, however, that Al-Uqlidisi's work, Kitâb al-FusÞl fî al-Hisâb al-Hindî, "the earliest extant Arabic work of Hindu-Arabic arithmetic", written in Damascus in AD 952–953, showed “this system at its earliest stages and the first steps in its development.” (ibid, p. xi.), especially so that "The manuscript claimed to have a collection of all past knowledge on arithmetic" and "a clear exposition of what was currently known about the subject". Saidan also writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Whatever the case may be, it should be pointed out that Arabic works give no reference whatsoever to any Sanskrit text or Hindu arithmetician, nor do they quote any Sanskrit term or statement.</i><a href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs13/cs13-3-lam.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs13/cs13-3-lam.pdf" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is in line with what Professor Lam Lay Yon, member of the International Academy of the History of Science, points out in her 1996 paper titled "The Development of Hindu-Arabic and Traditional Chinese Arithmetic":</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There are no descriptions of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system and the fundamental operations of arithmetic among the early Hindu treatises. With the exception of the Bakhshali Manuscript, whose date is controversial (could be as late as the 12th century), the treatises do not use the Hindu-Arabic numerals to represent numbers. Rather, numbers are generally written in Sanskrit in a terse stanza form. The Aryabhatiya, written by Aryabhata (b. 476 AD), contains a description of an alphabetic notation for numerals.(Kripa S. Shukla (ed.), Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata (New Delhi: Indian National Science Academy, 1976), pp. 3–5; S. N. Sen, “Aryabhata’s Mathematics,” Bulletin of the National Institute of Sciences of India no. 21 (1962), pp. 298–305.)</i><a href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs13/cs13-3-lam.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/ans/eastm/back/cs13/cs13-3-lam.pdf" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></dd>

<p>Until Al-Uglidisi's work, the Indian numerals and arithmetics required the use of a sand board, which was an obstacle to their use in official manuscripts. As-Suli in the first half of the tenth Century:</p>

<p>The numerals were mentioned in <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> in 662 AD by the Nestorian scholar Severus Sebokht who wrote:</p>

If those who believe, because they speak Greek, that they have arrived at the limits of science, would read the Indian texts, they would be convinced, even if a little late in the day, that there are others who know something of value.</i><a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Of prime importance in the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system is the use of 0 (zero). There are two different concepts here, the first is the use of zero as a place holder (a mathematical punctuation mark), and then as a number.</p>
<p>It should not be assumed that 0 was the invention of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system however, since the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian.html" title="Babylonian">Babylonians</a> were in fact the first known to use it. The 0 is thought by some to have come from O, which is omicron, the first letter in the Greek word for nothing, namely "ouden". An alternative theory is that it stood for "obol", a coin of almost no value, and that it arose when counters were used on sand board, so that a removed coin would leave a depression in the sand that looked like an O. Ptolemy, writing in 130 AD in his work the Almagest, used the Babylonian system with the empty place holder O, and "many historians of mathematics believe that the Indian use of zero evolved from its use by Greek astronomers".<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Zero.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Zero.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a></p>
<p>According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O'Connor, "The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876" on the Gwalior tablet stone<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Zero.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Zero.html" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science "the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD".<a href="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/sinologie/eastm/back/cs13/cs13-3-lam.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/sinologie/eastm/back/cs13/cs13-3-lam.pdf" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>. According to Menninger (p. 400): "This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land "270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden." Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression "50 wreaths of flowers" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity." The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, "Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century."<a href="http://members.aol.com/jeff570/constants.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.aol.com/jeff570/constants.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>. That's more than a century and a half after the Arab conquest of the Indus Delta region in <a href="../../../7/1/1/711.html" title="711">711</a>.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing the page I'm linking to; 'In India before the Arabs, mathematics as an independent discipline did not exist as such, and mathematicians considered themselves astronomers, for that's what mathematics were for in India, whereas for the ancient Greeks, and afterwards the Arabs, the guardians of Greek culture before the European Renaissance, mathematics existed and was studied for its own sake. Hindu mathematics, unlike Greek, lacked deduction, rigurous demonstration, proofs or derivations'. This is a very major difference, as "it was the mathematicians, rather than the astronomers, who ultimately ensure the almost universal adoption of the Hindu-Arabic numerals".<a href="http://home.c2i.net/greaker/comenius/9899/indiannumerals/india.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.c2i.net/greaker/comenius/9899/indiannumerals/india.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> Project: The history of Indian numerals Written by: Berat Jusufi, Jon-Fredrik Stryker, Vegard Larsen. It should also be noted, from the page, "It is now universally accepted that our decimal numbers derive from forms, which were invented in India and transmitted via Arab culture to Europe, undergoing a number of changes on the way. We also know that several different ways of writing numbers evolved in India before it became possible for existing decimal numerals to be marred with the place-value principle of the Babylonians to give birth to the system which eventually became the one which we use today.", which relates to the point I reported above that talk about the Indian numerals should be restricted to the nine symbols (1-9) as 0 symbol has Babylonian and then Greek origin, and the fusion of the 10 symbols was made by the Arabs. It also makes clear that there had been "changes" on the way of transmission.</p>
<p><br />
The leap to conclusion "How the numbers came to the Arabs can be read in the work of al-Qifti's "Chronology of the scholars", which was written around the end the 12th century but quoted earlier sources (see [1]): ... a person from India presented himself before the Caliph al-Mansur in the year 776 who..." is ludicrous. It's shameful. The critical fallaciousness here is stark; it smacks both of ignorance and of uneducated reasoning, in fact, lack of reasoning. The numbers were known before that, in fact, before the rise of the Arab nation, and even to the West of the Arab homeland as the quote below from a Syrian monk makes clear. In addition, the significance of the event cited is magnified multifold out of context and slanted in conclusion, as the following quote, for example, makes clear "The Romans, who took over later on didn't appreciate Euclid. There is no record of a translation of the Elements into Latin until 480 A.D. But the Arabs were more perceptive. A copy was given to the Caliph by the Byzantine emperor in A.D. 760, and the first Latin translation that still survives was actually made from the Arabic in Bath, England, in 1120. From that point on, the study of geometry grew again in the West, thanks to the Arabs." Greek Science after Aristotle, Michael Fowler <a href="http://landau1.phys.virginia.edu/classes/109/lectures/archimedes.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://landau1.phys.virginia.edu/classes/109/lectures/archimedes.htm" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. What's clear is that the Arabs had an organised infrastructure of translators, scribes, scientists and lovers of knowledge that served the world well. It's should also be clear that, as would happen whenever such a movement of extensive translation from multiple and varied sources would occur, that a lot of fusion and significant innovation would also occur that would create original knowledge, and history as documented by scientific evidence and scientific consenses, and not nationalist propaganda on wikipedia, is testament to that in cases such as that of the Arabs and of the European Renaissance. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson make this point quite well:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>We should emphasise that the translations into Arabic at this time were made by scientists and mathematicians such as those named above, not by language experts ignorant of mathematics, and the need for the translations was stimulated by the most advanced research of the time. It is important to realise that the translating was not done for its own sake, but was done as part of the current research effort.</i></dd>

<dd>The statement <i>developed in India by the Hindus around 400 BC</i> is <b>completely false</b>. You cannot claim that when the earliest dated use of the symbol 0 in Hindu sources is 870 AD. <i>Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero <b>may</b> have been known before the birth of Christ</i> - this is inconclusive. On the first count, the statement is qualified with a <b>may</b>. On the second count, it could be refering to the concept, not the symbol, of 0. I haven't yet figured out who actually developed the symbol 0 (Hindus or Arabs), but it most certainly wasn't the Hindus <b>around 400 BC</b>. -<a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrogular_c9a5.html" title="User:Frogular">Frogular</a> 07:11, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Literature written well before 9th century, that uses zero exists (like <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmasphutasiddhanta.html" title="Brahmasphutasiddhanta">Brahmasphutasiddhanta</a>), but we don't have the "original", written by the hands of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmagupta.html" title="Brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</a> himself (which is quite understandable. Text was written on leaves that last at most 100 years), therefore there is a relevance in talking about the stone inscription.

<dd>Hindu-Arabic numerals are commonly known as "Arabic numerals"; however the term "Hindu-Arabic numerals" is preferred in a more formal usage, since what are colloquially known as "Arabic numerals" were invented by the Indians. There are evidences, that an early form of the system, which did not contain a symbol for zero, was in use as early as around third century BCE. The beginning of use of zero is a bit unclear: it is believed to be added around fifth century, although the earliest existing inscription showing the use of zero accepted by all historians is dated to 876 AD in India. There are inscriptions predating this, however, from places that were not in India, but were in Indian cultural sphere<a href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>.

By 400 AD, they modified it to include a zero." The authors of this encyclopedia didn't even consider it appropriate enough to talk about the fact that some historians dispute some inscriptions.

<dd>And my childcraft children's encyclopedia told me that the Arabs invented 0-9.

<dd>From page 47:
<dl>
<dd><i>"Early Hindu mathematicians, Aryabhata (b. 476 A.D) and Brahmagupta (b. 598 A.D), do not give the expected information about the Hindu-Arabic numerals. Aryabhata's work, called Aryabhatiya, is composed of three parts, in only the first of which use is made of a special notation of numbers. It is an alphabetical system in which the twenty-five consonants represent 1-25, respectively; other letters stand for 30, 40, ...100, etc. &lt;skipping some text&gt; Another alphabetic system prevailed in Southern India, the numbers 1-19, being designated by consonants, etc."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Further down the same page:
<dl>
<dd><i>"Nor do inscriptions, coins, and other manuscripts throw light on the origin of our numerals. Of the old notations the most important is the Brahmi notation which did not observe place value and in which 1, 2, and 3 are represented by&#160;?,&#160;?,&#160;?. The forms of the Brahmi numbers do not resemble the forms in early place-value notations of the Hindu-Arabic numerals."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Alright, before Aryabhata in the 5th century, <b>symbols</b> used to represent the system were <b>not</b> nine (or ten, for that matter) symbols that looked anything like 0-9. They had 25 symbols for 1-25, and more for 30, 40, etc. The book even goes on to say that the forms of Brahmi numbers <b>do not</b> resemble the forms in early place-value notations of the Hindu-Arabic numerals.

<p>Deeptrivia, here's a little trivia for you, an <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> is a linguistic designation, and most of the time is *not* a racial designation. <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Khwarizmi_2adf.html" title="Al-Khwarizmi">Al-Khwarizmi</a>, Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi, is an Arab, regardless of where his ancestry or parents may have come from; he lived in Baghdad and worked in its House of Wisdom, he spoke Arabic and wrote his manuscripts in Arabic, and some historians, like <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Tabari_d18d.html" title="Al-Tabari">Al-Tabari</a> say he was born near Baghdad though his ancestors were from Persia. There's no contradiction in that, him being both Persian and Arab, just like someone from Sudan is both a Black African and an Arab, or someone from Algeria is both a Berber and an Arab. Here's another trivia, the "Arab" army that invaded Spain in 711 AD was ~ 4% ethnic Arabs (ie, ~96% non-Arabs), yet it's called the "Arab invasion of Spain". It really doesn't matter, if you speak Arabic, you're an Arab, and anyone from India, Malaysia or Indonesia, or anywhere else can become an Arab if they want to. This recently happened with the Comoros Islands, which is situated between Mozambique and Madagascar<a href="http://www.baycrossings.com/Archives/2003/05_June/images/June_ComorosMapwithreference.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.baycrossings.com/Archives/2003/05_June/images/June_ComorosMapwithreference.jpg" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>; it is now a member of the Arab League.

<dd>Reply to Frogular, Amir85, and Zereshk, I was pointing out to Deeptrivia what the problem was with his statement in his edit summary: "08:20, 16 December 2005 Deeptrivia (?Origins of the symbols - Al Khwarizmi is NOT Arab, Iranians will be disgusted)" Why wouldn't he be Arab? It's not known for sure that he was born in Persia, some historians say that and his parents migrated to Baghdad while he was a child, though even so it could be that, as his name suggests, Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa ibn Shakir Al-Khwarizmi, and the fact that his father was a high official in the palace, that he's of Arab origin despite being born in Persia, others - in fact, perhaps most - say he was born in Baghdad itself or near it; Brittanica itself states that he was born in Baghdad (see the first link)<a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045366" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045366" rel="nofollow">[46]</a><a href="http://iws.ccccd.edu/ebock/images/Scientists/More%20Scientists%20page%202/Al-Khwarizmi-bio.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://iws.ccccd.edu/ebock/images/Scientists/More%20Scientists%20page%202/Al-Khwarizmi-bio.pdf" rel="nofollow">[47]</a><a href="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~don.allen/history/arab/arab.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~don.allen/history/arab/arab.html" rel="nofollow">[48]</a><a href="http://www.math.umd.edu/~czorn/hist_algebra.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.math.umd.edu/~czorn/hist_algebra.pdf" rel="nofollow">[49]</a><a href="http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/people/rickey/hm/math311/al-khwarizmi.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/people/rickey/hm/math311/al-khwarizmi.html" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, but what is certain is that he had an Arabic name, Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa ibn Shakir Al-Khwarizmi, he lived and worked in Baghdad most if not all of his life, not in Persia, he spoke and wrote in Arabic, not Persian, and scholars widely consider him an Arab mathematician.

<p>It seems clear by now that csssclll is dedicated to introducing falsehoods into this article . He keep trying to give spin the numerals as an being an Arab product despite clear evidence that Arabs had little to do with the numerals , beyond a few books being written on the subject of Indian Numerals and those books then being translated into Latin by Europeans. csssclll is trying to insert the spin that the Arabs modified the glyphs , when they did not.

<dd>Yes indeed , the numerals were transmitted via the books written on the topic by Al-Khwarizmi, and Al-kindi etc and that is part of the version I support but just because someone writes a book on cars does not mean that they invented or modified cars which is clearly the implication csss wants to introduce. As far as resolving the gripes on the talk page I have had discussions on the talk page for months , some of which have conveniently been blanked out by some , others which are apparantly conveniently disregarded.

<p>I think it is fair enough to reiterate here the reasons we had originally for name change. The change in article name was done with consensus, and was based on the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Arabic numeral" is a very common colloquial term for Hindu-Arabic (so fits one of the many criteria for naming on wikipedia), but it's not appropriate in the more formal context of the title of an encyclopedia article, which should be more rigorous in reflecting academic norms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All other encyclopedias like Britannica <a href="http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9367121" class="external autonumber" title="http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9367121" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>, refer to the symbols exclusively as "Hindu-Arabic" everywhere they are mentioned. Articles in research papers and other encyclopedias (that are written by professional people who are rigorous scholars, who are paid a lot of money for their work, who are held accountable for what they write, and are peer-reviewed at many levels) exclusively use the term "Hindu-Arabic numerals".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>According to another article on Britannica, titled "The Hindu-Arabic system" <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-233818" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-233818" rel="nofollow">[56]</a>, the numerals are "commonly spoken of as Arabic but preferably as Hindu-Arabic."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Definitely preferred by scholars, e.g., as per Peter Wardley <a href="http://humanities.uwe.ac.uk/research%20papers/history/number_p_wardley/endnotes.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://humanities.uwe.ac.uk/research%20papers/history/number_p_wardley/endnotes.htm" rel="nofollow">[57]</a></li>
</ul>

<dd><i>"`Hindu-arabic' is preferred over `arabic' as a more accurate and useful description for two reasons: first, it places primacy on the region where this system of numerical representation had its origins, the Indian sub-continent; and, second, it draws attention to the difference between the numerals currently used in Arabic countries and those adopted by Europeans after the introduction of various adaptations. The latter, of course, has become the internationally accepted system of numerical representation."</i></dd>

<li>Another possibility is <i>Indo-Arabic numerals</i>, used for example by Georges Ifrah. "Hindu" numerals is not a good name, because they are not tied to the Hindu religion. ("Hindu" was once used to refer to the native inhabitants of India, but that is no longer the case.) Rather, each Indic script has its own version of what could be called <i>Indic numerals</i> - but this is a broader conception than <i>Hindu-Arabic/Indo-Arabic</i>. Call me crazy, but I think <i>Arabic numerals</i> should refer to the set of numerals used when writing Arabic. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 23:39, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Hindu-Arabic</i> is accurate. I would be against it if <i>Arabic</i> had become so standard that people would be consfused by the new term, but it hasn´t as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britannica.html" title="Britannica">Britannica</a> uses it.

<li>My position still hasn't changed. I still believe (now stronger than ever) that Arabic numerals should be moved to Hindu-Arabic numerals. We had a vote before, there is no need for another one, it should be moved staight away. It must be considered vandalism if someone now moves it back after we had a vote on it. <b><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="darkblue">D</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="teal">a</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/g/User%7EDaGizza_4a9b.html" title="User:DaGizza"><font color="lightblue">Gizza</font></a></b> <i><sup><a href="../../../d/a/g/User_talk%7EDaGizza_180b.html" title="User talk:DaGizza"><font color="orange">Chat</font></a></sup></i> <sup><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DaGizza_583c.html" title="Special:Contributions/DaGizza"><font color="gold">(c)</font></a></b></sup> 04:05, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have noticed a tendency while editing in Wikipedia of a certain number of seemingly Arab editors trying to word the text of many articles in such a way as to claim the contributions of non-arabs as their own.

<dd>There's a reason that the Greek star names are found in English in Arabicized form: Much of "pagan" Greco-Roman learning would have been lost to the world if the Arabs hadn't appreciated it and preserved it. European civilization didn't pass from Greece and Rome to Renaissance Europe; it passed from Greece and Rome to the Arabs to Renaissance Europe. Likewise, it's due to the Arabs that the Indian numbering system spread to the rest of the world. In Venice, merchants had to keep two sets of accounting books: One with Roman numerals to show government inspectors, who thought the concept of zero was the work of the Devil, and one with Arabic numerals so that they could actually be used for accounting. Arabs may not have invented these things, but the world owes them for much of its civilization. I think it's entirely appropriate to give credit where credit is due. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 23:49, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I totally agree also. Just a question to Astriolok; how could you deferentiate between an Arab editor and a non-arab?!

<dd><a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstriolok_2c26.html" title="User:Astriolok">Astriolok</a>'s statement is very serious. I don't think it should have been made without serious and <b>extensive</b> proof. No matter what a few individuals may do, every remark that fuels the fire of racial or religious prejudice should be avoided unless the facts are very much clear, and then only to take decisive and consensual action. <a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubramanian_5fd1.html" title="User:Subramanian">Subramanian</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/u/b/User_talk%7ESubramanian_0843.html" title="User talk:Subramanian">talk</a></sup> 15:09, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>The action was not arbitrary as there was a discussion that took place and consensus reached. Just because you showed up late and didn't like the result doesn't mean you can change the name back. I suggest you fix all of the redirects and wikilinks that we spent all the time fixing the last time we moved this.

We had a vote before, there is no need for another one, it should be moved staight away.

<p>According to a consensus of opinions expressed by people like DaGizza, Kwamikagami, Subramanian, Raj2004, Deeptrivia, Peyna and myself, I've reverted the title to <i>Hindu-Arabic numerals</i>.</p>
<p>I ask all participants in this debate to honor this title for the <i>time being</i>. The previous status quo was not similarly acceptable as it was completely arbitrary. This was the agreed-to title.</p>
<p>I have no intentions of undercutting this debate or increasing the heat, but simply honoring a prior decision which was taken last week.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope an administrator will watch these proceedings.</p>

<dd>Please don't speak of "consensus" when there is active disagreement that you choose to omit. The decision taken last week was esssentially Deeptrivia's (find "redirect" on this page) and acted upon in a rush and without gatheting "consensus" despite strong, clear and reasonable opposition from many editors. If there is any consensus that's worth a relevance it is the conensus amongst the English speakers en masse that 1, 2, 3 are "Arabic numerals". <a href="../../../c/s/s/User%7ECsssclll_6d0f.html" title="User:Csssclll">csssclll</a> (22:56, 18 December 2005 (UTC))</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Parting words</span></h2>
<p>Since I've been involved with this debate for awhile, I feel I ought to let everyone know I have decided to leave this debate, for numerous reasons, not the least of which is the attitude of a lot of the parties involved. First off, I entered this discussion to try to reach some kind of compromise and end the needless revert war. Instead, it has turned into some kind of ethnic/racist issue with people calling in their friends to bolster their point of view. Second, the discussion has rarely been civil. Finally, I'm tired of the reverting and lack of honest discussion. The issue needs resolved, but the current group of people have no interest in resolving this conflict. Therefore, I am withdrawing my participation in this discussion and you may ignore or make use of any prior comments I have made. Good luck, and for Wikipedia's sake, please resolve this. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 17:46, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
