<p>One area that is sure to generate editing wars is to go too far down the "purity" road when discussing Arabian breeding. There is a lot of myth, romanticism, legend, argument and emotion that crops up about this issue.</p>
<p>So, for the sake of Wikipedia, let's just not go too far down that road. How "pure" of blood the Arabian really is happens to be a very hot, controversial topic in some circles within the Arabian breed itself.</p>
<p>Emotions run high: By the strictest standard, some people argue that only something like 2 or 3 percent of modern Arabians meet the technical definition of "Asil" as propounded by the Bedouin. On the other hand, many major Arabian registries in the USA and abroad argue with equal vehemence that EVERY SINGLE registered Arabian can be traced to "pure" blood from the desert.</p>
<p>There are compelling arguments to be made for both sides.</p>
<p>What I think can come to as close to a neutral consensus view on this is as follows: a) There probably was an "Oriental" prototype that evolved in the middle east, adapted to a hot, dry climate, and existed prior to human domestication. b) The Arabian as a breed developed in relative genetic isolation, with "survival of the fittest" management, and from at least the 14th century we have strong evidence that purity of pedigree was protected with religious fervor by many of the Bedouin c) Therefore, in scientific terms, the genetic prepotency of the breed is extremely strong. d) Because the genetic prepotency of the breed is so strong, even if there might be some non-<i>asil</i> blood in modern pedigrees, the hereditary influence is scientifically and statistically insignificant. And d) getting into arguments over whose lines are "pure" and "unpure" is a quick way to make a lot of people very angry.</p>
<p>So if we must discuss "purity," let's take it out of the realm of myth, hash it out here, and not edit the article unless a consensus arises. The last thing that needs to occur here is a flame war between Egyptian, Polish and Crabbet breeders. Please!</p>
<p>The World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) has a good discussion of this issue for those who want to delve deeply into it. The organizations who are the most concerned with the "purity" of bloodlines include Al-Khamsa and the Pyramid Society. The more "inclusive" positions are discussed by the Arabian Horse Association, and with a slightly different tack, WAHO. All have web sites. Decide for yourself. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 19:22, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See below. The "Al-Khamsa" myth isn't even the same as "Al-Khamsa" designation in modern pedigrees, as I understand it. I see you created a red link on the words "Al-Khamsa," I think doing up an article on the topic is a VERY good idea, especially as this main article is already huge.<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 19:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's a blue link. It was when I started the article on <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Khamsa_1e2d.html" title="Al Khamsa">Al Khamsa</a> that I noticed the inaccuracies here.

<p>OK, I see you fixed the blue link. But let's keep the creation myths BEFORE the history section, they are just for fun, anyway.</p>

<p>PRECISELY!! It's a section about myths and legends, not intended to be part of the history section! Yes! Exactly! That's the point! You got it!!

<dl>
<dd>Yes, but the link you supplied only confirms the point that "Al Khamsa" is a designation of a <i>subset</i> of Arabian horses, <i>not</i> the entire breed. In that way your edit is misleading. I will give you time to research it and correct your edit and will look to do the same. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 20:10, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, check the last edit I made...note that I reincorporated your "Bedouin" language. If you want a further correction, post your thoughts here and we can tweak the details. But this IS the mythology section, not the history section. Please, understand that the term "Al-Khamsa" isn't being used here to talk about relative purity of bloodlines (see section below), I mean we also include the story about Ishmael's horse that fell from the sky in a whirlwind!</p>
<p>And frankly, I really, really, REALLY DO not want to get the "Al-Khamsa" fight started, because the next thing you know the "Blue List" people will be weighing in and saying that only THEY know which horses are really "Pure," then the Pyramid Society will have to weigh in saying that only THEY know which horses are "pure, at which point the CMK people will come in yelling that Skowronek "was too" a purebred, and in all honesty, Wikipedia is NOT the place! <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 20:21, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>See the expanded "Controversies" section. I hope I properly explained the position of Al Khamsa there and we can stop mucking around with the mythology section (see "Myth" discussion below). We have to keep these short, and luckily you now have a page where you can expand on the definition if need be. But if the paragraph states Al-Khamsa's position incorrectly, go ahead and fix--but PLEASE keep it short--no longer than the others, anyway! I made sure to put in a link to your Al Khamsa article too.<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 18:14, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In light of recent edits to the mythology section, shall we have a brief conversation about the issue of "Al-Khamsa" and other purity issues?</p>
<p>Let's especially not get into an editing war!</p>
<p>There is a longstanding and often fierce internal controversy between Arabian breeders over the relative "purity" of various bloodlines and whose horses are more "pure" than others. Please, let's just NOT go there in Wikipedia! If someone wants to put in some links to pages that discuss various viewpoints, we can add a FEW lines to the "controversies" section, plug in footnotes, and then let people go offsite to read about the points of view of various factions. But let's not have the Crabbet-versus-Polish-versus-Egyptian fight start here. And PLEASE OH PLEASE let's just NOT even start on the spat between "Pyramid Society," "Blue List" and "Al-Khamsa." If you want to add some links at the end, go for it, (though within Wiki policy of no personal promotion, etc...) but this article is already almost too long as it is. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 19:30, 10 August 2006 (UTC) (&lt;---- humbly begging...)</p>

<dd>Don't change history, even mythological history, just provide a source that applies it to all Arabians not just the Bedouin lines. No one is fighting - I'm just interested in accuracy&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 19:36, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it now just says "Arabian" bloodlines...I didn't put in the "Bedouin" part--was that you or someone else? But anywa,if we want to be technical about it, the Arabian Horse Association vehemently states that ALL Arabians come from pure desert Bedouin bloodlines...which I why I don't even want to go there. Am I correct that the Al-Khamsa people don't REALLY believe that Muhammad actually honored five mares? If so, then the story is a myth. (And yes, I read the WAHO article on "purity," and yes, I know that by some standards only something like 2% of all Arabians are considered "pure" by some standards...but oh gosh that spat gives me a headache.)</dd>

<p>I have temporarily removed the following sentence from the mythology section in order for there to be further discussion here.</p>
<p>"Pure descendents of these bloodlines are referred to as <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Khamsa_1e2d.html" title="Al Khamsa">Al Khamsa</a>.</p>
<p>It does not appear that anyone really believes these five horses actually existed. They are a creation myth or story. Of course, the same could be said for many human creation myths too, up to and including Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>Therefore, regardless of the status of Al-Khamsa horses today, the tale is a myth and we probably shouldn't be saying ANY horses descended from these fictional horses any more than that they descended from Ishmael's mythical steed Kuhaylah.</p>
<p>Further discussion invited. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 17:21, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The myth is likely limited to the tale of Mohammed and the mares rushing to the water. That there were "choice strains" (the five plus a couple of others) that groups have strived to preserve is easily verifiable from breeding records. It's my understanding that the myth of Al Khamsa refers only to these strains. This is consistently reported in all sources. To generalize it to all Arabians changes a specific meaning of <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Khamsa_1e2d.html" title="Al Khamsa">Al Khamsa</a>. This is actually not accurate. I see that you want to use it as a "just so" story for the whole breed, but I would suggest a <a href="../../../3/_/_/WP%7E3_69fe.html" title="WP:3">third opinion</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 23:49, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Until we get that third opinion, I am willing to live with your current version because of your correct statement that "Al Khamsa" has become a "term of art" and has a specific meaning beyond the literal translation of the term (though a couple spots are a little wordy, I may make MINOR edits). The wording makes no real difference to those who are just looking for basic info on Arabian horses and as it appearently matters a great deal to Al Khamsa. And yes, I think the whole tale is in fact a "just so" story. However, as a person who has Crabbet and Polish-bred Arabians, I personally think that is it a little offensive to claim that only Al Khamsa Arabians are "real" Arabians, but this is specifically the kind of no-win battle I was hoping to avoid. I mean, even the "Blue Star" people claim some Al Khamsa horses aren't "pure" enough for them...where does it end?<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 18:49, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Glad you can live with that. You've done a lot of good work on the article&#160;:) but it's a good exercise not to sit on an article quite so tightly. No one is claiming that there are certain "real" Arabians and others are "fake" Arabians (at least nobody here). Obviously, all are Arabians. IMO, the best ones are well-bred blends.

</ul>
<p>I always forget to sign the posts, thanks for the reminder. OTOH, it is unbelievably annoying to have my type of "pure" desert horses called a "blend." I mean, according to the Blue Star people, even Al Khamsa horses aren't really "pure." Seriously, I'd really like to see the actual criteria by which some of these organizations decide what "pure" is. According to Davenport (see _My Quest for the Arabian Horse_), you had to word your request to the Bedouin VERY carefully before their oath the horse was Asil actually was the truth--and with the wrong request they considered it perfectly acceptable to lie... But as for "sitting" on the article, check out the bullfighting thread. Or the pornographic vandalism. Or the "I love my pony/here's her picture" edits.

<li>Blend = blend of bloodlines. Of course, they are pure Arabians. Didn't mean to offend. There are distinct bloodlines in every breed of every animal.

<p>There is a lot of unsourced POV in the article. For instance, this sounds very POV and needs to be reworded, sourced or removed: "A pervasive misconception is that the refinement of Arabians means they have weak or light bone." There are other examples and I hope we can edit them to bring them more in line with policy or remove them. --<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrL_2b82.html" title="User:DrL">DrL</a> 04:36, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Tweaked the places you tagged and tried to reword or clarify and source when possible. Agreed with one bit you removed. We certainly could try some rewording elsewhere if needed. We now have what, 30 footnotes in the article? We can sure source some more! But let's first see if we agree upon where the POV problems are and if the problem is actually NPOV or just phrasing that needs work. Putting in the citation needed plugs, with useful summaries, is a good way to flag the areas of concern without resorting to wholesale edits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do suggest we discuss and tweak the potential changes here before making major edits. A collaborative effort would probably be the best way to manage this. Having owned Arabians for 30 years as well as having professional experience with other breeds, I think I have some perspective on these issues. What is your background with Arabians? Just curious (put it on my talk page if you'd rather not take up space here)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before we edit anything extensively, though, please do review the history of this article so we can have respect for the work of others and issues that appear to have been settled. In particular, read the "too positive" stuff in the Talk Archive. I'm open to suggestions on improving NPOV, and at one level would like to eliminate the "controversies" section altogether, but in light of the previous incarnations of the article, I think it is best--for now, anyway--to just keep in the preemptive strikes. Read the archived stuff and see what you think. I swear that I spent most of my early time on this article dealing with tons of NPOV critiques--both ways!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When I started reworking this piece, what was it, yikes, last March(!), there was a tremendous amount of negative POV material about Arabians in it. Prior to that, the previous incarnation had too much "all Arabians are wonderful dream horses" and other excessively positive POV nonsense. I agree that working toward fairness and neutrality is a good idea.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But please, given the Al Khamsa discussion above, let's not go on about who is on a Soapbox, eh? And, ahem, assume goodwill?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What I attempted to do by creating the "controversies" section is take a lot of that old material and address it in general terms in one spot that didn't take up too much space. I really think that discussing urban legends in detail is not a conversation that belongs in a main encyclopedia article, but given that a lot of people get all hot about things like this, a general statement seemed useful.</dd>
<dd>Sincere question--on the "light boned" piece, I threw in a cite to a problem comment in Wiki itself (want a project? Try the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_conformation.html" title="Horse conformation">Horse conformation</a> article!) I could cite to all the message boards and other sites where some idiot says Arabians are weak and have light bone, are hot-blooded and unmanagable, are stupid, dingy, or whatever. But must we? These ARE some of the pervasive misconceptions out there. I could do a google search and find you 10 examples in the first set of hits (Or, just check out a current flame war going on at the Chronicle of the Horse chat forum about half- arabs. Or, ever hang out in a hunter-jumper barn, or, for worse yet--a rodeo ropers' barn?)<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 05:55, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You improved the article a lot. I do want to mention that I am striving for accuracy, not playing favorites. There is nothing in the Al Khamsa discussion above that indicates I am on a soapbox. I don't own any Al Khamsas and I wouldn't trade any of my Arabians for any (well, maybe one).</dd>
<dd>Regarding my recent comments and edits, I just thought the article was coming off a bit too defensive (still could use a little more improvement). I actually own several kinds of horses and ponies and find the Arabians very similar in tractability to the other breeds. My one "problem" was a rescue that had been abused so I am not going to blame her for that and she is coming around. My point is that we would do the breed a service to steer away from the apologetic tone. Arabians have nothing to be sorry for. Unless a criticism is objectively verified (other than, say, an editor's personal experience) it shouldn't be in the article. Message boards are unimportant and not considered <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. When I was asking for citations, it was mainly with regards to the criticisms. In order to keep the criticisms in, there should be some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<p>I think the tone is carried over from dealing with the earlier incarnations of the article. I think it fair to look at ways to phrase things in a less "apologetic" manner, but to remove the controversies section entirely may start up another round of Arab-bashing that appears, for the moment, to have died down. There was a lot of flak for being "too positive" about Arabians, too favorable, etc...and this is a problem in several of the breed pieces--either they are written as a PR bit by the rah-rah team (I tweaked the Friesian article to remove a lot of flowery language), or they contain serious slams. (I did a partial rewrite on the Quarter horse article, it has a lot of problems).</p>
<p>Anyway, the tweaks and rephrasing is usually improving things bit by bit. There is still a ways to go before the perfect featured article is reached.<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 18:03, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Arabian horse article has been vandalized repeatedly in recent days, mostly by an unregistgered user who is upset about material in the article attributing Arabian ancestry to the Andalusian horse. Then, when this language is in there, many Arabian defenders jump in and add less-than-helpful pro-Arabian comments. Both violate Wikipedia's NPOV policy and it all needs to slow down and be debated HERE, not in the article itself. It has now been reverted twice. I have softened some mention of the Andalusian, added some citations to the article, and added yet another bit to the eternal "controversies" section to attempt to quiet this dispute.</p>
<p>May I ask that pro-Arabian folks not make inflammatory statements or even emotional "I love Arabians" statements. Please remember NPOV. Revert vandalism and be fair.</p>
<p>As for the Iberian horse fans, please do not run down Arabians. Arabian people are not vandalizing your articles, please extend the same courtesy to us. From checking out many Andalusian web sites, it is clear that some aficianados of that breed dispute the presence of any "Arabian" blood in their animals. Conversely, Arabian aficionados claim that the pure, documentable Bedouin Arabian exists in every light breed of horse.</p>
<p>However, this is not an issue that needs to be fought about. No one anywhere wrote down pedigrees to any great degree -- at least, none that can be traced from then to the modern day -- until about the 13th century at the earliest. So, prior to the High Middle Ages and Renaissance, we really can only await DNA research to know the details. The rest is at best educated theories based on historical research, skeleton studies, and occasionally legend and myth.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that oriental horses of the desert, whether called "Arabian" or not, obviously spread about the world at different times in history. There is room to debate how much "oriental" or "Arabian" blood came to the Andalusian breed only via an ancient influx by proto-Arabians to the Barb or in part from Bedouin Arabians in the 8th century, but the only real debate is a question of when and how much and within how many generations, a question that only sequencing of the horse genome can answer for good. Aside from that, we have history, archaelology and palentology.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> studies indicate that modern Barb and Iberian horses have intermixed at some time in history, especially via mares. So DNA alone can't detail which came first, but obviously they crossed. Similar comparison studies have apparently not been done on Barbs and Arabians.</p>
<p>However, it is pretty clear that most light horse breeds of Europe were created from more than one original proto-horse source, whether through natural breeding or with human guidance after domestication, and quite likely, both.</p>
<p>Oriental proto-horses, the ancestors of Arabians, were light and agile, developed for a desert climate, not adapted for a colder, European climate. Tarpans are the proto-horses drawn on the caves of Southern Europe, animals that were shorter-legged and less agile than the Oriental horse. The "forest horse," adapted for a cold, damp climate, existed in northern Europe and was the ancestor of the modern draft horse. The Andalusian itself in type and conformation clearly shows that all three types contributed to its development. Only question is when. Here is the most likely path:</p>
<p>1) In the Ice Age, there may have been a land bridge across Gibralter that would have allowed desert-adapted oriental horses and Tarpan-type horses of southern Europe to interbreed in a climate within the adaptation range of both. This may have been the first time oriental and European horses crossed.</p>
<p>2) While Iberian horses are spoken of by ancient Roman writers, remember that ancient Europe had seen invasions from North Africa via Carthage. If Hannibal brought over Elephants, certainly not native to Europe, he obviously brought trained war horses as well. Inevitably, these horses crossbred with local animals, making a second, this time human-induced, influx of oriental horses to Europe. Whether the horses of the Carthaginains could actually be called "Arabian" is doubtful, but they would have been desert-adapted, oriental-type horses.</p>
<p>3) Finally, Muslim invaders took their horses with them as Islam spread from Arabian to North Africa and then to Spain. The Moors stayed in southern Spain for several centuries. Inevitably, war mares had to be replaced and would have crossbred with local animals all along the way. Stallions were not used in warfare by the Bedouin, but would have been brought into conquered areas to "improve" local stock. Thus, Arabian blood would have crossed with that of the north African horses, from the Hegira onward, influencing the modern Barb, and there is clear evidence from mitochondrial DNA that Barbs and Andalusians share some ancestry. The historical record suggests that some Moors took Spanish horses back with them to North Africa as well, and the modern Barb shows characteristics of both Arabian and Iberian horses.</p>

<p>I want to submit the following statement, but it claims there are "blacklist words" there.</p>
<p><br />
The oldest and purest of all horse breeds, the Arab is considered by many people to be the most beautiful equine animal in the world. With its refined head and dished profile, expressive eyes, high spirits and unique, floating action, it is undoubtedly on of the most exquiste of creatures. Although it has certainly been bred with great care for many centuries, its exact origins are unclear. Depictions of horses in ancient art suggest that horses of Arab type lived in the Arabian peninsula as long ago as 2,000 - 3,000BC. Like the desert tribes with whom they have lived for so long, Arabian horses became superbly well adapted to life in a harsh environment, having extreme powers of endurance, tremendous soundness and ability to thrive on the most meagre of rations.</p>
<p>More than any horse, it is the Arab which has influenced the development of equine breeds throughout the world. This Arabian influence was initiated in the seventh and early eighth AD when the folowers of Islam spread across North Africa and into Spain. The horses they took with them were greatly superior to the native stock of other lands and so began a process of upgrading, through the introduction of Arabian blood, that was to go on for many centuries and, indeed, still goes on today.</p>
<p>Pure-bred Arabian horses are now bred throughtout the world. As well as appearing in the show ring, they are particulary suited to the sport of endurance riding. In recent times, too, there has been a resurgence of interest in Arab racing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Basically, that's because the material is not NPOV--too much flowery language, etc. I had to cut out a bunch of that stuff when I did the major rewrite and cleanup of the article last March. Every time stuff like this goes in, someone else comes by and inserts things like "Arabs are too high-strung, yada, yada, yada..." the usual stuff that all Arabian owners endure... We might think Arabs are the greatest horses in the world, but at the end of the day, everyone else thinks their favorite breed is the best too, and hence wikipedia's insistence on NPOV does make sense in that light. I just finished cleaning up after a major P*****g match with some Andalusian people, who take exception to claims their horses have Arabian blood, claiming their horses are the pure descendants of horses native to the region, unchanged since time immemorial. Only way to end that fight was to toss everything about Andalusians down to the controversies section and remove claims from the body of the article &lt;sigh&gt;.<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 22:03, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Trying not to write a book about sabino Arabians. The point is that there are semantic differences of opinions between researchers and the SAHR on what is a "maximum" sabino. (Everyone but the Arabian people call a maximum sabino an almost white or pure white horse, some argue all white horses are just maximum sabinos) Also the SB1 gene is probably NOT the one that causes sabino in Arabians, it's a dominant, and two copies produce white horses, yet there are essentially no true white Arabians and the very few sabino-white arabians (somewhere between two and eleven, apparently) are far fewer than would appear with a dominantecially when sabinos were thrown out of the registry until the dawn of DNA testing, esp. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 22:02, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
