<p>As he's <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungarian_name.html" title="Hungarian name">Hungarian</a>, is his name "Árpád Élő" or "Élő Árpád"? If Élő is indeed his family name (as the article implies), I'm fairly certain his names are in the wrong order in the introduction.

<p>Why the unexplained move some time ago from Arpad Elo to Árpád Élő? That is one of the most egregious abuses of the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a> rules I have ever seen. Naming conventions in general are based on how a person/place/thing/whatever is best known in English.</p>
<p>In this case, we can just as well look at how this world-renowned person (at least in the rating system for which he is the eponym) is known in any language whatsoever, and the results would be the same.</p>
<p>Here we have an American who spent all, or at least almost all, of his life in the United States, According to the introduction of the article itself, he himself spelled his name Arpad Elo. Any chess playing he did that is remembered today was done as an American whose name was Arpad Elo; his development of the rating system took place after he had been an American for decades.</p>
<p>He is best known, of course, in connection with the <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elo_rating_system.html" title="Elo rating system">Elo rating system</a>. <i>Nobody</i> ever uses anything other than <i>Elo</i> or <i>ELO</i> in connection with that rating system; nor has anyone found any reason to add any redirects from anything other than variants including one of those spellings.</p>
<p>In a Google search for the exact phrase "Elo rating system", and excluding articles with the word "Wikipedia" to lower the effect of the usage here on the results, there are 986 hits, of which 409 of them are displayed in the results. So what do those results show:</p>
<ol>
<li>In none of them is the spelling in connection with the rating system "Élő". It is always "Elo" or "ELO".</li>
<li>Only two of those 409, in the key word in context display of the results, include the "Élő" spelling anywhere in those results, and one of them is a webpage in Chinese or some other East Asian language. That's despite the <i>Élő</i> spelling being used in the search itself. In those two cases, it is used in the name "Árpád Élő", and both could well result from the usage here on Wikipedia.</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, we also don't even have any evidence whatsoever of what the original spelling in any of his birth records or whatever in his part of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria-Hungary_d732.html" title="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> would have been over a century ago, either, even if that had any relevance to the article name itself. Not even from any unreliable source (other than Wikipedia itself), let alone any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. No discussion whatsoever of the name change other than the name order comment above which came in only recently, not related to the move much earlier, and that issue is also addressed somewhere in naming conventions; even if he had remained a Hungarian, it should be given name first in the English Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Clearly this is a misnomer. Yes, a redirect should exist from <a href="../../../%C3%A1/r/p/%C3%81rp%C3%A1d_%C3%89l%C5%91_4d11.html" title="Árpád Élő">Árpád Élő</a>, and it remains behind. It certainly should not be the name of the article, however. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 23:00, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">User:Calton</a> is trying to start irrational edit warring over the name of this article. I challenge him to provide any justification whatsoever for his move.</p>
<p>This is a copy of a message I posted on his talk page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, exactly, is the idea of moving <a href="../../../a/r/p/Arpad_Elo_c424.html" title="Arpad Elo">Arpad Elo</a> to a name nobody, ever, anywhere uses, outside an old Wikipedia listing and its clones. A move totally contrary to everything in <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a>. A name totally contrary to common sense. No, this is not another unilateral move. It is a longstanding article name, discussed without objection on the talk page. This is an American university professor and chess player, not known under any spelling other than "Arpad Elo" in any chess publications, not known under any spelling other than "Arpad Elo" in connection with his professorship at Marquette University. He is best known for developing a chess ranking system. A system that is <b>always</b>, universally, <b>everywhere in the world</b>, known as the "Elo" system, though it is sometimes capitalized as the "ELO" system, often because people don't realize it is a person's name and mistakenly think it is an acronym. Now, please move that back, or I will have to find the appropriate place for a complaint against your actions. Can you cite any <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> showing that Arpad Elo ever used any other spelling, that he was ever known under any other spelling in any chess tournament, that he was ever known under any other spelling as a professor? I bet not. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 05:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>There may be other such moves by Mibelz that are questionable: some I don't know what they should be, and they are probably best dealt with individually if anybody wants to nominate them separately.

<dd>It is just a pattern of unexplained moves done for bad reasons, exactly the sort of thing that should be considered as a group. If enough people express interest in condisering any particular ones separately, that can be done. It has been done on other multiple nominations in the past. It should only be done after the moves are first reverted, with the burden of proof of the reasonableness of the move placed on Mibelz who wants to move these from their established article names.

<li>I support in some cases the English variant (Arpad Elo for example), that is in cases where the people lived most of their lives in English speaking countries and used the English variant of spelling. In other cases I oppose (e.g. Luděk Pachman, who was not German but Czech and I myself own some books authored by him as Luděk Pachman) - then the local version should be retained. So we should deal it on a case-by-case basis, I think.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 10:45, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If it is first reverted, and the burden of justifying the unexplained move is placed on those seeking to move it, I have no problem pulling <a href="../../../l/u/d/Lud%C4%9Bk_Pachman_c024.html" title="Luděk Pachman">Luděk Pachman</a> out for individual consideration. We can just move the discussion for that particular move back to the moved talk page. But to do it any other way, in light of this string of hasty, unexplained, and largely improper moves, would not be fair. The burden of proof belongs on <a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMibelz_2c33.html" title="User:Mibelz">User:Mibelz</a>. Since Pachman published several books and they were published in more than one language, it may well be that they were published under various spellings of his name, and there is also the factor of the name under which he competed in international competitions. Then the question becomes whether he is well known in English under one of those, and whether or not there is any real cause to make the move for that or any other reason. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 14:17, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Don't mock my neurons, Gene. Make a quick search for Árpád Élő and you'll soon see that that's the correct name of that person, whether or not most have referred to him without the diacritics. I should also remind you that in the very recent past it was extremely hard to reproduce the Hungarian letter "ő" (not long ago computer fonts didn't have it) so no wonder he has been credited without it.

How would wikipedia function if every time an editor disagreed with a guideline they started a <i>poll</i> outside the guideline talk page to subvert it?

<dd>What would you have? Nobody can ever move pages? That isn't acceptable either. Or would you have it that every article can be moved once, and then that move must always be deemed correct? That's silly, too. If they can move pages, those page moves are often going to be wrong, and need to be corrected. Those guidelines do give us guidance about what the names should be. But in order to apply those guidelines, there often needs to be interpretation of the facts involved. Wibelz did not claim his moves were in accordance with the guidelines, and many clearly were not. Some not nominated here may have been justified, but no case for them was made in any discussion either. They clearly ought to remain subject to challenge. What we have here is an editor making a series of moves disregarding those guidelines, making those moves without discussion and without justification. That's why this discussion belongs here. It does not belong on the guidelines pages. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 16:37, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, you make good points about discussing it here. I know it's frustrating for an editor to try and do the right thing in a consistent way according to the guidelines, only to watch others ignore the guidelines. In this case it's clear, <i>articles about people should 1) use the most generally recognizable name and 2) be in English</i>. Since some editors don't accept this simple and clear instruction, then their problem is with the guideline and not with this particular article. That's why it doesn't make sense to argue about it here -- unless you can get them to actually read the guideline, understand it and conclude that guidelines are generally helpful and should usually (but not necessarily always) be followed. So discussing is good, but a poll in the wrong place that subverts a guideline isn't so good IMO. --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 17:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Oppose</b> any mass moves. This material falls into at least two categories. If a person moves to another country and actively changes his / her native name to something completely different, then the choice is simple: list under the new name; e.g. "George Michael", not "Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou". The "English spelling prevails" argument is also is very relevant for royalty and well-known historical figures, so "Alexander the Great" not "Megas Alexandros". However, ordinary people often simply have their names misspelled due to misunderstandings / technical limitations (e.g. printers often owned typefaces only including French and German diacritics). It is also problematic that many names have been "transliterated" / "translated" differently by different people, thus increasing the risk of more duplicate articles. Some of the examples mentioned above might be relevant for a rename but some are clearly not: E.g. Barcza never left Hungary, so there is no reason at all to deviate from the name he used all his life. Vladimir Vuković was Croatian and lived in Austria-Hungary and Yugoslavia throughout his life, so the same case with him. The most sensible solution would seem to be to examine case-by-case how people referred to themselves (naturally with the beforementioned exceptions: royalty, historical figures (Plutarch) and a very small number of modern people (e.g. <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Asimov_1d17.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>)). Wikipedia has no policy that names should actually be <i>translated</i> into English and articles about both well-known and obscure people generally use the native spelling; e.g. <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87_0fcd.html" title="Slobodan Milošević">Slobodan Milošević</a>. This practice should continue and be employed except where very strong cases can be argued for deviating.

<dl>
<dd>I simply draw the line differently than you, and I have as much right to have my opinion as you have to have yours. If a person has taken active action to change his / her native name to something different then by all means update to the most recent name (e.g. George Michael). However, most people do not do this (something which particularly applies to first-generation immigrants). Their names might often have been rendered less than perfectly in the past, very often due to technical limitations, but that is no reason to continue such practices. I have seen many bad examples of proper names with a native form transliterated through German or French and <i>then</i> transliterated again into English, resulting in very inconsistent renderings for the same persons / places and duplicate articles. Since proper names have been transliterated in many different ways throughout the ages, mixing these standards is confusing and counterproductive.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since it is often difficult to determine if / when any person in question changed his / her name, it will have to be decided on a case-by-case basis. E.g. two of the persons you mentioned lived in Hungary for half their lives and became famous there before emigrating, but merely trying to Anglicanize them will be felt by many as disregarding this part of their story. Two others never left their countries of birth, however printers with poor equipment and a "nobody will ever care about this" attitude rendered their names imperfectly when publishing some of their works. One of your examples was a German citizen but of Czech extraction. I can't help but notice that the German Wikipedia does not try to Germanize his name. Such practices are common but - at least in Europe - considered bad style. Unfortunately, it also spread into the Internet age since Microsoft was incredibly slow in adapting proper support for such characters (something that gave Microsoft a bad name among many Europeans). I honestly don't believe that you are editing in bad faith, however, I am not sure you realize how strongly such "forced" changes of personal names is frowned upon in many societies. History is full of examples of one nationality repressing the other by outlawing one language and forcibly changing the relevant groups' personal names administratively, while punishing those that dared to continue using their original names. In Europe, this kind of administrative behaviour often produced hatred between nationalities, often lasting many generations. Furthermore, both personal and geographical names often have variants very closely related, but not identical, resulting in confusion when one name is accidentally changed to another.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I should also like to point out that the English language is written in more than one way, variations that have more causes than it makes sense to repeat here. E.g. the official webpage of the European Union is clearly written by native speakers of British English, however, it does not change the native spellings for proper names using Latin-based alphabets. Most Irish are native speakers of English as well, but they don't change the spellings of Irish-based named either. I see no reason why Wikipedia should spell German, French and Spanish names the native way and Japanese names with macrons when relevant, but using a different standard for other languages also using the Latin alphabet. Ñ and Ç are not part of the English alphabet either, yet they are used all over this website and a big box of "non-standard" characters is located just below this edit window. I don't see this as an error but as a great benefit to people trying to learn these languages - in particular since the proper use of diacritics is absolutely essential to ensure correct pronounciation in a large number of languages due to both closely-related words and closely-related sounds. Using diacritics is also a great help when people try to locate more information about these persons / places. A good application of redirects can take care of the rest.

<dd>If I chose to strongly oppose something or not is up to me to decide. You seem to believe that I don't know what I am talking about. Well, I am quite comfortable knowing that many other editors have taken the same position as myself in similar debates in the past. I believe that Mibelz is essentially right in his actions here and that articles should use a person's given name unless exceptional circumstances apply. If you present proof that any of these persons are household names on par with Alexander the Great, Plutarch or similar or that these persons made an active effort to change their names, then I am willing to reconsider them on a case-to-case basis. E.g. the article on <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Borge_a330.html" title="Victor Borge">Victor Borge</a> should be located under this name since he made an active effort to change his name from <i>Børge Rosenbaum</i>. However, I see no such proof presented on this page. Unless this is established, I oppose deviations from the original names. I still see no arguments why one standard should apply for French, Spanish and German material but another for other Latin-based alphabets. I support one standard for all Latin-based material.

<dd>If this is how you interpret my vote, then I should have been more clear: I am opposing what I believe is a <i>misinterpretation</i> of said rules and guidelines (I am also keeping in mind that Wikipedia is not a book of law.) One of my own POWs does sneak in as well; I do not like seeing other nationalities offended, no matter how. I do <i>not</i> believe it is your intention to do so, however, language has been used for this purpose quite a lot of times in European history, which is why many Europeans are cautious to avoid being accused of making the same mistakes as our ancestors did. (If anybody considers my approach to be too cautious, I respectfully disagree.)</dd>

<dd>I am no expert on Hungary or Hungarian culture, but I definitely know that Árpád can only be spelled with the diacritics, since I have encountered that name many times. But why don't you make a post on the noticeboard of the Hungarian Wikipedians? We could be lucky they had a few chess buffs around. I do believe I mentioned a good reason before: Using the names people received at birth, baptism or a similar ritual is a good idea unless we have extremely good reasons to do otherwise. Why? Because a given name is a lot easier to verify rather than speculating on when / if somebody changed his or her name or when somebody achieved enough fame to be known under a new name. What about a famous person leaving Europe, settling in the U.S. for a few years, and then returning or moving to a third destination? When is he / she famous / English enough? After 1 year, 2, 10? Is citizenship necessary? Should the person have represented the new country in any way? Should he / she have worked for the government of his new country? What if the person spoke no or next to no English? Etc etc. This problem applies even more to people who never left Europe in the first place, as is the case with your Croatian examples. I have explained how I believe these policies should be interpreted but I respect if you disagree. I have neither the time nor the money to go down and buy books just to make a point. However, I still don't see any reason at all why one standard should be applied to West Europeans and a different one for North and East Europeans. This is an international encyclopedia, based in the United States and written by means of the English language. It is not an American encylopedia. I also consider the spirit of "Avoid Systematic Bias" rather significant. The number of French, German and Spanish-speaking Wikipedians is pretty high (both native speakers and foreigners). I would be very surprised if these editors had not been through this discussion a thousand times before, yet apparently reaching what seems like a consensus for naming material about these countries / nationalities. The number of East and North European Wikipedians, on the other hand, is significantly smaller. However, I do not believe that numerical differences between nationalities should justify one nation being treated differently than the other. Such an approach would go against many of <i>my</i> impressions of / hopes for Wikipedia.

<dd>Hungarians do indeed use the spelling "Árpád" for holders of that name. Here is a page on the Hungarian king of that name <a href="http://arpad.org/pages.php?menuid=8" class="external autonumber" title="http://arpad.org/pages.php?menuid=8" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and here a description of a bridge named after him <a href="http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02185/html/719.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02185/html/719.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Here is the webpage of an ethnic Hungarian MEP by that name<a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/expert/groupAndCountry/view.do;jsessionid=C1DC642E0C7B280A75E5E6FADA36399A.node2?id=28197&amp;language=EN" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/expert/groupAndCountry/view.do;jsessionid=C1DC642E0C7B280A75E5E6FADA36399A.node2?id=28197&amp;language=EN" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I am not 100% sure what the entymology of "Élő" is but it is definitely an actual name and a Hungarian word. It seems to be derived from the word for "Living". This page is about chess and uses the same spelling <a href="http://www.chess.hu/hu/ertekszamok.php3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chess.hu/hu/ertekszamok.php3" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (the column beginning with 2813) referring to his rating.

Again, I believe the Hungarian Wikipedians might have more information about him and Hungarian spelling and I still don't see any reason why the same naming standards shouldn't be applied to both West, East, North and South Europeans. In particular for those that never left Europe in the first place. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 22:26, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You asked for documentation that this was the Hungarian spelling further up this page. You also asked for "any reason" to use this name. I have presented both, more than adequately. The Hungarian links I've presented further up prove that this is indeed the Hungarian spelling of this man's name, although you claim it doesn't exist anywhere in the world (your first post on this page). I find it alarming that you try to Americanize names for people that never left their country of birth - most notably Vladimir Vuković and Gedeon Barcza - using Élő (or whatever) as leverage. A mere glance at the relevant categories prove that Wikipedia normally list Europeans under their native names, see e.g. <a href="../../../h/u/n/Category%7EHungarian_people_eb6a.html" title="Category:Hungarian people">Cat:Hungarian people</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Category%7EFrench_people_694b.html" title="Category:French people">Cat:French people</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Category%7ESpanish_people_41d2.html" title="Category:Spanish people">Cat:Spanish people</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Category%7EPolish_people_fbb1.html" title="Category:Polish people">Cat:Polish people</a>. I've suggested asking the Hungarian Wikipedians for input, but you don't fancy this option either. As long as you insist on making a mass move of unrelated articles I strongly oppose the lot. This move might go unnoticed by the general community but if you begin making mass moves of Hungarian, Serbian, Croatian, Romanian, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Faroese, Icelandic, Polish, Czech, Slovak, French or German material using a mere "English has 26 letters" argument, that will not go unnoticed. Any such action would however succeed in offending many editors and driving many of them off Wikipedia. Since you haven't answered a single one of the concerns I have listed further up this page, I see no reason to contribute further to this thread. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinian_be8b.html" title="User:Valentinian">Valentinian</a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValentinian_fb3b.html" title="User talk:Valentinian">(talk)</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Valentinian_3b01.html" title="Special:Contributions/Valentinian">(contribs)</a></sup> 23:35, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, you think that since you can point us to a foreign language page that spells the name of a long-dead king in squiggles in that language, but in that website's own English pages spells it Arpad, that some Slovakian spells his given name "Árpád", that three different people in Hungary today more than a century after our subject's birth spell their own surname "Élő", and from that we should, by some strange leap of logic, conclude that <b>combining those two spellings is undeniably the <i>true</i>, God-given spelling of this person's name,</b> and it is our duty as good Wikipedians "<u>correct</u>" a confused and obviously misguided (while he still lived) American who was <b>so god-damned ignorant that he misspelled his own name</b> as "Arpad Elo"?</dd>

Don't let doubt about the exact spelling, hold you up—just make one up out of thin air, anything to avoid the inherent ugliness of a plain vanilla English alphabet name. Additional points are awarded in inverse proportion to the likelihood that an English-speaker can create those letters, or even distinguish one from another.

<li><b>Support</b> in general. For the record, my Google search of "Árpád Élő" returned the extact same set of results as "Arpad Elo". A quick glance of the results revealed no diacritics at all. If some of the names are more commonly presented with diacritics in English publications, then I may be inclined to support the diacritics there. However, as a rule, I think we should use the spelling that is most common. Besides, this is an English language publication, and English doesn't use diacritics, it just takes the pronunciation it creates and adds it to the long list of different ways to pronounce the same letter. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 12:15, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Opppose</b> bundling of unrelated move requests. Discuss each case on its own merits and on its own talk page, please.

<li>For the record (and I don't want to speak of something I know little about, but that's never stopped me before), my understanding is that one editor undertook all of these moves at roughly the same time and without discussion or establishing consensus. If they are all related in that way, i'm OK with putting them back where they were before and then placing the burden on those who wanted to move them to where they are now (with diacritics) to establish a consensus for a move. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 14:15, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I tend to agree with this. The moves were done out of process. There should have been a discussion and concensus before they took place.

<li><b>Strong support</b> per nominator. Several of these chess players and authors are widely known in the English speaking world under the English spelling of their names, and this is the <b>English</b> wikipedia. No evidence whatsoever has been provided that Elo ever spelled his name Árpád Élő, so this cannot stand. Pachman, Benko, Vukovic, and Barcza are equally well known and in English their names are never spelled with diacritics (in Barcza's case no diacritics, but he is Gideon in English).

<p>Per the discussion above I feel that consensus is clear enough to move <i>this particular</i> article because Arpad Elo spent much of his life the USA where "Arpad Elo", without the different marks, is the common spelling. This is <i>not</i> a general precedent for dealing with such symbols in general, especially not for people who are not commonly named in English texts. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:27, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've moved the rest of the articles based on three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discussion, when discounting the ones saying "don't group discussions", was leaning towards moving them back. The move happend in mass so I see no reason not to discuss them in mass.</li>
<li>Mass moves should have had a discussion before taking place. Really, any move other than a trivial one should make some attempt to established concensus first.</li>
<li>Original moves went against <a href="../../../e/n/g/WP%7EENGLISH_6528.html" title="WP:ENGLISH">WP:ENGLISH</a>. It is one thing for the Hungarian Wikipedia to have accent marks, but they don't need to be used in article titles on the English version.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to move these articles to the non-English names please hold a discussion before moving them again. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuffOfInterest_823e.html" title="User:StuffOfInterest">StuffOfInterest</a> 15:32, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'd spare the comment on the others, but I'd say that you do have a conflict of interest, having voted in the discussion above. As an admin, I could have close this poll myself judging "no consensus", but that would obviously be a conflict of interest. Your arguments 1) and 2) have merits, but I must say I think that <a href="../../../e/n/g/WP%7EENGLISH_6528.html" title="WP:ENGLISH">WP:ENGLISH</a> is the most abused Wikipedia guideline, and seeing it pulled wherever a "diacritic conflict" emerges makes me puke.

Furthermore, StuffOfInterest had already stated his position in favor of moving the articles, so the moves were blatant own POV enforcing.

<dd>It's HIS name, his correct name. That's undeniable, any search for "Árpád Élő" will prove it. Wikipedia's accuracy should not be compromised.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 05:56, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A search for it proves nothing. About 99% or more of any results showing an "Árpád Élő" spelling are from Wikipedia, or from clones and various other sources that have picked it up from Wikipedia. It is not a spelling he ever used. It certainly is not <b>correct</b> in the sense of being the <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">proper</a> name to choose for the one slot available for an article's name. The only real question is whether or not it ever was, at any time in his life, proper to spell his name as "Árpád Élő".</dd>
<dd>OTOH, you can see with just the reliable sources cited in the article itself, that the "Arpad Elo" spelling is proper. There are no squiggles in his name at <a href="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessplayer?pid=24396" class="external text" title="http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessplayer?pid=24396" rel="nofollow">chessgames.com</a>, and there are no squiggles in his name in the book he authored, cited in the article.</dd>
<dd>I think a Texan would say that you, Husond, are "all hat and no cattle". Stop feeding us your unsupported speculation. <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">Cite</a> a published, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> showing that Arpad Elo ever used any other spelling of his name after coming to America as a child. Show us that he ever competed in a chess tournament as "Árpád Élő". Show us that he ever published a book, a magazine article, or anything else about his <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elo_rating_system.html" title="Elo rating system">Elo rating system</a> using the spelling "Árpád Élő" for his name. For that matter, cite a published, reliable source that Arpad Elo ever used any other name as a child in Hungary before coming to the United States at the age of 10. Show us a published birth record or something of the sort. Show us previously published emigration lists or something of the sort. Show us with verifiable sources that the "Árpád Élő" could ever be considered "correct" for <b>any purpose whatsoever</b>, let alone for the article title.</dd>
<dd>Note that a claim that this was his birth name was tagged as needing a citation for over a month, and never backed up.</dd>
<dd>But as <a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond">User:Husond</a> knows quite well from his involvement in a previous naming debate, even showing that an American's name has sometimes been written with diacritics is not determinative of the correct name for us to use. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 19:34, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Once again you cite the mistakes of others to justify the perpetuation of a mistake. Árpád Élő is Hungarian, he was definitely born with that name, for in Hungary you couldn't name otherwise ("á", "é" and "ő" are separate letters in the Hungarian alphabet actually). If you want to move the article then it should be you to prove that he changed his name in America just because he disliked the "squiggles" as much as you do. The fact that he was credited more times as "Arpad Elos" is, once again, easily explained by practical issues: the fact that those letters are not represented in English keyboards will naturally cause a general disregard for them. But this is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not some sloppy chess competition organizers, and we can add diacritics easily so there is absolutely no justification for your endless attempts to remove them which ultimately may severely compromise the accuracy of Wikipedia. --<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 19:13, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gene, your fanaticism was pretty obvious already, but there was really no need for you to submit yourself to derision with such comment. I mean, what kind of impact do you expect to cause? Do you verily believe that anybody would give any relevance to your personal anger against other languages? Such nationalism sounds so immature and old fashioned. Besides, wCWikipedia is pretty global, and for your concern English is spoken outside the US, so how come you decide to bring local issues to this discussion as if the US had jurisdiction over the English language? One would think that Wikipedia is the perfect place for people to broaden their perspectives by interacting with users from all over the world, but apparently that doesn't really work for you.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 18:07, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As pointed out above, the part of the new rules appears to be <b>" Don't let doubt about the exact spelling, hold you up—just make one up out of thin air, anything to avoid the inherent ugliness of a plain vanilla English alphabet."</b> Don't waste any time looking for a verifiable source, just do it and move on and do a couple dozen more in the time you would spend dillydallying to get one done.</p>
<p>Note that a claim about the birth spelling of Arpad Elo's name was tagged as needing verification for over a month without any action, and that repeated requests in this discussion for Husond, Valentinian, or anybody else to verify this <i>fact</i> with a cite to reliable, published sources are a challenge that remains unmet.</p>
<p>Here is Arpad Elo's immigration record from <a href="http://www.ellisisland.org" class="external free" title="http://www.ellisisland.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ellisisland.org</a></p>

Port of Departure:      Antwerp
Manifest Line Number:   0008

<p>Looking at the scanned actual manifest of the ship <i>Zeeland</i> (you need to register and log in to see it), you can see</p>
<pre>
Éllő, Forenenć   38  f
  "   Pál        16  m

<p>going to <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedford%2C_Ohio_ebfb.html" title="Bedford, Ohio">Bedford, Ohio</a> to "husband &amp; father Ellő Ferencs" (from separate scan of other half of page). There appears to be an accent mark on the É in the mother's name, but not in the fathers, so maybe what looks like one by the mother's is just a spurious mark from writing the name above.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have verified either "Arpád Éllő" or "Arpád Ellő" (or the inverted name order versions, as in the father's name there, still redlinks as these are) as a possible name at the time of leaving Hungary, but not "Árpád Élő", a fictitious spelling for which nobody has ever provided any specific cite to any non–Wikipedia-derived source, reliable or not) as a legitimate, verifiable version, from a published, reliable source (the ship's manifest) of his Hungarian name.</p>
<p>That still would not be the proper name for this article in any case. It is obviously not a spelling he continued to use.</p>
<p>Note that searching for the exact phrase "Arpád Éllő" or "Árpád Éllő" gets exactly <i>zero</i> Google hits. It doesn't have the dubious advantage of having been pulled out of thin air by some past Wikipedia editor. It is not a spelling ever used by Arpad Elo at a time when he did anything that people would remember him for. Nor is "Arpad Ello", for that matter (one hit to a dead page, in a long list apparently aimed at catching typos in someone's search, including a zillion permutations of doubling of any one letter in the name and getting the space in the wrong place).</p>
<p>Another little bit of evidence that none of the moving crew involved here had any real belief that Arpad Elo was actually a Hungarian in any real sense is the fact that Élő Árpád and Elo Arpad remain redlinks as well.</p>

<p>The two references presented so far for the birth spelling of Elo are; Ellő (see above) and Élô (see <a href="http://www.hhrf.org/rmsz/03aug/03082612.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.hhrf.org/rmsz/03aug/03082612.HTM" rel="nofollow">ref #1</a> in the article). They don't match the spelling of our article (someone correct me here if I'm wrong). All other examples of Árpád Élő (as our article spells it) that I've looked at postdate the Wikipedia entry or were explicitly derived from it.</p>
<p>We need to take a hard look at this to make sure reality isn't whatever some Wikipedia editor says it is. And, of course, this is completely beside the fact that Wikipedia policies for <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28people%29_db33.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (people)">article nameing</a> specify English spelling when it is the most recognizable, that the most common spelling for Arpad Elo is in English, that he spent his entire adult life as an American citizen using and publishing under the English spelling of his name. --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 05:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having Árpád Élő's birthname does not hurt its English usage. Why should Wikipedia contribute for the general misknowledge of his exact name? Plus, it's not like some editors are enforcing an incorrect name, just accuracy. I'm not a Hungarian speaker but I believe that "Ellő" is an older form of that surname (as Hungarian surname "Kiss" was simplified to "Kis"). "Élô" is incorrect, "ô" was used many times to replace "ő" when the latter did not exist in fonts. For the same reason, "Arpad Elo" occurs more often because in the US it was/is uncommon to use diacritics due to technical limitations (keyboards) and widespread misknowledge about foreign letters.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 05:49, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Apologies, my initial comment (now stricken) was based on a very careless reading of what you wrote. Everyone agrees that Elo's birthname should be in the article in its original Hungarian spelling, if in fact we can determine what that is. The problem is that Husond and others ignore policy and guidelines such as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/WP%7EENGLISH_6528.html" title="WP:ENGLISH">WP:ENGLISH</a> that won't (or wouldn't, if Wikipedia admins would correctly discharge their duties) let them have their way with article titles. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 10:07, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I agree that spelling guidelines for the English Wikipedia have been ignored here. I'm not going to fight over that. The more serious problem, and we don't know for sure that it is a problem, is the possibility that Wikipedia has introduce a fiction that has spread all over the place. --<a href="../../../d/u/k/User_talk%7EDuk_82a4.html" title="User talk:Duk">Duk</a> 16:26, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Birthname restored. Any google search returns results for "Árpád Imre Élő" as being the birthname, which is actually obvious considering that he was born in Hungary and could not have been named otherwise without those diacritics.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 16:34, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Any google search returns results for "Árpád Imre Élő" as being the birthname</i>. Two things: 1) no, it doesn't.

<dd>That is <b>not</b> clear evidence of what his birthname is. That is a late 20th century or early 21st century imaginary reconstruction just as whatever some Wikipedia editor used as a basis for the previous, in-the-same-vein, unreferenced claim of "born as" whatever. It doesn't cite any reliable sources, and it <i>does not claim</i> that this was the spelling he himself ever used, nor that it is what some official recorded on a birth certificate or on a church baptism record, or in any school records or whatever. It is just somebody's notion of a <i>standard</i> spelling under <i>current</i> Hungarian spelling rules, and not at all indicative of any of the variations that may have been used in <i>Hungarian</i> spelling a century ago or more. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 11:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Plus, there is no evidence whatsoever that precise spelling at any time is of any concern for this article.

<dd>Yeah, I agree. As for the Ellis Island records, I'm not sure if they're the most reliable. I've used them to see the manifests of my ancestors, and they've made some mistakes. We don't know for sure if whoever wrote the manifest asked them how their name was spelled. <b>However</b>, assuming that the original spelling of the name <i>was</i> Ellő, I think the best thing to do is to find the man's birth certificate... <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 21:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They are a lot more reliable, and verifiable, that some imaginary 21st century reconstruction under the state of the Hungarian language usage in the 21st century. Furthermore, what you see as a "mistake" may not have been. The notion of a "correct spelling" even today is nowhere as strong as many of you seem to think, and a century ago it was clearly much less so, and a century before that much less yet. I don't have any Ellis Island ancestors myself, since they were all in America before it opened, but I have seen many of the entries for various other more distant relatives. The transcriptions of these usually handwritten forms are clearly not reliable and full of mistakes in the actual spelling; but in this case as in most cases, you can look right at the scans of the original manifest and verify what it actually says (you won't, of course, always be able to distinguish between similar letters, the same problem the transcribers had, but with what you already know about the individuals involved from other sources, you might be able to do a better job than they did). <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 11:18, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In general, I think Duk has it right here. Wikipedia shoudl use the spelling that is most common in English language publications, as Wikipedia is in English. However, the Hungarian spellings should certainly be noted in the article. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 17:51, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not thrilled with the quality of the references that have been added, partly for the reason that Duk mentions (hard to tell if they copied the spelling from Wikipedia), but also because I'm not sure the references are very authoritative on this question and there's also the possibility that the sources simply "Hungaricized" the name from English as the sources don't seem to explicitly state that Élő Árpád was his birth name. I did however find a possible reference that I think is more promising: <a href="http://www2.geographic.hu/index.php?act=napi&amp;id=77" class="external text" title="http://www2.geographic.hu/index.php?act=napi&amp;id=77" rel="nofollow">NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGYARORSZÁG</a>. Perhaps someone here who can read Hungarian could take a look at this to see if the reference should be added. It also looks like it might have some info for expansion of the article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 23:10, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
