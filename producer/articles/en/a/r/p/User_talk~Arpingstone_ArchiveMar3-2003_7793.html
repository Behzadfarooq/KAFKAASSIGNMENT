<p>If you need help resizing or otherwise manipulating images, just post a note at the village pump asking for help. One of the best users for help with images is <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">User:Lee Daniel Crocker</a>, but he hasn't been around much since about October -- says he'll be back when he gets done settling into his new house (in California, U.S.) and the company he works for gets done with the first-of-the year tax info forms they send out (by the end of January). I can help with images in BMP, JPG, and sometimes PNG. Some of the users who post the most images use ones that are too big and/or otherwise unacceptable to a lot of us, and we spend a lot of our time fixing those (and then listening to them bitch about it), so I really appreciate your trying to find out how to do it right the first time. -- <a href="../../../i/s/i/User%7EIsis_f221.html" title="User:Isis">isis</a> 08:50 Jan 21, 2003 (UTC)</p>

Yup, Avalon, just outside <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, about 100 kilometres away from me. I'd have liked to spend a good deal longer there but was with friends who had had enough for one day and wanted to get home in time to watch the cricket.&#160;:) I must get a decent general-purpose camera one day. My Sony is excellent for macro work (I bought it to take pictures of hard drives and CPUs) but a poor tool for birds (my real love) or aircraft.

<p>Could you perhaps compress Image:Stamp.gb.diana.1981.250pix.jpg a bit? It is nearly 100,000 bytes in size but an image that size shouldn't be more than 1/10 as big. Having images that big makes it very difficult for people with slower modems to use Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a></p>

<p>Hi Adrian</p>
<p>I've been following the Great Thumbnail Debate with much interest. I'm sorry that you were initially upset by it but it looks like it is settling down well now. It made me pretty nervous about *my* thumbnails - as I am very far from an expert - but I did some experiments (using Photoshop!) and I think I'm OK.</p>
<p>I was wondering about the caption to the SSC photograph. It seems to me it has two problems, both minor - (1) it's getting a bit long and maybe some of its text would be better in the article body and (2) the bit about the viaduct on rock is (to me) slightly confusing - for a moment I thought you were saying it's a viaduct OF solid rock, when presumably the intention is that that's what its <i>foundations</i> are on - is that right? And if so is there any way it can be made clearer for even thick people like me?? What do you think? Keep up the good work, <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENevilley_0173.html" title="User:Nevilley">Nevilley</a> 11:06 Feb 23, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>This may be an impossible task, but do you think you could explain to someone who knows practically nothing about using a scanner and other technical things (i.e. me) how to put photos onto Wikipedia?

<dd>Hi Olivia, welcome. Yes, I'll do an outline of how I prepare and upload my pics but it won't be lengthy because I don't know your expertise (if any!) or your equipment.

<p>Hi Adrian. I looked at your resizing of the larger Kaprun pic. It looks excellent - I tried resizing the large one to the same dimensions as you had done and had basically identical results. I was going to ask you how you got such high quality images, but you gave yourself away in your post: a digital camera. What resolution and zooms (optical &amp; digital) does this camera have? --<a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoyes_3ec6.html" title="User:Snoyes">snoyes</a> 23:11 Feb 25, 2003 (UTC)</p>

Olivia, here's what you asked for above. I am not any kind of expert so the more knowledgeable can probably tear what follows to bits. Do so, by all means, but be gentle with me! I do know that my method produce a neat looking result on the page. This stuff is only about inserting pics with JPG extensions i.e. photographs.</p>
<p><b>HOW TO PUT A JPG ON A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE PAGE</b><br />
If you want to see examples of my work:<br />
For a scanned object look at the <a href="../../../l/a/p/Lapis_lazuli.html" title="Lapis lazuli">Lapis lazuli</a> article, the blue elephant was laid on the scanner plate, this is NOT a photograph, it's a scan!<br />
For photos from my digital camera see <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severn_Bridge_8241.html" title="Severn Bridge">Severn Bridge</a>.<br />
For a scanned colour print see <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kaprun_disaster.html" title="Kaprun disaster">Kaprun disaster</a>.<br /></p>
<p>These instructions give a good appearance on my 1024 by 768 screen. Ideally I would check the appearance at the other common screen sizes but I can’t because changing screen size puts all my desktop icons into a heap in the corner and it takes too long to restore their positions when I return to 1024 by 768! Perhaps a peculiarity of my OS (Windows ME).</p>
<p><b>PREPARE THE PICTURES</b><br />
Pictures come off my digital camera at 2048 by 1536 pixels at 700K, far too big size-wise and memory-wise for Wikipedia. The output of my Epson flat-bed scanner (if I want to scan objects or colour prints) is often even bigger than that. Those of us with 56K modems won’t wait to upload such large pics so the size has to be reduced without sacrificing too much quality. There are dozens of graphics programs for resizing and quality reduction, I happen to have the big one – Photoshop - but the power of that program isn’t usually needed for Wikipedia illustrations.<br />
My standard pic sizes are a big pic at 750 pixels wide and a little pic (a thumbnail) exactly one third of that size, at 250 pixels wide. I used 800 pixels until recently but the re-sizing produced poor quality thumbnails, the one third cut-down seems to produce better quality. If the pic is portrait format, then use a lot less width for the big pic (say, 500 pixels) or the pic may be taller than the screen. Then the reader will have to scroll down to see it all (very irritating!).<br />
The big pic should be created at a quality producing a size not bigger than 100K and the little pic not bigger than 20K (15K would be better). Make the pic name descriptive – for example: old.severn.bridge.250pix.jpg and old.severn.bridge.750pix.jpg</p>
<p><b>UPLOAD THE PICS TO WIKIPEDIA</b><br />
The two pics are now ready for upload to Wikipedia. The little pic will go on the article page and big pic can be seen by clicking on a link called “Click here for larger version” (which I put below the caption).<br />
Now upload the two prepared pics to Wikipedia by going to this URL: <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Upload</a>. This screen requires three actions:<br />
. browse to one of the two files, say the 750 pixel one,<br />
. promise that you own the copyright by ticking a box,<br />
. put in a simple title such as “Pic of Severn Bridge”.</p>
<p>Then click UPLOAD FILE and wait awhile.</p>
<p>Your pic will be uploaded (with an on-screen complaint if it’s over 100K) and the screen will ask you to “Please follow this link”. This will take you to a screen carrying the famous slogan “EDIT THIS PAGE”. Click on that and then enter your description text in the Edit box, such as who took it, where and when, and if it’s public domain. Don’t forget to fill in the summary box with, for example, “Picture of the Severn Bridge”.<br />
A typical pic description would be:<br />
“The Severn Bridge seen from the English side of the river.Photographed by Adrian Pingstone in April 2002 and released to the public domain.” (you can see this message for anyones pic by clicking on the pic).<br />
PREVIEW until happy. To keep your description text for use with the second pic, select the text and do EDIT COPY.<br />
Finally, SAVE.<br />
Now go back to the upload page URL you used earlier and do exactly the same for the 250 pixel pic.</p>
<p><b>INSERT THE PICTURE CODE INTO THE ARTICLE</b><br />
Go to the article and note the area where the pic can best go, and if best on left or right of the page.<br />
Steal my picture code, here’s how:<br />
Go to <a href="../../../s/e/v/Severn_Bridge_8241.html" title="Severn Bridge">Severn Bridge</a>, click on EDIT THIS PAGE, copy the coding by selecting it with the mouse and choose EDIT COPY. You need the stuff between (and including) the words TABLE. In the code I know that “width=270” looks odd but it gives a better clearance between the pic and the text.<br />
Then paste it down into the articles Edit Page with EDIT PASTE. Modify the left or right instruction and the file names, type in your own caption and PREVIEW. Don’t forget the Summary.<br />
Modify as often as you like, finally SAVE.</p>
<p>If you have only a small pic and no large one then you probably just delete the “Click here” line in the coding (I haven’t tried this).</p>
<p>FOOTNOTE: I have a copy of this picture code pasted on to a Microsoft Word page and saved, then I do EDIT COPY/EDIT PASTE. I think that’s easier than going off to an article to steal it.</p>
<p>Done!!<br />
Enlightened, Olivia?<br />

<p>Oh and by the way, congratulations on your very clear picture instructions above. I did something similar with the code business - wrote a "nowikified" version of it for <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENevilley_0173.html" title="User:Nevilley">my user page</a> and just copy it straight off there now, without having to put a page into edit. Lazy or what? I see you are suggesting 270 width for 250px wide graphics, something I had not thought of (in fact if you had asked me I would probably have guessed it would mess the picture up or something - duh, as they say), so I am going to look again at your stuff and mine and copy your idea if I like it! Anyway, nice one! -- <a href="../../../n/e/v/User%7ENevilley_0173.html" title="User:Nevilley">Nevilley</a></p>
