	    <p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>re the images on <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_Houses_of_Parliament_5049.html" title="Irish Houses of Parliament">Irish Houses of Parliament</a>, unfortunately italics is a disaster because one browser in one version (Internet Explorer of course, who else!) turns them particularly when small into barely legible spiderly writing. I put the captions in in the way they are because they were the only way I could get didn't produce this effect. As to alternation, I've moved some but that too is highly problematical because some images interfere with headlines. That problem occurs on some versions of netscape because it does not recognise the &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; command and so text laid out as small which work perfectly on most browsers grow to full size on <i>some</i> versions of netscape, throwing everything all over the place and indenting some headlines, as well as crashing into other images if they are anyway close. (In putting on a lot of images with captions lately I have run into those problems over and over and over again and had to avoid the practice. Unless we get everyone to collectively bin IE and netscape - and oh god I wish they would. Of all the browsers I have used they are <i>by far</i> the worst! - italics (which I love using in professional documents I lay out) is a problem and alternation of pictures needs to be used <i>very</i> sparingly, and not with the &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; commands unless there are a clear two paragraphs between a left indent and the next headline. Even then all sorts of additional problems occur. I found these problems when using IE, then Netscape as a replacement. (I now use safari which is 100 times better!) I thought it was just a problem with my version of them, but others reported that different versions <i>also</i> produced the same problems. For some reason, it seems on netscape the <i>newer</i> the version the more it tends to screw up wiki images, or so I was told when I mentioned my problems. Older versions seemed not to have a problem. As one person joked, it seems bizarre that in every version of that damned browser they produce, things get worse not better! <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 19:28 May 11, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There won't be many aircraft articles to illustrate because lots of the aircraft I photographed last weekend at Kemble (in south west England) have no Wikipedia entry. I took 360 pics (!) at the Kemble Great Vintage Fly-in Weekend where four hundred British vintage light aircraft were on display. The first one I've added is a Piper Super Cub, look at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Piper_Aircraft_592d.html" title="The New Piper Aircraft">The New Piper Aircraft</a>, which was in a hangar at the time. I used up two 128 megabyte Smart Media cards on my digital camera, each card holds 180 pictures.

<dd>I think it's perfectly reasonable, Adrian. The distinction between a DC-9 and an MD-88, as you know, is more semantic than real, and as I recall the text of the entry takes the sensble line that they should all be regarded as one big family of aircraft. So go right ahead! Nice to hear that you have lots of nice new photographs. Maybe I can get my head out of the mammals long enough to write you a type entry or two to put them in.

<dd>Thanks for your kind comment, much appreciated. I am just an amateur photographer with only a mid range digital camera but I have a firm rule that I will only put my best photos on Wikipedia and only if I have a large version as well. Nowadays, I do the big one 750 pixels wide so that an 800 pixel wide screen is not overwhelmed. The little one I do at 300 pixels wide so that text can flow down the side. The peacock was roaming free on an island in Poole harbour in south western England and was displaying to a female (not to me!)

<p>Thanks for your good work at <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifton_Suspension_Bridge_f96b.html" title="Clifton Suspension Bridge">Clifton Suspension Bridge</a>. I thought the new versions were a bit too light when I looked at them at home, but on my monitor at work they're just right and my versions are horribly dark! The 750px versions look a bit fuzzy to me (you must have blown them up from my 600px versions), so I will go back to my original scans (nearly 4000px wide), try to recreate what you've done, and we'll see whether it produces any real improvement this evening. --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>You are quite right, I should have left the big pic at 600px wide. I blew it up to 750 px which was probably not a good idea. I did the blow up because I've standardised on a 750px pic, a size that doesn't overwhelm an 800 by 600 screen and is obviously OK at higher resolutions as well. I did all the processing in Photoshop. For your interest, I've discovered that any embedded thumbnail over 300px wide can squeeze the surrounding text down to just a few words in width, on an 800 by 600 screen (I use 1024 by 768). The effect is particularly serious if the reader has their Preferences set to have a menu down the left hand side. That's why I use 300px.

Does it look Ok to you? It's definitely sharper, but is close to half the file size. Mine's not as rotated as yours, either.

<p>Thanks for the tip on portrait format, Adrian - I'd already spotted the 250 and 600 px sizes as you will see from <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Bristol_9e35.html" title="University of Bristol">University of Bristol</a>... --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, I was a little unsure about the tilt on the university tower myself. I came to the conclusion that it's close enough to the angle where the nearest vertical edge of the tower (which goes right up the middle of the picture) should appear exactly vertical, and cropped it that way. By the way, today's uploads are the product of having got up bright and early on bank holiday Monday. --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a></p>
<hr />
<p>In response to your question, I'm using Photoshop 5.0LE for Windows, which came free with some piece of kit (scanner? printer? both?). Most of my recent JPEGs have been saved with quality setting 7 and "baseline optimised" format. I have picked up a few tips from <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/images" class="external text" title="http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/images" rel="nofollow">Philip &amp; Alex</a>, of which I think the use of <i>unsharp mask</i> is the one making the difference that you can see - it artificially emphasises the edges of things a bit. When working with my own photos I also have the advantage of always cropping and rotating the high-quality original before I resize it. Hope that helps... --<a href="../../../r/b/r/User%7ERbrwr_a39c.html" title="User:Rbrwr">rbrwr</a></p>

<dd>Hi! My pics come from the following sources:<br /></dd>
<dd>My own digital photography.<br /></dd>
<dd>Long hours searching the internet using Google (I'm retired).<br /></dd>
<dd>US sources such as NOAA, NASA, Navy, Army and Air Force.<br /></dd>
<dd>The Canadian Air Force (I no longer use the Australian Air Force, I think their copyright message is too restricting for Wikipedia).</dd>
<dd>I have two photographers who let me use the pics off their sites.<br /></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That's it! The easy way to see exactly where a pic comes from is simply to click on it. I always explain, in great detail, my source.</dd>
<dd>I've added two ThrustSSC pics but got in a mess trying to correct a mistake you made. You called them Thrust SSC and Thrust 2 (which is wrong, it's <a href="../../../t/h/r/ThrustSSC_4e1e.html" title="ThrustSSC">ThrustSSC</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrust2.html" title="Thrust2">Thrust2</a>). So I made a Redirect from Thrust SSC and Thrust 2 to the correct titles but now, when I put Thrust SSC or Thrust 2 into the Search box there's no result and I can't understand what I did wrong.<br /></dd>

<p>Just out of curiosity, you seem to have been around the British aircraft biz a bit, albeit seemingly mostly on the civilian side... ever been to RAF Brize-Norton? -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">John Owens</a> 10:32 6 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I haven't been to Brize, even though it's only about 40 miles from where I live. My interest has been photography at Heathrow since I bought a digital (Olympus 3020Z) camera about a year ago. For your interest, Brize has 19 VC10s, 8 Tristars and 4 C17s. Lyenham (about the same distance from me) has 51 C130s.<br />
I love illustrating Wikipedia and I cast about endlessly over the net for public domain pics (now that I've used up all the pics I've taken myself). I won't use any poor images so it's a hard search (but fun). Luckily I've got double speed broadband (1 megabyte cable) compared to the 56K dialup I used to have (and I'm retired) so I have loads of time for the searches.<br /></dd>

<dd>Huh, the C-17s are new. I asked because that's where I was stationed for about a month during the Kosovo dust-up, working on KC-135s that went there. I definitely remember the VC-10s, since those were our equivalent there, but I'd have noticed C-17s if they'd been there then. One of the curious aspects of that time was getting visits from one of the big Antonovs, I forget exactly which one, complete with the Russian tricolour on it. That seemed a little weird.&#160;;)</dd>
<dd>Unfortunately, I'm still among the digital-camera-lacking unwashed, and to top it off, some of my prints are in storage (and I didn't have a huge store to begin with). So I'm waiting to use a friend's scanner sometime, and then I should have a couple of decent pictures to add. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">John Owens</a> 21:26 6 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hm, that's odd. I was using css to get the text smaller, but I guess IE's not picking it up. I went ahead and put it back to smaller in HTML, if you would have a look and make sure it works now that would be great. (Either css or html works in my browser; unfortunately I've done quite a few pages the css way, but I'll switch to the html tags from now on.)

<p>Hi Adrian. We have had a bit of a burst of articles about various <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck.html" title="Duck">duck</a> species recently, which of course would be greatly enhanced by images. Those that occur in N America aren't too bad because of the US Fishery and Wildlife Service public domain images, but most European species (and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandarin_Duck_5f52.html" title="Mandarin Duck">Mandarin Duck</a>) have nothing.</p>
<p>I remember you saying you had been to Slimbridge, and wondered if you had any images you could add to these articles. Alternatively, if you have images for which there are no articles, I could prioritise those species on my "to do" list. Thanks for any help you can give (incidentally, I'll be off-line for a few days after tomorrow morning, so if you reply and I don't respond, I'm not ignoring you. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 08:19 26 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adrian, thanks for your pictures in the Bremen article. Photos are doubling the value of a city article. As for the pronunciation guide, I am sorry for forgetting to leave a comment on my deletion. There are two reasons: Firstly, it is not correct; if the first syllable would rhyme with <i>clay</i>, the city would be spelled "Brejmen". Secondly, it seems to me, that pronunciation guides rather belong to a dictionary than to an encyclopedia. We don't have pronunciation guides for all the other cities and places (at least I didn't find them). So it is somewhat strange to have it here and nowhere else. If you strongly feel that a pronunciation guide for foreign language places is necessary, then we should ask the community on village pump what they do think about it. Admittedly, I'd be quite unhappy with it. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 14:28 26 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, so Bray-mun is not quite right but surely close enough for a non-German speaker! And if we don't have pronunciation for the other difficult city names then we should, such a guide is perfectly well part of an encyclopedia (and a dictionary) However, lifes too short to worry about this, you and I just have different opinions of how much the reader should be told. We'll agree to disagree, and the reader can stay ignorant of how to pronounce the title of the article he/she is reading! I won't revert you.<br /></dd>

<dd>I am sorry, that you feel that angry. That was not intended by me. I would feel more comfortable with a phonetic alphabet, since there are some sounds in foreign languages, which do not exist in English and which can't be represented in English syllables. And in my own defence, it is not, that German city names are usually pronounced in a very strange way. Like in Italian or Spanish or several other languages, pronunciation is almost identical with the phonetic alphabet. I am interested, what other Wikipedians think about a pronunciation guide, so maybe I will bring this topic onto the mailing list. -- <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECordyph_c803.html" title="User:Cordyph">Cordyph</a> 21:21 26 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I am a mild person normally but I felt strongly on this and obviously it came over that way. Thanks for your polite response to my unfriendly reply. I'll carry the discussion on just a little further please .....<br /></dd>
<dd>Wouldn't a phonetic alphabet, with its specialised symbols, be much more confusing than my simple attempt to approximate to the pronunciation <i>and</i> a key would be needed to the phonetic alphabet. How would the reader access the key? I think the issue is..... how to give a rough guide in the rare case where the assumption a reader would make on the pronunciation could be wrong. Are you aware that most English-speakers would assume it to be Bremen as in lemon? It would be good to sort the matter out so by all means discuss it further in another area of Wikipedia. Best Wishes,<br /></dd>

<dd>Although it's easy to see the good intention behind the pronunciation guide, I too feel a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcription_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Transcription (linguistics)">transcription</a> to English being a less than optimal solution, in particular as English as a mother tongue is pronounced quite differently in different parts of the world. Further I would warn against the <i>clay</i>-rhyme, as the last syllable in "clay" is a <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diphthong.html" title="Diphthong">diphthong</a> which both the English and US-Americans tend to insert falsly in their French (and sometimes in German) for stressed <i>é</i>-sounds. In my opinion both the <i>"e"</i> in "Bremen" is closer to the first <i>"e"</i> in "remedy", although the first <i>"e"</i> of "Bremen" is more than duplicated in length. Maybe some US-English pronounciations of "bear" would come close? -- <a href="../../../r/u/h/User%7ERuhrjung_40b8.html" title="User:Ruhrjung">Ruhrjung</a> 12:46 27 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, I'm afraid you have jumped to conclusions. I am not a "troublemaker."

The fact is, no real explanation was given for the removal beside that jimfbleak didn't like my illustration. He jumped to the conclusion (much like you) that it was a "cartoon" or "parody." I find this insulting. There was no good reason to remove an illustration that is perfect for that article (it's a woodpecker finch, look at the images description!). I don't know what you have against people contributing original works, but it seems to be the consensus that my illustrations are not wanted in the bird pages. <a href="../../../m/b/e/User%7EMbecker_eaee.html" title="User:Mbecker">MB</a> 14:37 27 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Adrian. Your <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow_Goose_f13d.html" title="Snow Goose">Snow Goose</a> image should definitely be first choice, preferably labelled as blue phase.

<p>Nice Shelduck pic. Common Shelduck is the politically correct version of Shelduck to avoid Eurocentricity. However, since it's a European bird...</p>

<p>Amazingly, I'd already done an article for this species, on the strength of having seen it in India. The full adult male is brighter orange, greyer-backed and the face streaks almost invisible. Adult female similar to your bird, but face less marked.

<p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>It is great to see you turning your photographic skills to the birds now. It really make a huge difference to articles to have a picture, I think - especially for fauna ones (as opposed to, say, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Belgium_a4f5.html" title="Constitution of Belgium">Constitution of Belgium</a>).</p>
<p>I thought your 250px version of the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange-headed_Thrush_eaa9.html" title="Orange-headed Thrush">Orange-headed Thrush</a> seemed a bit blurry, and remembered the 750px original looking sharper than that. On checking, I saw that it was indeed nice and sharp, so out of curiosity I shrank it down to 250px myself using PMView (my usual image editor). Compare the old:</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Orange-headed.thrush.250pix-old.jpg">Image:Orange-headed.thrush.250pix-old.jpg</a></p>
<p>With the new:</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Orange-headed.thrush.250pix.jpg">Image:Orange-headed.thrush.250pix.jpg</a></p>
<p>(Hint: look at the wing feathers.) Interestingly, the new one is also smaller: both are 24-bit JPEGs but the old is 27.8k and the new 15.8k. Riddle me this if you can! I didn't do anything fancy, just used PMView to resize at the factory default settings. There is a new version of PMView out, called PMView Pro. Just for fun, I tried that one out too,and it does even better: 15.6k and a very slightly sharper picture (probably not enough difference to bother uploading and over-writing a third time, but I can pick them apart). Anyway, it occurs to me that maybe you could benefit from a top-class image viewer and manipulator, and though I have no commercial connection with PMView, I've been using it and recommending it for years, and in this particular case the difference is very visible. It's wonderfully easay to use so you might like to give it a whirl. You can download a 30-day free trial from <a href="http://www.pmview.com" class="external text" title="http://www.pmview.com" rel="nofollow">their site</a>. (End of free plug!)</p>
<p>Best -- Tony (<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a>)</p>
<p>Ahh, yes. I didn't think it was up to your usual superb standard, Adrian. Not a bad picture by any means (I've seen lots worse here), but with the consistent quality of your photographs here on the 'pedia, you have made a rod for your own back - we all expect perfection as routine!</p>
<p>But for this particular bird, don't worry too much. They are common as mud here. If, after all the money I've just spent on photography gear, I can't come up with a nice Australian Shelduck in the wild over the next little while, I'll put the camera, the scope, the tripod, and all the accessories into a big cardboard box and post the lot over to you, then start my new career as a coal miner or something. So long as the light is good - i.e., between about 10AM and about 3PM at this time of year - I only need to get within about 50 or even 100 metres of one. Doing birds without a long lens is seriously difficult!</p>
<p>On another matter, it's really odd to hear that Photoshop of all things is doing sub-optimal JPEG shrinks. It really shouldn't do that - as you know, it's supposed to be the big banana in graphics software. I imagine that there is some sort of setting that you have to change to make it optimise a bit better, but I have absolutely no idea what! It's too complicated for me. I'm strictly a hardware man these days.</p>

<p>Wow! I'm impressed! I think I might have to download a copy of Serif Photo Plus for myself. Is it difficult to use? (Yes, I'm a computer guy, but my expertise is hardware and (to a lesser extent) strictly business apps like spreadsheets - I look at Photoshop sometimes and just groan at the time I'd have to spend to learn how to use it. As for tinkering, not at all - a bettter picture is a better picture. More strength to your arm. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<p>(PS: 50k is fine, IMO.)</p>

<dd>I'm a dunce! My favourite PMView does the sharpening thing just fine, and I've owned it for years. Never thought to look before. And, do you know, I very nearly spent $US99 to buy Photo Plus last night. In other words, I've had all the software I need to do all the things you listed on my page just now all along. Time I started using it!</dd>
