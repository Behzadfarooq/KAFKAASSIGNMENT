<p>I'm not sure about the nearby material that says they were connected "using modems": I think the link speeds were of the order of 56k, and the modems of that era were not even remotely near that speed (think 1200 bps): the links were more probably DS0 leased lines. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 09:25, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, "modem" is right - that's a generic term for a device ("modulator - demodulator") that transforms a signal in one form (in this case, a bit stream) into another form (analog signals in this case). The ARPANet modems were provided by ATT; BBN's hardware only included the high-speed serial interfaces. The lines were indeed leased special high-bandwidth lines (but I don't think the concept "DS0" existed back then), again, provided by AT&amp;T. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 20:24, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS: When I said "high-bandwidth", I meant it in the technical sense (i.e. high band-pass), not as a synonym for "high bit rate" (although of course with the former it's easy to provide the latter). <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> 21:10, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I simply don't know the details of how AT+T provided the bandwidth. It may well have been a breakout of a T1 line. I have looked through everything I have, and nothing says anything about it. I do know (from the BBN proposal, in response to the original ARPA ARPANET RFP) that the interface between the IMP and modem was two wires in each direction - a data line and a clock line. So I guess the bit recovery was done by the AT+T gear - maybe, because for all I know AT+T just carried those two signals through from one end to the other, mostly unchanged, and didn't do clock recovery at the far end of each link. Turning the bit stream into packets (framing - i.e. figuring out where the byte boundaries was, and then turning the byte stream into packets) was done by the BBN hardware in the IMPs. The AT+T "modems" (they didn't do everything we now think of modems as doing) were <b>huge</b> - at MIT (which had two AT+T lines early on, when I first became responsible for the IMPs at MIT, and a third later on) the AT+T gear was in a giant rack (about 6' high, and 2.5' square, which was mostly full of stuff). My <i>guess</i> would be that the bandwidth was provided in different ways, at different times and on different links, but that is just a guess. Sorry I can't help more - that's all I know and/or can find out. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:38, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I e-mailed Leonard and he outlined that the following was incorrect in the ((cur) (last) 08:23, 4 Nov 2004 Jumbuck m (robot Adding:id)) entry:</p>
<p>This is what was originally in the entry: "Leonard Kleinrock had performed tests on store and forward message systems in 1961, and wrote a very important book in 1964 covering queueing theory and routing in store and forward networks, although this work did not include the concept of breaking a user's message up into smaller units for transmission through the network."</p>
<p>Leonard wrote to me with the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dear Kim,</dd>
<dd>...</dd>
<dd>This is not true. In fact, in my July 1962 publication (see my website: www.lk.cs.ucla.edu) I talk about chopping messages into fixed length units and transmitting them separately over the link. That material also appeared in my December 1962 PhD Dissertation which was later published as the book that is quoted, "Communication Nets"; you can easily find the description in that book in Section 5.3. Importantly, you should note that my July 1962 publication was months ahead of Paul Baran's and years ahead of anything that Donald Davies did. Basically, what I did for my PhD research in 1961-1962 was to establish a mathematical theory of packet networks which uncovered the underlying principles that drives today's Internet.</dd>
<dd>I would appreciate it if you would correct the entry in that link.</dd>
<dd>Best of luck. Len Kleinrock</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have updated the page accordingly. However there does seem to be some dispute - so I would like updaters to consult with Lenoard Kleirock before making changes his e-mail address is at www.lk.cs.ucla.edu - it would be even better if we could get Paul Baran and Donalad Davies in the dialog to thrash this out amongst themselves - they could then propose a nice summary that would sort out any inconsistencies - So whoever wants to take this on please be my guest! -- <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Meyrick_9acc.html" title="User:Kim Meyrick">Kim Meyrick</a> 21:44, 10 Nov 2004</p>
<dl>
<dd>You need to be careful with Kleinrock's claims, because he has an axe to grind. If you read Baran's <a href="http://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.html" rel="nofollow">page</a>, which I find to be equally incorrect, Baran claims all the credit. Alas, to talk to <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Davies_f59b.html" title="Donald Davies">Donald Davies</a>, you'll need a spirit medium, because he is no longer with us. Before he died, he <i>did</i> dispute Kleinrock's claim. And, needless to say, if you think Baran and Kleinrock are going to agree on a division of the credit, well...</dd>
<dd>As to the 1964 book, here's what section 5.3 says:
<dl>
<dd>"The server picks the next message in the queue and performs one unit of service upon it (i.e. services this message for exactly Q seconds). At the end of this time interval, the message leaves the system if its service (transmission) is finished; if not, it joins the end of the queue with its service partially completed .."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And that is the <b>entirety</b> of what the book says about the topic. Although no details at all are given, the most plausible reading of what was meant is that some kind of link-local fragmentation/reassembly is being used, not end-end packets of the sort described in Baran's work, and now used in the Internet.</dd>
<dd>I have the 1961 PhD proposal, and I'll look at that now. However, I suggest you be wary about rushing in where angels fear to tread! I would have to go check Hafner's book, but my <i>vague</i> recollection is that she got it about right. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 02:13, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have now checked both the 1961 thesis proposal, and the 1962 RLE QTR - the former says nothing at all, and the latter has exactly the same language as the book (quoted above). It's worth noting that the book is basically entirely about queueing theory, and is not about engineering a data communication network. The examples given in the book are principally telegram networks, although trucking networks also figure in some cases.</dd>
<dd>I also checked Hafner's book, and she doesn't explicitly rate Kleinrock's contribution, although she implicitly seems to credit Baran and Davies with a key role in coming up with the idea of packet data networks. I think there's something in that - they definitely were thinking of practical data communication systems, whereas Kleinrock's work is very much focused on the theory of queueing, which obviously has a much wider application than just packet networks. And of course Licklider and Taylor were the people who actually had the vision to build a real network. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 04:10, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS: DARPA's <b>own</b> history of the ARPANet (see article) nowhere mentions Kleinrock's work as a source of inspiration - but <b>does</b> prominently cite Baran and Davies. Not that I wholly believe that <i>either</i> (I think Roberts' quote about relying on Kleinrock's work is probably accurate), but more to show you that the picture painted by Kleinrock is <b>not</b> universally shared, and that you shouldn't rely on any one source. See also my recent comments at <a href="../../../p/a/c/Talk%7EPacket_switching_53a4.html" title="Talk:Packet switching">Talk:Packet switching</a> on the subject of Kleinrock's proper share of the credit. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 02:44, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Leonard Kleinrock has responded with the following which i post on his behalf:</p>
<p>"Both comments by jnc miss the point. I was not suggesting that others not be mentioned.

<dd>I had to laugh at "I include the contributions of Baran and Davies in every presentation I make regarding the history of the Internet".

<dd>I don't know which documents he is speaking of - I have read all the ones he has posted, and a great number more besides (although I don't have access to RAND's working papers, or the internal archives of DARPA).

<p>I removed this quote from Larry Roberts:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Roberts' wrote in his Inernet Chronology that "Although the UK work convinced Roberts to use higher speed lines (50 KB) and to use the word packet, the Rand work had no significant impact on the ARPANET plans and Internet history."</dd>
</dl>
<p>because it frankly conflicts with other things he said, at other times and other places. E.g.:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I got this huge collection of reports back at the office, which were sitting around the ARPA office, and suddenly I learned how to route packets. So we talked to Paul and used all of his concepts</i> (Norberg/O'Neill pp. 166)</dd>
</dl>
<p>which is completely 180 degrees away from the first quote!</p>
<p>I don't know for sure what's going on with him. I speculate that in part he's trying to buttress the role of Kleinrock (with whom he had shared an office at MIT, so they were/are old friends, and who has been on a campaign to try and claim credit for packet switching); in part, he also seems irritated (rightfully) at the common myth that "the ARPANET was created to survive a nuclear war". But in any event, with that level of self-contradiction, I don't think one can take anything he says (especially in recent years) as gospel. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 05:42, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sigh - another place where the history books seem to disagree! <i>Dream Machine</i> says (pp. 276) that:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Meanwhile, Scantlebury had told Roberts one other thing in Gatlinburg. .. they had come across the work of am American who had -again- invented the packet network independently. Baran was his name ... Roberts knew Baran slightly and had in fact had lunch with him during a visit to Rand the previous February.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>but <i>Where Wizards</i> says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In December, 1966, when Larry Roberts arrived at the Pentagon ... he had never heard the name Paul Baran.</i> (pp 68) <i>Roberts also learned, for the first time, of the work that had been done by Paul Baran and RAND a few years earlier.</i> (pp. 77)</dd>
</dl>
<p>and I would think they can't both be right. Although I assume the "previous February" above means February, 1966, since Gatlinburg was in October, '67, and I suppose it could have been February, '67 which was meant, which would remove that direct conflict. (Alas, Dream Machine gives no source, so I can't check to verify which one was meant.)</p>
<p>Still, even if it was Febuary '67 (removing the conflict), it's kind of mind-boggling that he could have had lunch with Baran in February '67, when Roberts was <i>already</i> working on the ARPANET (he'd started on that at DARPA at the end of '66), and <i>neither one</i> of them brought up the topic of networking. (I can just imagine the conversation: "So what are you working on now for DARPA?" "Oh, computer networking." "Oh really, I did a big project on that!" etc, etc.)</p>
<p>I shouldn't be surprised if <i>Dream Machine</i> has it right; Roberts probably forgot about it until someone found some old travel records, or something. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 09:05, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I found <i>a</i> source (probably the one <i>Dream Machine</i> used, but no way to be sure, but that doesn't matter much, since it is corroboration for what <i>Dream Machine</i> says): it turns out that it was February, '67. It's in Baran's <a href="http://www.cbi.umn.edu/oh/display.phtml?id=110" class="external text" title="http://www.cbi.umn.edu/oh/display.phtml?id=110" rel="nofollow">oral history interview</a> at the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Babbage_Institute_3811.html" title="Charles Babbage Institute">Charles Babbage Institute</a>, pp. 37, <i>but</i> he's quoting from his contemporary desk diary, viz.:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"O'NEILL: When you say Roberts came out to RAND, you mean he visited? When would that be, do you remember?</dd>
<dd>BARAN: I really don't remember the dates, so I checked my old calendar (copy attached) and here is what I found: On Tuesday, 28 February 1967 I find a notation on my calendar for 12:00 noon Dr. L. Roberts. On Tuesday, 31 October 1967 I see a notation 9:30 AM to 2:00 PM for ARPA's (Elmer) Shapiro, (Barry) Boehm, (Len) Kleinrock, ARPA Network. On Monday, 13 November 1967 I see the following: Larry Roberts to abt (about?) lunch (time?). Art Bushkin = 1:00 PM. Here. Larry Roberts IMP Committee. On Thursday, 16 November 1967 I see 7 PM Kleinrock, UCLA - IMP Meeting."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So that does take out the conflict with <i>Where Wizards</i> (and confirms that <i>Dream Machine</i> had it right). Still, it leaves us the problem of why on earth Roberts went to see Baran <i>after</i> he started working on networking, <i>unless</i> it was to talk about Baran's work - and what on earth would they have talked about <i>other</i> than networking, anyway? I suspect that Roberts simply forgot (years later) about this. <a href="../../../j/n/c/User%7EJnc_c16b.html" title="User:Jnc">Noel</a> <a href="../../../j/n/c/User_talk%7EJnc_50b2.html" title="User talk:Jnc">(talk)</a> 15:43, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Art Bushkin: I don't know how to make an entry here, and I don't recall the specific meeting, but I knew and worked with Paul Baran and Larry Roberts during that time period. Paul Baran testified before Congress during hearings (I don't remember when) on the subject of a National Data Center. The crux of his testimony was the fears of a National Data Center existing in single, large-scale computer were based on an erroneous assumption regarding the way that technology would emerge. Rather, Baran testified that there would emerge a distributed network in which many interconnected computers would create the effect of the feared National Data Center without a single central computer or locus of control. Baran's testimony and other writings, etc., greatly influenced my involvement in this field. As an intern at ARPA in the summer of 1967, and then as a consultant thereafter, I worked on privacy and security of information, and the early creation of the Internet (I invented nothing and was a very minor participant.). Baran was to me, and others, an influential thinker, and I recall speaking with him often about the use of the emerging technology, not just the network development. 24.250.118.155 23:57, 29 January 2006 (UTC) Art Bushkin</dd>

<p>BTW, that Baran interview (a few pages on) has some interesting thoughts on attribution, which I reproduce here because they are so incredibly apt:</p>
<dl>
<dd>My experience with innovations is that everything has a predecessor event or events. ... The process of technological developments is like building a cathedral. Over the course of several hundred years: new people come along and each lays down a block on top of the old foundations, each saying, 'I built a cathedral.' Next month another block is placed atop the previous one. Then comes along an historian who asks, 'Well, who built the cathedral?' Peter added some stones here, and Paul added a few more. If you are not careful you can con yourself into believing that you did the most important part. But the reality is that each contribution has to follow onto previous work. Everything is tied to everything else.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Too often history tends to be lazy and give credit to the planner and to the funder of the cathedral. Maybe we should take the care to avoid the simplifications and say, 'Okay, this person did this or did that, and that person did so and so.' No single person can do it all, or ever does it all. But we are lazy and tend to give all the credit to a single person most closely identified with an activity and forget all the others who really made it all possible.</dd>

<dd>To clarify further: The problem is that even if ARPANet may be the more grammatically correct usage, longstanding Wikipedia policy is to defer to the "common name" of a topic, even if that name is grammatically incorrect or politically incorrect.
