	    <p>I saw your <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coot.html" title="Coot">Coot</a> query, Adrian. You're right that the shield should extend onto the head, but I think it's just the angle, so that some of the white is hidden by black head feathers. It's definitely Eurasian Coot, and an adult at that (sub-adults still have a similar shield, but the bill is grey-tipped. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">Jim</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Ha! Jim is too quick for me again. Yup: definatly a Coot. Maybe ours are a little different. I'll look into it after the more important task -- some sleep! (I just got home after a 3-day trip. It's 2:20AM and I'm bushed.) Cheers -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></dd>

<dd>If this is still the same coot pic (as at 3 Feb), yes it is a Eurasian Coot; the absence of the 'white piece extending up over the head' indicates that it is an immature; the white shield only reaches full size when it is about a year old. - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 15:09, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Adrian, A quick word of thanks for all the effort you've put in adding the many car photographs to articles over the last few months. One small point though - I wonder why nearly all of them are a rear three-quarter view? Do you favour this view for some particular reason or is it accidental? Most illustrative photos of cars tend to go for front 3/4 views. I'm only curious - no criticism intended. Keep up the good work! <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 05:42, 5 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bonjour Adrian. Just saw your pics on the Eiffel Tower page. Absolutely fabulous views. I also noticed you seem to be an avid "French fan". I'd like to discuss use of your pictures of France on a website I have. I don't know what your policy is on this, but I'd like to know... I've just started to get to know Wiki... is there anyway to have personal contact via email?</p>
<p>Thanks, Samk (living just outside of Paris)</p>

<dd>Samk, 'allo! I love Paris very much even though I've had just two weeks there (in two separate one week holidays). However, I worked for British Aerospace in Bristol for many years and had to go to meetings in Toulouse, so I've been to Toulouse 36 times! (but never, stupidly, took any photos). Feel free to use any of my photos anyhow you like, they are all public domain and so no need to ask my permission, just let me know your web site address. Have a look at:<br />

<p>Hey Adrian: Thanks for the support , buddy! I have begun uploading photos of <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxers</a> to their pages. Preferably, when they are hitting an important opponent cause I think those photos are awesome. Of course, after asking for permission first. But I enlisted Maio for that because I dont want to over load you with work! I have permission for a <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexicana_de_Aviacion_9e87.html" title="Mexicana de Aviacion">Mexicana de Aviacion</a> jetliner but permit was given two years ago almost. I also will ask for permission of a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Air_Lines_1541.html" title="Delta Air Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> jet. My love affair with Delta dates back to 1980 when I first flew and it was on Delta, to Orlando from <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Munoz_Marin_International_Airport_2b99.html" title="Luis Munoz Marin International Airport">SJU</a>. Thank <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> dad didnt choose the alternative, <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Airlines_8d0f.html" title="Eastern Airlines">Eastern Airlines</a>, cause then my favorite airline would be gone now! LOL!</p>
<p><br />
But Im gonna re ask for the Mexicana permit and ask for the Delta permit in March, so not to overload you with work! BTW I love Mexicana too although I never flew them: Theirs was one of the first planes I could recognize at SJU when I was about nine..LOL</p>
<p>I even knew at what time Mexicana was arriving , I ususally made grandpa wait until seven PM so we coud see the Mexicana <a href="../../../d/c/-/DC-10_1ef1.html" title="DC-10">DC-10</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_727.html" title="Boeing 727">727</a>'s arrival! LOL same with <a href="../../../v/i/a/Viasa.html" title="Viasa">Viasa</a> and <a href="../../../i/b/e/Iberia.html" title="Iberia">Iberia</a>.</p>
<p>Well, thanks for the support with this reddice guy. He seems to me to be one who doesnt get jokes. Oh well, we must deal with everyone...LOL</p>

<p>Dear Arp: Hi1 My friend from Puerto Rico is having trouble finding the images I want him to download. I need to ask you another favor: Can I please direct you to the exact page with the photo Ive been given permission to portray both of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilfred_Benitez_0add.html" title="Wilfred Benitez">Wilfred</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clara_Benitez_f039.html" title="Clara Benitez">Clara Benitez</a> and then have you download them?</p>
<p>And I need to ask, exactly what system to I need in my memory to be able to transport photo files from my files to wikipedia and how do I get that system and is it expensive?</p>
<p>Thank you and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> bless you!</p>

<p>Dear Arp; Hey, thanks for the help1Im gonna call the Benitez family tomorrow, they will surely like the way it looks,as much as I do.</p>
<p>I need tutorial on how to upload photo files from your computer to wikipedia, what program do you need ect.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask how much did you enjoy your experience at Britih Aerospace? Must have seen a lot of airplanes from different airlines ah? I know if Icant become famous Id surely love getting a job at Airbus, for example, in the future..LOL I mean, imagine, Ive seen many different North American, European and Latin American airliners in person,but I was lucky one time that I saw one of <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saudi_Arabian_Airlines_605f.html" title="Saudi Arabian Airlines">Saudi Arabian Airlines</a> after an unscheduled stop herein Phoenix once! So I bet it must have been fun seeing all those planes from airlines worldwide while at BIa!.</p>

<p>250 pixels is certainly good; especially when you're using the 'thumb' parameter that puts that (rather ugly, so far) border around the image. Good thing with the new code is that it's just a quick edit to change the size! However, when not using 'thumb' in the attributes, 300px doesn't look over big, IMO.</p>

<p>Hi. We've decided that we need to tag all images because of all the dodgy images on wikipedia. As you release your (really good) images into the public domain I've been tagging them with {{msg:PD}}. As you point out the wording of this needs to be changed as yours are public domain internationally. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 12:20, Feb 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think we should make the international PD the default. The current message is really designed for images that are copyright expired in the US. The idea behind tagging is so that images can be filtered. At the moment some using wikipedia can't really use any of the images as there is no way of filtering out American fair use, etc. This is what I'm doing - so a third party user can keep the legal ones. I hope this makes sense.&#160;:<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 12:28, Feb 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Arp: Hi1 How are you? I discussed with another friend, the other <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rican_ff02.html" title="Puerto Rican">Puerto Rican</a> guy, about the addition of a photo in the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menudo.html" title="Menudo">Menudo</a> article. The website has not been updated in two years, and my friend told me something that I could download it based on <i>free usage</i> or something because the site hasnt been changed in two years so the webmaster probably doesnt keep it anymore etc, etc. I asked for permission but wasnt answered.</p>
<p>Anyways Im gonna send it to you and if you believe it grants being here, let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks and God bless you!</p>

<p>Hi - yes, it was me who moved Embraer ERJ 145. I used ERJ-145 because searching the web, it seems to be the most common way to render the name. However, you're right - there should be no dash and I've corrected this. Will add appropriate redirects.

<dd>Oops again. I was working from a US Navy fact sheet, but further investigation seems to show the USN using both "Sea Hawk" and "Seahawk" interchangably, but with "Seahawk" more common.

<p>Thanks Adrian, I'll write articles as and when I get the chance. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a></p>
<p>I'm no expert on cameras. My Fuji Finepix 4700 is mechanically and optically good, but only 3X optical zoom, not interchangeable nor screw-on to my telescope. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">Jim</a>. Incidentally, this page is at 39kb. ---</p>
<p>==USAF Museum photos== On futher looking, you are probably correct (that they are *not* normally okay to post). I just *assumed* USAF photos and did a real quick look thru the USAF museum info itself. Guess I should learn to look closer! Anyway, I found replacement photos (from NASA!!!), but can't seem to get them to replace the old ones (using the same filename)... Guess this is gonna be one my 'stupid' days. Thanx for pointing it out though!!! ---<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerak_9e49.html" title="User:Serak">serak</a> 21:34, 29 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Adrian. Cameras ..... Tough choice! I can only really comment on the Nikons in any detail. I have a Coolpix 4500 (well, two of them now) which is a little over-priced, 4MP, 4X zoom, very neat and clever in lots of ways, and drives me crazy with its shutter delay. The delay is about 0.7 sec. Doing wildlife stuff (as I do) that makes it mega-frustrating, but for digiscoping the CoolPix 4500 is petty much the only game in town. Nothing else fits onto a scope and performs as wel as the Nikon does. (With nearly all others, you get a lot of vignetting.)</p>
<p>That estimated 0.7sec is <i>including</i> focus delay, so you'd stil find it better than your Oly, but I doubt you'd be saisfied.</p>
<p>What would I get if I were you? (i.e., not digiscoping.) First, I'd listen to EricD's advice (on my talk page). Eric is much better informed than I am about cameras in general. Second, I think I'd bite the bullet and make up my mind to wait another 6 to 12 months, and then buy an SLR.</p>
<p>Digital SLRs are really starting to threaten decent value now. There is the new Canon, essentially a 10D with a plastic body and slightly downgraded electronics, that is getting excellent reports and about 2X the price of a Coolpix. More interesting still is the new small Pentax. Give the Pentax three or four months to start biting into Canon's market share at the DSLR entry-level point, and it's price war time. Good for buyers! Say ... oh ... any time from Octover or so onwards. Better yet, just after Xmas is usually a good time. Retailers are flat and manufacturers try to sweeten things up for them.</p>
<p>I <i>know</i> that isn't what you wanted to hear, but I am not aware of a non-SLR digital camera that will really do what you want yet.</p>
<p>Finally, some random thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore "digital zoom". It's complete maketing crap. Serves no purpose whatever. Optical or nothing.</li>
<li>Try to avoid non-standard flash card formats (i.e., Sony Memory Stick, XD, all those other weird ones. <i>Real</i> cameras use genuine Compact Flash.</li>
<li>When calculating the cost of the camera, be sure to include the cost of <i>at least</i> one set of spare batteries (more likely two sets - I have 5 batteries plus an in-car charger, and it's only just enough), and plenty of flash cards. The more megapixels the camera, the faster you go through flash cards, as your images take more space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best of luck with your purchase! <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 11:57, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have a Canon G3 (now superseded by G5 model) and I'm very pleased with it. It's not an SLR, but it offers a feature set that comes very close to one, but at a lower price point. The lack of true through-the-lens shot composition isn't a problem, since you can see what you get on the screen, and once you get used to it, this mode of operation is easier than holding it up close to your eye anyway. The main benefit I can see from a true SLR is lens interchangeability, but the new generation of digital SLRs do not accept standard analogue lenses of old (for good optical reasons), so you will have to reinvest in lenses if you go that route. The G3/G5 uses Compact Flash, and I agree with the above - avoid the proprietary formats. On a 256M card, I can get over 400 shots at good workaday quality, and still well over 100 with ultimate quality. The Canon has enough manual modes to keep the creative photographer in me happy, but will still point and shoot for snaps in "auto" mode. Shutter lag is acceptable, better than the Fuji models around at the moment, though could still be better. There is a way to get rid of most of the lag using a "fast shot" mode, where it sets the camera up just short of taking the actual picture, then when you press the button it completes the shot. Seems to work. Optical zoom is only 3x (maybe the G5 extends this, not sure), sometimes I would like a bit more. Asd Tannin mentions, digital zoom is not worth paying too much attention too, though one time I used it the rseults were better than I expected, since the camera is able to interpolate using all the data from the CCD, so the result is better than what you'd get if you just zoomed up a JPEG image later in a software package. Anyway, I recommend it, but trhe market is moving fast, so there may already be something better for the same money. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 21:53, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings Adrian. I have changed the pic on <a href="../../../u/n/d/Undercarriage.html" title="Undercarriage">Undercarriage</a> to better fit the article.

<dd>Hi Adrian. The original pic was excellent. Is. No question. However, if you read the page history you will see where a user insisted on "a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tripod.html" title="Tripod">tripod</a> effect" to describe undercarriage configuration. It clearly isn't, and it isn't an aeronautical term anyway, so that's why I swapped to an a/c showing five sets of wheels. The user seems to have done a bunk and maybe "tripod" won't reappear, so I'll revert the pics. Gladly. But if he comes back, and tries his "tripod" silliness, then ......

<p>Hey Adrian nice to hear from you again! Lots of things have happened here: My computer is next to my door, and since my uncle and his wife were forced to open the door before they got shot Im worried about that because of that I dont collaborate much here anymore. We think it was a robbery.</p>
<p>Anyways, about the photo, I have been granted permission to use photos on the <a href="../../../a/v/i/Avianca.html" title="Avianca">Avianca</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Air_Lines_1541.html" title="Delta Air Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futura_Airlines_3dfc.html" title="Futura Airlines">Futura</a> articles. Problem is, all the owners keep asking to have their names under the photos. I figured out I could put it there, send them the link, make them happy, and then erase it.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could help me with the uploading of some of these photos.</p>
<p>Thanks, and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> bless you!</p>

<dd>Hi Antonio! I notice that Dori has sugested you try really hard to do the uploads yourself but I don't think there's much chance you would succeed so I'll certainly do them for you. Just let me know, here on my Talk Page, the URL and I'll put them on.</dd>
<dd>On the subject of copyright, I'm afraid we simply don't (as far as I know) allow copyright notices in pic captions. Surely your suppliers would be happy with a link at the bottom of the article? If they insist that the copyright notice be directly under the pic then I can't help you. It's certainly not a solution to do the notice then erase it later!<br /></dd>
