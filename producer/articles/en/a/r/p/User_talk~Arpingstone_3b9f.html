<p>That is one fantastic roof in Croyde, North Devon. I want to build this type of roof on a cottage that I am designing right now. I want to get detailed photos of the underside of the curved part to see how it was constructed...any way you can get that and post it? Any details about the design and construction of the roof would be much appreciated.<br />

<dd>I do have one more pic so here it is. It probably won't help! I was on holiday nearby and I can't go back to ask about the construction (it's 100 miles away from me). You could write to them, the address would be Welcome Cottage, Croyde, north Devon, England<br /></dd>
<dd>You might be interested to know a bit more about messaging so here goes:<br /></dd>
<dd>New messages go at the bottom of the page, not at the top where you put it. You could have linked to the article with two square brackets either side of the article's name, as I have done above with the articles name of Roof (notice that the link turns blue, a single click will then take anyone straight to the article where the pic is to be found). Sign your username and the date, if you have a username, with four tildes (the wiggly line thing). On my keyboard the tilde shares a key with the hash sign.

<dd>Fig, you have a problem that some editors have which is the use of semi-specialised phraseology that you understand perfectly but millions won't in other countries or even here in Bristol where I live. They are NOT normal phrases with obvious meanings. Yes, they are understandable by you but that's not the point - John Bull in Ohio might want to understand it as well.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your comment “If you dont know what an "evolved community" is I suggest you shouldn’t be editing small urban wiki stubs” is so silly. I have been editing WP since January 2003 (you have been editing since January 2006) so I DO have the experience and I will continue to edit any article that the reader may not understand or that shows poor style.</p>
<pre>
That it’s a “small urban wiki stub” has no relevance whatever, I edit long articles or stubs, on any subject, because unclear writing is recognizable no matter the subject.
</pre>
<p>It would be great if I did a poll of Wikipedians all around the world to see if they know what “evolved community” and “residentially fragmented” means but its too much effort since your mind seems to be closed and I never get into to-and-fro arguments, there’s too much else to do on WP. So revert by all means and I can take the article off my Watchlist so that I don’t have to see an article that many will find annoying.

<dd>The 2 aqueducts are now fine but there could be a small refinement to the Somerset Coal Canal. The final 0.5 km of the SCC, up to the Dundas Aqueduct, still fully exists (as boat moorings) so should be coloured in the K&amp;A blue. This stretch is so short that I would in no way object if it was ignored. The stretch runs from the Dundas Aqueduct back only as far as the "S" of the word "Dundas". It might be helpful to tell you that the stretch is 4 millimetres long on my 19 inch monitor, viewing the biggest version of the map - <a href="../../../a/r/p/User%7EArpingstone_3088.html" title="User:Arpingstone">Adrian Pingstone</a> 20:08, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Adrian,</p>

<p>Dear Adrian,</p>
<p>I just have a question concerning your Jaguar XJ8. Can you please tell me what the colour denotation is? It looks like Sapphire Metallic Clearcoat 806/JGE or 1806/JHE. Thank you for replying ex ante. Jag Enthusiast Sava</p>

<dd>Hi! It would be helpful to have told me which pic you refer to, I've had to spend a while just finding it.

<dd>Hi! Thanks for your question. I don't think you can be aware that the sea shore is <i>always</i> level against the land, it can't be any other way (it doesn't depend on how the mountains might slope in the distance). I saw the slope of the seashore the instant I looked at the picture, this is a very common failing with seascapes. To check, I just pulled the pic upwards until the seashore was running along a horizontal part of the screen, then you'll see it. If you don't understand what I mean please ask again. - <a href="../../../a/r/p/User%7EArpingstone_3088.html" title="User:Arpingstone">Adrian Pingstone</a> 20:08, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At first I thought you had uploaded a crop of the original Thelka image, but looking at the image description page, I suspect that you've been out and taken a fresh shot today. Nice job!</dd>
<dd>I'd be surprised if there aren't more Bansky's around in Bristol - it would probably be worth talking to <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncancumming_9958.html" title="User:Duncancumming">User:Duncancumming</a> or others of WikiProject Graffiti. <a href="http://visitbristol.co.uk/site/guide-book/banksy-graffiti-artist" class="external text" title="http://visitbristol.co.uk/site/guide-book/banksy-graffiti-artist" rel="nofollow">This Web site</a> suggests there is one on Cheltenham Road and there is mention of one on Gloucester Rd <a href="http://www.knowhere.co.uk/488_shops.html" class="external text" title="http://www.knowhere.co.uk/488_shops.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. However, I don't know how current these websites are, and graffiti can be transient. There are several websites and Flickr groups devoted to Banksy, so it can be rewarding to look through those and see if you can recognise any locations. If you happen to catch any, I'm not sure that the article would have room to support them, but there is a category for Banksy on Commons where I'm sure they would be appreciated.

<dd>You've caught me out! I put the Naked Man's date (November 2006) on the Image Description Page of the Skeleton Rower in error (now corrected). The Rower closeup was in fact taken at the same time (April 2005) as I took the general shot of Thekla. I had spotted the graffiti on the side of the boat but was not sure what it was. So I took the telephoto shot to examine at leisure on my computer. I had no idea it was by Banksy.

<dd>Thanks for being kind about my improvements, I get nervous when I change a pic in case the other party doesn't think it <i>is</i> an improvement! Two sorries - first I know nothing about copyright etc because I put on only my own PD pics. Secondly I haven't gone as far from Bristol as the places you mention so no luck there.

<p>Thanks for the apology and for clarifying your comments on my talk page.</p>
<p>Regarding the link to eoearth.org, You stated "it's useful and not spam because no price is given nor where to buy it". This, however, is not the criteria in the <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> standard. WP recently tightened their external link standards and actually elevated several criteria from "quideline" status to "policy". Sounds like semantical hair splitting, but from what I've read, WP is getting flooded with link spammers who are not simply trying to sell products but are trying to promote their own websites<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam</a>. Here's an extract from this new policy statement;</p>
<dl>
<dd>"For policy or technical reasons, editors are restricted from linking to the following, without exception.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A website that you own, maintain or are acting as an agent for; even if the guidelines otherwise imply that it should be linked to. This is in line with the conflict of interests guidelines."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Further it states in its guidelines that the following links are to be avoided:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Links that are added to promote a site..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>It appears that an individual or group of eoearth.org users have been flooding WP with links to promote this website. In most cases, the only contributions to WP by these users are the additon of these links. In the case of KonaScout (who added this link), this user was warned twice prior to cease link spamming eoearth.org by two other editors and the links were removed. If you check his contribution list, the vast majority are simply adding external eoearth.org links. Other eoearth.org users likewise have been warned by other editors and most have stopped.</p>
<p>My removal of this link was in accordance with the WP standard. If you still object to its removal and think that its retention should be treated as an exception, please discuss it in the Glacier article Talk page.</p>
<p>Thanks again for taking the time to write and explain your comments. I have not removed the link yet, but wanted to get your response first. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalltech_9c69.html" title="User:Calltech">Calltech</a> 22:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your comment. Unfortunately, without examples of my “basic mistakes”, I cannot defend myself. I think it sad that you have criticised a fellow Wikipedian, yet have not said what the criticism is. (You should know that I have done 16,000 edits since January 2003 and this is the first complaint of “mistakes”.) If the mistakes were minor then it would be normal to correct them yourself, there is no need to let the other party (me) know that they have made a mistake.</dd>

<dd>Although I don’t know what I’m supposed to have done, I find it weird to be "told off" for my editing skills by someone whose own editing skills ended us up with an entry for <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barton-le-Clay_f22f.html" title="Barton-le-Clay">Barton-le-Clay</a> that was so massively unencyclopedic that I had to do hundreds of changes to bring it into line with the WP norm for village entries. (An aside: the reader of this might like to look at the Barton-le-Clay entry for 12.32 on 22nd October 2006 to see the state it was in when I came across it). Had you looked at a few other village entries on WP you would have seen how far off your entry was from the norm, and I would not have needed to edit it at all - <a href="../../../a/r/p/User%7EArpingstone_3088.html" title="User:Arpingstone">Adrian Pingstone</a> 14:44, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I noticed you removed an external link because the page was in a foreign language (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aircraft_spotting&amp;diff=90029449&amp;oldid=89932521" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aircraft_spotting&amp;diff=90029449&amp;oldid=89932521" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). This is not an excluding factor (for instance many governments in non-english speaking countries have websites in a foreign language).

<dd>Hi, thanks for your message. I’ve been editing WP every day since January 2003 so I like to think I know what I’m doing. As you probably agree, the aircraft spotting page in German was not acceptable to WP so I removed it. I always write a helpful Edit Summary so I wrote <i>This is the English Wikipedia, foreign language links are not allowed so German language link removed</i>. I did not say that certain foreign language links <b>are</b> OK but perhaps I should have.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, in future, I’ll change the wording to say <i>This is the English Wikipedia, foreign language links are not normally allowed so German language link removed</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I never write <i>Removing link spam</i> because that gives the uploader no information about why his/her link was unacceptable. Best Wishes - <a href="../../../a/r/p/User%7EArpingstone_3088.html" title="User:Arpingstone">Adrian Pingstone</a> 16:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arp, you say {Unencyclopedic sentence removed again, how can the reader have any idea what "residentially fragmented" and "evolved community" mean.} on editing Cabot. I dont understand what your problem is with this - they are entirely normal phrases with obvious meanings. The residential areas in Cabot are divided into 6 seperate areas, none of which is identifiably "Cabot". If you dont know what an "evolved community" is I suggest you shouldnt be editing small urban wiki stubs. Contrast with the "Clifton" page. Please justify its removal, come up with alternative text, or I will re-insert it. The information is justifably encyclopedic and needs to be included. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFig_wright_153c.html" title="User:Fig wright">Fig</a> 23:37, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fig, you have a problem that some editors have which is the use of semi-specialised phraseology that you understand perfectly but millions won't in other countries or even here in Bristol where I live. They are <i>not</i> normal phrases with obvious meanings. Yes, they are understandable by you but that's not the point - John Bull in Ohio might want to understand it as well.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your comment <i>“If you dont know what an "evolved community" is I suggest you shouldn’t be editing small urban wiki stubs”</i> is silly. I have been editing WP since January 2003 (you have been editing since January 2006) so I <i>do</i> have the experience and I will continue to edit any article that the reader may not understand or that shows poor style.</dd>

<dd>Come up with some better text then. As I said, the information is relevant and I think the meaning clear. If you dont, then improve the text; but dont just delete it - that's just silly. It's ridiculous to delete sound information from any encyclopaedia just because you think it wont be understood - it is better to have extra information that some people might understand and others not than it is not to have the information at all. Heck, the people who dont understand it might try and find out what it means...and get smarter in the process. Everyone's a winner. If you have better text, put it in, or I will re-insert. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFig_wright_153c.html" title="User:Fig wright">Fig</a> 13:26, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. You seem unable to tell me what "evolved community" means although I directly asked you to tell me. Maybe you don't know either! Incidentally, why should the reader find what the phrases mean, they surely expect WP to be their one source.</dd>

<p>Hello, Arpingstone. My intention is not to replace your photos with mine. Actually, I added one of your pictures in the Tarom article (the one with the B777). I thought just that there are too many Boeing 737 pictures in the article, while the Tarom fleet consists of other aircraft too. That is why I uploaded the photo with the A318 from Romanian Wikipedia, so I had to sacrifice one of the 737 pictures; since there were two made in Heathrow, I decided to delete one; Anyway, the best thing is to create a link to Wikipedia Commons, where we can put all the pictures. Thanks. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECristibur_182a.html" title="User:Cristibur">Cristibur</a> 21:13, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your friendly response. Have you made a mistake above (or have I misunderstood?) because Tarom don't have any B777!<br /></dd>
<dd>I understand the points you make but since Tarom have 2 A310s, 2 A318s, and 9 B737s an emphasis on B737 pics seems reasonable. Anyhow, if you would be kind enough to let my pic stay that would be great (and the article is not yet overcrowded with pics so I don't think we need not send our readers to Commons).

<p>Hi. I've been seeing your pics in various articles I work on, and you seem to have quite a collection. I have a couple of new articles, and a few old ones, that are in desperate need of good pics. Is there any chance you might have some already, or be able to get some? I'll have to make a list if you're interested, either of the pics I could use, or of the articles themsleves (or both). What I need the most right now are a few of some civil Hughes/MD 500s, old and new models (I can be more specific).

<dd>Hi! Thanks for writing. I have five Hughes/MD helicopter pics that I don't seem to have uploaded onto any article. They are two <b>Hughes 500 Model 369HS</b> (G-ORRR, built 1975, and G-GSPG, built 1976), a <b>Hughes 500 Model 369D</b> (G-BIOA, built 1980), an <b>MD500N NOTAR</b> (G-SMAC, built 1992) and an <b>MD500E Model 369E</b> (G-TRUE, built 1992). I can upload any (or all) to illustrate articles. The obvious articles are:<br />

<p><font color="black">Hi Arpingstone. I see you do a lot of great work here on Wikipedia! While I want you to keep it up and to still be bold, I'd like to suggest that before you make massive edits to an article or remove a large chunk of information simply because you feel something looks wierd or out of place, you should discuss the change in that article's talk page. I'm not saying that you do this (make these edits) all the time, but it seems that you do this often, whether it be a chart you think should not be there or whether it be a paragraph you don't fully understand. Also, I think that wording like "one can do such a thing" is okay and doesn't have to be replaced by "such a thing can be done". It makes the article more dynamic and interesting than it would be with constantly subjective wording. Before you change all the wording in an article, I suggest that you discuss that change too. Thanks again for your contributions to Wikipedia! <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlthepal_2d33.html" title="User:Althepal">Althepal</a> 20:50, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</font></p>
<dl>
<dd><font color="black">By the way, I noticed that at least once (The Adobe Photoshop article) you mistook an edit (which was a little messed up) for vandalism. I left your change as is, but just try to be a little more careful to see if what looks like vandalism might be an honest attempt to improve the article, but the person accidentally inserted the edit in the wrong place or something. Just something to keep in mind. Keep up the good work, <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlthepal_2d33.html" title="User:Althepal">Althepal</a> 20:54, 29 January 2007 (UTC)!</font></dd>

<dd><font color="black">I've made 8,000 edits since January 2003, with only about 20 "complaints", so that's not bad. Inevitably some of my edits will be contentious so just revert what you don't like. If (say) 99% of my edits are good then I'm happy.

<dd><font color="black">Very true.&#160;;) You generally do good work, so I'm happy too. Just informing you that some types of edits should be more carefully made. For example, you removed the table and some important facts from the Helicon Filter article and and the Adobe Photoshop article, simply because you thought it looked out of place or made for unbalanced POV. Looking at the first page of your contributions, it seems you removed quiet a bit of information from the National security article that should have stayed, and you often make changes because you think something "looks odd", such as in the List of notable Bathonians article. Again, keep up the good work, but be careful not to remove lots of information without agreement from others. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlthepal_2d33.html" title="User:Althepal">Althepal</a> 22:43, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</font></dd>

Why would every entry in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_Bathonians_bca5.html" title="List of notable Bathonians">List of notable Bathonians</a> be bracketed? The bracketed stuff was the occupation of each person, not an afterthought or secondary fact, so bracketing was simply wrong. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Security_f12c.html" title="National Security">National Security</a> article was one of the most unreadable articles I've ever seen until I simplified it (the "average" reader would have been completely lost even if you were not), now others can improve it.<br /></font></dd>

<p><font color="black">I've noted your soundly reasoned contributions/edits on several (many?!) aviation subjects in <i>Wikipedia</i> with much interest.</font></p>
<p><font color="black">As a 'raw beginner' (only from October 2006) I've tried to help on aviation articles, also. I have studied aviation history for several decades - and am still learnin'&#160;!</font></p>
<p><font color="black">We have both contributed to the 'MyTravel Airways' article. In the last few days, I've contributed data on passengers carried by 'MYT'. Another contributor, 'Airline UK' has been consistently deleting the info. His contributions to <i>Wikipedia</i> are over 90% devoted to MyTravel. I therefore suspect that he is 'in the pay' of MYT. The article is unduly 'laudatory' about that airline's past and present.</font></p>

<p><font color="black">Thanks for your clean up on Lustleigh article, but i think a couple of your cuts were a little harsh. I've put a couple of them back in, because i think their removal got rid of some useful information and background. Being absolutely succinct is not always desirable! Thanks <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain.davies_53bf.html" title="User:Owain.davies">Owain.davies</a> 18:49, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</font></p>
<p><font color="black"><br />
Thanks for your comments, always welcome. In regards to Example 1, I concede that there are too many news in the last part of the sentence (that wasn't a reversion however), however, I really don't think your two sentence structure made any sense, as it split one cadent sentence in two. I'll make a final fix on it.</font></p>
<p><font color="black">For example 2, the sentence structure is not ideal with two parentheses, but the detail is relevant, and it would be in a better structure, but I did it quickly, so I didn't forget to go back to it. I totally disagree that it's rambling.</font></p>
<p><font color="black">As I said, I agree with most of your edits, i just think your chopping axe is a little <b>too</b> sharp. Personally I'd rather see you reword sentences you don't like, than just remove whole sections which someone's worked on. In any case, please feel free to carry on editing my writing (depending what computer i'm working on, i don't always have a spellcheck for the internet, and as i'm usually making bulk additions, the grammar can sometimes slip), but i might just sneak the odd bit back in! <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain.davies_53bf.html" title="User:Owain.davies">Owain.davies</a> 20:46, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</font></p>

<p><font color="black">I can see we're just not going to agree, but PLEASE blunt that axe of yours a little! From my point of view, a lot of the cuts you made led to the paragraphs requiring assumption or some prior knowledge. A good encyclopaedic article shouldn't need prior info to understand why content is there. (just the last example i changed, Military ambulances, you set it to say that they are armoured, which loses something over pre-positioning that with the information that they are going to enter hazardous war zones - pure assumption)</font></p>
