<p>He was popularly known as "Adi". Adi was not very happy joining the infantry, instead he wanted to joined an armoured regiment. On one fine day his battalion was inspected by <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_General_811b.html" title="Major General">Major General</a> El Edroos, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commander-in-Chief_dd6e.html" title="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</a> of the state forces.

Adi was quick to jump and throw it. However the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grenade.html" title="Grenade">grenade</a> exploded in the middle which left him injured as the flying shapnel hit his chest. Major General Edroos, was a witness to this event which kept him spellbound. He was impressed by the exemplary courage dispalyed by Ardeshir. Major General Edroos summoned Ardeshir to his office and congratulated him for his efforts. Ardeshir took this as an opportunity and requested that he be transferred to an armoured regiment. The General accepted this and he was transferred to the 1st Hyderabad Imperial Service Lancers. Interestingly, 1st hyderabad Lancer fought with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Poona_Horse_01e9.html" title="The Poona Horse">The Poona Horse</a> in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_polo.html" title="Operation polo">operation polo</a>.</p>

On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">11 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, the regiment was assigned the task of delivering the main armoured thrust for capturing Phillora. It decided upon launching a surprise attack on Phillora from the rear. To achieve the surprise, when the regiment was thrusting forward between Phillora and Chawinda, it was suddenly counter-attacked by the <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistani_Army_c953.html" title="Pakistani Army">Pakistani Army</a>'s heavy armour from Wazirwali.</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Tarapore defied the <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistani_Army_c953.html" title="Pakistani Army">Pakistani Army</a>'s charge, held his ground and gallantly attacked Phillora with one of his squadrons supported by an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">Infantry</a> battalion. Though under continuous enemy tank and artillery fire, he remained unperturbed throughout this action. When wounded, he refused to be evacuated.

<p>Unmindful of his injury, he again led his regiment and captured Jassoran and Butur-Dograndi on 16 September 1965. In this battle his own tank was hit several times. But despite the odds, he maintained his pivots at both these places and thereby helped the supporting infantry to attack Chawinda from the rear.</p>
<p>Inspired by his leadership, the regiment fiercely attacked the enemy armour and destroyed approximately sixty <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistani_Army_c953.html" title="Pakistani Army">Pakistani Army</a> tanks, suffering only nine tank casualties. However, Lt. Colonel Tarapore was enveloped in flames and died a hero's death.
