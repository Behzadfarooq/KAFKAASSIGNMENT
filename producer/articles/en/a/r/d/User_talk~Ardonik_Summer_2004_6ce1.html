<p>The relevance of the <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slash_fiction.html" title="Slash fiction">slash fiction</a> xref for the articles on <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk.html" title="Kirk">Kirk</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spock.html" title="Spock">Spock</a> is that Kirk/Spock slash is thought to constitute the earliest specimens of this kind of fiction. <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShutterBugTrekker_03a7.html" title="User:ShutterBugTrekker">ShutterBugTrekker</a> 15:14, 13 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there Ardonick. You are right, my comments should be on the talk page: that is what it is for. However I have found that putting my question at the top of the article is an extremely effective way of getting quick answers. I feel that Wikipedia has a bit of problem wiith writers who are so engrossed in their subject that they dive right in without a proper introduction as seen in the articles you mentioned. My questions are intended to provoke that introduction. Cheers <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPing_4215.html" title="User:Ping">ping</a> 10:20, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey I read your note and decided that I will try to add on. I found Ulla was a Asherite, but he wasn't mentioned very much in the Bible.</p>

<dd>Hi, Spl2. I hope I didn't come across as harsh when I asked for the article to be fleshed out more; if I knew anything at all about <a href="../../../u/l/l/Ulla.html" title="Ulla">Ulla</a>, I would have done so myself. Searching online, all I can really see are mentions in biblical concordances. The most "informative" link I found was <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/smith_w/bibledict.Ulla.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/smith_w/bibledict.Ulla.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>!

<p>I did read the IRC article. I think I have a general idea of what it is and how to use it when it is set up. However I couldn't find any details of how to get started and set it up. I'm on Win XP using internet explorer via a verizon DSL connection. Do I have to download new software or is this a function in IE? Do I need to change settings in the control panel internet settings section? What is the first step for setting it up?

<p>Just to clarify, the change in the VfD instructions from [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/PAGENAME]] to [[PAGENAME/vfd]] was deliberate and in response to repeated complaints that it made maintenance harder. The decision to move the "add to this discussion" link out of the header line was also deliberate because it kept causing the table of contents to fail and the link in the VfD header (that is supposed to take you directly to the relevant entry instead of just to the top of the VfD page) to fail. I'm okay with the reversion if it wasn't working, but I would like to know what went wrong. It seemed to work the several times I tested it.

<p>Thanks for your prompt message back. There's no rush and maybe no need to change anything. I'm okay with it either way but was trying to be responsive to the requests of others on the VfD Talk page and on the VfD footer page. My thoughts are below.

<li>Should the "add to this discussion" link be on the same line?
<ul>
<li>Pros: Takes up less space, automatically gets bolded</li>
<li>Cons: The header link is really hard to make work right, the TOC is cluttered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Should the sub-page be a sub of the VfD page or a sub of the article? (Either way, the new <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_process_57c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion process">Deletion process</a> requires us to keep the page and <i>not</i> copy the discussion anywhere.)

<p>Oh, I understand your concern and personally think such articles should be merged (if not deleted; but one must be careful with such talk or risk being labelled a <i>deletionist!</i> *gasp*). In the case of <a href="../../../g/o/h/Gohdan.html" title="Gohdan">Gohdan</a>, I'd merge it with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_The_Wind_Waker_a8e9.html" title="The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>. But like you, I've no knowledge of the series and wouldn't feel comfortable doing it. VfD is the best option, but from what I've seen, it'll probably end up being kept or merged, though perhaps someone who knows Zelda will see the listing and do the merge.</p>

<p>Look, it's a commercial photo. If we get to use it under fair use, what photo could we possibly not get to use? Why have copyright at all? The burden of proof is on us to argue why a recent commercial photo can be used in the Wiki under fair use. I have no knowledge of where the other photo came from, that's why I didn't delink it. Why do you call me dishonest? I said nothing about my motivations for delinking. All I said was that it was a copyrighted picture, which it very clearly is.</p>

<li>Hi, User:67.180.24.204. I saw your message at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>, and I have replied to you there. The gist of it is that I will accept that you're more concerned about copyvio than you are about Image:Kerry.4CF2.jpg's controversial nature (though you still have yet to remove the second image on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_Kerry_e534.html" title="Alexandra Kerry">Alexandra Kerry</a>, for some reason), but I won't revert your removal again.

<ul>
<li>How do you know the source of the second image? I don't, so I haven't removed it. I'm curious since you question my motivations: Why don't you question the motivation of those who included the image and spent more than half the text talking about it? I suspect it's either a horny 15-year old or a right-wing nutcase. But, frankly I think such a triviality has no place in an encyclopedia; this is not a gossip column. I don't care that it's controversial; I just find it completely tangential to the purpose of the Wiki. I was thinking about arguing that point, but figured it wasn't really worth the effort. But then, I noticed the attibution to AFP &amp; realized we shouldn't be using the photo anyway. Even if I wanted the photo to stay, I would have unlinked it at that point.</li>

<dd>Good point — I assumed that both images were from Agence France Presse based on the comments by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> in the article's <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexandra_Kerry_f983.html" title="Talk:Alexandra Kerry">talk page</a>. Upon further examination, it's clear that the <a href="http://snopes.com/photos/risque/kerry.asp" class="external text" title="http://snopes.com/photos/risque/kerry.asp" rel="nofollow">Snopes article</a> only refers to the first one as being from AFP and makes no mention of the origins of the second.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for questioning the motivations of those who included the image in the first place, I think that the incident at the Cannes film festival was newsworthy enough that at least a cursory mention should have been made of it in the article, and without an image, there is no context for such a discussion. As you can read in the talk page, I did not feel that the image was dignified, but upon re-reading the article, I realized its relevance. That's why I did not remove it myself and why I reverted your changes when you removed it. I dislike censorship, and I interpreted your actions as such. It appears that I was mistaken, and I apologize for that. But I would <i>still</i> like the image to remain in the article; I feel that we are at least as much in our rights to use it as Snopes.</dd>

<dd>I'm no conservative--my loathing of President Bush runs very deep. However, I do not feel that including that image represents either a pro-Bush statement or that it somehow smears John Kerry. The woman is <i>independent</i>--she does not represent or explify the political ambitions of either her father or stepmother. Her photo at the festival, while unfortunate, has nothing to do with Kerry's presidential campaign. I feel that we should truthfully report what happened in a NPOV and then simply leave it at that.</dd>

<p>Shouldn't categories be more broad than the articles they contain?

<dd>Actually, I think it's just the opposite--an article ought to only be classified in the most specific categories possible, so that you can always "drill down" from an article to the next lowest category, no matter where you are. I recall reading this somewhere in the Wikipedia: namespace, but I forget where.</dd>

<dd>It makes sense to me to do it this way, because
<ol>
<li>It would bloat the broader categories if we put every article there, and</li>
<li>If there are a bunch of articles in the Musical notation category, then it stands to reason that <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_notation.html" title="Musical notation">Musical notation</a> should also be there so that it can link to them.

I was curious, because the markup showed that there was obviously an image there, so I tried to restore it on my system, evidently much to the consternation of others. It looks like there's some sort of 250px threshold for...something...for some reason.</dd>

<p>Hi Ardonik, I noticed your comment about adding to plainsong and I think that's a great idea--and thanks for pointing out the mistaken redirect (I fixed it) since Gregorian chant is a subtype of plainsong/plainchant and not the same thing at all. Do you think the major article should be a plainsong or plainchant? Feel free to fix it if you have a preference. I'm glad to see there is at least one other wikipedian interested in this stuff. Best wishes, <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 14:25, 8 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My preference is <i>plainsong</i> (with a redirect from plainchant), as plainchant and Gregorian Chant are easily confused. To make matters more interesting, there appears to be a (Catholic?) movement to have the genre renamed to "Gregorian Chant," dismissing "plainchant" as a neologism designed to deflect the importance of the Church in establishing and promoting the genre. However, there are a number of musical scholars who disagree with this perspective. I learned about the issue through a series of web pages; I sorely wish I had preserved the links to them! I'll try to dig them up and add the information to the plainsong article.<br />
I'm an engineer by trade, so my knowledge of the subject is limited, but I'd love to learn more. Plainchant in all its forms is such beautiful music. To underscore my point, I hope to eventually upload a few public-domain .ogg files for these articles.<br />
That comes later, though; for the time being, I shall wade back into the flames of the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">VfD</a>. --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a> 20:31, Aug 8, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Looks fine to me. You may have an easier time importing the whole thing in one blow and then <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wikify" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:wikify">wikifying</a> the headers and such one by one, instead of importing one chapter at a time. But who knows? Your way may work better. (I tend to use automated text replacement when I want to wikify huge excerpts of text; see, for instance, <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Talk:Powers_of_two" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Talk:Powers_of_two">Wikisource:Talk:Powers of two</a>.)<br />
Of course, the POV "greatest work" thing will have to go. I think the title should be "Das Kapital," since we tend to keep the original foreign language titles (from what I've seen.) --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a> 06:25, Aug 10, 2004 (UTC)

<li>thanks.<br />
the original is already in chapters, so I am just going to put it on the same way to make it easier to compare to the original source.<br />
Das Kapital it is, then.<br />
I'm using html-kit out of familiarity, if you can suggest a better - or favorite one that would be great.<br />
It's not intended that there be links within the text to external (not part of das Kapital) links? correct? as this is a historic document and not a wikipedia article? <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 06:47, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My understanding is that we are strongly discouraged from editing original sources (except to make them easier to navigate, as you are doing.) As I wouldn't even copyedit a single spelling error, I'm pretty sure adding links is not a good idea. As for tools to convert plaintext to formatted HTML, I tend to do it the hard way by writing custom programs. I'm starting to accumulate quite a few of these, and they're only good for one article. I may have to look into HTML-kit one of these days, but programming parsers keeps the brain exercised.  :-) --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a> 08:07, Aug 10, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>(This is in regards to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturist_hot_springs.html" title="Naturist hot springs">Naturist hot springs</a> article.) This is indeed the correct way to contact me, or any other Wikipedian (though it's our talk pages that you should edit rather than our home pages. No big deal.) We generally don't respond to people by e-mail, so there's no need to sign with your address.<br />
In order for the article to stand, it will need to be <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wikify" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:wikify">wikified</a>--that is, brought in line with the standards that the community has adopted for other articles on the Wikipedia. The community will often do this for you, if some kind editor can see the potential in a raw article, but what are we supposed to do when we can't see that potential? That's what VfD (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>) is for; in addition to being a chopping block for articles without encyclopedic merit, VfD is a place where many articles have been beaten into a workable form out of sheer desperation. It happens to many people, so please don't feel as though this process is singling you out.<br />
I was the one who nominated the page for deletion, so I do not feel that I am eligible to vote for either its retention or its deletion. As I know next to nothing about the topic at hand, I can only offer you my personal opinion.
<ol>
<li>First, I think that throwing around the term "naturist" and implying that ancient Native Americans considered themselves naturists is not helping anyone understand your intent. There also appears to be some confusion here between <i>naturalism</i>, which is the study of nature, and <i>naturism</i>, which is the term modern <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudism.html" title="Nudism">nudists</a> prefer to "nudism." I think that the focus should instead be on how Native Americans used hot springs and what specific religious rites were associated with them.</li>
<li>Secondly, I think that the meat of your article ought to become a section of the <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_springs.html" title="Hot springs">hot springs</a> article. As contributors to hot spring publications, I'm sure you two have plenty of useful material to add. Don't feel as though any text currently on the <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_springs.html" title="Hot springs">Hot springs</a> article is sacred; Wikipedians exhort contributors to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold in updating pages</a>. Your changes will, of course, be mercilessly edited later by others whom we also exhort to be bold. We usually like the results.</li>
<li>Third, whether the article is merged or stands on its own, I think it could be vastly improved by references that allowed for independent substantiation. Add a ==References== section to the article for specific citations, or a ==Further reading== section so that people can learn more about the history of hot springs and ancient societies. No specific citation format needs adhering to as long as you provide enough information for people to find the material. We really like <a href="../../../i/s/b/ISBN_9609.html" title="ISBN">ISBN</a> codes, though, if you have 'em. --[[User:Ardonik|<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a>(<a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdonik_e62b.html" title="User talk:Ardonik">talk</a>)]] 05:45, Sep 4, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ardonik, firstly can I say thanks for the respectful and informative message you left regarding the deletion of my link.</p>
<p>Admittedly my link is down to my own POV. I felt compelled to respond to the disparity between the IE / Firefox encyclopaedia entries. As you've seen IE has had more than its fair share of condemnation on this site and I merely wanted to highlight the fact that Firefox is not invulnerable.</p>
<p>I respect your decision and will abide to better etiquette in my future submissions</p>

I hope that's not how I came across--you shouldn't feel compelled to avoid an edit just because some fellow called "Ardonik" didn't like it, and if you disagree with him, by all means revert his stupid changes and leave a comment on the article's talk page! That said, I do see the point that you were trying to make, and I think the best solution to the problem will be to remove the POV additions from <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Explorer_6bc1.html" title="Internet Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>. The article as it stands now essentially condemns the browser, and though (1) I don't like MSIE, and (2) the things the article is saying are essentially true, we'd do better to report IE's flaws and benefits from a neutral point of view.

<p>Hi, Thanks for your comments to my page -- I <b>still</b> don't know whether dialogues should be in User or Talk or replied back to the person making the comment -- it's veddy confusing....</p>
<p>In any case, a couple of months ago I wrote some comments about people submitting articles about themselves that I posted in one of my own pages, and also in a Wiki group that evidently argues about this sort of thing -- right now I can't find that group so I'll just copy what I wrote on my own page:</p>
<ul>
<li>[I do realize the problems with high school students and so forth writing vanity articles about themselves] ...but I *do* think that Wikipedia ought to be encouraging living people to writing about themselves in a substantial way, however, even though this may seem like vanity to others. For instance, right now, the American author Allen Drury, who wrote the famous (and wonderful) Advise and Consent and a *ton* of other books only has a 1-line entry about him. He died a year or so ago at age 90, more or less. It would be nice if someone like him had written several thousand (or more) words about his career, as seen by himself. Now that perspective is lost forever. I think that most people who actually *have* a career, or achievements, worthy of writing about will tend to be over-diffident about themselves if anything. I think that the "vanity" factor that a lot of Wikians worry about is overstated.
<ul>
<li>Since writing the above I've seen a lot more <b>real</b> vanity articles inserted and then deleted but basically I haven't changed my opinion that people ought to be able to write articles about themselves, as long, of course, as it's done in a dispassionate and neutral fashion. In the couple of months that I've been hanging out in WP I've run across dozens of people whose lives ought to be in these (electronic) pages and who don't even have a stub about them. Wouldn't it be nice to have Jack Kramer and Pancho Segura, two great old tennis players who are now close to 80, give us some of their perspective? And there are innumerable thriller writers who are also either v. old or recently dead that it would be nice to hear from. The true vanity articles can easily be seen for what they are and then be deleted. But once a Jack Kramer, or Allen Drury, or (you name your own favorite but relatively obscure S.F. author) is gone, then a lot of priceless info is gone too....
<ul>
<li>Anyway, those are my thoughts on the subject, and I'd be glad to hear your comments if you'd care to give them. It's a situation, I think, in which there can never be any hard and fast rule to apply to <b>all</b> cases, but I think we want to take care that WP doesn't throw the baby out with the bathwater. (For instance, this asshole Wile has edited out what I wrote about Heinlein saying that "Harsh Mistress" was his best book. I put my own name in there because someone else had said earlier that this comment had no attribution to it and had deleted it. So if this comment is allowed to stand deleted, either because <b>my</b> name is there, or because my name <b>isn't</b> there, then WP has lost an important fact, I think: What Heinlein actually thought about his own books....)

<li>I find comments about your behavior <i>on</i> the VfD subpages to be relevant within them. Nevertheless, your request is a fair one and I will comply with it, provided you can do me a favor in turn: please cease at once your off-putting refactorings, VfD subversion, and the lectures you deliver to people who dare to vote delete. As someone noted earlier this weekend, you're beginning to piss a lot of people off. I know you'll see that as a personal attack, but it really is true, and I can provide proof.<br />
Do that, and from now on, my comments about your conduct will go on your talk page (or to RFC, as the case may be.) --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdonik_e62b.html" title="User talk:Ardonik">talk()</a> 01:24, Sep 7, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have challenged the other editors to show me any policy I am directly violating. I cannot find one. Any comment about me, specifically opinion rather than verified actions I performed, will be removed for the reasons I mentioned. I see a solid team of VfD regulars who are opposed to my ideals, and are uniformly challenging my right to improved articles in any way possible in order to prevent deletion. If those other editors had done half the work I am, they would have my respect and quickly realize that they are abusing VfD by listing fixable articles. Its sad that some of them fish <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a> and list first versions of articles on VfD. I consider that lazy action, since doing the research and making improvement is what is needed. I am not the only one that feels this way, and you can see many VfD listings being challenged by other users now. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 01:38, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>Hmm. That's what you see. I see a lone Wikipedian who fancies himself a maverick of sorts, fighting against what he perceives as a cabal united against him (perhaps by blood oath?) You don't like VfD, you don't like the people who regularly participate in VfD, you don't like the votes they make. They're lazy, unwilling to make the Wikipedia better, unmotivated, rabid deletionists, a Good Old Boy's Club, stupid bloody fools. Okay. Good and well.<br />
But removing VfD notices is still vandalism, and the fact remains that you rarely make attempts to reach consensus with aforementioned cabal. (Say, am I part of it? I started in June.) But that's not all--you delete some people's comments and respond to others, you act self-righteous, and your repeated edits border on trolling or vandalism. It's sad, because you make good contributions elsewhere and sometimes you even provide useful input in VfD. Alas that your single-mindedness on this one issue clouds your ability to reason with others who are just as rational as you are.<br />
Netoholic, <a href="../../../t/h/e/There_is_no_cabal.html" title="There is no cabal">there is no cabal</a>. I don't think any useful reform of VfD will stem from your input at this rate.<br />
There, I got that off my chest, and there's no chance you'll "refactor" my words here. --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdonik_e62b.html" title="User talk:Ardonik">talk()</a> 01:50, Sep 7, 2004 (UTC)

<li>Nah, I don't subscribe to any conspiracy theories. All I see is that the VfD process has become bloated, and noone seems willing to make the minimal effort to improve bad articles rather than "thumbs down". -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 01:59, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ignoring, of course, the arguments from myself and others that not everything that isn't a candidate for speedy deserves an article or even a redirect on the Wikipedia. Some articles are crap, and have to go. If this were the TriviaPedia instead of the Wikipedia, perhaps less stringent standards for inclusion could be adopted--having an article on everything that anyone bothered to wikify or somesuch.<br />
I'm a self-described deletionist, but I find <b>archinclusionism</b> to be just as silly as <b>archdeletionism</b>, and I've yet to see you vote to delete any article (you seem to prefer to abstain from voting on crap articles that aren't candidates for speedy.)<br />
Me, I see a VfD process that works beautifully, though the bloatedness cannot be denied, and is bound to get worse in the near future. It will be great if we can get the "VfD enthusiasm" transplanted to Cleanup or Requested Articles, but the VfD system as it stands is a great way to clean up the Wikipedia. That you seem to think that <i>almost everyone</i> participating in the VfD process is doing something wrong is why we're having this exchange. --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdonik_e62b.html" title="User talk:Ardonik">talk()</a> 02:13, Sep 7, 2004 (UTC)

<p>I am afraid you are the victim of a prank.</p>
<p>"<i>Aloysius</i> Charles Swinburne" is supposed to be the tipoff that there is something dodgy about that stanza; I think I may have also posted it once and attributed it to "Winceburn." Some of the postings in alt.quotations begin with the line "And who could possibly remember," which is also intended to be a tipoff, as one might say "who could possibly <i>forget</i>" a famous quotation, but nobody could possibly <b>remember</b> a fake one. I probably should have included one of those tipoffs in my posting.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wrote it, and that's all there is—it's not part of anything longer. Please do not include it in any Wikipedian main namespace. If you feel that you must, indicate that it's a parody and attribute it to "Author unknown" or "anonymous."

<p>hi there. i see what your saying, and i didn't know it had been put up and removed already (and recently). i assume you know about the content of the site. i still don't really see it as a silly 'fan site' as it is there to inform about firefox. still, i wont put it back up as you seem to really want to keep a tight ship. i understand.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, JoeSmack. Thanks for understanding. I don't have anything against the page, but as you know, Google indexes us heavily, so the Wikipedia should not provide free advertising for non-notable sites (that's strike one), spreadfirefox.com is recent and not yet notable (that's strike two), and the external linking on the <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozilla_Firefox_3b86.html" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozilla.html" title="Mozilla">Mozilla</a> articles tends to get waaaaaay out of hand (that's strike three.) I know that everyone means well, but we really have to fight to restrict those areticles to being just encyclopedia articles and not <i>Mozilla community portals.</i> Strangely, no other web browser articles have this problem with "fanlinking."<br />
I think I'm going to blame TechTV for this. Apparently, they promoted this spreadfirefox.com site in a recent show, so a bunch of totally random, well-meaning people now think the <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozilla_Firefox_3b86.html" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> article automatically deserves a link to it. Were you lured to the spreadfirefox site by TechTV, too?<br />
Spreadfirefox.com's advertising is aggressive, but it seems to be better at tooting its own horn than aiding the cause. Time will tell if my words prove true, but in the meantime, I can use all the help I can get to keep the "fanlinking" from overwhelming the article like it did last time. --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdonik_e62b.html" title="User talk:Ardonik">talk()</a> 06:19, Sep 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article was already intact. The vested self interest is dominated by Daniel Boyer and his friends vested self interest in monopolizing surrealism and how it is presented to the public.

Provide <i>solid reasoning</i> for doubting the veracity of the article. If you have citations, documents, or any other counter-evidence, produce them. Take the effort to do this and I will retract my remarks and apologize to you for them.<br />
It's just that I don't take kindly to people who ruin articles by deleting large amounts of material, substituting vague edit summaries for actual attempts to reach consensus; you must understand that we have far too many actual vandals here who behave the same way.

<dd>Jerzy, I strongly recommend that you talk it over with Hemanshu. I don't want to be thrust into the middle of an edit war. He seems genuinely willing to communicate and express his concerns to you (anbd the rest of us) at #wikipedia, and he's also waiting for a message from you on his talk page or WP:VIP. I've been exhorting him to talk, and I'm going to exhort that you talk to him also. Refusing to communicate is what gets us into edit wars to begin with, and they do nothing to further this encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdonik_a1eb.html" title="User:Ardonik">Ardonik</a>.<a href="../../../a/r/d/User_talk%7EArdonik_e62b.html" title="User talk:Ardonik">talk()</a> 17:36, Sep 19, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>He has an unanswered msg on this talk page. (Well, a <i>verbally</i> unanswered one.)</p>
<p>If you'll look at the contribs and histories you'll see that i'm avoiding an edit war by lying down like a rug (tho i won't lie by act or silence about the situation), which is my style in conflicts. I responded at length to his only msg, IMO (as i said in it) more kindly than he deserves. He has not responded to the explanation that he asked for. IMO, every indication -- and notably the fact that you are here begging the one who has sought discussion with him, for nearly a year, to get things rolling -- is that we are not going to interact fruitfully, and that i would end up inflaming the situation by trying to discuss at a point where i think i've said everything helpful that i could say.</p>
<p>The sub-headings are worthwhile, but not worth fighting for. And they can be put back when he gets banned or goes away mad over something else; i'm good at using diffs for that sort of thing, if it doesn't seem just as efficient to recreate them from scratch. If the usefulness of LoPbN hasn't ended first, as the Cat system takes over. In the meantime, i have a backlog of splitting of <i>pages</i> of LoPbN to do, and if he <i>wants</i> to talk at some point, i'll be less likely to lash out then for not having struggled to get him to talk.</p>
<p>Believe me, the key to this is that one side understands this isn't <i>worth</i> an edit war.<br />

<p>This is to thank you for your kind and valuable, and public-spirited intervention, even if i may have seemed pretty ungrateful, or perhaps sarastic (not to say sArdonik [wink]), at the time. My state of mind has improved much faster than my pessimistic prediction, and i've just posted at <a href="../../../h/e/m/User_talk%7EHemanshu_756e.html#Temporary_Heading_Title" title="User talk:Hemanshu">User talk:Hemanshu#Temporary Heading Title</a>.</p>
<p>I consider your removal at <a href="../../../v/i/p/WP%7EVIP_552d.html" title="WP:VIP">WP:VIP</a> a wise approach, especially as the contested edits had reached a natural end point and ceased, 1.5 hrs since, so that clearly no V was IP.</p>
<p>Thanks again for what i think was needed, which promises calm and hope of objective improvement. Please regard this as an expression of satisfaction, without any request either to stay with it or to call it done, as i am quite happy to rely on your fine judgment as to that. [smile]<br />

<p>Ardonik, why exactly do you feign neutrality with regard to involuntary circumcision? Just saying "anti-circumcision" over and over is your way to give up neutrality, as using the anti prefix is a clearly inflammatory <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loaded_term.html" title="Loaded term">loaded term</a>, as if anyone against cutting children doesn't know NPOV from a hole in the ground. I have no problem with allowing and being fully tolerant of your favoritism of circumcision. That is fine with me, even if you are sincere in saying you are neutral. But why do you persist in deleting out opposing points of view? As I read <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> there is clear reason to let both sides present information. And you go farther to claim my statements are a "rant" when I made no assertion of right or wrong whatsoever. I guess your superior powers or whatever give you that privilege? So those are my two cents. I'll stick with the real definition of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> that is defined as allowing both sides to be stated rather than allowing neither one. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 21:54, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have never, <i>ever</i> deleted a single word of yours; the most I've ever done to you (besides attempt to reason with you unsucessfully) is put a useless article up for VfD. If you can't already tell, I'm ineligible to vote in there, so my opinion about Circumciser doesn't matter.<br />
DanP, I think it's time that I stopped attempting to be civil with you — it's getting me nowhere, so I'll employ frankness instead. I'm getting sick and tired of your childish rants, paranoid accusations, and idiotic assumptions about the motives of both me and others (you've made up your mind that we're part of the <s>pro-circumcision</s> <i>pro-mutilation</i> camp as of late.) <b>You're trolling,</b> even if you don't see yourself as doing so. You're making a god-damned fool of both yourself <i>and</i> Intactivism at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Circumciser_ca1b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Circumciser">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Circumciser</a>. Making this encyclopedia better is only a fleeting interest of yours. You're mainly here to inject and enforce your POV and vent your spleen at anyone who doesn't agree with you until they grow bored.<br />
Well, <i>I've</i> grown bored, DanP. Go bug <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriends_of_Robert_de5d.html" title="User:Friends of Robert">User:Friends of Robert</a>.

<dd>Well, I apologize for upsetting you. My motives are not to upset anyone, or enforce POV at all. I do not "represent" intactivism as you clearly suggest. I'm sure I 'could' count all of your accusations and similar childish rants against me just as easily, though I'm not so bitter. I am fully interested in making this encyclopedia a better encyclopedia -- that is not trolling. When I see inconsistency, bias, convenient omissions and falsehoods in an article, should I just let it go? Is that your suggestion to make our encyclopedia better? Man, nice way to encourage contributions. But aside from that, keep up the good work. I can at least appreciate and value your response. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 22:56, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)
