<p>I have added to the Downpatrick (Irish Towns) entry and that led to new pages on St Patrick's Day and Down Cathedral.</p>
<p>I also added a 461AD page (St Patrick's death), but have discovered that a page for 461 already exists. I can't seem to find out how to delete such mistaken pages - any advice, anyone??</p>

<dd>Heya, and first of all: Welcome to Wikipedia!</dd>
<dd>Generally, you'll want to ask questions at the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_Desk_d83b.html" title="Wikipedia:Help Desk">Wikipedia:Help Desk</a>, as people will only come to your talk page if they want to ask or tell you something, which means that especially for new users, there won't be may users coming by here. If you prefer, you can also ask on <a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw">my talk page</a>, I'm happy to help anyone with questions.</dd>
<dd>For the mechanics of deletion, have a look at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>. In this case, since you're the sole author and have requested it to be deleted due to a mistake, I've just deleted it directly without needing to go through the whole voting thing. Once again, welcome to wikipedia and I hope you stick around. --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 20:03, 2005 Jan 18 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Many thanks for the help - I was really concerned about that 461AD page. I will certainly stick around. Will talk to you again. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 22:05, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there a particular reason for splitting off the councils in Northern Ireland? I'm worried it may undermine the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry.html" title="Derry">Derry</a> City/City of <a href="../../../l/o/n/Londonderry.html" title="Londonderry">Londonderry</a> compromise, and few of the articles are very long. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 17:57, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought it was useful to split NI Councils out because they were mixed up very confusingly with cities, towns and counties and are a huge and important part of local democracy here. Not sure I understand your Derry/Londonderry reference - the articles reflect the reality of the situation. Some articles are small, but it is a work in progress, with elections looming --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 18:55, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The compromise titling the article <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry.html" title="Derry">Derry</a> was based an a simplistic historical analysis: once there was a town called "Derry" on the east bank of the Foyle. Then a new "City of Londonderry" was built on the west bank of the Foyle and given a city charter. The current local authority, covering an area which included both banks and more, decided to call itself "Derry City Council", but the city charter was left unchanged. So given that the article covered all three, it was argued that title of the article should be "Derry". But if <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry_City_Council_a64b.html" title="Derry City Council">Derry City Council</a> is a different article then this weakens the case, and could lead to disputes. I will think further. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 22:56, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no way otherwise to get a complete picture of all US airlines. Another approach would be to replace (and reduce) the category "Airline companies of the United States" with "Current airline companies of the United States". For consistency this would then have to be done throughout the Airline category - a bit of a task. --<a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 02:45, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ardfern! The work you're doing with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_airlines.html" title="List of airlines">List of airlines</a> is great but can I ask you to please do more edits at a time. The History Page of that article has a lot of edits by you very close together in time. This makes the history of your edits very long for someone who is checking through them (as I was). Just try to prepare more edits for each time you log on &#160;:-) BestWishes - <a href="../../../a/r/p/User%7EArpingstone_3088.html" title="User:Arpingstone">Adrian Pingstone</a> 18:21, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've noticed that you've been adding code data to a number of airline articles. Instead of using the inline "Code Data" section, please add the {{<a href="../../../a/i/r/Template%7EAirline_infobox_2725.html" title="Template:Airline infobox">airline infobox</a>}} to the article, as we are removing the separate section in favor of the infobox (we may keep the {{<a href="../../../a/i/r/Template%7EAirline_codes_5c20.html" title="Template:Airline codes">airline codes</a>}} template, but as of now that is undecided).

<p>There is a template for the codes that is working it's way into useage on more articles. It has been modified several times as editors have made changes to the way the information is displayed. So, that appears to be the way to go. This template was formed since some articles had this manually entered at the beginning of the articles, in different formats, and other articles had the data under a heading. It also correctly links to other wiki articles.</p>
<p>Destinations have been moved out of many articles since the lists were too long. This data was being updated in a format that closely follows the standard based on continent and country list used in many places in wikipedia. Your lists of destinations, and yes, they are destinations and not services, don't follow anything used by the larger airlines. Your changes also remove corporate ownership which is articles across the board seems to be near the beginning of the article. This is important since many airlines are ownned by a holding company that many own several airlines and related companies. If you want to make whole scale changes like this, I would suggest that you start a wiki airlines project, announce it and discuss it there. Going in and wiping out changes that were standardizing, or had standardized, the data in a way different then yours is counter productive. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 4 July 2005 19:38 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, airlines provide service to destinations. Those are listed by the airline as destinations. They list destinations and they fly to destinations. They offer service to a destination. They don't fly to a service. Airlines on their web sites commonly use 'select destination city' or something simplar for choosing your destination. So destinations would appear to be correct. Bottom line, this probably needs a project to discuss what is the best way to go. I have been flying, for many years and never used or heard the term service applied to destinations. I worked as a travel agent and never used or heard service used to describe destinations. So I don't know where this came from. Wikipedia searching does not add much, the closest is Tourist destination. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 4 July 2005 23:31 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for tidying this article up a bit. I have changed the wikilink to J41s back to <a href="../../../b/a/e/BAe_Jetstream_41_1852.html" title="BAe Jetstream 41">BAe Jetstream 41</a> from <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handley_Page_Jetstream_2443.html" title="Handley Page Jetstream">Handley Page Jetstream</a> because they are two separate articles. The former deals specifically with the J41 whereas the latter deals with earlier versions of the Jetstream. The type acquired by Impulse was the J41. Also, could you please take another look at the part that says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The airline was acquired by Qantas in November 2001, forming part of the QantasLink group of subsidiary airlines. It ceased operations on 24 May 2004 and in May 2005 its operations were integrated into the QantasLink network."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm sure these dates aren't right. This suggests that the airline didn't fly at all between May 2004 and May 2005 but that it re-commenced operations in May 2005. I'm confused because I'm sure that Impulse was flying as Jetstar in 2004. I'm not sure what this section should say.

<dd>I see, I went to culturenornirond.org like you suggested, but they just state that translation there - there's no source given. So I emailed them to see where they got it from. (I'm just interested to know if they've simply done a restrospective Irish translation of the modern name, or whether there's records of the Irish name being used originally, and "Carryduff" is an Anglicised version of the original.)

<li>Fair enough, but he was left "superfluous" and had not been moved to non-fiction writers as you said, I have just done that. When I look at Category:Irish writers I see at a glance at least a half-dozen who are also "Non-fiction" writers and just wonder why they remain. I'm not trying to start a tangle, I just wish to get clear. On the other hand Patrick Augustine Sheehan is in non-fiction but most (or all) of the Canon's writings are fiction. I've written up much of William O'Brien, where does he belong&#160;? or P.A.

<dd>It's good that somebody is trying to bring some order to these categories - your work is appreciated. While it would be nice if we could separate everything into Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland categories, some subjects (as I'm sure you know better than I do) cannot be divided so neatly. Some of the ambiguities, I think, could be cleared up with simple renamings. For example, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBridges_in_Ireland_14fd.html" title="Category:Bridges in Ireland">Category:Bridges in Ireland</a> consists entirely of structures in the Republic of Ireland, so the category could be <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">renamed</a> to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBridges_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland_25af.html" title="Category:Bridges in the Republic of Ireland">Category:Bridges in the Republic of Ireland</a> to avoid ambiguity. I didn't look through all the articles in <a href="../../../c/a/s/Category%7ECastles_in_Ireland_bbd1.html" title="Category:Castles in Ireland">Category:Castles in Ireland</a>, but if all of the ones in Northern Ireland are included in <a href="../../../c/a/s/Category%7ECastles_in_Northern_Ireland_475c.html" title="Category:Castles in Northern Ireland">Category:Castles in Northern Ireland</a>, then it, too, could be renamed (provided the Northern Ireland category is removed as a subcategory). However, an article like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_tallest_structures_in_Ireland_5b74.html" title="List of tallest structures in Ireland">List of tallest structures in Ireland</a> that covers both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland has to go somewhere, and I don't know of a better place than <a href="../../../b/u/i/Category%7EBuildings_and_structures_in_Ireland_475b.html" title="Category:Buildings and structures in Ireland">Category:Buildings and structures in Ireland</a>.

<p>I was just putting an infobox in for the airport. When I checked the official I found that they spell the town "Carrickfinn" rather than "Carrickfin". I checked with Google (not always reliable) and it would seem that the double nn is more common but of course does not mean more correct. If you feel that the single n is the better spelling then can you change it back.

<p>I've never step foot in any of the communities listed. I've never heard of the schools. But I do know that these are articles that deserve to remain on Wikipedia. I have voted to delete articles, almost always because the subject is offensive or hopelessly slanted. So many people seem to have an Encyclopædia Britannica view of what should be on Wikipedia, referring to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as a justification for deletion, when it rarely applies to the article in question. I've done much work on school articles in my home state of New Jersey, and the least I can do is to show respect for those who have created school articles elsewhere.

<p>I saw your post on the Australian notice board, and while I generally agree with you, you're not really helping your own case. The articles you created were all one-sentence stubs of very little interest to anyone who didn't already know the school. One primary reason why we've been relatively successful in getting schools kept in Australia is because we take the time to write useful and interesting articles of at least two or three paragraphs. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 01:50, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I saw the edit you made to the Ballynahinch article. I know you're trying to improve things, I just want to give you my thoughts. The category you have created seems to me to unnecessarily fragment information. Even adding the link would be fine, but removing information about the '97 attack. There's no logic to that. Better to provide a summary and say more information is available at article X, category Y etc. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 22:20, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ardfern I've been de-wikilinking "The Troubles" in subheading as I've recently discovered it is against wikipedia <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Manual of Style</a> guidelines. If you've many more to do, it might be advantageous to not link the Troubles in the subheading, but in the blurb underneath (or not at all - your preference). A couple of other things I've noticed about WP:MOS is that subheadings should ideally not start with the word <i>The</i> (although <i>The Troubles</i> is an obvious exception to this case) nor to include the title of the article itself. Hope this helps, and keep up the good work.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetanta747_5845.html" title="User:Setanta747">Mal</a> 22:51, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ardfern, I noticed you were beefing up some of the NI school articles, thanks for that, it's better for random page users and it should make them less likely to get attacked.

<dd>OK I understand where you are coming from, just wanted to make the point that the reference site you are using is not official. But as you say it does have all three items.

Hi, Ardfern. I think we have a strange situation here. The reference you cited is a printed material, the information is not available on the net, so it is not instantly verifiable; Even so, I have serious doubts that this information is accurate, since I am a Romanian aviation fan and, by consequence, (I believe) I am up-to-date regarding Tarom-related topics. Anyway, there is nothing to do for now, I will just add a question mark on this issue and we'll see, time will tell.

<p>I'm curious about the fleet update. Your figures give 17 DHC6's but KBA's site says they have <a href="http://www.borekair.com/index.php?cat=fleet#" class="external text" title="http://www.borekair.com/index.php?cat=fleet#" rel="nofollow">35</a>.

<dd>I think I found the cause of the difference. It appears that Borek are counting <a href="../../../a/k/l/Aklak_Air_fb86.html" title="Aklak Air">Aklak Airs</a> aircraft as part of their own fleet. A look at the <a href="http://www.aklakair.ca/fleet/dc3t.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.aklakair.ca/fleet/dc3t.asp" rel="nofollow">Aklak DC3T</a> page shows that the link to the gallery leads back to the Kenn Borek site. Also, when I came to work and was looking over the daily aircraft movement log it shows a AKK DHC6 arrival. Yet the only DH6 here is painted black and red (not white) and says "Kenn Borek" on it. Don't know why I didn't think of that before as they quite often come in and out under the two different companies names. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 07:27, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I saw you new article <a href="../../../j/u/m/JumpJet_3f5b.html" title="JumpJet">JumpJet</a>. It is very dated. Do they still exist?

<dd>Hardly "very dated" with a 2006 ref in it. Website is still running and has 2006 dates on it. Looks like it is still going to be set up. Happy for article to be updated when new info comes along, or for it to be moved to defunct airlines if it is never established. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdfern_e088.html" title="User:Ardfern">Ardfern</a> 21:39, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know what you consider to be dated. The article says the airline is "planning to operate services between New Zealand and Australia <b>starting in 2005</b>". The website you mention says very little, but directs potential customers to other airlines. As the 0800 number doesn't work, I'm not going to put in a toll call to Wellington. In the meantime, I'll give the article a haircut. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 22:43, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed you added relatively current fleet info for Tropical Airways, sourced from a reputable magazine. However, the airline's website has gone away and I can't find much evidence that the airline is still in business. I've decided to update the page with the possibility that the airline is defunct. I'm also going to remove the broken web link. But you may want to check that copy of "Flight International" again and fix/reert this if it offers better insight to the health (or lack thereof) for this airline. <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoeverywhere_685f.html" title="User:Goeverywhere">Goeverywhere</a> 07:08, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm wondering what your reasoning was for this? Both airlines trace consider themselves as being established at the earlier date, note for example the "Sixty Years of Aloha" celebration that airline had last year. I'm reverting the changes. -- <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawaiian717_5c0b.html" title="User:Hawaiian717">Hawaiian717</a> 05:06, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree that it makes sense for there to be separate articles for Inter-Island Airways and Trans Pacific Airlines. Yes I see there are some cases where there are separate articles, like the rather convoluted situation with the history of US Airways. However, you'll note that <a href="../../../u/s/a/USAir_3e39.html" title="USAir">USAir</a> redirects to <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Airways_3275.html" title="US Airways">US Airways</a>, and I think the situation with the Hawaii airlines is the same, where a company did little more than change its name. I think when we have a clear case of a single corporate history, splitting it doesn't make sense. Also note that US Airways is categorized in 1937, the establishment date for All American Aviation, and not 1996 when the current name was adopted. -- <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawaiian717_5c0b.html" title="User:Hawaiian717">Hawaiian717</a> 19:04, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ardfen,</p>
<p>I noticed you spent considerable effort in creating the catgories maritime incidents by year. Although an interesting approahc I doubt whether this is truly a useful approach. I can imagine it is for years with a lot of high-profile incidents (WWII comes to mind), but especially for older eras you will end up with many categories consisting of a single incident; for example beasides <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batavia_%28ship%29.html" title="Batavia (ship)">Batavia (ship)</a>, how many other incidents from 1629 do you expect that will be added. IMHO such 1 item categories is a bit contrary of the ideaof categorisation; which is the combination of several or even many related occurences in order to sport a larger trend. Perhaps it may be more fruitful to merge some of the categories. E.g. incidents of the 17th century, 18th century, 19th century, 1900-1914, WWI incidents, 1918-1940, 1940,41,42,43,44,45, 1945-1960 and so on.... That would have another benefit, it would be much easier to maintain decent use of the categories. Just think about it. cheers <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoutf_9ee7.html" title="User:Arnoutf">Arnoutf</a> 12:13, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I notice from some lists that you have been involved in adding people to some of the Northern Irish categories. Could I ask that you be a bit careful in doing so as a lot of people have been added to Northern Irish categories when they weren't from Northern Ireland, specifically all those who lived before 1920. I don't think it's good practice to add people to the Northern Irish lists who lived and died before the existance of the country, it's a bit like labelling everyone born in the old borders of Palestine at the beginning of the 20th century as Israeli because that's what is now there. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 08:58, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No I don't think we should be classifiying them as Northern Irish people, as they simply weren't. They may have been born or lived in the territory that later became Northern Ireland but they aren't as Northern Ireland had nothing to do with them. My point above about calling people born in western Palestine at the beginning of the last century being classified as Israeli is the same point, us deciding that these people are Northern Irish is making big presumptions on these people who for all we know may well have moved (or not) when Northern Ireland was created. I think they should just be classified as Irish as that's what they were. Presuming them to be part of Northern Ireland heritage just doesn't work for me due to the dates and differences in countries/states and the like. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 21:04, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
