<p>Stop the Armenian vandalism. Ardahan is a Turkish province. Someone keeps adding the Armenian spelling whenever I edit the article. Armenia has been an Ottoman province for many centuries and I could add the Turkish/Ottoman spellings for every Armenian province/city related article but that is considered vandalism and I won't do that. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenix_6edc.html" title="User:Denix">Denix</a></p>

<p>Once again, I removed an irrelevant link from this article and multiple users keep adding it back. There is NO Armenian presence in Ardahan. The link redirects to "armeniapedia", a 100% biased Armenian wikipedia clone filled with Armenians. The article is written in Armenian, therefore not understandable by foreigners. It could contain false information, insults etc. I suggest you remove this link: <a href="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Ardahan" class="external free" title="http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Ardahan" rel="nofollow">http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Ardahan</a><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenix_6edc.html" title="User:Denix">Denix</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenix_f71c.html" title="User talk:Denix">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denix_8cb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denix">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>No one ever said there are Armenians living in Ardahan today, but it historically had a large Armenian population. The link is about the <b>history</b> of the city, not it's current status. I believe the page is taken from Soviet documents, actually. I fail to see any reason to remove the link other than personal prejudice. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 04:46, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Khoikhoi is right, it is from Soviet documents, and as you can read from the parts already translated to English (which the entire page will be in eventually), there is nothing sinister or false in the article, even though it is on a website "filled with Armenians" (gasp!). In fact, if you find anything 100% biased on the site like you claim, go ahead and click on... "edit this page". It is a wiki, as you say, and that is what wikis are all about. I should warn you that I do (as the administrator of that site) expect quality and (yes) unbiased edits however. --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 18:12, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I do use Wikipedia a lot, but I wouldn't recommend it as a reliable source for history or political articles. There will always be biased retards editing / vandalizing articles until their own view is reflected in it and they are satisfied because they have admins as friends and they can easily get other users banned.

<dd>Let's, for the sake of argument, say that "unfortunately, you are not mistaken". Given that, you and I and the whole world know that policies change. Or do we really? Let me ask it in another way, what year <b>are</b> we in? (notice the bolded text, and notice your previous remarks in the present tense. Please do not sidestep.)</dd>
<dd>Let's try another thing...again, let's say "unfortunately, you are not mistaken". The Kurdish guerrillas did not start their "activities" until mid 80's. Now, what "strict policy" are we talking about?</dd>
<dd>You can choose to extend this debate, as an Armenian. But let me tell you something...as a Turk with Kurdish blood in him, as someone who lost his uncle to Armenian terrorists and brethren-in-arms to Kurdish guerrillas, as someone who has been shot on by the same guerrillas...please spare me the armchair "holier-than-thou", smart attitude. If you want to contribute to knowledge and to Wikipedia, be my friend and my mentor, go right ahead, I'll follow. But if you want to spend endless hours in front of your computer extending decades-old single-sided hatred towards Turks, I am not your man. <a href="../../../m/u/5/User%7EMu5ti_f9e7.html" title="User:Mu5ti">Mu5ti</a> 04:02, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not really sure I fully understand your point in the beginning. Someone said they did not believe the stuff written here about history, politics. I am simply pointing out that (assuming this person grew up in Turkey - which seems quite likely) this person was raised in a country where free speech on these issues was not allowed, and they were not exposed to the truth as the rest of the world knows it. A very VERY important realization that tens of millions of Turks need to understand. If you are hinting this was all in the past - it is only because of EU entry that certain things have begun to change... but if you want present tense, Turkey's most famous writer (internationally) was just on trial and let off on a bit of a technicality for saying there was an Armenian Genocide and that Kurds were mistreated. Armenians still haven't gotten any of the property stolen from them back during, or after the Armenian Genocide (when all Armenian community property purchased since some date in the 1930s began being confiscated under a treaty provision meant to protect them, not screw them), and I, personally, am forbidden to climb Mt. Ararat simply because my last name ends in -ian. I was informed this, and others have been. My intent is not to debate, simply to point out simple truths. Truths that are blatantly obvious to everyone in the planet except Turks. I can be your best friend, but I cannot shut up about these truths. And fyi, if you consider yourself a Turk, you are a Turk, but don't think your "other bloods" stop with the recent Kurdish blood. --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 04:07, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It says she was born in Kars region.

<dd>I encourage Raffi to add to this article, with information based on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. I'm sure the Ardahan article on Armeniapedia is referenced, so we can use those sources to expand this page. However, "links to open wikis" is listed on the "Links normally to be avoided" section of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. This does not stop us from adding Armenian history to this article. I hope we can edit constructively from now on rather than edit warring over external links. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 06:31, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Concur. In fact, I will create a history sub-section myself and add a couple of paragraphs in it so that such edit-wars can be avoided in the future, after the article gets unprotected. After I have created the section, I will remove the link and I will leave the further expansion of the section on users who might be more knowledgable about the subject. I personally have no idea about Ardahan or its history, so I am not qualified. If this is ok, there is no need for further protection. Let's wait for a couple of days to see if there are any further comments. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 07:37, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The policy states: "Links to open wikis, except those with a substantial history of stability and a substantial number of editors." I would certainly argue that Armeniapedia falls under the category of substantial history of stability, and though I am not sure what "substantial number of editors" amounts to, every single edit since the site went up has been carefully monitored. In other words, though the script is a wiki and anyone can edit, the entire thing is under my careful supervision and I think avoids the usual issues that open wikis represent, and therefore again, I consider Armeniapedia to be an exception. I feel like an link to an article on the Armenian history and presence in the town is a positive addition to the Wikipedia article, until such time that the article incorporates that information substantially itself. And although I am a frequent contributor to this site, I'm sure you'll understand if I do not copy and paste every bit of work I do from my site to this one. So. Where does that leave us? Do I need to change the format of my site or lock it from external editors in order for it to become reliable or is my dictatorial level of supervision enough?? --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 16:04, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In any case, see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a>. In fact, you should avoid making any additions of links to your website yourself. By the way, hence my comment about reliability: If the website is under the strict monitoring of only one person, that site cannot be considered reliable, no matter if its turcopedia, chinesepedia, brazilopedia or etc. Nothing stops anyone from adding to this article, as long as it is in sync with Wiki guidelines, such as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. In any case, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a> are clear. Reverting the addition of links of websites added by their webmasters is not "vandalism". However, I will create a section and try to expand it in this article a little bit, then remove the link as a compromise. <i>Nevertheless</i>, please do not add the links to your website yourself in the future. I have also deleted <i>many</i> external links to websites created and run by Turkish editors, political or simply commercial, for similar reasons as cited above in <i>many</i> articles. Open wikis cannot be considered as stable all the time. In any case, by your own words, you admitted that it is pretty much a site practically run by one single person with occasionnal "dictatorially" monitored contributions. That fails the spirit of "significant number of contributors" criteria. On a side note, please also see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>; saying "I suspect racist in motivation", then putting msgs to the talk pages by saying "thank you for confirming my suspicions!" is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> as well.

<dd>Yes, I read the conflict of interest clause as well which says you should *try* to avoid it. I can see why, since on my own wiki as well people try to promote low to no quality sites of theirs, in irrelevant places. So again, I feel that I am not violating the letter, nor the spirit of this rule. If it is under strict supervision of one person OF COURSE it can still be quite reliable. There are other contributors, but imagine it is not a wiki at all for all practical purposes. How does a non-wiki automatically become unreliable??? A site is unreliable due to its content being unreliable/poor, and I think if you actually took the time to look, you'd be surprised at how neutral and plentiful the information is. I am sorry if you follow my edits and don't like my stated suspicion, but having read the NPA, I don't believe my statement quite is an "attack". So that just leaves my lack of belief in your good faith, which I must say this exchange and my long history of fighting to maintain a mention of Armenians in articles related to Anatolia and modern Azerbaijan kind of has trained me to doubt. Your lack of faith in my ability to create a reliable site is simply wrong, a lack of good faith, and I feel a sort of a personal attack... So what can I say? It doesn't look like the two of us are coming closer to agreement. I hope Kholkhoi agrees with some of my explanations, but in any case I will wait for his word on this matter... --<a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERaffiKojian_530a.html" title="User:RaffiKojian">RaffiKojian</a> 14:19, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>lol. I know that it is to be "avoided". But "terrorist" is also a word to "avoid". If there is no rule set in stone, maybe I should go to ASALA article and add "terrorist"? Even Bin Laden article tries to avoid the mention of the word terrorist as much as it can, so "avoid" is not such a flexible word. Anyways...</dd>
<dd>Listen, I know my way around many things and Net is definitely one of them. I have read Armeniapedia from back to front and I also know some of the arguments that have taken place about it in many pages. I also read the Ardahan article. First of all, a majority of the text is in Armenian. That's not a problem per se however. It wouldn't be too fair to demand that it be translated perfectly since I imagine that it is not easy to run a site with such a large scope. And I am sure that you are trying to do something that you believe is good, I respect that. I also understand your AGF problems, I <i>know</i> what goes around, believe me.</dd>
<dd>But I also have one problem: the inclusion of that link is also used as the promotion of that site in the sense that, it takes the reader of this article to a site whose content is used to highlight info that some consider that others "need to know", like you said in your post way above in response to another Turkish user. When I click on that link, I am not simply going to an article about Ardahan: it is going to take me to a website whose primary focus is to highlight one nation. I don't know what made you create that wiki, but I suspect similar reasons that lead to the creation of creationwiki et al: inability to shape Wikipedia as you would like to (you here is not personal). This is not relevant, but I can't help but note for the record that this is a way to circumvent the "wikiprocess" and include info in Wikipedia through the backdoor. Basically: better stick to Wikipedia and contribute like the rest of us. Anyways, this is not relevant, but I feel that this is really the case. <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> doesn't include the evolution article of CreationWiki as an external link, if you catch my drift... Now, don't get me wrong, as an atheist I consider CreationWiki to be, well, you know what I mean, and I am not saying it is the same thing for armeniapedia, I am sure that there is a lot of good content in there (even though they do seem to point a bit too much to Turkey&#160;:)). If you felt that I was doubting your good faith to be able create a reliable site, then I apologize, since that wasn't the case. I can generally seperate content disputes from faith issues. People can disagree greatly, but they might truly feel that they are right. Similar...</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless, I hear your points, and to be fair I will admit that, unless the Wikipedia articles such as Ardahan are expanded, the inclusion of the armeniapedia link can make sense, <i>even though</i> I still stand behind what I said earlier about EL and Conflict of interest. I gave this some thought actually, and I will AGF since we never ran into each other, and what you said about how your AGF got worn out because of the past is valid enough; so I can understand your reaction. I am a blunt person, I will let know of what I think of something quite clearly... What I am saying is, for me the link is ok, but <i>only</i> for those articles in Wikipedia whose content is lacking. If there is a section in a Wikipedia article with the same scope, then it becomes duplication of POV and/or emphasis. I generally do a lot of general cleanup tasks around many articles, and have been trying to clean up Turkish city articles, so if I come across any such situations, I will act consistent with what I just wrote in the spirit of good faith. As for this article, I no longer have problems with it staying <i>until</i> the history section is expanded (which I will actually try to do when it is unprotected).

<dd>I appreciate your sentiments. Let me say that if the content on the Armeniapedia page is represented on WP, I have no problem with the link being removed from WP, since I agree a link should lead users to additional info, but in this case for example it would be hard for an article called <i>Ardahan</i> to match what I would hope my site could offer. Instead, it would probably need to be an article called <i>Armenian history and presence in Ardahan</i>. That has to do with the philosophy of my site and its reason for being - which has nothing to do with POV or circumventing the way this wiki works. So since the subject has come up, let me just give some background on the philosophy of Armeniapedia vs. Wikipedia. The philosophy of Armeniapedia is simply to contain every bit of information in the planet that relates to Armenia(ns)! So, like "About the articles" on the main page explains, <i>"Articles about things not Armenian are here only to give the Armenian angle, or connection. The Bob Dole page will therefore only contain letters, references, information on his activities related to Armenian(ns)."</i> (hardly worth mentioning on Wikipedia). And in addition to this it contains much that is not "encyclopedic", another very important distinction. I cannot put an Armenian cookbook, lessons, books, etc on this site. It is not permitted. Armeniapedia is perfect for all these things. If I could find a way to synchronize certain articles which are <i>about</i> Armenia or an Armenian between the sites, I'd love to. That would save me a lot of headache and I wouldn't mind at all if all the editing/traffic went to Wikipedia. I also have a lot of links to Wikipedia on the site and wouldn't care if every single page was linked to a relevant article. I like for Armenians to be exposed to both. I also enjoy contributions on Armeniapedia and if they reach a level where there is a decent, trustworthy community established, at that time I could worry about distributing editorial powers - which by coincidence I just granted to a fellow I know from wikipedia here just a few days ago. So in any case, I hope that better explains the site and its intentions to you, which I felt I owed you since you have given me the benefit of the doubt. Also, I would love to finish a proper translation of the Armeniapedia article, but my written Eastern Armenian is not up to par - I am doing what I can. Also, I really strive to be as neutral as anybody, and would genuinely welcome constructive edits from anyone on any article on Armeniapedia.
