He founded a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monastery.html" title="Monastery">monastery</a> there in the 6th century, but both town and monastery were destroyed by fire in 1089, and again in 1151.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/o/r/Normans.html" title="Normans">Norman</a> influence can still be seen not only in the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, but also in local families such as the Cantillons (Barons de <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballyheigue.html" title="Ballyheigue">Ballyheigue</a>), and Fitzmaurices, and in place names, such as Ballintobeenig, a nearby townland below Mt. Crusline called after <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Aubin_b2aa.html" title="St. Aubin">St. Aubin</a>. The 1st Lord Kerry, Thomas FitzMaurice, founded a <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franciscan.html" title="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> friary there in 1253, and Nicholas, the 2nd Lord Kerry, built a <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leper.html" title="Leper">leper</a> house there in 1312.

It was the seat of a <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishopric.html" title="Bishopric">bishopric</a> until 1660.</p>

En route, true to his family arms and Constantinian motto (<a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Hoc_Signo_Vinces_6bfa.html" title="In Hoc Signo Vinces">In Hoc Signo Vinces</a>) and in anticipation of the battle to come at <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinsale.html" title="Kinsale">Kinsale</a>, he visited and venerated a relic of the <a href="../../../t/r/u/True_Cross_2696.html" title="True Cross">True Cross</a> (<a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_rood.html" title="Holy rood">Holy rood</a>) on the Feast of St. Andrew, on November 30, 1601 at <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Cross_Abbey_8a8f.html" title="Holy Cross Abbey">Holy Cross Abbey</a>, near <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thurles.html" title="Thurles">Thurles</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_Tipperary_285e.html" title="County Tipperary">County Tipperary</a>, which was a rallying point for the defence of religious freedom and for Irish sovereignty. From there he sent an expedition to Ardfert, to win a quick victory and successfully recover the territory of his ally, Fitzmaurice, Lord of Kerry, who had lost it and his 9-year old son, to Sir Charles Wilmot. The expedition captured Caislean Gearr (Short Castle, of which no trace remains), adjacent to the Cathedral in Ardfert.

Tomb of John O'Donnell in the grounds of Ardfert Cathedral</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A large tomb in the grounds of the cathedral was built much later by John O'Donnell (1803-1879), the most prominent descendant two centuries later, and whose own direct male descendant was the late <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Denis_O%27Donnell_3048.html" title="Patrick Denis O'Donnell">Patrick Denis O'Donnell</a> (1922-2005), well-known Irish military historian. The family seat of John O'Donnell, at Tubrid, mentioned by Lewis in his Topographical Dictionary of 1837, passed through a female line to the O'Carrolls.</p>
<p>The area is rich in terms of its archaeological heritage. The medieval cathedral, St. Brendan's, and associated churches, Temple na Hoe (Church of the young Virgin) and Temple na Griffin, have become a major tourist <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage.html" title="Heritage">heritage</a> attraction in the Kerry area due to their central location. The 13th Century Franciscan Friary to the north east of the village is of equal merit, but due to its peripheral location, its contribution to the character of the village is not as obvious. It was once an integral part of Ardfert Abbey - not an abbey at all but the name of the Talbot-Crosbie mansion destroyed by fire in 1922 by the IRA.</p>
<p>Five structures included on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS) are located in Ardfert; St Brendan’s Catholic Church (consecrated in 1855), the Old Gates of the Earl of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glandore.html" title="Glandore">Glandore</a>'s Demesne, the Talbot-Crosbie Memorial, the Ardfert Parish Room (now a site registered as derelict by Kerry County Council) and Brandon House. There are also many other structures within the village which are not included in the RPS, but are considered to be of considerable architectural and heritage value, such as the Ardfert Retreat Center. Of note are the surviving <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estate_%28house%29.html" title="Estate (house)">estate</a> walls which contribute to the character and identity of the village. The following structures are of particular merit and should be considered for inclusion in the Record of Protected Structures:- Gate lodge adjacent to the Ardfert Retreat Centre; Gate Lodge at Skrillagh, Ardfert; Cut stone structures adjacent to St Brendan’s Church.</p>

<p>From the seventeenth century (possibly 1639) until 1800 the area was a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borough_constituency.html" title="Borough constituency">borough constituency</a>. The borough <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporation.html" title="Corporation">corporation</a> (its local Council) elected two members of the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_House_of_Commons_eec2.html" title="Irish House of Commons">Irish House of Commons</a>. The borough was disenfranchised by the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Act_of_Union_1800_7ae6.html" title="Act of Union 1800">Act of Union 1800</a> and from 1801 the area was represented as part of the <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_constituency.html" title="County constituency">county constituency</a> of Kerry. Ardfert lost <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borough.html" title="Borough">borough</a> status under section 13 of the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipal_Corporations_%28Ireland%29_Act_1840_3a48.html" title="Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840">Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840</a>. It was one of fifty-eight borough corporations dissolved on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">25 October</a> <a href="../../../1/8/4/1840.html" title="1840">1840</a>. At this time, about a half-mile east of the Cathedral, Ardfert Abbey was the home of the Crosbies, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_Brandon_3cda.html" title="Baron Brandon">Baron Brandon</a>, and contained the ruins of the old Franciscan Abbey. They also maintained a well-stocked deer-park, and extensive gardens.</p>
<p>The village is located within an area of good agricultural land which is flat and low-lying. The main Tralee-<a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballyheigue.html" title="Ballyheigue">Ballyheigue</a> road bisects the village in an east–west axis and road width restrictions on the western side of the village leads to traffic congestion. To the north of the village the Tyshe River traverses the village road network. The village settlement pattern is radial and dispersed and consists of a mixture of single site depth development along radial roads interspersed with <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housing_estate.html" title="Housing estate">housing estates</a>. Within the core of the village there is a mix of dwelling types of various traditional designs. More modern design predominates in the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-off_housing.html" title="One-off housing">one-off housing</a> on the radial routes. The largely linear settlement form is undermining the traditionally compact and sustainable urban form. The development of a central <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retail.html" title="Retail">retail</a> and social node has been constrained to some extent by need to protect historic buildings and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monuments.html" title="Monuments">monuments</a> within the village. The traditional urban form and structure which has defined the streetscape is being undermined by fragmented building lines and architectural design elements which do not relate in scale or character to existing development.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village.html" title="Village">village</a> offers a comprehensive range of local <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goods_and_services.html" title="Goods and services">goods and services</a>. Despite its advantages, demand has been suppressed by a lack of <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wastewater_treatment.html" title="Wastewater treatment">wastewater treatment</a> capacity. There are, however, sizeable landbanks in core areas within the village to allow for sustainable growth. While Ardfert provides a very broad range of services, for a settlement of its size, serving the local community and rural hinterlands, recent developments have increased its role as a <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dormitory_suburb.html" title="Dormitory suburb">dormitory suburb</a> for <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tralee.html" title="Tralee">Tralee</a>. Local <a href="../../../e/m/p/Employment.html" title="Employment">employment</a> possibilities are limited with no major employer or industry. The village also functions as a local service centre for the surrounding agricultural hinterland. The village also acts as a convenience stop for tourist and local through traffic. The village is well served by social and <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retail.html" title="Retail">retail</a> services. The village core houses a <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_Office_4bd6.html" title="Post Office">Post Office</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garda.html" title="Garda">Garda</a> station, health centre, garage, petrol station and a number of retail outlets and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_house.html" title="Public house">public houses</a>. In addition there is a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Church, a school and a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Community_centre.html" title="Community centre">community centre</a> with gym and launderette. <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planning_permission.html" title="Planning permission">Planning permission</a> for residential development has recently been permitted on the existing <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_Athletic_Association_dab2.html" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> (GAA) grounds, with replacement facilities planned elsewhere on the periphery of the village.</p>
<p>The village is experiencing significant residential growth, and while there is already a significant level of service provision within the village, including a new modern medical centre, further parallel growth in retail, employment, civic and other services and facilities will be necessary if the independent character of the village is to be maintained. In particular growth in local employment opportunities will promote the sense of local community and identity, and balance the tendency towards its development as a <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dormitory_town.html" title="Dormitory town">dormitory town</a> for <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tralee.html" title="Tralee">Tralee</a>.</p>
<p>Ardfert has developed around a crossroads of local roads and the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tralee.html" title="Tralee">Tralee</a>-<a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballyheigue.html" title="Ballyheigue">Ballyheigue</a> regional road. There is therefore, a considerable level of through traffic, and its infrastructure needs to be better planned and developed. This situation is compounded by the quarry to the north east of the village which generates significant HGV traffic movements through the village. During the summer months the situation is exacerbated by through traffic to coastal locations. The <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tralee.html" title="Tralee">Tralee</a>-<a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballyheigue.html" title="Ballyheigue">Ballyheigue</a> Road at the northern end of the village is too narrow to allow traffic to flow freely and the consequent bottleneck delays traffic into and out of the village. The building line of existing development does not allow for the widening of the road. In order to reduce traffic congestion, through traffic must be diverted around the village. Existing footpaths are segmented and piecemeal and pavements are not provided throughout the entire plan area. The majority of the plan lands are within 800 metres or ten minutes walk of the village centre. There is therefore excellent potential to encourage pedestrian and cyclist activity.</p>
<p>The population of Ardfert village was recorded as 596 persons in 2002 (Central Statistics Office), an increase of 3.8% on the previous recorded figure. Projected growth based on this intercensal percentage increase would result in a population increase of 64 persons over the next five years. It is, however, likely due to a number of factors that demand will be significantly higher over the next few years.</p>

 Ardfert also has the distinction of winning the All-Ireland junior football championship in <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croke_Park_ebdd.html" title="Croke Park">Croke Park</a> on the 19 February 2006 beating <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loughrea.html" title="Loughrea">Loughrea</a> of <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galway.html" title="Galway">Galway</a> 1-7 (10pts) to 9pts. On winning the county junior final 2005 Ardfert was promoted to the intermediate championship. Success followed later that year as they defeated Annascaul in the kerry intermediate championship final. The team's accomplishments were further cemented when they won the intermediate championship All-Ireland final defeating Derry and Ulster Eoghan Ruadh by a scoreline of 1-4 (7pts) to 5pts on the 10th of March 2007 again in Croke Park. As of 10th of March 2007 Ardfert have not lost a county or national championship fixture in three years.

<p>The village development strategy is to facilitate the continued development of Ardfert as an independent viable village and to ensure that the nature and form of future development will enhance and protect its character and heritage. This will be achieved by:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing its function as a local service centre by encouraging additional commercial, civic and community facilities on mixed use sites within the village core.</li>
<li>Encouraging a compact village structure to promote efficiency of service delivery.</li>
<li>Identifying an area to act as a central focus and by developing an attractive public domain to facilitate community development.</li>
<li>Facilitating the development of walking and cycling routes throughout the village and particularly from development areas to the village centre and service centres.</li>
<li>Facilitating development that preserves and enhances the cultural, architectural and historic character of the village.</li>
