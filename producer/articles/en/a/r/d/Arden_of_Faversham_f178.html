<p><i><b>Arden of Faversham</b></i> (also called <i>Arden of Feversham</i>) is an <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan_theatre.html" title="Elizabethan theatre">Elizabethan</a> play, entered into the Register of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worshipful_Company_of_Stationers_and_Newspaper_Makers_8dba.html" title="Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers">Stationers Company</a> on April 3, <a href="../../../1/5/9/1592.html" title="1592">1592</a>, and printed later that same year by Edward White. It depicts the murder of one Thomas Arden by his wife and her lover, and their subsequent discovery and punishment. The play is notable as perhaps the earliest surviving example of "domestic <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tragedy.html" title="Tragedy">tragedy</a>," a form of Renaissance play which dramatized recent and local crimes rather than far-off and historical events. The author is unknown; some have claimed, on slender evidence, that it was <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>.</p>

<p>Thomas Arden, or Arderne, was a successful businessman in the early <a href="../../../t/u/d/Tudor_period.html" title="Tudor period">Tudor period</a>. Born in 1508, probably in Norwich, Arden took advantage of the tumult of the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformation.html" title="Reformation">Reformation</a> to make his fortune, trading in the former monastic properties dissolved by <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_VIII_1afb.html" title="Henry VIII">Henry VIII</a> in <a href="../../../1/5/3/1538.html" title="1538">1538</a>. In fact, the house in which he was murdered (which is still standing in <a href="../../../f/a/v/Faversham.html" title="Faversham">Faversham</a>) was a former guest house of the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedictine.html" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> abbey near town. His wife Alice had taken a lover, a man of low status named Mosby; together, they plotted to murder her husband. After several bungled attempts on his life, two ex-soldiers from the former English dominion of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calais.html" title="Calais">Calais</a> known as Black Will and Loosebag (called Shakebag in the play) were hired and continued to make botched attempts. Arden was finally killed in his own home on Feb. 14, 1551, and his body was left out in a field during a snowstorm, hoping that the blame would fall on someone who had come to Faversham for the St Valentine's Day fair. The snowfall stopped, however, before the killers' tracks were covered, and the tracks were followed back to the house. Bloodstained swabs and rushes were found, and the killers quickly confessed. Alice and Mosby were put on trial and convicted of the crime; he was hanged and she burnt at the stake in 1551. Black Will may also have been burnt at the stake after he had fled to Flanders: the English records state he was executed in Flanders, while the Flemish records state he was extradited to England. Loosebag escaped and was never heard of again. Other conspirators were <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanged_in_chains.html" title="Hanged in chains">hanged in chains</a>. One - George Bradshaw, who was convicted by an obscure passage in a sealed letter he had delivered - was wrongly convicted and posthumously acquitted.</p>
<p>The story would most likely have been known to <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabethan.html" title="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> readers through the account in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holinshed.html" title="Holinshed">Holinshed</a>'s Chronicles, although the murder was so recent, and so memorable, that it is also likely that it was in the living memory of some of the anonymous playwright's acquaintances.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/d/Arden_of_Faversham_f178.html" title="Edit section: The Play">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Play</span></h2>
<p>The playwright followed the account in Holinshed's chronicle fairly closely, not only in the sequence of events leading to the murder and trial, but also in the unusually complex thematics of the event. From the first scene, Arden is a markedly ambiguous character; he is shown to be intemperate, domineering, and deceitful, having just in essence stolen a piece of land from a fellow townsman named Green. These touches of characterization do not, of course, alter the play's basic intent, announced on the title page, to show "the great malice and dissimulation of a wicked woman, the insatiable desire of filthy lust, and the shameful end of all murderers"; they do, however, reveal an ability to create complex characters decidedly above the norm for anonymous Elizabethan playwrights. A similar complexity is found in the murder scenes, which combine genuine tension, for instance in the assassins' attempts to find Arden on a foggy night, with almost bathetic humor, in their incompetent attempts on the man's life.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/d/Arden_of_Faversham_f178.html" title="Edit section: Text and history">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Text and history</span></h2>
<p>The play was printed anonymously in three <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_size.html" title="Book size">quarto</a> editions during the period, in 1592 (Q1), 1599 (Q2), and 1633 (Q3). The last publication occurred in the same year as a broadsheet ballad written from Alice's point of view. The title pages do not indicate performance or company; while this absence is not unheard of, it does suggest that the play may have been written outside the mainstream of the Elizabethan theater. However, the play was never fully forgotten. For most of three centuries, it was performed in <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lillo_188d.html" title="George Lillo">George Lillo</a>'s adaptation; the original was brought back to the stage in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, and has received intermittent revivals since. It was adapted into a ballet at <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadler%27s_Wells_fe05.html" title="Sadler's Wells">Sadler's Wells</a> in 1799, and into an opera, <i>Arden Must Die</i>, by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Goehr_a4e9.html" title="Alexander Goehr">Alexander Goehr</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>.</p>
<p>The question of the text's authorship has been analyzed at length, but with no decisive conclusions. Claims that <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakespeare.html" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> wrote the play were first made in 1770 by the Faversham antiquarian <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Jacob_9cd0.html" title="Edward Jacob">Edward Jacob</a>. Others have also claimed for Shakespeare, for instance <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algernon_Swinburne_a890.html" title="Algernon Swinburne">Algernon Swinburne</a>, and the nineteenth-century critics Charles Knight and Nicolaus Delius. These claims may be rejected as impressionistic, although it is not inconceivable that Shakespeare had a hand in certain scenes.</p>
<p>There are two circumstantial connections with Shakespeare that hint at his involvement either as an actor or a writer. First, the Lord Chamberlain's players, the company with whom Shakespeare performed, staged the play at least once. It has been speculated that Shakespeare might have taken the part of Shakebag, who, untypical for a ruffian, often speaks in verse rather than prose. Second, the play's publisher, Edward White, also published an edition of <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titus_Andronicus_3a0b.html" title="Titus Andronicus">Titus Andronicus</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlowe.html" title="Marlowe">Marlowe</a> has also been advanced; the strong emotions of the characters and the lack of a strongly marked virtuous hero are certainly in line with Marlowe's practice. Moreover, Marlowe was raised in nearby Canterbury and is likely to have had the knowledge of the area evinced by the play. Another candidate, favored by critics <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Gard_Fleay_9c47.html" title="Frederick Gard Fleay">F. G. Fleay</a> and Charles Crawford, is <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Kyd_f5a9.html" title="Thomas Kyd">Thomas Kyd</a>, who at one time shared rooms with Marlowe. However, without more knowledge of the text's history than is possessed at present, all ascriptions are bound to be speculative in nature.</p>
<p>In 2006, a new computer analysis of the play and comparison with the Shakespeare corpus by Arthur Kinney, of the Massachusetts Center for Renaissance Studies at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Massachusetts_d915.html" title="University of Massachusetts">University of Massachusetts</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, and Hugh Craig, director of the Centre for Linguistic Stylistics at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Newcastle_e738.html" title="University of Newcastle">University of Newcastle</a> in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, found that word frequency and other vocabulary choices were consistent with this play being written by Shakespeare. <a href="http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/newsreleases/articles/39476.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/newsreleases/articles/39476.php" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> However, it is worth noting that this data has not necessarily been peer-reviewed, and it is also likely that such a method would encounter some difficulties, especially since there are three editions of the play, and editors differ in their 'interpretations', that is, different words will be used by different editors. This allows for the possibilty of the different versions of the play being a closer 'fit', as well as the possibility that they are testing a text that has been corrupted by some four hundred years of editing, some of which, perhaps, may have been influenced by Shakespeare's language and his impact on the conventions of Elizabethian theatre. As some have said, it may be the case "that the only reason for ascribing the play to Shakespeare is its merit". Thus, while new methods may cast new light on authorship, it may well equally be the case that authorship will never be sufficiently proven.</p>
