<p>Can anyone help me as ho HOW the article Calgary Science School needs to be cleaned up??</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello, first let me say the tagging of the article you wrote isn't meant as something mean to you or even necessarily a message for you to fix it. It's a way we tag things so that people who want to format articles can find the ones that need to be formatted. I have added the tag back to the article. Having that tag on it just puts it on a list for people in the cleanup project&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you would like to fix it up yourself that would be great too, the two pages I would suggest reading for help with it are <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. Remember this isn't an essay but an encyclopedia, so we are ideally only looking for factual information presented from a very neutral point of view. The manual of style is very helpful, but one of the best ways to learn about good formatting is to look at a few of our <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles</a> and see what formatting standards they implement.</dd>

<dd>Hope that answered your question, if not feel free to update it either on my talk page or on the newcomers page where you listed your original question. - <a href="../../../c/o/h/User%7ECohesion_07b5.html" title="User:Cohesion">cohesion</a><font color="#CC0033">★</font><a href="../../../c/o/h/User_talk%7ECohesion_c433.html" title="User talk:Cohesion">talk</a> 03:35, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not quite sure what article you are referring to.

<dd>Hmm. So I guess I *did* delete it; way back in April. Here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Arden_shibley" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Arden_shibley" rel="nofollow">log</a>. I don't think I would be a good idea for me to tell you who created the page. Nothing personal, I just don't see the need to do so. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 23:49, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>FYI, the person who created the page used a throwaway account, so IMO, it won't really help much anyhow. And the editor hasn't edited in quite some time. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 19:27, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's my understanding that warning a user of a speedy delete may be appreciated in some cases, but it isn't necessary all the time. The difference between speedying a page and the more deliberative prod and AfD procedures is that speedy deletion is reserved for pages which are obviously and blatantly inappropriate for Wikipedia. Most of the pages I speedy tag are their author's sole contribution. In such cases, I think it's safe to assume 1)that the author doesn't particularly care about the quality of wikipedia and 2)that the author is aware that their page is not appropriate, and is probably aware that it will soon be deleted. When there is a significant chance an author might become a serious contributor, and failing to notify them of a speedy deletion might alienate them from Wikipedia, I notify them. Generally, however, I feel such notifications are a waste of time for the sake of politeness that is unlikely to be appreciated. If you feel differently, however, by all means notify users of speedy tags.

<p>Please consider removing the tag you placed on this article, for the reasons I have stated on the talk page. This possible poisoning in a London restaurant (claimed to have been done by the Russian government against a critic who is notable even without this controversy) is a very big deal with regard to foreign relations, and could cause quite a bit of trouble for Putin, depending on what Scotland Yard turns up.

<dd>I can aso add that if you want to avoid problems like these, you can simply follow this rule: If you're not real sure if an article should be tagged, don't tag it. If it's something that should be tagged and you don't tag it, someone else will. All of us editors work together. Oh, and if anyone gets on you at first, just tell them "Hey! I'm new here!" It's hard to learn the ropes. (Heck my first honest-to-goodness edit on a wiki accidentally defaced the article...)

<p>Thanks for the compliments. =) Okay, now if you want to get 250 mainspace edits, I suggest you either do vandal-fighting by patrolling <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecent_Changes_6285.html" title="Special:Recent Changes">Special:Recent Changes</a> and reverting and warning users for vandalism. You can also just pick a group of poorly written articles and expand and rewrite them. Or...you can go to the Wikipedia backlogs, and help copyedit, fix up POV issues, etc. Copyediting is usually good practice for new users, so read <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYEDIT_2a54.html" title="WP:COPYEDIT">WP:COPYEDIT</a> and find some articles to copyedit at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit_5425.html" title="Category:Wikipedia articles needing copy edit">Category:Wikipedia articles needing copy edit</a>. All of these are great ways to contribute to Wikipedia, and can help you get to 250 mainspace edits quickly. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 19:41, 19 November 2006 (UTC) <span id="63288960753"></span></p>

<p>I saw you had a little problem with CrzRussian, dont worry about it, he likes to throw his weight around wiki like he owns the place and its nothing big, I did find it rude what he said though and the funny thing was he is a hypocrite in what he wrote as I've seen him do this many MANY times myself, imho he is the worst admin wiki has at the moment and should be removed. Alas I had to sign out and change my IP because he has been harrasing me a great deal recently, and I would rather not be identified. My advice is stay out of his way, he cant handle what little power he has in life and will abuse it, I wouldnt like to see a good admin get problems from him. Congrats on becoming an admin, from your history you look like you'll make a good contribution to the site&#160;:) G'luck in the future and messaging me on this IP is pointless as its about to change&#160;:P Just wanted to let you know the situation.

<p>Dear Ardo: The words I chose in rebuking you were disproportionately harsh and therefore obscured my real message. I apologize.</p>
<p>What I meant to say is as follows. This is a collaborative project. People come together here to write an encyclopedia. Some are "established users", most are newcomers. They come in, put something down, and frequently leave. Now, a new wikipedian can make any number of mistakes. They can get their policy mixed up in an AfD vote, they can write an article that fails notability guidelines, or accidentally screw up an edit and delete something. These are no big deal - they're fully reversible, and nobody really cares. One thing that does leave a permanent impact is when brand new users posting their first ever legitimate article encounter unreasonable resistance from the eager crack-force called the New Page Patrol.</p>
<p>Deletion of other people's legitimate work is serious business. We must respect their efforts, at least in order that we not earn a reputation as a place where newcomers are not welcome, to say nothing of common courtesy. When you tagged an article within less than one minute of creation for speedy deletion - when that article was a good faith effort and did not meet <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> criteria - I decided to come over here and tell you why this was wrong. When I saw two warnings from the same day for the same thing, and reviewed your contributions, I realized that we may have a more serious problem and I decided to upgrade my message to a threat.</p>
<p>I hope you understand my motivation and are not offended. - <b><a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">crz</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/r/z/User_talk%7ECrzrussian_d07a.html" title="User talk:Crzrussian">crztalk</a></small> 05:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To weigh in as a relatively new user to Wikipedia, I must say I found it VERY offputting that you attempted to delete my article for notability reasons without knowledge of the subject or even a simple google or news daemon search to see if the article had necessary notability and relevance. It seems to me that you are just going for a large number of individual edits, and instead of doing something like, say, contributing to the encyclopedia, you find it easier to wantonly apply speedy-deletion tags to new content, because most people gauge that kind of contribution with bots that don't know the difference between good changes and bad. The fact that you are either an administrator or in consideration to become one has shocked me, I must admit - I don't expect such conduct from respected users, let alone admin. <a href="../../../t/u/v/User%7ETuviya_fa69.html" title="User:Tuviya">Tuviya</a> 17:28, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I imagine that you were concerned about this article's having been created some months ago and redirected it to your userpage lest such creation should happen once more or in order that editors who know you IRL might best quickly find your userpage.

<p>Well... there is an option for administators to disable/enable blocking anonymous users only and account creation, however, there are still bugs in that system. I've tried to edit with both parameters checked, but could only do so when anons were blocked, and account creation opened. Another user couldn't edit at all with it blocked, so it seems to really depend. In any case, that IP is now unblocked to my knowledge, so you should be fine. —<span style="color: red;"><span style="font: small-caps 14px times;"><a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy">P<small>ilotguy</small></a></span> <small>(<a href="../../../p/i/l/User_talk%7EPilotguy_51fb.html" title="User talk:Pilotguy">push to talk</a>)</small></span> 21:10, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe I should read up on those templates, as I'm not too familiar with them. Hence the reason why I just used stub. Sorry, <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdo191_0ce6.html" title="User:Ardo191">Ard0</a> 04:45, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't apply the speedy tag as blatantly as you say I do, there are alot of pages I leave alone and let someone else deal with, due to my lack of memorization of all the templates for speedy. I've been yelled at about three or four times for my tag on Alexander Litvinenko, no need to yell at me about that, thank you. Could you please write some more on my editor review, with some more constructive comments. I can't learn when all people focus on is my mistakes. Thanks, Ard0 04:57, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You are getting very defensive, and I don't appreciate that very much. You should have been talked to about the Litvinenko article, and there were MANY other ones that you were talked to about - despite this, you continued to apply speedy-deletion tags erroneously. I am not going to add anything else - I feel that you are frustrated because I have indicated an area that you need growth in, and it is my belief that you are not really ready to be an administrator, because of a variety of issues - one being your lack of familiarity with speedy delete policy, another being your quickness to take offense, and the third being that you seem to want it a bit too much for me to be comfortable. My comment stands as it is. I will add that I have nothing against you personally, and that I am sure you are a good editor - but it is my belief that, if you want a high edit count, you should edit articles the old-fashioned way by adding content - not by deleting anything that you can't immediately recognize, without any research into the subject first. <a href="../../../t/u/v/User%7ETuviya_fa69.html" title="User:Tuviya">Tuviya</a> 05:25, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, I'm not 'yelling' at anyone. That attitude is another issue entirely. Best wishes, <a href="../../../t/u/v/User%7ETuviya_fa69.html" title="User:Tuviya">Tuviya</a> 05:26, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please note that you can sign your comments using four tildes like this, ~~~~.</p>
<p>Many pages I delete are unsalvageable junk of the "bill is a poophead" type or vandalism. I do give warnings (eg about giving sources) if appropriate, but advertising is liable to speedy deletion. It's difficult to see why the responsibility for meeting the criteria is down to me rather than the poster.</p>

<p>OK, the text follows, try again (I've not protected against recreation), but remember that articles like this must not be written like advertisements. As for the five minutes, the assumption is surely that editors save text when they are happy with the content? <big><font color="red"><b>MERRY CHRISTMAS</b></font></big> <big><font face="chiller"><font color="purple"><b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">Jimfbleak</a>.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimfbleak_5bf6.html" title="User talk:Jimfbleak">talk</a>.</b></font>07:59, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</font></big></p>

<p>I've just seen your other message, fair point, my apologies. You need to make sure you give sources for your article, also, as it stands, it's basicly a eulogy to the company, bound to read like an adv. <big><font face="chiller"><font color="purple"><b><a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">Jimfbleak</a>.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimfbleak_5bf6.html" title="User talk:Jimfbleak">talk</a>.</b></font>08:04, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</font></big></p>

<dd>Thanks for your understanding, I'll find some more info on Maple, write the article in word or something, then put it up. Could you maybe give me a hand once it's up, to expand it a bit?? Or just let me know of some way I can request it be expanded? Thanks again, <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdo191_0ce6.html" title="User:Ardo191">Ard0</a> 18:36, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
