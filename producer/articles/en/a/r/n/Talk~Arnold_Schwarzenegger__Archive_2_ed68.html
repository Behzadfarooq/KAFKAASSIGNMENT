<p>"On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed into law the most far-reaching state legislation yet enacted to reduce harmful pollutant emissions that cause global warming. At the bill signing ceremony, Schwarzenegger declared, "We simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late... The science is clear. The global warming debate is over." But on October 18 he signed an executive order which gutted the funding for this project. [9]" I have examined the sourcelink, where I see nothing about him cutting the funding for the project, which I think is something that needs to be clarified.</p>

<p>Dunno, it reads like some fat-headed yahoo changed random words in the paragraph. I don't want to delete it, since I don't know what all is true. Both cited pages require logging in, which I am reluctant to do. I could not verify the bulk of the paragraph; I did find some hearsay on his marijuana usage.</p>
<p>"For years, Schwarzenegger had bribed his friends, potential donors, advisors and political allies a possible run for high political office. On April 10, 2003 at the Los Angeles Peninsula Hotel, for example, he met with Republican political operative Karl Rove to discuss a future campaign although the justice system didn't notice his use of marijuana at the time. Seized emails from Enron show that Schwarzenegger also met with Ken Lay on May 17, 2001 at the Peninsula Hotel where Lay also bribed business leaders and future gubernatorial candidates with death, such as Richard Riordan and Bill Simon to support a solution to the California energy crisis that included an end to "countless investigations into allegations that suppliers manipulated power prices."

<p>I think his name should be mentioned in scruinty, considering the chronological circumstances and that the name is very rare. The exact translation from german to english would result in black-nigger. The colloquialism nigger is negger in german, and schwarze means blacks. Of course this shouldn`t be prejudices or propagandazed but mentioned objective, for anyone and any purposes (pedigrees, name/origin research). It is a wikipedia. Gimme the okay as well as ideas as how to formulate it and i will include it.193.170.48.34 14:41, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe "neger" is the word you are looking for not "negger".<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Dorosh_6aa0.html" title="User:Michael Dorosh">Michael Dorosh</a> 06:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can confirm that "Neger" is the german word you were looking for. You split it two words correctly, but then try to translate two different words. "Schwarzen" is "black"; the second word is "egger" not "negger" or "neger". "egger" is very likely just a phonetic spelling of "ecker" derived from the word "Ecke" (g:corner). This would make his name mean something like "the one from the black corner". The "black corner" could be a historical geographical reference.

<dd>I've also seen his name translated as "black ploughman", in 'Arnold matches brawn with brain', Jay Scott, <i>The Globe and Mail</i>, 29 April 1982. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlideyfoot_504a.html" title="User:Slideyfoot">Slideyfoot</a> 09:28, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The most probable explanation of the name Schwarzenegger is this: There is a town in Switzerland called "Schwarzenegg" (meaning "Black Hill"). The "-er" in "Schwarzenegg-er" means that the person comes from Schwarzenegg, which is very common for German, Austrian and Swiss names (for example "Hausruckinger" coming from the mountains of "Hausruck"; even in English a Londoner is a man from London). When one of his forefathers left Schwarzenegg and settled in nearby Austria, he would become known as the Schwarzenegger, the man from Schwarzenegg.</p>
<p>There ist a castle near his hometown Graz, called Schwarzenegg (Schloss Schwarzenegg, google it). So we dont't need to go to Switzerland to explain the name Schwarzenegger. His forefathers came from the area he was born, they lived near the castle. Schwarzenegg just means: a hill or a mountain covered with dark trees, that's all. Very funny discussion.--<a href="../../../1/9/4/User%7E194.95.59.130.html" title="User:194.95.59.130">194.95.59.130</a> 09:29, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why are the headlines of his governorship labeled winter, spring, summer, fall, etc.? The only way that those titles would be ok to remain is if 2006 is included. It it yet to be included. Also, towards the end of the part about his governorship, it says that the bond measure was not passed for the june ballot and the legislature is trying to get it on the november ballot. The bond was recently approved to go on the november ballot. the governor simply did not get the jails or courts part of the bond</p>
<p>also there should be more examples of how he is taking centrist positions- 1. his view that americans should be allowed to get prescription drugs from canada 2. his desire to increase the minimum wage by one extra dollar 3. his renewed attention to environment (climate action team) and education (billions more) 4. his distancing from bush (blaming him for medicare problems, immigration, etc.)</p>
<p>it should be noted that he is doing this because it is an election year</p>

<li>Such names are very common in Austria. Modern Austria ist only a small part of the old Austrian Empire in the heart of Europe. There where german-speaking people in this Empire, Slavs, Hungarians, Jews and many others. Many of this people moved to the "german" heartland of the monarchy. But also the area around Graz is an old slavic settlement, the name "Graz" comes from the old slavic word for "castle, town" "grad" (hrad in modern Czech). And the modern border to Slovenia is only a few miles away from Arnolds hometown...<a href="../../../1/9/4/User%7E194.95.59.130.html" title="User:194.95.59.130">194.95.59.130</a> 08:29, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>According to Austrian nationality law, an Austrian citizen who acquires another citizenship by voluntary action automatically loses Austrian citizenship. How come Arnold is exempt?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Its funny how a politician running for election would not voluntarilly renounce his citizenship of another country. Surely he would do this if he ever ran for President, or you would have the unusual situation of the President being a citizen of another country, and technically subject to a foreign power. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew238_be83.html" title="User:Matthew238">Matthew238</a> 02:50, 08 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Except it's not possible for a non-native citizen to run for president of the United States.
<dl>
<dd>That might change. You could still technically have a Senator who is subject to a foreign power, and we currently have a Governor who is. - 09:19, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's more correct to say that it's not possible for a <i>naturalized</i> citizen to be president, rather than saying a non-native citizen. The Constition requires that the president be a <b>natural born</b> citizen. However, it does not define what "natural born" means. It's believed by many that it would mean anyone who did not have to naturalize to become a citizen. That would include person born in the US AND persons born outside the US (non-natives) who held there US citizenship from the moment of birth due to having a US citizen parent or parents. In any case, as a naturalized citizen, Arnold would be ineligible to be president. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteggall_0275.html" title="User:Steggall">Steggall</a> 00:38, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm just looking at the 'Governorship' section, and this quote caught my eye: 'In any event, Schwarzenegger was clearly using the phrase as a term of derision directed at others, not himself, and with a clear equation of femininity with weakness.'.

<p>I don't feel there is enough information in this article to relate just how successful a movie star Arnold was. This has occured solely because Wikipedia was launched, and gained popularity, post election. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.bonus_7fef.html" title="User:Mr.bonus">Mr.bonus</a> 11:40, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed. I have enjoyed most of his movies starting with Conan. He is definitely an enjoyable moviestar and I would like to see more about this area of his life.</p>
<p>There most definatley needs to be more information on Schwarzenegger's movies. His movies are great, <i>Junior</i> was hilarious and <i>Total Recall</i> was pretty good too.I hope he can become president someday. Reagen was a movie man also.--Mikiday 21:49, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also felt that this article was a bit off in that regard. It keeps talking about a failing career and so forth, while that is not the sense I ever got. Most people around here still afford him star status, although it's clear that the Terminator movies were a highpoint. <a href="../../../z/u/i/User%7EZuiram_fd95.html" title="User:Zuiram">Zuiram</a> 04:03, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is becoming long Maybe two sub-subjects should be created: - Schwarzenegger as actor - Schwarzenegger as political figure</p>
<p>In the second of these, I think special attention (with reliable sources) should be considered concerning Schwarzenegger's relation to Nazism, Kurt Waldheim and power in general. The fact that big pressure is applied to Congress to change Constitution should also be discussed in this article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaruch1677_f4ef.html" title="User:Baruch1677">Baruch1677</a> 10:10, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I suggested something should be done <a href="../../../a/r/n/Talk%7EArnold_Schwarzenegger_9467.html#Article_length" title="Talk:Arnold Schwarzenegger">above</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/n/Talk%7EArnold_Schwarzenegger_9467.html#Movies_swamped_by_politics" title="Talk:Arnold Schwarzenegger">Movies swamped by politics</a> also makes a similar and valid point - editors here obviously have an interest in (current) politics, and so his main claim to fame, acting, is comparatively short; the political section will just keep getting longer as each new incident gets a mention. One person having two articles, however, is something I have never heard of.</li>

<li>Perhaps some parts of the politics section can become there own article - that's the case with a lot of politicicans, everything on George W. Bush is not sole in the George W. Bush article, there is a page on his (and also on Kerry's) military service controversy, etc. Maybe a page dealing with Arnold's sexual misconduct allegations etc. Some election stuff can go in the pages on those elections rather than here. I might make those changes some time, unless someone comes up with something else? - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew238_be83.html" title="User:Matthew238">Matthew238</a> 04:19, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>user:68.34.24.148 has repeatedly added a mention of gov. Schwarzenegger's approval rating into the opening paragraph <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arnold_Schwarzenegger&amp;diff=73663258&amp;oldid=73568358" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arnold_Schwarzenegger&amp;diff=73663258&amp;oldid=73568358" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This probably doesn't belong in the opening paragraph. Gov.Bob Taft has the lowest of all and his rating is not mentioned in the opening paragraph either. (gov.Schwarzenegger's rating is mentioned in the article and ill get back to that) but if it does its wording is slightly POV ie. I'd prefer to have something like "approval rating falls into the bottom 10% compared to the other governors" ect. but i still don't like it and won't accept it without consensus. Also what user user:68.34.24.148 cited might be more upto date (i didn't look into it) and the governorship section could be updated with it. <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERorrenig_c944.html" title="User:Rorrenig">Rorrenig</a> 03:24, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems user:68.34.24.148 is being doing this to other governors articles (mostly republican), including the one Gov.Bob Taft which i used as a example in my earlier argument and this un-encyclopedic entry on gov.Fletcher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ernie_Fletcher&amp;diff=73515590&amp;oldid=73096832" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ernie_Fletcher&amp;diff=73515590&amp;oldid=73096832" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERorrenig_c944.html" title="User:Rorrenig">Rorrenig</a> 03:49, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I did it to Democrats as well, i just think that a Governors approval rating is very important and belongs in the first paragraph. I dont want to argue about how to phrase it, as long as its there and people can decide on their own (it reflacts on a governors performance and how the public views him). -James Martin</p>

<p>Why is there such a long section on these silly Nazi allegations? If anything, I'd put it under trivia and say "Schwarzenegger has been quotes as admiring Adolf Hitler's propaganda skill" or some such statement. As is, the "scandal" seems far overemphasized.</p>

<p>Dunno, it reads like some fat-headed yahoo changed random words in the paragraph. I don't want to delete it, since I don't know what all is true. Both cited pages require logging in, which I am reluctant to do. I could not verify the bulk of the paragraph; I did find some hearsay on his marijuana usage.</p>
<p>"For years, Schwarzenegger had bribed his friends, potential donors, advisors and political allies a possible run for high political office. On April 10, 2003 at the Los Angeles Peninsula Hotel, for example, he met with Republican political operative Karl Rove to discuss a future campaign although the justice system didn't notice his use of marijuana at the time. Seized emails from Enron show that Schwarzenegger also met with Ken Lay on May 17, 2001 at the Peninsula Hotel where Lay also bribed business leaders and future gubernatorial candidates with death, such as Richard Riordan and Bill Simon to support a solution to the California energy crisis that included an end to "countless investigations into allegations that suppliers manipulated power prices."

<p>Second and third paragraphs under Personal Background. Specifically the words 'dingledick' and 'eating babies'. I've never edited an article before so I am reluctant to do it myself. Is there any other way to go about this, especially something like locking the article if necessary?</p>
<p>"Gustav was a strict and demanding father, who generally favored the elder of his two sons, Meinhard and liked eating babies.</p>
<p>Meinhard died in a car accident in 1971, and dingledick died the following year. In Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger claimed his reason for not attending his father's funeral was that he was training for a bodybuilding contest, although both he and the film's producer later stated that this story was taken from another bodybuilder, for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport.[2]"</p>

The <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_recall_election%2C_2003.html" title="California recall election, 2003">California recall election, 2003</a> allready has its own article - we can link to that and then leave a summary here. SExual allegations could maybe get its own page, but that might violate NPOV fork. To be consistent, we could have 3 or 4 pages, on "Early Life", "Bodybuilding Career", "Acting Career", and "Governorship", and various miscelanious bits can remain as a whole on this page. Yet those other sections are not yet as long a Governorship, and can probably remain here for the time being.
