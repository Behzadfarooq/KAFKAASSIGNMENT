	    <p>Well, I think probably the issue of categorization of English dynasties at the very least needs to be reopened again on the categories page. I've put the English kings in a more specific subclass <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantagenets.html" title="Plantagenets">Plantagenets</a> so they at least don't get confused with the other houses of Anjou. I agree that it's not Wikipedia's job to "standardize" names where there is no standard, nor to impose continental notions of what a house consists of on British monarchs. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 02:52, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that, because the photograph is the subject of an article that discusses the attributes of the photograph, {{<a href="../../../a/r/t/Template%7EArt_c376.html" title="Template:Art">art</a>}} makes sense here. I think the distinction can be drawn where the photograph itself is sufficiently notable that it's worth talking about it separately from the photograph's subject. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 15:41, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think we can determine the difference by the <i>use</i>. If a photograph is being used in a context where it is being treated as a work of art, then we can consider it a work of {{<a href="../../../a/r/t/Template%7EArt_c376.html" title="Template:Art">art</a>}}. If not, then not. If someone incorrectly tags a photo as {{<a href="../../../a/r/t/Template%7EArt_c376.html" title="Template:Art">art</a>}}, then we can look at the article it's included in and determine whether it really is art. If it isn't then we can tag it as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusedisputed_0925.html" title="Template:Fairusedisputed">fairusedisputed</a>}} or as an imagevio or whatever. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 16:32, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sir, you added:</p>

<dd><i>"she was to rise to greater things"</i></dd>

<p>This is POV. To some the stage may be greater than the screen.</p>
<p>Also, if I am going to do a lot of edits on an article, I check the talk page. If you had looked at the <a href="../../../l/a/u/Talk%7ELauren_Bacall_6ee4.html" title="Talk:Lauren Bacall">talk</a> page for Ms. Bacall, you would have noticed a nice discussion about Bogart calling her "Baby".</p>

<p>Hey there. Thanks for your comments about the photos I've been posting. (Like Bruce Cabot). These photos are promotional photos given to the press when they were first released in the 1940's, so wouldn't that mean that they fall under public domain? The whole point of the photos, released by motion picture companies, were for them to be used in media for publicity for their films or music. So are we not using them correctly?</p>

<p>Thanks. I'll stick with screenshots from my movie collection. I thought the publicity shots from 60 years ago would be OK, but it seems like it's not worth the effort.

<p>It is not the category that is odd so much as who is in it. Roy Keane almost certainly does not have a British passport and so it is pretty strange to think of him as British. Without reading Cherie Blair's bio I certainly wouldn't think of her as Irish, she's from Liverpool and a Catholic but AFAIK that's as far as it goes. If a grandfather or greatgrandfather from Ireland makes you an Irish Briton then at least 20% of Britons are Irish British. I think it should be restricted to those who had a parent from Ireland or those for whom their Irish heritage was actually important e.g. Spike Milligan.<a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGordyB_9ddb.html" title="User:GordyB">GordyB</a> 10:38, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, maybe I exaggerated, but my point was similar to GordyB's above, about the numbers of British people with Irish ancestors. The categories for Irish-Americans, German-Americans, etc are including people on the basis of great grandparents; if we did the same for the British category we would be talking about hundreds or maybe even thousands of people. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Watts_14b9.html" title="User:Jeff Watts">JW</a> 11:34, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi, I've seen your comment on my talk page re: renaming the category to British Irish. I don't think that really helps address the various issues around such a category. I note also you've now suggested Category:Irish diaspora in Great Britain. I think that is less bad - it uses terms that are current in the language - but still inherently problematic as a category for putting individual people into. At what point do individual people stop being part of a diaspora and become part of the country where their ancestors moved to?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I note that a number of pages which refer to Irish people in Britain appear to be pushing an agenda - I am <b>not</b> of course suggesting that you are doing so! - and this is something that should be avoided. (For example <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_community_in_Britain_fa9c.html" title="Irish community in Britain">Irish community in Britain</a> lists numerous people who allegedly belong to the Irish community. Some of them are Irish citizens who live in the UK. Fair enough. Others are prominent people who few would think of as Irish (or even "Irishish"). Similarly the page reports on the 2001 census which put the percentage of people declaring themselves to be of Irish ethnicity in England and Wales as being 1.2%. It then goes on to make a POV case that this figure is "ridiculously low"). My concern with this category is that it will lend itself to such people pushing agendas - both pro- and anti-Irish - without being especially enlightening to the WP user. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValiantis_48f7.html" title="User:Valiantis">Valiantis</a> 15:01, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've changed my vote to support your helpful proposal to rename to Category:Britons of Irish descent. I think that's a good compromise and avoids most of the POV issues. Better to try and get consensus on a 'middle ground' rename than to have no consensus as no consensus means the cat will remain under the existing name! <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValiantis_48f7.html" title="User:Valiantis">Valiantis</a> 22:45, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with this category but I think evidence should be provided for Irish ancestry, particularly if "1 Irish grandparent" is the criteria for membership. As far as I am aware Martine McCutcheon has a Scottish step-father (from whom she gets her Scottish surname) and an English mother. Now either of them could be of Irish descent, as could her real father, but including her requires evidence of this, surely.</dd>

<dd>Re: your newest proposal to rename to Category:Irish diaspora in Great Britain. Sorry, but I'm unhappy backing that for the reasons I stated above. I would fit into that category in the way it seems to be being defined (in so far as it is being defined at all) and yet I do not see myself as part of any diaspora. I note that a user below has queried your adding of Jack McConnell to the current cat and I see the "Irish diaspora" wording leading to almost as many debates (and edit wars) as the current name. This is not near enough to the middle ground to work for me. I'm therefore abstaining from any further comments on this issue in CFD unless anyone writes anything particularly new there, so I won't actively oppose your new proposal. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValiantis_48f7.html" title="User:Valiantis">Valiantis</a> 19:19, 23 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hello. i read through the debate on the cat's renaming/deletion. the reason i voted to keep <a href="../../../s/c/o/Category%7EScottish-Americans_cded.html" title="Category:Scottish-Americans">Category:Scottish-Americans</a> is mostly because there exists cats for so-called Irish Americans and African Americans, cats which i personally would like to see gone but that exist for culturally (and even psychological) reasons that see a lot of people wanting them retained. since i know they cannot be gotten rid of, i d like to see them at least balanced in a sense by having similar cats for all ethnic backgrounds. however, my personal bias is that they should not exist for "tagging" ethnicity (as goes on), but for indicating first generation immigrants who have an original cultural set of values that can be identified and linked in wikipedia to that country/region. many users however use the cats for second, third, or any generation of person with ethnicity. as for the cat in question, i too have a problem labelling Bono, Roy Keane, and others included on the list as Irish-British notwithstanding an explanation in the head of the cat of what is to be meant by it. i would propose a cat for first generation Irish immigrants who settle in Great Britain and call it Category:Irish-British people and separate lists, one for Irish who have contributed to British culture and life, and one for wiki articles on Britons with Irish ancestry and have the lists linked to the cat. however since this is not really the support you were looking for, i withhold voting. regards -<a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayumashu_b61f.html" title="User:Mayumashu">Mayumashu</a> 03:11, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess I don't know. But, his stance on sectarianism is as likely to be as a result of the scale of the problem in Glasgow as to any Irish descent. I for one, living in Scotland and following politics, have never heard of McConnell's Irish descent being brought up at any time - I reiterate that he probably doesn't belong in the category. I think we need a third party to settle this one though. <a href="../../../e/r/a/User%7EErath_3567.html" title="User:Erath">Erath</a> 21:09, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think an Irish-Scots category should refer to people with strong Irish, often Irish-Catholic, ancestry. For instance those who probably identify themselves more with Ireland than Scotland (Gillespie, O'Brien, James Connolly etc may well belong in this category). I don't believe McConnell (or Lorraine Kelly) do to be honest. If it simply means someone who has an Irish ancestor; or in the case of Lorraine Kelly simply an Irish sounding name,....well, who in Scotland does not? He may well be influenced by his Irish grandparent if indeed he has one, or his ancestry may well be of significance to him. But surely wikipedia requires evidence for rather than no evidence against....... You may as well call Gerry Adams a British-Irishman owing to his English ancestry and British surname. Anyway McConnell's wife is a well known local Catholic politician and I suspect it was this that influenced his tepid fight against religious bigotry but again I have no evidence for that (note: he has done not a thing to remove sectarianism from Scottish society). 130.159.254.2 11:56, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Arnie. Yeah, I appreciate that there are several actors in that category who might not really belong, but I think that happens with almost every category, and the solution is to remove the particular actor from the category. I don't think it's an argument for category deletion in itself. Also, I will mention that, of all ethnic identities, the question of <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">who is a Jew?</a> is probably the thorniest. For instance, because Jewishness traditionally comes via matrilineal descent, one could legitimately claim to be a Jew with only 1 of one's 16 great-great-grandparents being of the Jewish faith <a href="../../../r/m/o/User%7ERMoloney_d972.html" title="User:RMoloney">RMoloney</a> <a href="../../../r/m/o/User_talk%7ERMoloney_9f09.html" title="User talk:RMoloney">(talk)</a> 01:20, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh Ryan Moloney, of course! The world's only famous Moloney, I should have thought of that. I actually have a friend whose brother lived with Ryan for a while when he was living in Oz. But anyway. As I say, Jewish identity is, almost by definition, a thorny topic. See, for example <a href="../../../j/e/w/Template_talk%7EJew_adf5.html" title="Template talk:Jew">Template talk:Jew</a> for pitfalls encountered when trying to separate Jewish ethnicity from Jewish religion. As well, some less traditional elements in modern Judaism do consider those with Jewish fathers, gentile mothers as Jewish. While I still favour a wholesale "keep" of the category, with problematic cases dealt with on a case by case basis, if you have a renaming proposal, I would urge you to mull the wording very carefully indeed. <a href="../../../r/m/o/User%7ERMoloney_d972.html" title="User:RMoloney">RMoloney</a> <a href="../../../r/m/o/User_talk%7ERMoloney_9f09.html" title="User talk:RMoloney">(talk)</a> 02:18, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But surely you encounter the same can of worms with general ethnicity categories? If the xxx-American actors category is gone, then this actor will be in 4 different xxx-Americans categories. I do share your concerns about the likes of Michael Douglas being included, but I can't think of a way to formulate the Jewish Americans category so as to exclude him. You see, with self-identification, you've got the problem of anti-Semitic Jews like <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a>. With religious observance, you've got atheist Jews like <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Weinberg_4602.html" title="Steven Weinberg">Steven Weinberg</a>. (And it's my opinion that both of the aforementioned should be in the category.) If you were to strictly apply matrilineal descent, that would be considered POV as it would not be agreed to by <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_Judaism_1877.html" title="Reform Judaism">Reform Judaism</a>. <a href="../../../r/m/o/User%7ERMoloney_d972.html" title="User:RMoloney">RMoloney</a> <a href="../../../r/m/o/User_talk%7ERMoloney_9f09.html" title="User talk:RMoloney">(talk)</a> 03:18, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we need to, and should, forget about any semblance of "Jewish religious law" or "Jewish mother law" or whatever. That would be taking a POV towards a certain ethnicity, since we certainly don't use "Irish mother law" or "Armenian mother law" with those groups. I'm reponsible for adding a majority of ethnic labels towards a large number of actors, I use the 1/4 law - if an actor has a grandparent "fully" of one ethnicity, the label can be applied there (and as such I've taken actors out of labels they were already in but had insufficient ancestry for the label; i.e. taking 1/8th Swedish Julia Roberts out of Swedish-Americans). We need to look at this from the same point-of-view that we would use for any other ethnicity. If no one complained about Roberts being listed as "Swedish-American" despite very distant Swedish heritage, then I'm not sure why all this attention is paid specifically to "Jewish Americans" - people like Michael Douglas who has one Jewish parent! Imagine if Julia Roberts' father was "full-on" Swedish - not a person in the world would even consider taking her out of Swedish Americans. Usually the info on "how Jewish" the person is, is already in the entry, so let the viewers make up their own minds based on their own perceptions. Right now I don't believe there are actors in the "Jewish American actors" category who are less than 1/4 Jewish (but I am pretty there are actors in other categories who are less than 1/4 whichever ethnicity). Before taking anyone out - be sure to read through the entry or do some research on the person. As for "Jewish American actors" Vs. "Jewish Americans" - I don't mind necessarily if the two are merged. <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 07:11, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><cite id="Re:_Jewish_American_actors_reply_1"></cite> I'd say people with little Jewish ancestry, and those who don't identified themselves as such are miscategorised.

<p>Well, people with "little" (i.e. less than 1/4th) of Jewish ancestry are not listed. I guess it's certainly possible that 1/4 is considered little by some people as well, but I think it's a reasonable amount, especially since people like Paris Hilton keep getting "Norwegian-Americans" added to them, despite being only 1/16th Norwegian (in Hilton's case; I removed the tag but it got re-added; of course I removed it again).<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 18:08, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, I must say I'm at a loss as to where previously I've supported your comments. I do vote a lot at AfD etc. but I don't remember this. I did help vote down "list of Jewish High school principals" and "list of Jewish engineers"--non-encyclopedic and a little creepy to my mind. But bonafide actors? I'd say keep the category in-itself. I'm broadly a "self-identifier" is indentifier type. That is, if X comedian, actress, author etc. identifies as Jewish, well, we'll put them in the appropriate "American Jewish..." category. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:29, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I cast a vote here as well...just so you know, I have a somewhat nuanced view of this type of category: I'm in favour of them <i>if</i> the combination of that particular ethnic (or sexual) minority group with that particular occupation constitutes a unique cultural context in its own right. I'm in favour, for example, of an <a href="../../../a/f/r/Category%7EAfrican_American_musicians_fa12.html" title="Category:African American musicians">African American musicians</a> grouping, because African American music is a unique, specific and identifiable cultural context with an encyclopedic history in its own right. I don't think they should exist for <i>any</i> imaginable combination of personal characteristic and occupation (and accordingly voted to delete the particular category under discussion), but they <i>should</i> exist in cases where they clearly group members of a distinct cultural phenomenon with an identifiably unique and encyclopedic cultural context of its own. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 03:00, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You wrote me: "Hi I am not against saying De Niro is not italian american but the header of articles is a place to put nationality. His nationality is not italian american. So you have to say he is american first then you can say he is italian american with explanation. Arniep 14:39, 11 November 2005 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Let's explain something. I think the header of articles is a place to put etnical origins about a person and not ONLY his/her nationality. In your way nobody can be consider an Irish Amercian, a Polish American, ecc; because they all are American born. That's so silly! Everybody knows Italian American as a proper nationality doesn't exist. Somebody could be American and Italian, with two nationalities but it doesn't make him an Italian American. Italian American is about the heritage as I wrote you some times ago. That's the so-called Ethnography. An example: Ronaldo (the football player) recently joined Spanish nationality, that dosen't mean he's Spanish, he's still Brasilian with two nationality. Anyway De Niro was proposed Italian nationality to underline his Italian origin. All De Niro's serious biographies report him as an Italian American actor. Maybe you're the only who can't stand it. I don't know what to think... I think Wikipedia must be a free encilcopedia which reports the most complete and correct imformation about the subjects. That's all.</p>

<p>Oh my Gosh! I really don't understand what's the problem here! Worldwide De Niro and other are considered and reported as Italian American in their Biography.

In your way, third time I say it, NOBODY can be consider Italian American because they're American born. That's silly and untrue!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I just stumbled on to this - and this is stupid. Maybe you would have some sort of argument if DeNiro was 100% Italian, but he is only 1/4. He has about as much right getting called a German-American actor (maternal grandfather was German-American) as an Italian one. He shares both ethnicities equally.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 06:38, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I said it before. I'm telling you that biographies report it. To me you can clearly write De Niro is half Italian and half German, no problem. Just write it! I don't understand why can be written in the header. The nationality is given by the place where he was born and that's implied in the birth date with place. Anyway, what I said is that De Niro is widely consider an Italian American and could be more clear and true if it'll be riported. I mean, Maybe not everybody likes truth... Ah, and the same for Madonna or Quentin Tarantino or Joe Pesci or Al Pacino, and so on. I'm try to make order in the Wikipedia's Italian American section, this is why I'm trying to explain you my reasons. I would do the same for Irish American, Polish American, ecc. Using only the American nationality Wikipedia's pages as Italian American, Irish American couldn't exist. I hope someone understand. I'm only trying to do my best. Thx</p>

<p>This is the Wikipedian publics decision to delete this lists; complaining to an administrator just shows your undeniable bias. There are many lists being deleted, mainly because Wikipedia is starting to get itself together, search for copyrighted images, clean up redundancy and the like. Because the Jewish lists happen to be the ones that are the most far-reaching -- I haven't seen a single list of another religion/ethnicity who won International Medals etc -- they also appear to be the ones most frequently being voted for deletion <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 18:35, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In response to your comment on my talk page, first off I treat every list on a case-by-case basis. Second, if someone were to nominate African American lists, I would actually give consideration to voting to delete, depending on the subject matter of the particular list. IMO all these lists should be treated as categories. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:59, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As explained in <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a>, the term encompasses both an ethnicity and people who practice Judaism. I asked of <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">User:Kappa</a>, if there were a List of Jewish entertainers, would <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._4834.html" title="Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a> be included on the list? If the answer is yes, then the list is based on religion and is of no use because the religion has nothing to do with their success as entertainers (just as there is no List of Catholic entertainers). A compromise might be "List of ethnic Jewish foobarians" excluding those who are converts and then that falls within the precedent of having lists by ethnicity.

<p>My voting pattern is not influenced by the way you define <i>Jewish</i>. Unless historic events dictate otherwise, a person's occupation rarely bears relevance to their religious beliefs, ethnic heritage, shoe size, or favorite film. By all means I'll vote for a list of Jewish scientists who fled Germany during the Nazi era. By all means I'll vote for a list of the first Jewish scientists to work at major research institutions. When there's a demonstrable relationship I'll support the list. If you disagree then vote your conscience. My decision is firm. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 20:51, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>i do think you have made a point and the "WP:POINT" threatening is an unfair over-reaction, but obviously the majority of users accept / want categories that follow the "nationality + occupation" and in the case of the States "nationality + ethnicity + occupation categories" patterns. i myself think there should be a two types of categories used, one the way you seem to want where occupation is independant of nationality/ethnicity (i might want to search for a writer but not know if he's German, Swiss, Austrian) and one where the two things are together, the way the majority here seem to want it. -<a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayumashu_b61f.html" title="User:Mayumashu">Mayumashu</a> 01:29, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your vote. It appears Lulu's hostility to Jewish lists may be driven by an opposition to zionism...I'd guess maybe he equates the listing of Jewish achievements as some kind of nationalist zionist act which in my opinion would be ridiculous but its a possible explanation.

</dl>
<p>You badly misunderstand things, if that is your belief. In general, I vote to keep list or categories of "&lt;nation/ethnic/religion&gt;-ish &lt;occupation&gt;ers". It depends slightly on how broad the descriptions are, but I'm much more inclusionist than most voters on those things. It has nothing at all to do with "Jewish" versus "Swedish", "Catholic", "African American", etc.</p>
<p>That said, you certainly did wrongly name some categories you had created, but that seems to have been resolved happily enough (we now have "Category:Jewish Foos" rather than the stylistically wrong "Category:Jews in Foo"). I had no issue with the basic idea of having categories, just about naming.</p>
<p>I'd watch out for RachelBrown's weird agenda on this. I happen to have come across <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_jurists_bebc.html" title="List of Jewish jurists">List of Jewish jurists</a> via VfD. As you can see, I voted "keep", but then decided to try to bring it up to encyclopedic standards (and also created the analogous <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_African_American_jurists_528f.html" title="List of African American jurists">List of African American jurists</a>). Exactly like the briar patch I once had to fend through to cleanup List of born-again Christian laypeople, I encountered (not unexpectedly) some editors whose purpose was <i>not</i> creating a good encyclopedia page. Instead, <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERachelBrown_1109.html" title="User:RachelBrown">User:RachelBrown</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoetlister_675f.html" title="User:Poetlister">User:Poetlister</a> just want such lists to contain "as many names as possible" (i.e. indifferent to providing evidence that a given name actually belongs there). A different set of editors was equally attached to keeping "as many names as possible" on the born-again Christian list. Both sets of obstructionists made almost exactly the same comments: "a friend of mine told me...", "just trust me, I checked...", etc. In other words, they don't like <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Actually, I had also had similar problems on some LGBT lists/cats.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help getting the list cleaned up, that would be great. Maybe good penitence for the WP:POINT violation.&#160;:-) See the talk page, or also my comment at <a href="../../../k/b/d/User_talk%7EKbdank71_a40d.html#More_.22support_group.22_lists" title="User talk:Kbdank71">User_talk:Kbdank71#More "support group" lists</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 02:00, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd be fascinated to know where I said I want such lists to contain "as many names as possible".

<p>"Both of my parents came from good families, but like many <b>New Englanders</b> at the time, they had limited access to their feelings.....My maternal grandfather, Louis Grieco, was a hardworking <b>Italian immigrant</b> who came from Melitto, Italy, around the turn of the century.

<p>Sorry, I just noticed the extra posts on Aniston right now (all I noticed before was the post about Wealthy Fictional Characters) and my subscription to Rootsweb is now out. In general, I find it interesting that I couldn't find a <b>single</b> web site that mentioned Aniston's Scottish and/or Italian heritage! I think it's a good example of how the media (and the net) just spin out one "exotic angle" about an actor (i.e. the Greek part of Aniston) without really getting into details. From what I can tell from Dow's book, she was born somewhere in between 1933 and 1937. Do any of your sites for Grieco mention their New England residence? It's clear Dow's parents lived in either New England or California, not New York.</p>

<p>About a year ago I was against deletion in a similar Jewish case. In fact I was very active in defending it, and I had a very long dispute with IZAK, and he finally convinced me that in such a multicontroversial case as Jews, lists are the best solution, for a number of reasons. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mikkalai_3580.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mikkalai">contribs</a>) 17:02, 25 November 2005.</small></p>

<dd>One of numerous reasons is that Jewish categories are within unrepairable mess. For Example your "Jewish calssical musicians" ais a cubcategory "musicians by religion". The latter one contains "christian musicians", which lists those who wrote "christian music", rather than those who are christians. It also lists "Muslim musicians", probably created by a lazy anti-Semite, since it contains a single entry. I ams starting to beleive that categories "by nationality" is an anachromism in the era when people mix freely and hardly serves any useful purpose besides clanish pride "he was one of us". <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:51, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I think that categories such as Category:Jewish philosophers, Category:Jewish classical musicians, and Category:Jewish scientists serve a very useful purpose as they show how Jewish people have made a significant contribution to these areas, just as Category:African American musicians shows how African Americans have made a great contribution to popular music.</i></dd>

<dd>See. I'm concerned here, because as far as I'm concerned the category structure isn't the place for showing how Jewish people have made a significant contribution to such areas, that's the job of an article. I've already proposed that categories such as Category:African American musicians be replaced with African-Americans in music, which doesn't cause tensions and flaws within the category structure. Let me think about it a while, although at the moment I'm still inclined to delete. Perhaps a compromise lies in a restructuring, <i>Jewish people in</i>? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 18:17, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I said before I have no strong feelings about those eth-prof-natio categories, but there is no way in heck that say, "Jewish Americans" or "Jewish Canadians" should get deleted. It would ruin the (so to speak) "ethnicity-American" project, and leave people like say, Ben Stiller, listed under say, just "Irish-Americans" when they should be listed under both, hence inaccuracy.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 17:59, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I guess it's fine to leave him out for now, but I am really annoyed when people call Harry Bloom his "stepfather", thus making me think they don't know exactly what a stepfather is. There is an odd coincidence because Bloom co-starred with Sean Astin in LOTR, and Sean Astin has a Jewish biological father and a non-Jewish father (and mother). However, in his case, John Astin <b>can</b> be called his stepfather, because Sean was conceived while his mother was still married to Michael Tell (his Jewish biological father), and married Astin a couple of weeks later. Also, Bloom is annoying because he ranks as the #1 "Why doesn't some reporter just ask him if he's Jewish instead of talking about his sex life" celebrity of the 2000's.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 18:59, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A stepfather is someone married to your mother who isn't your father; I can't fathom the distinction that is being drawn here. If neither biological parent is Jewish (and he hasn't converted), it's a bit dubious to call him Jewish. We have enough confusion on the "Who is a Jew?" front. - <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.153.41.72.html" title="User:81.153.41.72">81.153.41.72</a> 20:17, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>A stepfather is someone who married your mother after you were conceived but who is not your father. Harry Bloom was married to Orlando's mother before, during and after Orlando's conception. It was some sort of an agreement that Bloom be conceived with a different man, because Harry Bloom was physically unable to have children at his age. We don't know if Bloom or either of his biological parents are ethnically Jewish.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 20:20, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, we don't know <i>how</i> Jewish Bloom is (i.e. if either of his birth parents are Jewish, which I personally think is likely but again, we don't know). Just wondering, though, how would you describe Astin's relationship to Michael Tell and John Astin? Would you refer to Astin as his stepfather? Ethnically speaking, he is listed under Jewish Americans and Irish Americans (his mother was also 1/4 German, but as you know that becomes 1/8th with Astin). Would you agree with this listing?<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 23:19, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, his mother didn't have an <i>affair</i> per se. Harry Bloom and Sonia Copeland had some sort of agreement in that she wanted to have children but he physically couldn't so they made an agreement that Colin Stone, a family friend, would father the children. It's a very odd story, but that's the story. And frustratingly enough there are no details (yet) on Colin Stone or much information about Sonia Copeland. I'm guessing sooner or later there will be and I will know for sure.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 23:34, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think she mentions her exact birth date or place in the book. BUT... I did search for her on Rootsweb, last week, and if she was born in California it would have shown up (I got no results). So I am guessing she was born in New England, since she called her parents New Englanders. Also, where did you read about Bloom's mother not being Jewish (aside from his Wiki entry, which I put the information about her parentage into myself)?

<dd>Speaking of Dow, I am thinking maybe we should nominate her article for deletion and see what people think. She really isn't notable for anything in acting or writing, and her relationship to Aniston belongs under Aniston's page.

And so on and so on when it comes to celebrity relatives who are not notable for anything other than their relation and maybe a book. Tell me what you think but I am leaning towards an AFD for Dow.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 02:14, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the point of coming in with a late vote for an option that has no chance of being implemented? All it can do is lead to a "no consensus" result and the retention of the lousy existing name. Please consider doing wikipedia a service by amending your vote to support category:Landmarks of the Philippines. Why do you think the Philippines needs a "locations" category when no other country does? The standard categories cover everything perfectly well. This has only happened because a local with a poor grasp of English took action before I got to the Philippines menu and I beg you to assist with the removal of this anomaly, which just causes confusion and makes wikipedia look amateurish. There is no change at all that such an inconsistency would be maintained in a professional encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 11:48, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think having to close all his AfD noms as a speedy Keep will chill him down a bit. I don't see any major violations here, other than the obvious IP sockpuppetry, which any closing admin would ignore anyway. Please remember that non-admins are allowed to close AfDs, provided that the result is an undisputed "Keep", and the closing is done in good faith, ie the closer wasn't personally involved or has a personal interest in the outcome. In this case, since the outcome was the opposite of what he was hoping for, I decided to accept his closing of those AfDs, which would have been closed as a Keep anyway. His "condition" was, of course, invalid: once an AfD is opened, you cannot simply remove it, <i>especially</i> if you were the nominator.</p>

<dd>This has now become a huge, bloody mess with List of British Jews under attack by 40YearOldVirgin (or maybe SlimVirgin), List of Jewish Americans being voted "Keep" on by most people despite the need to make it a group of links to smaller categories since it is so big, and something like 20Keeps to 15Deletes for the Jewish categories. I think being bold, as you said somewhere else, is a good idea here. Maybe we need to post a small policy detailing the 1/4 rule on every ethnicity based list and category and make it an official policy somehow. Yes, I'm sure that user you were talking about is a Mr. Sock Puppet Man, but it's pretty clear that he was right, despite that, about the pointlessness of having a "List Of Jewish Americans" and a few smaller, near-identical lists.

<dd>Arniep is just acting like a child. He's offend his precious Jewish Lists were getting voted for deletion, thus threw a fit by making dozens of WP:POINT afds - which got him temporarily banned. Meanwhile, I aided to productively fix up lists and, albeit suspiciously, informed a few wikipedian friends of AFD votes for them to vote on - which is hardly conspiring, as it was their decision to vote <i>keep</i> or <i>delete</i>. I frankly don't care about an RFC -- don't even know what it is.

<p>The category is too large at the moment and everybody can be placed in one or more subcategories. So please specify an instrument or a genre in case you feel that there is more to be said instead of "musician". The point is that the term is too broad and there were many pages of musicians. In case of singers or guitarists, it's not that important since there are no subcategories, but in this case there are. So please move it in an appropriate subcategory. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittenKlub_4f17.html" title="User:KittenKlub">KittenKlub</a> 21:32, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm back. Yes, "Jewish American" OR "Italian American" CAN be perceived as labels, but not necessarily so AND also "1948 births" is also a label. So is "People from New York". These are just biographical facts about a person and have nothing to do with who they are anyway. You do understand that the whole <b>self-identify</b> thing is POV? Someone doing an interview for an Italian magazine or a Jewish magazine may come out with a more Italian or Jewish angle than general. And I think most people don't identify with anything. For example the Phoenixes (i.e. <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joaquin_Phoenix_25f4.html" title="Joaquin Phoenix">Joaquin Phoenix</a>, etc.). I doubt they identify as Irish or Spanish (their father's ancestry), I don't think they seriously think of themselves as very Jewish either, probably just ethnically and culturally. But <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_Phoenix_2d57.html" title="Summer Phoenix">Summer Phoenix</a> was starring a movie about a Jewish character and said "I'm Jewish" in an interview about the film. Would we list her as a Jewish American but the other Phoenixes as "nothing" (i.e. people of whatever descent I guess)? This whole subject becomes very subjective, and you can have hundreds of arguments like the one we could start on the Phoenixes, DeNiro or Downey Jr. (and I am just using an example). Like I keep telling you, this whole thing - and in fact everything in an encyclopedia - should be based on <b>facts</b>, not on perceptions. A lot of actors have <b>public images</b> relating to a certain ethnicity, and it doesn't make them huge identifiers with that ethnicity in real life (I am pretty sure people perceive <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Biggs_e5a3.html" title="Jason Biggs">Jason Biggs</a> as Jewish based on his film roles, it doesn't make him Jewish). Madonna may like to call herself <b>English</b> but it doesn't make her an English American. Same thing for nationalities - people may hate their own country, but they are still nationals of it. Johnny Depp is an <b>American</b>, wouldn't you say? He isn't a French actor, but an American one, despite his lifestyle and <b>identification</b>. Facts would include birth date, year, place, nationality, ethnicity, and religion - which is different than ethnicity. It's true that there is a Jewish religion separate from the ethnicity, that's why I think we should just keep all the terms as they are now. We don't have the same problem as we would with British people, because if you put "Jewish-British people" on someone who is 3/4 British and 1/4 Jewish, they wouldn't be under any other ethnic category, thus misleading. This problem doesn't exist with Americans. And you said it - "Native Americans" are labeled "Native Americans", precisely because they are such.<a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">Vulturell</a> 02:58, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../u/l/s/Ulster_Scots_626a.html" title="Ulster Scots">Ulster Scots</a> page mentions "Irish-Scots" and explains how they're quite distinct.</p>

<p>And what about African-Americans - some of them go back three or four hundred years before they last "saw" Africa?</p>
<p>Don't really understand the fuss between "Irish-Scots" or "Scottish People of Irish Descent"... I mean, are we gonna start saying that Irish-Americans have to call themselves "American People of Irish Descent", and are we gonna have "American People of African Descent"...</p>

<p>Hi. I agree with several things concerning the RfC, but I'm still not entirely convinced of all the claims it makes. I also think I'd rather move on from the whole event at some level. I'll also hesitantly admit that your(User:Arniep) behavior during that period showed some lapses of judgment. Mine did too, but I think yours was slightly more problemattic as you received some punishment. For these and other reasons I've decided to stay out of RfC page, especially as I couldn't count as an outside view. I hope you do not take this as an insult, but I also hope that in the future you refrain from going to my talk page concerning RfCs. I'd rather not be involved in them for the most part.

<dd>Why the hell would I admit to something that ISN'T true?! There's nothing on wikipedia that says I cannot edit with acquantances and friends - and that is exactly what I've been doing - much in the same way that you edit with some of the users on the Jewish pages. There is no reason I would be so adamant about my denial of this - for having extra usernames is utterly pointless for me and gives me no advantage over anything! I admit I was rude to some users (but so were they to me), and I admit I was in many edit wars (who isn't?!?!).

Incase you haven't noticed, everyone you have encountered has a large belt of edits under their sleeve. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 01:18, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>Hello they are not your friends they are you. You set up your <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStabRule_e05a.html" title="User:StabRule">User:StabRule</a> account for the express purpose of using it as an extra account to delete Jewish lists because people were questioning the anonymous votes which is quite obvious if you look at the first contributions.

<dd>I agree with Arniep! Stay out Antidote and calm down! You have to respond only on your RfC. -- <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">Bonaparte</font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBonaparte_ba39.html" title="User talk:Bonaparte"><small>talk</small></a> 14:23, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hmm, I took that as meaning I can't edit anyone's comments specifically - but I guess that's given. Anyway, like I said before - I'm done trying to convince anyone. Trust me, at this point I wish they in fact were my "sockpuppets" but there's really no point in lying about it just to end the RFC. Anyway, I hope you had fun going through all that work. Maybe we'll edit the same article at one point. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 23:08, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right - they were not "your lists" - but I was using that word in a possessive form since you implied several times that you take them personally. Anyway, I appreciate that you apologized for that and I don't like it when I need to use it against you but seeing as you have used my "suspected" sock-meat-whatever puppetry against me so many times already and you have purposely diggen up edit wars on me to discredit my ability as an editor (all for what I see it as - revenge) makes me see it as a notable addition. If the sock-meat-whatever-puppetry claims were true I'd already be apologizing for them. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 21:30, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
