<p>What in the world does "most unique" mean?</p>
<p>I believe it refers to the fact that this painting is unusual, practically alone in western art history, with regard to its themes, symbols, design, and complexity. --<a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESophitus_c635.html" title="User:Sophitus">Sophitus</a> 05:09, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Most unique" makes no sense; something is unique or it is not. Such nonsensical overstatement leads a reader to wonder if the writer knows what he is talking about.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Talk%7EArnolfini_Portrait_76b7.html" title="Edit section: Identity of the subjects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Identity of the subjects</span></h2>
<p>I was initially reverting the edits by User:220.238.157.118, changing the name of the subject from Giovani Arnolfini to Michele Arnolfini, as unexplained possible vandalism, but now that I have read around a little I see that there is plenty of uncertainty over the identity of the subjects of the painting.</p>
<p>Conventionally the sitters are identified as Giovanni di Arrigo Arnolfini and his bride Giovanna Cenami. This is largely based on the 1934 analysis by Erwin Panofsky which is often taken as the definitive interpretation. Panofsky in turn, was basing his analysis on a couple of 16th century documents that mention the picture, that may have been mistaken. There is evidence that this can't be Giovani Arnolfini, for example a document indicating that Giovanni was married 14 years after this painting. Others have argued that the apparent age of Giovanni shown in the portrait doesn't match the age he would have been at the time. Still others suggest Jan van Eyck actually painted the picture sometime long after the 1434 date painted on the wall.</p>
<p>Certainly one of the other candidates for the sitters would be Michele Arnolfini and his wife Elizabeth, but I don't think this is universally accepted. The linked Austrian reference <a href="http://www.asn-ibk.ac.at/bildung/faecher/geschichte/maike/treffpunkt/buch2-7.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asn-ibk.ac.at/bildung/faecher/geschichte/maike/treffpunkt/buch2-7.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> given by User:220.238.157.118 appears to state that the couple is Michele &amp; Elizabeth without much qualification. My German isn't stong enough to read that article well, but it appears to start with a discussion about the common standards of marriage in the middle ages, rather than being an analysis of this particular painting, and I can't see that web site has any special credibility.</p>
<p><br />
I suggest we leave the names of the sitters as the conventional Giovanni &amp; Giovanna, but include a paragraph explaining how they are probably misidentified and giving some of the alternatives. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 06:14, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>- You need to see the National Gallery catalogue: The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings by Lorne Cambell, 1998. Ms Cenami is out (she married G di A in 1447); it is G di A's cousin Giovanni di Nicolao plus an undocumented second wife who are shown. I think this version has to be given priority, as it is their painting. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 15:49, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm new here. How do I cite the book "The Arnolfini Betrothal: Medieval Marriage and the Enigma of Van Eyck's Double Portrait"? The part about art historian Edwin Hall is from this book. <a href="../../../c/m/y/User%7ECmyk_fbb9.html" title="User:Cmyk">Cmyk</a> 07:01, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a question I've been meaning to look in to for a while. In the old days (about 6 months ago) we would have just put a reference to the book at the end of the article. But now I am increasingly seeing the {{<a href="../../../r/e/f/Template%7ERef_0622.html" title="Template:Ref">ref</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENote_9446.html" title="Template:Note">note</a>}} templates being used to mark a particular comment. You can find instructions for using them at <a href="../../../r/e/f/Template_talk%7ERef_d46d.html" title="Template talk:Ref">Template talk:Ref</a>.</dd>
<dd>Basically it looks like you make up a footnote reference, like 'Hall01', then add {{ref|Hall01}} at the right point in the body text. Then add a Notes section with a list of reverse links back to the ref marker along with the specific page reference, {{note|Hall01}} Edwin Hall, p. 55.</dd>
<dd>When listing a book reference, its a good idea to inlcude the ISBN number which will automagically be turned in to a link to a page of sources for the book - e.g. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0520212215</a></dd>
<dd>There are some good examples of using them, as well as the formatting for book references in the <a href="../../../d/m/i/Dmitri_Shostakovich_de8c.html" title="Dmitri Shostakovich">Dmitri Shostakovich</a> article and several others in the <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">list of Featured Articles</a>. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 07:57, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Unique" does not take a modifier. It means "one of a kind," so something is either unique or it isn't: it can't be "very" unique. I changed the word in the article to "original," which seemed closest to what the author of the post meant.</p>

<p>It looks like many of the claims made in the "Symbolism" section of this article are from Panofsky's essay.

<p>I've decapitalized the name.

<dd>Probably not the best idea. As far as I know there is no known original title for this painting. 'Portrait of Giovanni(?) Arnolfini and his Wife' is the title the National Gallery (London) gives it, so might be considered official, but there is quite a range of alternative titles (we ought to include 'The Arnolfini Wedding' in the description). However the most popular common name appears to be just 'The Arnolfini Portrait' (with a capital P). Wikipedia's naming conventions are to use the most common name in English. Indeed this is already how the article is most commonly linked internally, so we should move the page back to where it was. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 16:33, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why do you assume The Arnolfini Portrait is the most common name? I don't like it, it seems very informal and it does not feel like a proper name.

<dd>Well, the internal links pointed to where the page was of course, to avoid redirects. That's no argument. And google stats are no good either, since "the arnolini portrait" can be used in a sentence where it might not be meant as the name. I'm willing to follow you based on your last point. But I still don't think "The Arnolifini Portrait" is the actual name of the painting. If it's not the name, we should follow the standard article naming guidelines and drop "The" and decapitalize "Portrait", so Arnolifini portrait. I'm sure Mona Lisa is not at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mona_Lisa_c24c.html" title="The Mona Lisa">The Mona Lisa</a> allthough people might call it that.</dd>
<dd>...
<ul>
<li>Well, I checked <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html#Selected_works" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo_da_Vinci#Selected_works</a> for reference, some of the works have "The" in the name where it could easily be left out (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Baptism_of_Christ_%28Verrocchio%29_ff3e.html" title="The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)">The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)</a>), others don't have "The" where it might have been used (<a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_of_the_Rocks_65ae.html" title="Virgin of the Rocks">Virgin of the Rocks</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adoration_of_the_Magi_%28Leonardo%29_5590.html" title="Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)">Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)</a>) so there appears to be no standard. To me, using "The" seems wrong unless it would be clear that the title contains "the" like in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Man_Who_Knew_Too_Much_%281934_film%29_ce89.html" title="The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)">The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)</a>. We'll have to take a closer look at the guidelines, can't do that right now.</li>
<li>As for the capitalization of "painting", that seems the same story. If it's the name of painting it can be capitalized, otherwise it's lowercase since it is not a proper noun.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>But anyway, I'm not going to push this.</dd>

<dd>No its not just because that's where the page was (although you are supposed to dab and update links when you move a page - hint&#160;:) ). When I check a 'What links here' I also check to see what text is associated with each link. If most of them have already been dab'ed that tells you that many editors are trying to use a different title. In this case, the text was typically a straight link on 'The Arnolifini Portrait'.</dd>
<dd>However, I would agree with you in that I'm not so comfortable with including the preposition as part of the title. As you say it can go either way. An easier check is just to look at <a href="../../../r/e/n/Category%7ERenaissance_paintings_856b.html" title="Category:Renaissance paintings">Category:Renaissance_paintings</a>. Again in this case it seems to be quite common to include the preposition in the title, but it is the sort of thing we could do with a wider policy on (there would be a better place to decide that than here - maybe it has already been discussed).</dd>
<dd>It is also commonly the case that Renaissance paintings (and many others) don't really have an official title. Unless a title was written on the painting (unusual), or unless a painting has a particularly well documented provenance which records a title in a contemporary document, the accepted title for a painting tends to be much more recent and may relate to the obvious subject, a famous owner or the name used by a gallery (even then there are often variations due to translation issues). The titles are mostly just 'handles' that art historians use to be sure they are all talking about the same painting. In this case I think the common title comes from Panofsky's 1934 article. It is quite likely that nobody had paid much attention to this painting before then.</dd>
<dd>However, I'm no expert on these things, so would happily be corrected. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 08:25, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whether we're supposed to update all links when moving a page stands to discussion. Updating a page creates more work for the servers than having the server process the redirects. Eliminating double redirects is more important.</dd>
<dd>After all that's been said, I still think the page should be at <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnolfini_portrait.html" title="Arnolfini portrait">Arnolfini portrait</a> or even Arnolfini (portrait) or Arnolfini (painting) but I'll leave the decision to you. But don't leave it where it is, I shouldn't have decapitalized without removing "The". If we use "The", it's a name and Painting should be capitalized. <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPietdesomere_7597.html" title="User:Pietdesomere">Piet</a> 08:43, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Solipsist; any search for an "actual name" is going to be futile. The title of this article is necessarily going to be an art-historical construct. That said, I don't think <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnolfini_portrait.html" title="Arnolfini portrait">Arnolfini portrait</a> (decapitalised p) is ideal. It suggests that "Arnolfini" is a particular type of portrait, just as <i>Fresco painting</i> is a particular technique of painting or <i>Relief sculpture</i> is a particular kind of sculpture. And I'm afraid <i>Arnolfini (portrait)</i> or <i>Arnolfini (painting)</i> only make that false suggestion stronger.</dd>
<dd>There's a convention on Wikipedia for artworks whose popular titles follow the formula "adjective (from the name of the patron/most famous owner/location) – noun" to capitalise both words: <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borghese_Gladiator_9a36.html" title="Borghese Gladiator">Borghese Gladiator</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgin_Marbles_d588.html" title="Elgin Marbles">Elgin Marbles</a>, <a href="../../../g/h/e/Ghent_Altarpiece_30b5.html" title="Ghent Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbaville_Tryptych_7dac.html" title="Harbaville Tryptych">Harbaville Tryptych</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mond_Crucifixion_6f0f.html" title="Mond Crucifixion">Mond Crucifixion</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland_Vase_08d5.html" title="Portland Vase">Portland Vase</a>.

<dd>I agree with Ham - though I think the most common name in the UK is "The Arnolfini Wedding", as started by Panofsky. The NG used to call it "The Arnolfini Marriage" (Potterton 1971) or Levey (ex-Director, "The NG Collection", 1987):"The Marriage of Giovanni Arnolfini" &amp; their current Languir guide 1997 subtitles it " The Arnolfini Portrait". The Article should be as it is, but "Arnolfini Portrait" for the reasons given above.</dd>

<dd>You're right, the decision to change the title from "Wedding" does appear to have been a pretty arbitrary one. Regarding the merits of "Wedding" versus "Portrait", I don't feel strongly on the matter – although I can't emphasise enough that there is no such thing as an "approved" title for works like this. However, since the matter probably won't be settled until we have decided on which is in most common usage, I made the following searches on Google, Google Book Search and Google Scholar:
<ul>
<li><i>"Arnolfini Portrait"</i> Google: 18,100; Book Search: 472; Scholar: 170</li>
<li><i>"Arnolfini Marriage"</i> Google: 13,000; Book Search: 92; Scholar: 81</li>
<li><i>"Arnolfini Wedding"</i> (not counting instances of <i>"Arnolfini Wedding Portrait"</i>) Google 834; Book Search: 49; Scholar: 65</li>
<li><i>"Arnolfini Wedding Portrait"</i> Google: 628; Book Search: 31; Scholar: 28</li>
<li><i>"Arnolfini Double Portrait"</i> Google: 955; Book Search: 33; Scholar: 31</li>
<li><i>"Giovanni Arnolfini and his Bride"</i> Google: 306; Book Search: 44; Scholar: 10</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Thus the current nomenclature, and not "Wedding", appears to be the most commonly used.

Also, there needs to be a consistent footnote style used because it gives it a bad appearence and doesn't inform the reader that some of the footnotes are links to other articles (which should be footnoted anyway, if not done son directly). <sup>(<a href="../../../s/a/i/User_talk%7ESailorAlphaCentauri_a8ff.html" title="User talk:SailorAlphaCentauri">talk to</a>)</sup><a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESailorAlphaCentauri_27ee.html" title="User:SailorAlphaCentauri">SailorAlphaCentauri</a> 15:59, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, though on the first point you could always try reading the text next to the image (anathema to many a WP editor I know) <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 16:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
