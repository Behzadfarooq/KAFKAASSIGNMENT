<p>An anonymous contributor changed the following text:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Arnold Judas Rimmer BSc, SSc</b> (Bronze Swimming Certificate, Silver Swimming Certificate), who sometimes goes by <b>Arnold Jonathan Rimmer</b> is played by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Barrie_5575.html" title="Chris Barrie">Chris Barrie</a> in the television series <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_5cc5.html" title="Red Dwarf">Red Dwarf</a>. He is instantly recognisable by both the permanent sneer on his lips and the "H" (hologram) symbol on his forehead.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>...who sometimes goes by <b>Arnold Judas Rimmer</b>...</dd>
</dl>
<p>Does anybody have a citation for his <b>not</b> being sometimes known as Arnold Jonathan Rimmer.</p>
<p>In episode "Justice" (3rd of 4th season) Kryten presents him at court as Arnold Judas Rimmer. There is canned laughter when he speaks the "Judas" part. I suspect that Kryten is playing here on the self loathing, suicidal personality of Rimmer (which is what gets him to prison in the penal colony on the first place); it is not his actual name, else there would have been no canned laughter either; we are to regard it as an in-context joke. Furthermore, Rimmer seems to disaprove of the name. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucius_Domitius_21ef.html" title="User:Lucius Domitius">Lucius Domitius</a> 19:53, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Grim Reaper calls him Arnold Judas Rimmer in the last episode of the series, but he seems to do so in a rather matter of fact way; well, Red Dwarf is not about consistency, really. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucius_Domitius_21ef.html" title="User:Lucius Domitius">Lucius Domitius</a> 23:58, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In <i>The Inquisitor</i>, Lister tries to persuade Rimmer that he (Lister) knows him (Rimmer) by saying something like "Your middle name's Judas, but you tell everyone it's Jonathan". He is referred to as "Arnold J. Rimmer" all the time. So it's definitely his middle name, although he does disapprove of it (he disapproves of most of what his parents did to him, his name being no exception). <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMendor_eb4d.html" title="User:Mendor">Mendor</a> 00:00, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting remark; but the fact is that "Justice" predates the "Inquisitor" and is still the first mention of the name "Judas", as a joke according to all evidence. The idea might have occured to the creators to make it into Rimmer's real name after the "Justice" episode. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucius_Domitius_21ef.html" title="User:Lucius Domitius">Lucius Domitius</a> 13:37, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Series II episode "Better Than Life" predates both of these, where the Taxman clarifies his full name, a character created by Rimmer's twisted subconscious. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndymarczak_410b.html" title="User:Andymarczak">Andymarczak</a> 11:42, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was redirected here from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rimmer_Experience_d528.html" title="The Rimmer Experience">The Rimmer Experience</a>. This article has one sentence which almost discusses the experience section of the episode, but doesn't tell us anything about the experience. The page that was at "The Rimmer Experience" before it was deleted, has a large amount of, (if not usefull then interesting), information about this section of the episode.

<p><i>Consequently, in Series 4 episode 3, "Justice", the story is rewritten on the fly and it is revealed that Rimmer's sense of responsibility for the disaster is due to his zealous egomania and that he could not possibly have been responsible for the the accident.</i></p>
<p>I don't think it was part of a rewrite.... I figured that Rimmer DID feel guilt about the accident because he WAS responsible, but Kryten was instead twisting the facts just to get Rimmer off the hook. I mean later in the episode Rimmer DID point out how Kryten twisted the facts in order to win... - Nick15</p>
<dl>
<dd>I thought, the whole point of that joke is that Kryten didn't have to "spin" anything to get Rimmer off. He was telling the truth. Just shows how useless Rimmer was, (Before he became a hologram). However, there was a flash-back when we saw Captain Hollister yelling at Rimmer, saying that it was his job to mend the drive plates. Not sure which ep. it came from, but it might have been "Stasis Leak" from series 2. <a href="../../../j/p/_/User%7EJP_Godfrey_d1cf.html" title="User:JP Godfrey">JP Godfrey</a> 11:24, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've tidied up the page a bit and tried to put everything into a more logical and lucid structure, as previously it was going from his life to his personality to his death and then back again. I also removed the section about 'The Rimmer Experience', since it seemed unnecessary to devote so much space to a single joke about the character (and I'm not sure, but I don't think we're allowed to provide entire song-lyric quotes on Wikipedia, as was the case) when it could be summed up in a single sentence or paragraph - nevertheless, I've retained the text and provided it here, and am willing to be convinced that it could be important.

<dd><b>The Rimmer Experience</b> is a sequence from an episode in the seventh series <i><a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_%28Red_Dwarf_episode%29_4e9f.html" title="Blue (Red Dwarf episode)">Blue</a></i>. It is a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_reality.html" title="Virtual reality">virtual reality</a> journey through Arnold Rimmer's distorted mind, written by <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryten.html" title="Kryten">Kryten</a> with the aid of Rimmer's diaries, to remind <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Lister_33e5.html" title="Dave Lister">Dave Lister</a> of why he loathed Arnold Rimmer so much.</dd>
<dd>

</dd>
<dd>The Rimmer Experience is akin to a roller-coaster ride. The participants (<a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_characters_5da8.html#David_Lister" title="Red Dwarf characters">Lister</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_characters_5da8.html#Kryten" title="Red Dwarf characters">Kryten</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_characters_5da8.html#Kristine_Kochanski" title="Red Dwarf characters">Kochanski</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_characters_5da8.html#The_Cat" title="Red Dwarf characters">the Cat</a>) are taken in a small car along a track, while viewing video and audio simulations made by Kryten based on Rimmer's diaries. Kryten suggests that they ride the Experience when Lister reveals that he is beginning to miss Rimmer (who has left to become <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_characters_5da8.html#Ace_Rimmer" title="Red Dwarf characters">Ace Rimmer</a>.) The purpose of the Experience is to snap Lister out of his false, nostalgic memories of Rimmer and remind him of Rimmer's true nature.</dd>
<dd>The Experience begins by travelling through a large pair of fairground-style windows. A huge Rimmer head speaks to the four viewers about the heroism in the events that follow, and the remarkable nature of the man (himself) featured in them.</dd>
<dd>This is followed by a simulation of the <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Starbug.html" title="Starbug">Starbug</a></i> cockpit, in which Rimmer corrects Kryten about the nature of <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid.html" title="Asteroid">asteroid</a> belts, and Lister and the Cat tremble in fear. The second simulation is of Rimmer giving the Cat fashion tips, followed by Lister saying that he owes his life to Rimmer.</dd>
<dd>The Experience culminates in what is popularly known as the Rimmer Munchkin Song. This is sung by a chorus of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dwarf_characters_5da8.html#Arnold_Rimmer" title="Red Dwarf characters">Arnold Rimmer</a> puppets, which also perform a marching dance at the same time. The puppets, or <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munchkins.html" title="Munchkins">Munchkins</a> as they are popularly known (after the singing Munchkins in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wizard_of_Oz_%281939_movie%29_fbfb.html" title="The Wizard of Oz (1939 movie)">The Wizard of Oz</a></i>), wear uniforms identical to Rimmer's in red, blue and green.</dd>
<dd>They are accompanied by a <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">choir</a> chorus of marching Rimmers, a <a href="../../../x/y/l/Xylophone.html" title="Xylophone">xylophone</a> and an unidentified brass instrument. The song lyrics are as follows:</dd>
<dd><i>If you're in trouble he will save the day</i></dd>
<dd><i>He's brave and he's fearless come what may</i></dd>
<dd><i>Without him the mission would go astray</i></dd>
<dd><i>He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer</i></dd>
<dd><i>Without him life would be much grimmer</i></dd>
<dd><i>He's handsome, trim, and no-one slimmer</i></dd>
<dd><i>He will never need a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walker_%28tool%29.html" title="Walker (tool)">zimmer</a></i></dd>
<dd><i>He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer</i></dd>
<dd><i>More reliable than a garden trimmer</i></dd>
<dd><i>He's never been mistaken for <a href="../../../y/u/l/Yul_Brynner_657f.html" title="Yul Brynner">Yul Brynner</a></i></dd>
<dd><i>He's not bald, and his head doesn't glimmer</i></dd>
<dd><i>Master of the wit and the repartee</i></dd>
<dd><i>His command of space directives is uncanny</i></dd>
<dd><i>How come he's such a genius? Don't ask me!</i></dd>
<dd><i>Ask Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer</i></dd>
<dd><i>He's also a fantastic swimmer</i></dd>
<dd><i>And if you play your cards right</i></dd>
<dd><i>Then he just might come round for dinner''</i></dd>
<dd>By the end of The Experience, Lister is so fed up he declares "I never want to see or hear from that scum-sucking, lying, weasel-minded smeghead, in my entire life." Kryten replies "<a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, eat your heart out."</dd>
