<p>Adding one link to a scientology website does not denote a total reorganization of an entire page. To disrupt the integrity of pages others contribute and painting them with POV issues is a pale excuse. To redirect a "Recommended Reading" url link to the Wiki page on William Sargant alone - one that you have already altered, is inane - your POV noted. The reorganization of External Links - to separate the news titles from the urls (with the creation of a new "References" category - shows an obvious intent to confuse readers and researchers. POV is a shoddy excuse for Vandalism.</p>
<p>User:Maureen D 05:41, 29 July 2005</p>
<p><br />
NPOV does not include reorganizing this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arnaldo_Lerma&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arnaldo_Lerma&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">entire page,</a> and most notably to the date integrity, specifically to include this paragraph of undated information:</p>
<p>"Lerma was on the Board of Policy of Liberty Lobby, an anti-semitic organization founded by Willis Carto. Carto turned over part of his archives to Lerma to continue his "legacy.""</p>
<p>Alot of work had to be done in order to disorganize the date format that had previously been established. Why would anyone have to reorganize the entire article if the addition of material were credible enough to fall under the timeline or categories already established? The reorganization of the context of dates was necessary and intentional in order to insure the addition of this information, knowing it lacked the proper support, and which also served to move other "more notable" information about Arnie Lerma from the top of the page. The paragraph, with credible and supportive dates and ext links could have simply been added to the article under the already established date intergrity had the supportive information been known. The burden of proof to its authenticity had to be in question in order to alter the intergrity of dates as they had already been established. This is not editing, this is vandalism. The total reorganization of dates, in addition to the above comments from July 29. lack not only a NPOV, but have the effect of using a NPOV in order to vandalize.</p>

<p>No discussion of the removal of these links by AI originally or after last revert. One ext link was left in by AI, (Aff of Arnie Lerma) that was mistakingly not filed in date chronological order and will be fixed now that the article has been reverted. Maureen D</p>

<ul>
<li>Vandalism: AI has reverted article again, this time changing name "Arnaldo Pagliarini Lerma, known as Arnie Lerma" to "Arnaldo (Arnie) Pagliarini Lerma." No comment on necessity for change, eg did you contact Mr. Lerma to ask what his preference was in order to make this change?</li>
</ul>
<p>Playing with dates again- moving personal information and birthdate around</p>
<p>and then adding the same undated, opinion:</p>
<p>'Lerma was on the Board of Policy of Liberty Lobby, an anti-semitic organization founded by Willis Carto. Carto turned over part of his archives to Lerma to continue his "legacy."'</p>
<p>Is the subtle shifting of dates supposed to deter readers still, to not notice the addition of this undated, unsubstantiated information?</p>
<p>To the degree that there was less reorganization to the entire article this time still shows the same necessity and intent to use a dispute to the NPOV yet, with having to shift a date, and again add in undated, unsupported information.</p>
<p>Reverted; Reported again to Vandalism in Progress Maureen D</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>AI stop the Vandalism.</li>
</ul>
<p>AI has removed media links supportive to written text, and added unsubstantiated, undated material, linked to scientology websites. Moving things around, recategorizing the page, does not cover the obvious need to add this spurious, undated material. It is not believed that NPOV allows fabrication as source for bias. A hundred websites could be listed as a reference, but without the history or support to substantiate the factual dates of the bias text presented, then the information is as good as fabrication. Shifting and editing other facts to degrade the date integrity, has been the underlying factor of this vandalism.</p>
<p>This text has been added several times <i>without a link</i> to its source: "David G. Post, co-director of the Cyberspace Law Institute at Georgetown University, said..."</p>
<p>The only source found for this quote is from scientology's website, "Freedom Magazine website" <a href="http://www.freedommag.org/english/vol28I2/page30.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.freedommag.org/english/vol28I2/page30.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedommag.org/english/vol28I2/page30.htm</a> that does not contain a date or link to it's being rendered as a professional opinion anywhere else, nor as it may be pertinent to the results RTC vs Lerma. The same "Freedom Magazine" website also claims that Arnie Lerma stole the copyrighted materials that were posted to the internet. Have yet to see a link to conclusive court documentation that proves this "opinion," as well as other allegations made on that website. The balance of credible information on the website is past bias in a rational form.</p>

<p>I have extensively cleaned up and "wikified" the article which included reformatting, spelling correction, grammer correction, introduction of data which may be seen as controversial and can be disputed with discussions here on the talk page. Very little or nothing of Marueen's contributions were deleted except Arnie's "link farm," which Wikipedia is not.

<li>What is the connotation to adding the category of "Agenda" to the discussion page, without a comment? Wikified what? Your own reverts of undated information, vandalism? I've never seen an encyclopedia that references events without dates. Repeating, - the underlying nature of this vandalism has been the use of technical editing to remove references, and the degradation of date integrity that supported the dated information that has been cited, (with the spontaneous addition of undated information.) There has been no reply or discussion of the undated information that has been edited in, and reverted numerous times. The discussion of dated information has been noted numerous times on this talk page, without response by AI. (Wikification and "link farm" suggestions have been introduced later, yet that does not address the undated information comments.) "If there are disputes.." is not a logical reason for not bringing information without dates or supportive information. You cannot shift that responsibility, if you have read or understood the discussion on this page so far. The burden of proof to the information is not others, but yours. Maureen D</li>

<p>There is no proof, that this text is from Arnie Lerma: it is not on Lermanet itself but on the CISAR site which is hosted by Lermanet since 2004 or 2005. Joe Cisar is a Journalist who translated lots of German Scientology articles into English and did some investigations about Scientology as well. As the whole Spotlight-Scientology-Carto stuff is on the Cisar page, it is more likely, that the author of these reports (including the description of the Carto visit) is Joe Cisar and not Arnie Lerma - there is no name given about the author.

<p>Removed the ext link to the RFW website, (Religious Freedom Watch - Anti-religious Extremist: Arnie Lerma) as it applies to no referenced text in the article. The problem with the link being added originally is that the information that was being referenced in added text was undated, therefore unwarranted for addition.</p>
<p>One of the other problems with referencing the RFW website link is that the text often referenced does not match the text on the page. The edits in this article compared to the text on the RFW website were misleading. (Besides undated information.) eg., after AI added the RFW weblink, the first paragraph in the Arnie Lerma Wiki article was changed to say, "Lerma organizes and participates in demonstrations against the Church of Scientology." However, one of the first things that RFW link quotes is, "Arnie Lerma at a hate march.." The addition of text from the page verbatim would certainly be extreme in its own sense, and that brings the question of having to even soften the information to put it on Wikipedia. A supportive reference would back up what the article text says, not say something else when you looked to the link for more information. The language on the RFW page is extreme on the other hand, and if it cannot be quoted directly, or if the source of the page is not actually named on the page itself, it has no merit. The softening of the added language from the RFW page vs what is actually quoted in the text of the article may almost seem intentional, as if knowing that a certain level of extremism on the weblink already existed.</p>
<p>It has been assumed that RFW is a Scientology page, but without any quotation that is directly related, along with its being the only source of information that quotes this information - it would not appear to be a substantial, credible reference to be used for an encyclopedia. 25 August 2005 User:Maureen D</p>

<dd>Experienced Scientology critics are convinced that it is a Scientology page - there are numerous factors contributing to this view: similarity of language, lists only people seen as "enemies" by Scientology, site is registered by "Scientology Parishioners Committee". I've seen at different times some Scientologists mentioned who run it. Even if it is not finally proved, the site qualifies definitely as Partisan website, probably as extremist partisan website.

</ul>
<p><i>cos_lerma_011996.announce"</i></p>
<p><i>CoS press release on the Jan. 19 ruling in favor of RTC and against Arnaldo Lerma. This press release diverges from previous ones, having more factual information and less spin, though it does state "This is a significant decision not only for the Church of Scientology but all other intellectual property owners..." This is not true - the case was jurisprudentially routine, and established little or nothing in the way of new precedent. The aspects of the larger case that are interesting from a precedent and legal significance point of view - whether Digital Gateway Systems and the Washington Post could also be held liable - have already been resolved, and not in CoS's favor. The press release also of course neglects to mention the judge's chastisement of CoS for the improper raid on Lerma, and other significant aspects of the decision.</i></p>
<p>The text you're adding highlights a copyright issue that does not merit the impunity, or precedent, <i>then or now</i> as the EFF's opinion above logically and professionally states - verbatim. The bulk of RTC vs Lerma is on the World Wide Web for others to read. This POV you express, based on a Scientology press release (and amongst many opinions stated in the court documents) suggests the copyright issue as being senior to the overall outcome - which it was not. It was decided that the harassment was senior. Maureen D 3 September, 2005</p>

<p>The comment by the EFF Website confirms the obviously provable fact that the judge ruled in favor of RTC regarding Lerma's alleged copyright violations, regardless of any other issues. And Lerma's copyright violation(s) are simply an issue, regardless of any seniority of the issue. Lerma's alleged claims of harrassment do not nullify the CoS claims of alleged copyright violation. Seniority does not disqualify the significant-minority view.(see WP:NPOV) Censorship of the copyright issues ruled upon at the January 19, 1996 hearing is a violation of WP:NPOV. --<a href="../../../a/i/_/User%7EAI_72bc.html" title="User:AI">AI</a> 21:55, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My POV regarding Lerma's copyright violation is not based on personal opinions or my personal activist views on copyrights. On January 19, 1996, the judge granted RTC's summary judgement motion based on evidence of wholesale and verbatim infringements by Lerma of 33 separate works. At the same time, the judge denied a summary judgement motion filed by Lerma who claimed that his actions were "fair use" and should be allowed. Censorship of the POV I am presenting is a violation of WP:NPOV.

<li>You did not cite your sources in the article - only here, with one press release from Scientology. The listing of your December hearing above: <i>"RTC filed a summary judgement motion in December based on evidence of wholesale and verbatim infringements by Lerma of 33 separate works..</i> is much past explanation rendered in official court documents if you have read either of the two hearings you refer to. Or the ones before or after the dates. There are linked court docs in the article that discuss these issues as well. (and is it 33 separate works or 31? or 5 infringements?) If you cite the same press release on the article, it will not be acceptable because it doesn't include any official opinion of both of the hearings you have cited. The facts are in the court documents. Scientology makes untruthful statements in respect to the explanation of the fair use, as the denial of one motion is not an overall reason to conclude that the hearing caused a precedent setting event. That is not a POV that is a distortion of the facts. When there are not other professional renderings of such a conclusion, that is not an opinion. In retrospect, the facts have been distorted.</li>

<p>I suggest only authentic sources be cited, eg actual court documents, so that the community can see and determine that the details properly render a NPOV.

This is not a healthy way to debate. AI has shown no interest in summarizing or bringing any other details of both of the court documents cited in this Scientology press release. If AI is unable to bring and summarize court documents that reflect or allow others to have input for a NPOV, I think the citation of sources be rejected until the proper support is brought and can be read by the community. Like this Scientology press release, and with other sources AI has used here, the facts were not authenticated to prove the summary of his text to the article, but he instead argued NPOV. AI stopped discussing and instead started to talk about Wiki policy. This does not replace his responsibility to bringing in of other sources to authenticate or allow others to check the NPOV. Nor should this consume other editors time to have to prove the facts for AI. This is an intentional, repetitive occurence in this article, where AI responds in terms of NPOV instead of proving his summarization from the sources he brings or by attempting to bring other sources. This Scientology press release is not an authentic representation of a proper source.</p>

<p><i>Arnie Lerma was interrogated by the church and was allegedly offered "safe passage out of Florida with all of his body parts"</i> is easily viewed as an "extarodinary claim". It doesn't have "extarodinary proof", indeed, it has no reference at all. Would it be safe to say, "Lerma claims the moon is made of green cheese" and provide no reference? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryeo_a180.html" title="User:Terryeo">Terryeo</a> 19:25, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you deny that it happened, or that he claimed it? --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 20:58, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, being interrogated and coerced with threats of bodily harm by the <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Sisters_of_the_Poor_247b.html" title="Little Sisters of the Poor">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> is an extraordinary claim. The Church of Scientology interrogating one of its own members and offering that member violence is barely enough to raise an eyebrow. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 21:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Turrisi has also edited the Wiki page on Willis Carto,</p>

<p>which is a repetitive pattern that Scientology has continued on other forums with other posters; a significance that on behalf of Scientology, members are providing propaganda on numerous levels concerning Arnaldo Lerma that reveals a conspiracy of character assasination.</p>
