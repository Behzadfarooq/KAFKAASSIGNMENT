<dd>I don't think it's correct to call "Schoenberg" the anglicized version of "Schönberg"; it is exactly how a German speaker would type or write the name without the letter "ö". I also doubt very many English speakers would be helped by the change. More than likely, the composer got a lot of SHOWN-bergs or even SHOW-en-bergs. Without any text to the contrary, my guess would be the change was a matter of typographical ease of use. Ben L. 15:42, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Schoenberg was not afraid of turning 76 until just prior to his birthday, when an astrologer acquaintance sent him a warning that the year was ominous. Prior to that, he had only been afraid of ages that were multiples of 13, 65 in particular.</dd>

<p>I've spent some time searching and can't find any corroborating information for the claim of his specific time of death, saying "harmony" etc only that he died on that day. Could we get an external link? I am interested to confirm this because not only is it a very strange coincidence but it seems rather odd that his wife would be telling him to "wake up and quit this nonsense" just before midnight as not only would normal people be sleeping, but the day would have been over shortly anyway. Sounds very dubious to me. 203.97.162.200 06:16, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have heard many tellings of the story in many places... if it's not true it's at least a <i>very</i> widespread rumour. (But it would be nice to know the truth.)

<dd><i>The composer Arnold Schoenberg (ironically born on the 13th) suffered from triskaidekaphobia. He was convinced that he would die aged 76 (because 7+6 = 13). Not only did his premonition come true, he also died on Friday 13 July 1951 (another 13: Friday is the sixth day of the week - beginning on Sunday - and July is the seventh month, making 6 + 7 = 13; 1951: 19 - 5 - 1 = 13) at 11:47 PM - 13 minutes to midnight. Also, adding the numbers 1, 1, 4, and 7 brings up a total of 13.</i></dd>

<p>Maybe his triskaidekaphobia should be placed under a different title, as I'm not sure how a phobia can be an extramusical interest. I presume <i>interest</i> refers to Schoenberg himself and not the reader. <b>thedarkestclear 13:54, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</b></p>

<p>The category I pointed to is a list of categories and pages. The pages are all of the form "List of works by ----" - specifically, not mixed with biography etc., and also importantly, so named. (It was, when I wrote that, (edit - almost!!) the only page in that category in fact that wasn't of the form "List of compositions by x", and tended to stand out. It's not there anymore. Hrm.

<p>I know Schoenberg was a communist, or at least held communist/socialist views and leaned far to the left. It directly relates to one of the principles of of atonal theory (the destruction of tonal heirarchy). Does anyone have a source for this? I think it should definitely be added to the article. A quick Google search didn't reveal much, and I don't have my library card with me, so I can't access my library's online databases like Grove and JSTOR; but if someone has a biography or something of the like, it'd save some time. -- <a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">Ci</a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_Esperanza_ee71.html" title="User:Cielomobile/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../c/i/e/User%7ECielomobile_be6b.html" title="User:Cielomobile">lomobile</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/i/e/User_talk%7ECielomobile_a41e.html" title="User talk:Cielomobile">talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cielomobile_5348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cielomobile">contribs</a></sup> 10:05, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is true that many of the postwar composers interested in serialism are/were communists. <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luigi_Nono_cfbf.html" title="Luigi Nono">Luigi Nono</a> springs very quickly to mind, but there are many others.</dd>

<dd>Schoenberg, however, was not a communist. He was also opposed to the term "atonal", and the phrase "destruction of tonal heirarchy" doesn't really fit with the way he described what he was doing (he considered it more of an extension beyond tonality, not the destruction of it). Even in his writings on music (published as "Style and Idea") you can see right wing tendencies; his argument for stronger copyright, for instance; his view of the composer as a privileged expert; etc, and there are articles more directly related to his political views in journals out there (sorry, I can't come up with a citation offhand), and these views also correlate directly with his religious beliefs. - <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainwarrior_5180.html" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> 14:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First off, let me say that I completely unsure of Schoenberg's political views. However, I do not think there is any contradiction between having Communist sympathies and arguments for strong copyright or the composer as a superior being. To me such views are variations on authoritarianism, and Russian Communism, at least, certainly had no problem with that. <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_Sixguns_b319.html" title="User:Cyrus Sixguns">Chris</a> 01:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
