<p>This is a remarkable list of notable alumni, many of whom are so notable they have no Wikipedia article... --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 14:46, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does one judge notablity on having a Wiki page these days then?</p>
<ul>
<li>Not by any means. But if someone is notable enough to be listed here, you'd think someone would see fit to write an article about them, or at least a stub. It's a pretty impressive list, after all, with a lot of honors. Also, how are we non-Arnold School people supposed to differentiate between someone like Ben G. Nigam, and Sir Martin Holdgate or, for that matter, Samuel Flitman? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 02:37, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And where's even the evidence that, say, Sir William Lyons was a student at Arnold? His article doesn't indicate it in any way. I'm thinking the entire list should be considered bogus until demonstrated otherwise, with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that can be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 21:34, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sir William Lyons was a pupil at the school, hence why there's a suite in the Design Centre named after him. If it pains you so much sir, why not drop an email to the school for confirmations?
<ul>
<li>Please familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's requirement that information presented here be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and come from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. It's possible that I'm wrong in my observation about some of the people on this list, but it's made a lot harder when people are trying to include obvious fake entries like Flitman, Nigam, Fisher, and Weetch. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 21:49, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With due respect Sir. This is a direct quote from the Arnold School website:</li>
</ul>
<p>Solid foundations Arnold School was founded by Frank Truswell Pennington on 4th May 1896. Known initially as South Shore Collegiate School, the school moved to its present site in Lytham Road when Pennington took over and gradually, expanded the buildings of an earlier Victorian School. He then adopted the former school’s name of Arnold House School, named after Dr Thomas Arnold, Headmaster of Rugby School. The name was later amended to Arnold School.</p>
<p>Distinguished pupils By the time of his death in May, 1938, Pennington had given the School to the Old Boys who elected a Governing Council. From its inception, Arnold has attracted pupils of the highest calibre from the Fylde Coast. In return, the school has given Lancashire many of its most distinguished citizens, including Sir William Lyons, the founder of Jaguar Cars and Dr Michael Smith who received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1993, a replica of which is on permanent display in the school entrance hall. Other notable alumni include:</p>
<p>Honours</p>
<p>Sir Walter Clegg (Government Chief Whip, Ex-Officio Controller of the Royal Household); Sir Harold Grime (Director of Reuter’s Agency, Chairman of the Press Association, Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire); Sir Martin Holdgate (Geographical and Zoological); Sir William Lyons (Founder of Jaguar Cars); Sir Earnest Woodhouse Smith, (President of Institute of Fuel).</p>

<p>It certainly pains me that someone without any prior knowledge of the school or its outstanding contributors throughout a century of British and world history fails to be verified by yourself due to the fact they do not appear on "Wikipedia" or any "Google" search.</p>
<p>A formal apology would be very forthcoming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are Flitman, Nigam, Fisher, and Weetch? Or, for that matter, Coggin? As I said, I could be wrong about Lyons, and I was. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 22:00, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Again Sir. Being an accredited member of Arnold School for a total of 10 years and an Old Arnoldian for many more, it appears that, yes, some pupils have taken it at their liberty to vulgarise and graffitti upon this place of learning. However. I do not certainly this it is your place to delete esteemed members of the OA wider circle. If you were to look at the school records and indeed the school leavers, published annually, you would find these names. As consequently, you show no desire to verify these names beyond limited internet searches, unless you check the records themselves by contacting Arnold School directly to check to whether these people did indeed attend Arnold and are then should rightfully be justified a place upon the Arnold School wikipedia section. I suggest therein, that unless you are willing to check with the Old Arnoldian society, you should not make anymore brash and downright disrespectful names against the men and women who attended this academic establishment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With regards to Mr Weetch. His film was shown on the popular Granada television programme 'Granada Tonight' documentating the schools charity work in Tanzania, which earnt the staff member in charge of the excursion Mr Kendall Lee, an OBE and a meeting with the Queen. To therefore completely disregard such work would be disrespectful to the hours of man power and sacrifice the school and especially Mr Weetch and Mr Lee have put into providing charity work in Tanzania, which has accumulated in a school for the blind along with various well projects and road building excercises. Even though this is not deemed as 'popular' as for example, Mr Purves who appeared on 'Blue Peter', charity work is an esteemed and reputable practice, even if it does not appear highlighted on a 'google' search engine.
<ul>
<li>That's all very well and good. Please <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite</a> your <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources; that's how Wikipedia works.

<li>A link has now been provided which verifies the facts stated previously. I sincerely hope an amicable solution can now be reached and the previous incredulous tone ceases.</li>
<li>Please sign your posts with ~~~~. So, where's this Rhian Coggin person in your references? I appreciate that you are putting in accurate information; it does not for a moment lessen my incredulity at the nonsense that's also been put into this article in the last couple of days. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 22:52, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This Rhian Coggin person is listed (as stated in the article) on the following website:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Well, sure, there's someone there listed as "R Coggin", but in what way can we <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> that what the list says is correct: <i>Rhian Coggin, Linguist, University of Manchester, University of Sheffield, Folkuniversitetet Göteborg</i>? All we can verify is that a person named R Coggin left Arnold. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 23:31, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi. Just dropping by to encourage the contributors here to keep to the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy. <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">User:Jpgordon</a> is quite right that making sure that each alum mentioned has a reference to both their attendence and their notability will keep the list from being strangely cluttered with either non-alums or random names from the class lists. It looks like there has been some start towards this, and that's good to see. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 23:26, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The links shows that rhian coggin has gone to the University of Manchester and is a valid source. If it upsets you so much ring them or get away from your PC for once and fly to Manchester and find out. Why do you need to be famous to be part of this. Are you trying to say their achievements exceed ours and they are more superior as they have been on TV for eg <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.110.100.139 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.110.100.139_ec4a.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.110.100.139">contribs</a>) 23:47, April 22, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Apologies for whoever wrote the last statement. However, a few facts do ring true. The website explicitly states that R. Coggin has indeed studied linguistics at the University of Manchester. Trooserjazz 23:51, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, no, it says he studied German/Russian there; and it says nothing about University of Sheffield and Folkuniversitetet Göteborg. (We really do have to be that nit-picky here about our data and our data sources; and when we discover questionable information, we grab onto it like a bulldog until it's either verified or discarded.) As far as the previous statement is concerned, I don't worry much about the opinions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arnold_School&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49638361" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arnold_School&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=49638361" rel="nofollow">vandals</a>. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 23:56, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whilst it is easy to verify say, major historical events, of course it will be difficult to do the same for a small school in North West England. What is going on here isn't sullying the reputation of Wikipedia, or indeed just a bunch of school children having a laugh. The information is relevent to Arnold School (isn't that the job of an Encyclopaedia anyway?) and therefore I feel the constant deletion of entries is absurd. There are various other articles written on here which hold content that is somewhat dubious. A prime example being one on Bernhard Schlink's book Der Vorleser (which has now been corrected I believe.). Point being there will always be inaccuracies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should you wish for proof of the academic whereabouts and history of Rhian Coggin, I can happily provide you with screen shots, however you won't be allowed acces first hand as they're university directories which you need a campus username to access.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Rhian is a girl's name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why am i a vandal could you give evidence to why i am. I do apologise to what was said, but i was becoming increasingly frustrated. Trooserjazz has given you all the evidence and links to assure you that the information is factually correct you have refused to except this and began to nit pick</p>
<p>Please can we cease all this nonsense of who is and who is not posting in-credible information. All necessary information regarding Arnold School, its achievements, its noteable alumni and its not so noteable alumni can be confirmed on the official Arnold School website (and not just on internet search engines). I should expect that using this method we can all work together in order to create a respectable and credible Wikipedia site where anyone wishing to find reliable information regarding the academic establishment can be sought. I pray that this may be the end of ongoing nonsensical correspondance. Thankyou.</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) Please sign your posts with ~~~~. (b) Wikipedia has a very strict rule: information has to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. It's the responsibility of the person putting the information into an article to assure the verifiability; secret or confidential sources (such as the university directories) don't really fit well into this scheme, do they? Nit picking is precisely necessary -- in the real world, it's called fact checking. (c) Please convince your classmates to stop adding their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arnold_School&amp;diff=49686086&amp;oldid=49663766" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arnold_School&amp;diff=49686086&amp;oldid=49663766" rel="nofollow">chums</a> to the list; it's that sort of vandalism that brought me here in the first place. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 03:32, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
