	    <p>Rothstein's relationship with Legs Diamond is misrepresented in thsi article all reports in New York during that period list the two as being "at war" by 1928 over the Diamond's cheating Rothstein in a drug operation. Which is likely the reason Diamond associate Fatty Walsh, George Uffner and Charlie Luciano were the first 3 picked up when Rothstein died.. The myth that Luciano was no longe rinvolved with Diamond at that point is shot down when you check the New York Times archives and find an article dated Aug 30th 1930 that notes that he was on board White Star liner known as the Baltic when Diamond landed in Ireland and was prevented to disembark.</p>

<hr />
<p>Rothstein's agents paid over 9 million dollars to the players who were fixing the World Series?! Someone check that number: it has to be wrong. Eddie Cicotte received 10,000 dollars for his participation; the other seven players received a combined total of about 50,000 dollars (check that number as well, it might be a little off). Not all of this was paid by "Rothstein's agents" but it is a true statement if you stretch the definition; every gambler had Rothstein's support even if they were not always using his money. Rothstein himself bet a considerable sum on the series. I can't remember how much but I think it was about 2 million. Lou N. 10/22/05</p>

This article is poorly written. Case in point: "Rothstein was shot to death at Manhattan's Park-Central Hotel in November 1928...even Rothstein himself refused to identify the shooter." If he was "shot to death" how was he able to discuss the shooter? Did he die straight away or, as the piece says, the next day of his wounds at a different location?</p>
<p>And as "Lou N." does, I question the $9 million figure regarding the 1919 World Series. Very fishy.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
The figure about Arnold's bet might seem a slight shady, but after doing some research, there was some light that was shed.</p>
<p>After reviewing an old section about Rothstein's shooting from "The New York Times, Monday, November 5th, 1928", I found that this article presented on Wikipedia was only more or less off by its wording. It is true that he was shot, but he did not die immedieately, hence the part "...even Rothstein himself refused to identify the shooter." in this article. However, a sentence starting with "Rothstein was shot to death at Manhattan's Park-Central Hotel in November 1928..." to describe his eventually dimise was not so much poor writting as much as not including enough information before and after to come to such a conclusion. It is true he was shot and it is true that he died the next day at Polyclinic Hospital, but he was alive long enough to have discussed the shooter, which Rothstein refused to say, since he was not moved from when he first entered Polyclinic, passing away with the name of the true shooter with him.</p>
<p>As to whether the bet was really 9 million dollars might seem farfetched, yet according to "The New York Times" article, when he was found wounded in the Fifty-sixth Street service entrance of the Park Central Hotel, Fifty-sixth Street and Seventh Avenue at 11 o'clock p.m. the night of November 4th, authorities found that he was carring $6,500 in his pocket. It also explains that he was reported to have often carried up to $100,000 in his wallet at a time. It very well could have been 2 million, but possible enough that he would have bet up to 9 million since he was known to be a gambling man, the reason why he was shot in first place due to refusing to pay the debt he owed in a reasonable amount of time as specified by "The New York Times, Wednesday, November 7th, 1928". It is even said in this edition of "The New York Times" that he used money that he borrowed to gamble with, losing all of it, gaining it back, and then losing up to $219,000 at the end of game in debt (even though the Times article reveals in the next two sentences that on paper, he was out more than $800,000) causing someone to go out and shoot Rothstein as the result. However, such knowledge as to the actual number of the 1919 world series scandal is left to further research.</p>
<p>Overall, the article is only short of few writting errors. It still has much validity and except for the parts discussed so far as being questionable, is still helpful and informative. Mr. Jack 00:03, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A question: Is there any information regarding the death of his widow which must have happened after the Katcher bio since in the forward to this book she is mentioned as an interviewee?</p>
