<p>Hi, I was just about to welcome you, but somebody else did it while I was editing my message!</p>
<p>Specifically, however, I noticed you removed <a href="../../../v/i/d/Vidkun_Quisling_c366.html" title="Vidkun Quisling">Vidkun Quisling</a> from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Norway_a177.html" title="List of Prime Ministers of Norway">List of Prime Ministers of Norway</a>. I don't know much about this, but I think it might be worth leaving in a link of some kind anyway - see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Norway_b140.html" title="Talk:List of Prime Ministers of Norway">the article's discussion page</a> for more on that.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, you marked that edit as "minor" - since it makes a substantial difference to the article's content, this might not be a good idea. There's <a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMinor_edit_ba6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Minor edit">no very solid rule</a>, but generally, minor is used for fixes to things like grammar, spelling, or formatting, rather than content. Otherwise, people might overlook changes that they disagree with and have no chance to discuss them.</p>
<p>Other than that, I hope you enjoy your time as a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedian.html" title="Wikipedian">wikipedian</a> (but not <i>too</i> much...) - <a href="../../../i/m/s/User%7EIMSoP_6779.html" title="User:IMSoP">IMSoP</a> 21:09, 18 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arne, I hope you don't think I am disagreeing with you in what I wrote on the talk page for the race article. I get battered down every time that I suggest that people think a little about why race is conceptualized as it is. The attitude seems always to be that we can only dumbly report what the "experts" have to say. Since they all disagree that is never going to make for a coherent treatment. I like what is in the Encyclopedia entry you copied over. I just don't think that certain people will let us do it. (I am willing to try, however.) <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 06:46, 19 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Patrick, I appreciate your consistent work on improving the 'Race' article. In the long run it is the many people having the same attitude that will make Wikipedia being a credible encyclopaedia covering the common understanding even in disputed areas. But there will always be different views and even different dominating view in different regions (e.g. race seems to have a different meaning in the US of America than in Europe). If Wikipedia aims to be an authoritative encyclopaedia it therefore has to make some distinctions between dominating views and more marginal ones. Since the marginal often tends to be more active and enthusiastic (maybe particularly on the web?), the may be given too much space. --- <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnejohs_04de.html" title="User:Arnejohs">Arnejohs</a> 08:05, 22 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See, the paragraph you deleted was not someone's opinion, it was facts. It stated the date we started the hunt this year, the fact that many people are calling for boycots, how long the hunt is going to last, and how many seals we are going to kill. That's not a point of view, its simple, accurate facts. Deleting those facts because you don't like them is vandalism. You need to investigate the NPOV policy, it is quite clear about not deleting people's work simply because you don't like it. I don't have time to read your new additions yet, so I can't comment about that. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneric_Player_cc8d.html" title="User:Generic Player">Generic Player</a> 03:43, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The paragraph was:</dd>
<dd><i>On March 29, 2005 Canada officially began its annual seal hunt amid calls for boycott of Canadian seafood products by opposition groups. Authorities have set at maximum quota of 319,500 harp seals to be shot or clubbed to death for their fur over the next month. About 95 per cent of these will be less than three months old.</i></dd>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Canada did not start seal hunting in 2005, it started much earlier.</li>
<li>The maximum quota is not given annually, the number reflects what is left of the three year quota. 283,497 harp seals were harvested during the 2003 season and 365,971 seals were taken in 2004.</li>
<li>Seals are not only hunted for their fur, several other products come from the sealing.</li>
<li>I find no documentation of the assertion that 95% is less than three months old.</li>
</ol>
Based on this I still find your use of the term <i>vandalism</i> provocative. To me the paragraph clearly represents a POV. --- <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnejohs_04de.html" title="User:Arnejohs">Arnejohs</a> 07:10, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps this is partly a language issue. We did begin our annual hunt on march 29, 2005. Annual means it occurs every year, this is simply stating what date it started this year. And 319,500 is this years quota. If you wanted to make the article more informative, you would add the figures of the previous years, not simply delete everything. And there was a link provided regarding the fact that almost all the seals killed are less than 3 months old. The hunt is for young pups, older seals are able to escape, its the pups born this year that are hunted, this is not a POV at all. Please actually read the NPOV policy, its quite clear, you are not supposed to delete things you don't like, if you feel something is only portraying one side of a story, you are supposed to try to clarify that its only one side, and show the other side, not delete everything. Deleting things you don't like is vandalism, wether you want to admit it or not. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneric_Player_cc8d.html" title="User:Generic Player">Generic Player</a> 17:25, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know that the 2005 catch started on March 29 and that the text was telling that. But as an encyclopedia Wikipedia should not compete with the newspaper. Yes, I agree with you that time series of catches and quotas should be in the article. Preferable a table covering catches over several years by all sealing countries. I will look around for such information.</dd>
<dd>Meanwhile I think it is more confusing than informative adding one single number as if a disaster is happening: Hundreds of thousand seal being 'shot or clubbed to death'. The link you refer to was, as far as I can tell, to an activist group opposing sealing of political reasons. In my mind it is more relevant to discuss such issues in an environmentalist article than a straight forward article on the harp seal as such. I do not feel this is a <i>one side of a story</i>-issue, it more about telling the objective story (if possible).</dd>
<dd>Finally: Texts in Wikipedia are deleted all the time. This is an essential idea of the whole project, that texts are refined, corrected, modified, changed, - hopefully rather to the better than to the worse. The whole history is intact. From that perspective nothing is deleted, as it is always available. The discussion pages should be used when people do not agree and debates like this should rather be put on the discussion page of the article than here.<br />

<dd>Its interesting that you deleted facts because you didn't like the way they were worded, and instead posted a big long quote of the opinion from a very obviously pro seal hunting organization. That's not NPOV. Anyhow, I removed the big long quote, worked in what I could from the paragraph you wrote, and added a bunch of information about both harp seals first of all, and the hunting secondarily. You can delete this section of your talk page after you read it, we can use the harp seal talk page for any other discussion. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneric_Player_cc8d.html" title="User:Generic Player">Generic Player</a> 21:48, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../i/c/e/ICES_ebaa.html" title="ICES">ICES</a> could hardly be labelled as a <i>very obviously pro seal hunting organization</i>. The scientific base of seal management is the responsibility of ICES, covered out by the most prominent seal researchers in the world. I would guess even you accept that as a NPOV.</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless I appreciate your new strategy of adding information even though I still find it rather biased. Your Canadian focus makes you forget that the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_cod.html" title="Atlantic cod">Atlantic cod</a> is more than the weak North-West Atlantic cod stock. I intend to make a few corrections if you don't mind. But don't worry, I will not delete sections (like you just did). I will however ask you to be a little bit more reserved using the very touchy term <i>vandalism</i> when people edit articles.<br />

<dd>ICES is most certainly pro seal hunting. They do not consider ending seal hunting at all, for them it is entirely an issue of how many to kill, same with every other species. They consider wild animals to be a natural resource to be exploited, which is certainly an opinion, as many people feel otherwise. That quote would be like me putting in a page long quote from sea shepard, its not going to be very neutral.</dd>

<dd>What I wrote about cod is a pretty Canadian perspective obviously. Its not intentional, just that I am not a cod expert by any means and only really know about it from the Canadian perspective. Feel free to improve on it any way you can to reflect a more accurate global picture. I only deleted the quote because its really long for not much info, and the link to the ICES pdf covers their position pretty fully.</dd>

<dd>Generic Player, you are not serious when you compare ICES with Sea Shepard! The latter is even committing crimes (like sinking ships) in their campaigns. ICES is an intergovernmental organisation with 19 member states: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The <a href="http://www.ices.dk/aboutus/convention.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.ices.dk/aboutus/convention.asp" rel="nofollow">ICES Convention</a> of 1964 is far from confirming your allegation. The fact that ICES was founded in 1902, long time before resource based regulation was an issue at all, should be sufficient to state my point. Today ICES gives advice based on consequence analyses from the best available biological knowledge, not recommendations. --- <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnejohs_04de.html" title="User:Arnejohs">Arnejohs</a> 05:52, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course I am. They are two groups with opposing viewpoints. It doesn't matter who is involved in ICES, their viewpoint is that seals, like all animals, are simply a resource. That is clearly an opinion, and not a fact. Much like moral/ethical objections are an opinion. Putting in a big quote from either side isn't helpful or on topic, simply stating that certain people feel each way, and possibly linking to their views is plenty. Consider it this way, at one point the prevailing <b>opinion</b> in some places was that african americans were possessions. Just because it was a majority opinion, that doesn't mean it was correct, and people who were against slavery were incorrect. People committed crimes to free slaves too, but that doesn't mean they were wrong. Sea shepard's opinion is not any less valid because they do something you disagree with. And of course, reporters and observers of the seal hunt who have cameras are assaulted and threatened all the time, both of which are criminal actions. Its misleading to pretend one side is innocent, obviously there are people on both sides of the issue that break laws.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What it comes down to is this: there's just no need for such a quote, referencing their opinion as it is now is fine. Just like there is no need for a page long quote of how cruel the hunt is, simply mentioning the veterinarians report is enough, although I should probably see if I can find a copy of it online to link to. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneric_Player_cc8d.html" title="User:Generic Player">Generic Player</a> 17:59, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <a href="../../../n/y/k/Image%7ENyksund_Norway.jpg_5fce.html" title="Image:Nyksund Norway.jpg">Image:Nyksund Norway.jpg</a>. Wikipedia gets hundreds of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>

<p>Dear John Quiggin, In my opinion it is obviously wrong to categorise <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioeconomics.html" title="Bioeconomics">Bioeconomics</a> as <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterodox_economics.html" title="Heterodox economics">Heterodox economics</a>, as Bioeconomics builds directly on classical <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welfare_economics.html" title="Welfare economics">Welfare economics</a> and applies a classical capital theoretic approach. Therefore I urge you to remove the Heterodox economics tag. Thank you. --- <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnejohs_04de.html" title="User:Arnejohs">Arnejohs</a> 18:03, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article gives two definitions. The first is the one you describe, and the second referring to a paradigmatic shift towards a holistic synthesis of economics and biology. This latter definition seems to be assumed in a number of the links to <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioeconomics.html" title="Bioeconomics">bioeconomics</a>, and it's for that reason that I added the Heteredox economics tag. Maybe you could expand the article with some references to clarify all this. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 20:19, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:MaReMa trans logo.gif</b>. The image has been identified as not specifying the source and creator of the image, which is required by Wikipedia's policy on images.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:MaReMa trans logo.gif</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently specifies that the image is unlicensed for use on Wikipedia and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">You may add it back</a> if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">our fair use policy</a>).</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arnejohs_d028.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arnejohs">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images not used in any <b>articles</b> will be deleted after seven days, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.
