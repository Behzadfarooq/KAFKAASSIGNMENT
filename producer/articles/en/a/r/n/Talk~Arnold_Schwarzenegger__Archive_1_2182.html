<p>Imho, it's correct to say he has an "Austrian" accent. Kind of similar to saying someone has a "British" vs. an "American" or even a "Southern" accent. It's not strictly by name of language, it's by nationality or region. Well, the comparison isn't quite right, since he is speaking a foreign language, but hey. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldlover_1934.html" title="User:Arnoldlover">Arnoldlover</a> 02:11, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>An act to amend Section 7052 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to human remains</p>
<p><br />
I believe firmly that this has no place in the article and have therefore decided to remove it.</p>
<p>"On September 10, 2004, Schwarzenegger signed a bill into law that made the sexual abuse of a corpse a felony punishable by up to eight years in prison. This was in response to recent incidents of people found engaging in sexual acts with deceased persons, and that law enforcement was unable to charge them for that abuse because no law had been on California's books at the time. Prior to the bill being signed by Schwarzenegger, the most prosecutors could charge them with was breaking and entering. The signing of this law did however make Schwarzenegger the butt of several jokes by late night talk show hosts such as Jay Leno."</p>
<p>The article implies that Schwarzenegger must have contributed to the bill in some other way besides that of signing it. The bill was actually proposed as an amendment to a previous bill by California Assemblywoman Sharon Runner of the 36th district.<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/03-04//bill/asm/ab_1451-1500/ab_1493_bill_20030221_introduced.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/03-04//bill/asm/ab_1451-1500/ab_1493_bill_20030221_introduced.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I find no reason to include it and further consider it to be slander and partially biased. Therefore, I have erased it from the article as it has no merit or purpose.</p>

<p>Schwarzenegger was awarded a "Doctor of Humanities" from Cleveland Chiropractic College in 1999. The honorary diploma was presented by Dr. Carl S. Cleveland III, president of Cleveland Chiropractic College, Kansas City and Los Angeles. The diploma recognizes Arnold's many humanitarian efforts and his support of fitness and health-related endeavors, such as the Inner City Kids program and the Special Olympics. -- Dr. Gohan</p>
<p>"I am very honored to get this honorary chiropractic degree, this is totally unexpected," Arnold commented. "I'm proud of this. It will get a special place in my office and I will be hanging it up so everyone can see." -- Arnold Schwarzenegger</p>

<p>Saying his father was a "Gendarmerie-Kommandant" it's not really correctly translated to call him a "policeman", but rather the boss of a police-station. I know, that's quite a minor point, but nevertheless my first contribution.</p>

<p>The article had a number of epithets which really cannot be squared with the NeutralPointOfView. It is wholly within our purview, however, to have a section about reviewers' evaluation of his acting ability; it is also perfectly fair play to mention how various films were reviewed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you're referring to where the article refers to his "wooden acting style," I don't think that's a POV issue. Not that I'm trying to set up a slippery-slope arguement, but that is a fairly inoccuous piece of description... we shouldn't have to rely on third parties for every descriptive term we use. Would we call it a POV issue if somebody referred to the redwood as "these majestic trees?" A POV issue for Arnold would be if somebody characterized him as a dangerous radical, or a crusading right-winger, or something like that... loaded terms. It's a fine line, but let's err on the side of interesting prose rather than strict political correctness. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIroll_0870.html" title="User:Iroll">Iroll</a> 21:31, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps <i>unsigned</i> is referring to my changes "Nectarflowed (→Summer 2005 - De-POV summer 2005 section. Arnoldlover, this is an encylopedia, not a political soapbox.)".

<p>I can't believe that anyone quotes the New republic and anything that it prints. The only people who don't likee Arnold are those who would love to see socialism here in the USA. The difference is that in Europe, the socialists have found ways to eliminate grass roots movements, such as abolishing referendums. Socialists are fascists in sheeps clothes. Go to europe and try voicing your opinion. They have it so great. Yeah right...--<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomtom_db7c.html" title="User:Tomtom">Tomtom</a> 21:26, 1 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I live in Europe and i can attest to this. It is true. Socialists now have full control. Anyone who disagrees is immidiately pushed aside of politics and ideas with all kinds of epiteths, this when any non-socialist candidate isn't right down shot in the head, harassed by the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">EU</a> till resigning, or like Teo Van Gogh outright stabbed to death and decapitated by immigrants. Discussion is not possible, the secret polices of many European countries now set up honeytraps for non-socialists and monitor them. The EU parlament has been trying to pass so "anti-Hate" laws which are nothing but censorship. In Belgium the most voted party was already banned, i live was born and live here and to be fully honest democracy is merely a mirage. To make it all worse the government funded TV's are seriously socialist and unionnised, they fully control public discussion. 85.138.0.158 23:46, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I partially argee with Tomtom on the socialist issue. The trouble is that much of our problems in politics of the free western world are due to the fact that complete Fundamental Socialism and complete Fundamental Capitalism both support the same dangers of totalitarianism. The only difference is who would enforce it, Corporations or Government. The utopia we should strive for is a compromise which above all fights all blatent lies and conspiracy from influencing the public or defining justice. This fight against Arnold should be recorded with complete quotes from both arguments and references to more sources that explain the ones which are true or false, and why they are such. Please, place it under "propaganda and controvercial arguments" but above all, please do not withold it from the system. I came looking for information here of what people were talking about when they said arnold stole 2 million from education. I'm sure that it's all lies but the problem is that here at Saddleback College in California, the college students who run the political clubs are quite convinced, even when they too do not know anything more about it then the accusation itself. I'm forced to dig into these fools much too personally for being too lazy and irresponcible to read the propositions themselves before they make rallies against the governor. I need all the information that I can pull in order to convince them of their own mistakes. I came to wikipedia before to read prop 74 for myself and it was great. I found the official arguments which quoted the democratic students verbatum, still without good reasoning. Then I found the proposition from there myself and I was suprised to find that it's only a page long with only two paragraphs worth of changes, all making perfect sence in themselves. Nothing required an expert to understand and it was proven to me by reading it that the democratic party was clearly blatently lying. One more point, I din't have time to look at any others and it turs out that I was against the proposition despite it's good intentions. I merely believe that there are more important issues in education to deal with before we attack bad teachers. Still, in my opinion, the blatency of the lies spread on Arnold, which completely ignored constuctive criticism against the propositions themselves, should be punishable. Please do not forget their lies and propoganda so that it may be recorded by those who will bring an end to such political offences in the future. 01:29, 10 November 2005 (UTC)youngidealist</p>

<p>Recently the Sydney Morning Herald unearthed a quote from Mr Swarzenegger from 1975, in which he stated he admires Hitler, on the grounds that he was a little man who rose from nothing to be somebody.

<li>"I was always dreaming about very powerful people - dictators and things like that.

<p>In the section where Schwarzenegger (hmm, I guess I should now say Governor Schwarzenegger 8^) explains why he joined the Republican Party, <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam Carr</a> parenthetically added:</p>
<dl>
<dd>(In fact, at the time Schwarzenegger came to the United States, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> was governed by conservatives, and had been since 1945. Austria did not have a socialist <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor_of_Austria_2f62.html" title="Chancellor of Austria">Chancellor</a> until 1970.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now I know very little about Austrian modern history, so I await the opinions of others, but this is very much at odds with the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Austria_a5d9.html" title="Politics of Austria">Politics of Austria</a> article. In that article, it states the Austrian government was a coalition between conservatives, socialists and communists from 1945 till 1947, and a coalition between the conservatives and socialists from 1947 until 1966, when the socialists held power in their own right, then variously socialists alone or conservative/socialist coalitions until 1983. (Schwarzenegger left Austria in 1968.) Furthermore, until 1955 a substantial part of the country - including Schwarzenegger's home - was occupied by the Soviets. Now Adam did refer to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor_of_Austria_2f62.html" title="Chancellor of Austria">Chancellor of Austria</a> as well as the government, and that part seems to be true - but rather misleading as it seems that under the socialist/conservative coalition, they always had a conservative Chancellor but a socialist <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Austria_64a2.html" title="President of Austria">President</a>. To cut a long story short, it seems that this remark is quite wrong. <b>But</b> I know very little about Austrian politics, so I'll leave it for comment for a while. -- Roger 10:11 9 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Roger is correct that the Austrian Socialist Party was a junior partner in Austrian governments from 1947 to 1966. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1966 the conservative <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_People%27s_Party_16e7.html" title="Austrian People's Party">People's Party</a> won a majority in their own right, before being defeated by the Socialists in 1970. So Austria did <i>not</i> have a socialist government, in any sense, in 1968 when Schwarzenegger left for the US.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What I was objecting to was "governed by conservatives ... since 1945".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The presence of SPO ministers in the government did not make Austria a "socialist country." The 1947-66 governments pursued policies which in European terms would be considered centrist - I suppose to an American Republican they might seem "socialist."</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, but a socialist/conservative (and sometimes communist) coalition over part of the country, and Soviet interference in the rest, is hardly "governed by conservatives ... since 1945", either. And the Austrian doctrine of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proporz.html" title="Proporz">Proporz</a> means that the SPO always controlled at least a few ministerial positions, in particular the Minister for Labour and Social Affairs. (On a peripheral issue, the Schwarzenegger quote doesn't actually say "socialist country".)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The Presidency of Austria is a ceremonial post so the party background of its occupant is not really relevant.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The admittedly terse reference I read on the matter suggests that although he customarily does not use them, the Austrian President actually has immense powers, including the powers to dissolve the Nationalrat, sack the Chancellor, indefinitely delay Acts, pardon criminals, and, in a state of emergency, to rule by decree for up to four weeks. (See also <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Klestil_0426.html" title="Thomas Klestil">Thomas Klestil</a>.) In practice it seems that the only such power that has actually been used is dissolving the Nationalrat, which has been done twice, both times with the Chancellor's approval. In contrast, although the Chancellor's role is very similar to that of a Prime Minister, he actually has very few constitutional powers. For example, he cannot even sack one of his own cabinet ministers! As a practical matter, the SPO/OVP split of President and Chancellor probably guaranteed the continuation of the custom of Proporz, which meant the socialist party controlled industrial relations.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>If Schwarzenegger's home was in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graz.html" title="Graz">Graz</a> area then he was in the British Zone of Occupation, not the Soviet Zone. In any case the occupation ended when he was seven.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, my map was rather small scale, so <i>mea culpa</i>. My point was that having a large chunk of your country occupied by the Soviets is not really compatible with "governed by conservatives".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Anyway, feel free to remove the paragraph if you feel it is misleading - it is a very minor point. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 11:46, 9 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<li>I wouldn't exactly describe Austria as a socialist country, it is no more socialist than any country in western Europe, but that is all beside the point.

As Schwarzenegger was born in a countrified area in <a href="../../../s/t/y/Styria.html" title="Styria">Styria</a> and you would find a huge support for the ÖVP in such areas, it is no wonder he would support the conservatives in the US too.

<p>I put back the links to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> stories about allegations of sexual harassment, which were removed by another user. The LA Times is a leading newspaper, and the sexual harassment allegations were one of the most contentious issues in his campaign for governor. Many people have formed opinions about the Times' reporting on Schwarzenegger without having actually read it. I think including them is appropriate, and I don't know why they were deleted. If someone thinks they present a one-sided POV, the solution should be to offer a countering report, not to delete these.</p>
<p>The LA Times is only a leading newspaper in LA, no one else cares what they have to say. The hve become legends in their own minds. All have been debunked and since retracted. Check it out.

<p>The article states, "meanwhile, he earned a B.A. from the University of Wisconsin, Superior where he graduated with a major in international marketing of fitness and business administration in 1979." Is there really such a thing as a degree in international marketing of fitness and business administration? Or did he double major in "international marketing of fitness" and "business administration"? If that's the case, my question now becomes- is there really such a thing as a major in international marketing of fitness?</p>

<p>Arnold earned his BA degree from the University of Wisconsin-Superior in 1980 in International Marketing of Fitness and Business. He earned it from attending Santa Monica City College and UCLA extension with 72 credits, earning him an Associates degree then transfering to UW-Superior. University of Wisconsin-Superior is state university just like the University of Wisconsin-Madison; it is under the state university system. Accredited by The North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) and is one of six regional accreditation organizations recognized by the United States Department of Education.</p>

<p>I doubt the last added statement is NPOV. His comment WAS received well by many, and simply saying that it wasn't is not NPOV. I thought it was funny and many political correspondents shrugged it off as "so he has a sense of humor, so what?". -- <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlterego_1aa3.html" title="User:Alterego">Alterego</a></p>

<dd>I removed the previous sentence because that one seemed NPOV to me. It seemed to have this "he's doomed" tone to it, and how do we know what's going to happen? However, even though personally I think 81.63.57.97 10:57, 1 January 2006 (UTC)the controversy is way overblown -- which should hopefully override your doubts about my own personal POV -- you can't possibly be denying that it didn't cause a major uproar if you've been following the coverage.</dd>

<dd>I'd be fine with changing it to "some", but you can't discuss the remark without discussing who it actually offended. That's why it's newsworthy to begin with --the number of people who got ticked. Gay advocacy groups, as well as women's groups and Democratic higher-ups in California, have gotten very worked up over this one. It was a lead story on most opinion programs this week, and most of the coverage I've come across (including on <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3602003" class="external text" title="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3602003" rel="nofollow">NPR</a>, in <a href="http://www.wpxi.com/politics/3545477/detail.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wpxi.com/politics/3545477/detail.html" rel="nofollow">the AP</a>, and in the SF<a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/07/19/GUV.TMP" class="external text" title="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/07/19/GUV.TMP" rel="nofollow"><i>Chronicle</i></a>) used the word "many".

(Chicago). The last comment is definitely not NPOV and needs to be altered. I think the only people who really cared about it were a) the media b) the targets of the comment c) some advocacy groups. Using the SF Chronicle and AP as examples of NPOV is incorrect. The media is not NPOV; discussions of outright political bias aside, it is very difficult to have an NPOV news source.

<li>I'd like to second that the statement is simply not offensive. Schwarzenegger always uses the term humorously, mocking society's negative connotation of "girly men."

<li>When dealing with the "girlie men" statement, from a detractor's or a proponent's perspective, it's important to not take it out of context. He said it at a rally of supporters, assumedly in a humorous context with part of his intention being to rev up the crowd (as opposed to being intended as simply a slighting of legislators). Additionally, I think it should be considered that he used the term again in his speech at the republican national convention, saying voters shouldn't be "economic girlie men." I think most will find that to be a less questionable use of the term (it's a rhetoric device to encourage strong economic attitudes, and is not being directed at specific people), and that he used it a second time even when he knew the stakes surrounding use of the term were high (i.e. public reaction) could suggest that he does have specific goals when using the term (e.g. to rev up the crowd) as opposed to representing a simple insult or questionable views on woman or masculinity.--<a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENectarflowed_3ba7.html" title="User:Nectarflowed">Nectarflowed</a> 22:48, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>"There is another way you can tell you're a Republican," said Schwarzenegger at the 2004 Republican National Convention. "You have faith in free enterprise, faith in the resourcefulness of the American people, and faith in the U.S. economy. To those critics who are so pessimistic about our economy, I say: Don't be economic girlie men!"<a href="http://www.gop.com/news/read.aspx?ID=4593" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gop.com/news/read.aspx?ID=4593" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Schwarzenegger's comments were jarring because he had, in effect, made his entire recall campaign all about the (presumed) economic consequences of continuing with Democrat <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray_Davis_41cb.html" title="Gray Davis">Gray Davis</a>, whom he painted as a reckless overspender. Candidate Schwarzenegger campaigned, he claimed, because of the burden of state debt and its corrosive effects on all levels of society.</p>
<p>As someone also concerned about this debt, on <i>both</i> a state and federal level, what was I to make of Schwarzenegger's "girlie men" comment at the Convention? Are only "girlie men" concerned about the consequences of debt and government overspending? Why — having run the campaign against Davis the way he did — was Schwarzenegger now <i>mocking</i> people who take such fiscal matters seriously? He may have given his Republican audience a laugh, but face it: our country is an a huge mess thanks to its massive and unsustainable overspending. And instead of talking about solutions, we had Schwarzenegger, good Republican that he is, kicking sand in the faces of the sissies!</p>
<p>For what it's worth, that was my take the moment I heard the "girlie men" comment last year. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandover_7608.html" title="User:Sandover">Sandover</a> 07:48, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By saying "alleged" it implies Arnold had ulterior motive to come to USA other than what he has expressed. That makes it too POV. What is it you are trying to say, that Arnold gave a false reason, or that Austria was not Socialist at the time? Or both? And how do you define Socialistic Governments? I've read Arnold's spokespersons rebuttle about this and it makes sense - his view was that the policies and practices in Austria leaned towards Socialistic style and that is true -regardless of whether or not Austria was then controlled by a poltical party which called itself "Socialist" or not. You are splitting hairs, looking for a way to call Arnold a liar.

<dd>Hold up. "You" isn't me. I didn't write the text; I'm just wondering why it was removed. Also, it is accurately described as an "alleged" reason, since he alleged it. I don't want unnecessary doubt cast on his allegations, but I do want them reported accurately. Still, we don't have to use the word "alleged" if you don't like it.

<dd>Schwarzenegger has said in other places (places outside of the political sphere) that he was always fascinated with America, even when young. He's said that when he was young and dreaming, he felt Austria was too small for him, and also that the soviet military presence was terrifying to him. He's mentioned a number of times his highly positive reaction to american republican politics when he emigrated (specifically fiscal conservatism, "get[ting] government off our backs," and a strong military (citing the soviet military presence in Austria).</dd>
<dd>I agree with Rex071404 that he probably mean't "policies and practices in Austria leaned towards Socialistic style" <b>compared with the comparatively highly capitalistic republican culture he found in America</b>, and it seems like the critics mentioned in the proposed excerpt offered above by Quadell may be finding false inconsistencies by taking his statement unnecessarily literally.

<p>Austria is a socialist country as written in their constitution. It was a socialist country ever since the abolition of the monarchy in 1918. Even as part of the Third Reich it was socialist as the Germany was socialist. Nothing changed except for certain governmental policies. The Nazis were socialist of a different color.

<dd>There must be a lot of prejudice in the USA about European governments. It seems everything that doesn't fit their redneck view of the world and how great a relentless turbo-capitalism is which produces abject poverty, is called socialism. Europeans would in general probably view their rather socialdemocratic governments (centre-left or centre-right) with much more sympathy. But admittedly, that crazy neoliberalism has taken a strong foothold in Europe, driven by American financial interests and corrupt Euro-crats in Brussels. The more open-minded Americans are invited to visit our "brave new world" in Europe.</dd>

As for your preocupations with poverty, perhaps you should hand out your own salary to the "poor", or like all socialist do you as well prefer to be an hypocrite attempting to do "charity" with other people's tax money? 85.138.0.158 23:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Heading - Schwarzenegger Bribery Scandal of July 2005</p>
<p><i>On July 15 it was reported by the L.A. Times that Schwarzenegger's veto of a bill that would have regulated advertising of body-building supplements was a conflict of interest with his US$8 million of outside income from such advertising.</i></p>
<p>Some commentators, such as a guest on Los Angeles area station KCRW, have gone so far as to call it the biggest bribe for any U.S. governor ever.</p>

<p>About the 6'2 / 5'10 thing, could he really have gotten away with being 5'10 in his bodybuiding career? Unless all bodybuilders lie it seems unlikely he could fake his height - 1) they all walk around and pose in bare feet, 2) surely his height would have been measured before competition as part of his statistics, 3) In Pumping Iron (1977) he poses next to Lou Ferrigno who is said to be 6'5, and he does not appear particularly shorter to me. In the article when it says his "spokespeople" now give his height as 6' who are these spokespeople? I just worry the height factor is slightly spurious and possibly a factor of malicious journalism, (e.g. the constant rumour mill over Tom Cruise being ridiculously short).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't believe this claim. A quick search through Google Images using "Bush Schwarzenegger" finds tons of photos of the two of them together. In each one of them on the screen, Schwarzenegger is considerably taller than Bush. I can easily believe that the height difference is three inches. Nor can I verify the claim that this speculation occurred in a July 2002 issue of US Weekly. The only hits I get for that claim are of mirrors to this page. This seems flimsy grounds to have included the paragraph about Schwarzenegger's height. Can anyone give me a more substantial reference and/or evidence for the claims made in this paragraph? If not, I will delete it. --<a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESusurrus_68b2.html" title="User:Susurrus">Susurrus</a> 06:46, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe he was never 6'2" but about 6'1" and down to about 6'0" now. I don't really get the whole "controversy" though, especially thinking he's about 5'10" or whatever. He's obviously got a huge body (and head) which could make him appear shorter, but the thing is there's nothing special or amazing about being 6'0" or over. It's pretty much the norm in Europe. Heck, I'm half asian and still 6'1". While many actors do fudge an inch or two, and Arnold may have fudged 1", it's rare that they'll fudge more than 2". Otherwise they'll be "exposed" too easily.</dd>

<p>Heights are routinely altered in movies, and the heights of bodybuilders never used to be measured. If Stallone really is 5'7" and has always worn lifts, Schwarzenegger would probably have been 6' at his peak.</p>

<dd>People get shorter with age so Arnold could have been 6'2" and have shorten since then with age. In the sport of body building, all measurements are recorded. Fitness people are strict with numbers; ie, weight, fat percentages, muscle size, calories, and also height to weight ratio.</dd>

<dd>I think if nicknames are relevant, then put in his nicknames, both flattering and critical. The 1000-Google-hit rule is unduly arbitrary. The standard should be whether it's an actual nickname rather than a one-off dig. Basically, the standard should be whether it's a fact or not. I hear the <i>Boobengrabber</i> nickname, for example, on talk radio <i>a lot</i> (which, of course, would not show in Google results). It does exist. It's in current use. And it's directly relevant in the context of the article (lingering harassment-claim perceptions). (Your Google results would change, by the way, if you searched only on the nickname and also included alternate spellings.) <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquib_71a8.html" title="User:Squib">Squib</a> 21:07, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The prior search may have been skewed by including his long, hard-to-spell surname. The point of a nickname is that it is used instead of a real name. I get 4,090 hits on Gröpenführer alone, and it is the standard nickname applied to him in a national syndicated cartoon, Doonesbury. "Austrian Oak" is presented not as a common nickname but as an old nickname from pre-internet days, so I wouldn't expect many hits. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 21:16, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What most people tend to forget is that MILLIONS of Germans where members of the Nazi party during the period of the Third Reich. If you wanted to make a career in Nazi Germany, you HAD to be a member of the party in power, just as you had to be a Communist Party member to make a career in the USSR. I am not totally sure about this, but I think that many people joined the Nazi party not so much in a belief in Nazism, but as a move to help them in their careers and ambitions. My point: Where all Nazi party members really nazis, <b>i.e</b>: Did they really <i>believe</i> in nazism?</p>

<dd>I think Arnold's father was as 'Nazi', not just a member of the party (if you can even make that distinction), and I do think being a Nazi is a 'crime' - whether or not Germany won or lost the war. I also believe that his father being a Nazi is relevant to Arnold's bigoraphy. I <i>do not</i> believe, however, that this should be considered a mark against Arnold. You cannot hold someone responsible for something their father did 3 years before they were born. Arnold should be praised or critisised for what he believes and for what he does, not for what his father believed or did. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew238_be83.html" title="User:Matthew238">Matthew238</a> 04:32, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Considering that Arnold did not have a very good relationship with his father, which was highlighted in a recent re-editing of <i>Pumping Iron</i> where it was said that his reason for not attending his funeral as commitments to body building was in fact just an excuse. In reality he didn't like his father. The only reason <i>sins-of-the-father</i> proliferates is in the belief that a father actually indoctrinates their child and thus the child <i>may</i> follow in their footsteps. I doubt whether this is the case here as a result of Arnold leaving Austria at such a young age and thus having very little contact with his father to allow this to happen. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 00:07, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While it's true that Arnold cannot become president, it isn't because he's "foreign born", per se. It's because he isn't a "natural born citizen". There are foreign born people who receive their US ciitizenship on the basis of having a parent who is a US citizen. Those foreign born people are natural born citizens because they've held their US citizenship since the moment of birth, and they would be able to become president. So, it's more correct to state that the reason Arnold cannot be president is because he isn't natural born, or that he's naturalized, in the US.</p>
<p>It's often mistakenly believed that the Constitution requires a presidential candidate to be native born, but the Constitution doesn't say this. It says: "No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President"</p>
<p>There have already been three presidential candidates who were not born in the US, and no legal challenge was made against their candidacies:</p>
<p>Barry Goldwater (born in the Arizona Territory prior to it being made a state) George Romney (born in Mexico to US citizen parents) John McCain (born in the Panama Canal Zone to US citizen parents)</p>
<p>All three of these men were eligible for the presidency because they held US citizenship from the moment of their births, despite not being born in the US. While some people might argue that Arizona Territory and the Panama Canal Zone counted as US territory, Mexico does not, yet Romney was eligible for the presidency because he held US citizenship from birth.</p>

<dd>I have a question - Does it count if we annex the country in question? e.g. if Austria became the 51st state, would Arnold then be eligible? (Unlikely, just exploring the theory) And also, "or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution" seems to imply, to me, that since the USA didn't exist when George Washington was born, not including this clause would disqualify him, and everyone for 35 years, from being president. That comma is nasty, though. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 21:21, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're correct that the reason for the "or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution" clause was to allow for the fact that orignally there would have been no "natural born" citizens, since anyone born in the original colonies would have been born as British Subjects. Personally I doubt that if a county or territory were annexed that the people born there prior to the annexation would be eligible for the presidency, because they would only be US citizens from when the annexation took place and would not be natural born citizens.</dd>

<p>More importantly, what should probably be debated is whether or not the "natural born" requirement still needs to exist. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteggall_0275.html" title="User:Steggall">Steggall</a> 04:00, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As for whether someone from an annexed country would count as a natural born citizen, what about Hawaii and Alaska when they became states - what happened there.

<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign posted a form on its Web site asking Californians for stories about inferior teachers to support the ballot initiative to lengthen teachers' probationary period.</p>
<p>The form was then removed Wednesday after an Associated Press reporter called to inquire about it.</p>
<p>Posted on the Web site <a href="http://www.joinarnold.com" class="external free" title="http://www.joinarnold.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.joinarnold.com</a> the form asked: "Have a story about a teacher who just might not be cut out for the job, yet nothing can be done because of tenure? Please tell us. We'd like to share the stories of Californians like you!"</p>
<p>It was part of Schwarzenegger's campaign in favor of Proposition 74, which would boost the probationary period for new teachers to five years from two years. The governor argues that it's nearly impossible for districts to get rid of poor teachers who have been in the classroom for years.</p>
<p>Todd Harris, a spokesman for California's Recovery Team, said the campaign "ever even accessed the form. ... There are so many egregious examples of this we never even needed to."</p>
<p>Alliance for a Better California, which is campaigning against Proposition 74 and other measures, had planned a counterattack Thursday in Los Angeles. The group will still demonstrate and launch a Web site praising exceptional teachers, spokeswoman Robin Swanson said.</p>
<p>"Why do teachers have to point out to him that it's a bad idea to attack them? Why are he and his campaign staff playing these sorts of political games?" she said.</p>
<p>"The governor should have more respect for teachers in his state," Swanson said.</p>
<p>Harris said individual examples of problem teachers are a good way to demonstrate the need for a change.</p>
<p>"The overwhelming majority of California's public school teachers are highly skilled and dedicated public servants. But everybody knows that there are a few poor performing teachers who simply don't belong in the classroom," Harris said.</p>

<dd>If Cecropia claims that "some in Austria" claim "moral virginity" then s/he should restrict her/his last statement to such Austrians, not "Europeans".

<dd>On behalf of that stadium's name: have some patience. That it should become something in remembrance of above named convict is highly unlikely (meant rather as a joke!?). Newspapers say it might become the name of a regional sponsor (which seams likely to me) due to lack of creativity, virtue or suitable options or just plain prospect of beneficial financial support. Nevertheless Arnold IS a big issue in Austria at the moment in public where it comes to the question of how to refert to an Austrian offspring and celebrity who is now a politician with a rather Californian Republican attitude than Austrian, especially when this does not comply with general European standards of human rights (see: death penalty). Maybe I go hike there and take a look tomorrow.Mogwai22 00:40, 27 December 2005 (CET)</dd>

<p>I changed the wording of the part where it said he approved the execution of Tookie. This is not true, he did not approve the execution, he just refused to personally grant clemency, which he left up to the courts.

<dd>I don't think it does. He hasn't raised taxes and is generally pro business. You also have to consider the general representation of California. Most of the legislature is made up of Democrats. It would be harder for any fiscal conservative to successfully cut the size of government in a state like California and still get reelected. Take a look at his speech at the GOP presidential convention in 2004. In the speech he's quoted as saying "If you believe that your family knows how to spend your money better than the government does, then you are a Republican." Thorburn 00:39, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

From 1997 I believe that Arnold change focus from motion pictures to running for political power and thus it wasn't a decline in his acting career but instead a personal choice. To say films like Terminator 3, Collateral Damage, 6th Day and the like were a "decline" is a very personal view.
