<p>In one episode, Arnold Vinick mentioned growing up in a "<a href="../../../c/i/t/Citrus.html" title="Citrus">citrus</a>-growing" community.

In the meantime, the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_council.html" title="City council">city council</a> decided to organize a campaign for Arnold Vinick, including the opening of an Arnold Vinick presidential campaign headquarters.

Presidential debate between Santos and Vinick.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Throughout the campaign, Vinick and Santos treat each other with mutual respect. (In the episode "King Corn," it is revealed that, two years before the election, Vinick and Santos co-sponsored an immigration reform bill that was defeated in committee on Capitol Hill.)</p>
<p>At the outset of the first and only Santos-Vinick debate, Vinick proposed to have "a real debate," without time limits on speaking; i.e. to ignore the rules to which their campaigns had agreed. Santos readily agreed. During the debate, Vinick tried to paint Santos as a typical <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal.html" title="Liberal">liberal</a> Democrat who would raise taxes to pay for intrusive big-government programs while still leaving the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_budget.html" title="Federal budget">federal budget</a> unbalanced. The senator laid out a moderate agenda and reiterated his support for tax cuts, proposed tax-deductibility for <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health_insurance.html" title="Health insurance">health insurance</a> costs, explained why he had voted for the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_American_Free_Trade_Agreement_e370.html" title="Central American Free Trade Agreement">Central American Free Trade Agreement</a>, opposed a moratorium on the federal <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_penalty.html" title="Death penalty">death penalty</a>, promised to open part of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_National_Wildlife_Refuge_9de5.html" title="Arctic National Wildlife Refuge">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> to <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_exploration.html" title="Oil exploration">oil exploration</a>, and declared his strong support for <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_power.html" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>. He was heckled by a member of the audience for claiming that <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_Start_b694.html" title="Head Start">Head Start</a> didn't work, but perhaps his most surprising comment and show of blunt honesty was his remark that he would not create any new jobs, saying that in a free society <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrepreneur.html" title="Entrepreneur">entrepreneurs</a>, not the government, created jobs.</p>

President Bartlet and Senator Vinick at the San Andreo nuclear power plant.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the middle of the campaign, as Vinick enjoyed a huge lead over Santos, a <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_reactor.html" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactor</a> in Southern California comes close to <a href="../../../m/e/l/Meltdown.html" title="Meltdown">meltdown</a>, creating a panic for millions living in the vicinity. In the episode "Duck and Cover" it is revealed that Vinick, as a Senator from California, pushed for the plant's opening and speedy approval by regulators. The reactor did not melt down, although when the story broke that Vinick was a major supporter of the plant, his poll numbers dropped dramatically, putting numerous states, including <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> (which, despite leaning Democratic in presidential elections in both reality and the show, was thought to be safe for Vinick, given that was his home state), into play and causing the election to become too close to call.</p>
<p>After a staff shakeup prompted by the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_National_Committee_6379.html" title="Republican National Committee">Republican National Committee</a>, Vinick decided to go to <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> on the heels of the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Santos_1b3c.html" title="Matt Santos">Santos</a> campaign, and hold a press conference outside of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Andreo_1642.html" title="San Andreo">San Andreo</a> plant in order to defuse the political fallout from the incident. His strategy seems to have been effective, as he returned to his straight-talking style, exhausting reporters of their questions and commandeering live news coverage from his opponent's campaign.</p>
<p>Despite this strategy's success (the Senator won his home state of California), Senator Vinick lost the presidential election to Rep. Santos by 272 electoral votes to 266. Senator Vinick conceded the election after Nevada, the decisive state, was carried by Santos by about 30,000 votes. Although Senator Vinick was urged by his staff to contest the election, he refused to do so.</p>

<p>After the election, Vinick appeared to be positioning himself to run again in <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010.html" title="2010">2010</a> against Santos (it was in fact mentioned a few times that Vinick did win the 2006 <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_vote.html" title="Popular vote">popular vote</a>), but his advisors tried to convince him that there were better Republicans who could run and that his age would be a hindrance. It is stated that Vinick would be seventy by the <a href="../../../2/0/1/2010.html" title="2010">2010</a> election. Impressed by his foreign policy acuity, President-elect Santos asked Vinick to join his administration as <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Secretary_of_State_9ece.html" title="United States Secretary of State">Secretary of State</a>. Vinick initially turned him down, but then accepted when Santos assured him that he could perform the job on his own terms, without partisan politics.</p>

<p>A <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> article published on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_10.html" title="April 10">April 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> reported that, if not for the death of actor John Spencer, Vinick would have won the election. According to the article, the writers felt it would be too much for Santos to lose his running mate and the election in one day, so the plot was changed to have Vinick lose, but narrowly.</p>
