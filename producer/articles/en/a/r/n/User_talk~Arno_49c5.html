<p>Hi there. Great stuff on the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romana.html" title="Romana">Romana</a> article.

<dd>What Tarquin said. Glad you accepted my NPOVing (I like Adams and think his Who stuff is good [it's Nation's bits of Destiny that are the problem if you ask me, but this probably isn't the place to debate such things]); I'd never heard the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Tamm_abd3.html" title="Mary Tamm">Mary Tamm</a> pregnancy rumour, by the way - do you know enough to write a bio page for her?

<p>Thanks for the pick-up on the year for <i>Ethos</i>. I checked several sources that all said 1962! Go figure!?! <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Ellis_602e.html" title="User:Peter Ellis">Peter Ellis</a> 03:49, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe it was erected in 1962. I must say that the statue itself is rather unimposing.

<p>The Northern Territory had one non-voting member of the <b>House of Representatives</b> from 1922 to 1968. The member acquired voting rights in 1968.

<p>I am sending this message to a group of seasoned users whose opinions I respect. My aim is not to draw you into a dispute, but to canvass opinion on a contentious area of policy. If you have a few minutes to spare, please see the debate currently under way at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EProtection_policy_9b85.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Protection policy">Wikipedia talk:Protection policy</a>, with particular reference to user page protection. For some reason, I seem to have fallen foul of a group of sysops who have made it their business to stamp out the practice of protecting one’s own user page. A sensible (in my opinion) proposal has been made to amend the policy, and I would be grateful if you would add your view, assuming you have one.

<p>Hi, I've <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html#Free_the_Rambot_Articles_project" title="User:Rambot">started a drive</a> to get users to <a href="../../../m/u/l/Wikipedia%7EMulti-licensing_5622.html" title="Wikipedia:Multi-licensing">multi-license</a> all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_95b5.html" title="Creative Commons">Creative Commons</a> Attribution-Share Alike (<i>CC-by-sa</i>) v1.0 and v2.0 <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_Commons_License_4fc5.html" title="Creative Commons License">Licenses</a> or into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> if they prefer.

<p>To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the "<b>{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}</b>" template into their user page, but there are other options at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_namespace_f54f.html#Licensing_Templates" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User namespace">Template messages/User namespace</a>.

<p>Sorry, Ran-Man, this went largely over my head. How, for instance, are you going to determine what in this website are my contributions, and what if someone overrides them?

<dd>Hello Arno! I actually did not think that message was from you. When I saw it, I searched for User:Arno and came across your page, but did not get the impression that the message came from you after reading about you. Sorry for SWD316's message...he is a buddy of mine that has been looking after my page since I quit editing on Wikipedia. It is kinda cool that he is taking up for me in my absence though. Sorry for any issues from this and I hope that everything is OK between us! I am not suprised that the culprit did not post a user ID but I am not worried about it. I figure they have come back by now and read my response. Anyway, thanks for being understanding and sorry somebody put you in something you had nothing to do with! <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhatcat68_1af3.html" title="User:Phatcat68">phatcat68</a> 18:17, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Arno ... actually i have liked the logic by which u have talked in the talk page of Muhammad's cartoon , it is nice to see ppl talk with this fully logical wise speech , actually i have suggested in <a href="../../../b/a/b/User_talk%7EBabajobu_72fe.html" title="User talk:Babajobu">User talk:Babajobu</a> to propose a policy for displaying the offensive pics in all pages in wikipedia like Piss Christ and Anti-semitism ... etc .. i think u will like this idea , can u support me please --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfinishedchaos_15c9.html" title="User:Unfinishedchaos">Chaos</a> 16:44, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah I second the motion. I included a bunch of links to articles whose pictures should be viewed &amp; "censored" depending on if they're offensive. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitism.html" title="Anti-semitism">Anti-semitism</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazis.html" title="Nazis">Nazis</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">War</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">Penis</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">Vagina</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breasts.html" title="Breasts">Breasts</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_anatomy.html" title="Human anatomy">Human anatomy</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Carlin_f409.html" title="George Carlin">George Carlin</a> (well, just all the swear words), etcetera.</dd>
<dd>Basically, what I'm looking to do is to make sure wikipedia offends no one, and to that end we can surely start with religious &amp; racial offensive pictures (the anti-semitism article shows 17-19 offensive images of jews)! Further, I'm sure everyone wants this toned down enough to be pg-13 (no swearing) and have no pictures of the unclothed human body (those who believe in clothes might click those NPOV articles like "Human anatomy."</dd>

<dd>Thanks, guys, but can you tell me who you all are? Also, and this may come as a surprise to some wikipedians, I'm hesitant abut how far a picture ban should go. But I do oppose the provoctive action taken in putting up that cartoon (as a good many do know!). <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArno_4ba5.html" title="User:Arno">Arno</a> 08:36, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><font color="gold">"I didn't block the user in question because I didn't find anything overtly offensive about the word "poof". There are lots of words that have negative slang connotations, but only a select few are known automatically as a curse word. This is not one of them. I still hold the stance that it uses the word "poof" in the sense that someone poofs up a pillow. I won't block that user, because I find nothing wrong with his edits or his username. <a href="../../../m/o/0/User%7EMo0_25cf.html" title="User:Mo0">Mo0</a>[<a href="../../../m/o/0/User_talk%7EMo0_eb76.html" title="User talk:Mo0">talk</a>] 02:50, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</font></p>

<p>G'Day!</p>
<p><i>This is a courtesy call.....</i></p>
<p>I've just completed a thorough edit of the Big Coathanger.</p>
<p>I have left all the written content, made some inclusions and only editted in the name of clarity and making appropriate connections.</p>
<p>What I have done is re-order the information under (sometimes different) headings, improve the layout, add the best photos I could find (incl. de Groot declaring the B. open) and shuffle those pics that were not either particularly informative or particularly beeyootiful down to a snapshot gallery (because we ALL like to have our work up, don't we? and it's a sign of the popularity of the item)..</p>
<p>I'd be interested in gettting your feedbackk, as you were a major contributor.</p>
