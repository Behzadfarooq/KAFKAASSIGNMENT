<p>I thought your diagram comparing the various antenna types had great intuitive appeal. There were a few discrepancies that I noticed, however. The antenna you have labeled as a Beverage is actually a rhombic; the distinction between the two is significant. The antenna labeled 'periodic' is properly termed 'log-periodic' and its feedline is connected to the shortest elements, not the longest ones as you are showing. That connection does not work. I took the liberty of slightly cropping your image and creating a thumbnail of it on the Yagi Antenna page so that it would fit on smaller screens. Since you have the original, may I suggest that you pick up these corrections and re-upload the image? Thanks! Jim, K7JEB</p>

<p>I keep looking at this diagram - but I don't understand it. I understand area rule. Maybe I'm just being dumb. I understand that there are 2 shock waves coming off - but everything else appears to be abstract - especially the <i>area rule</i> between the two dotted lines. Can you explain it better&#160;?</p>
<p>I think a better illustration would be to have a F-104 style plane compared with a non supersonic plane (P-51&#160;?) with a graph of the comparing the cross-sectional area at each point along the length of the airframe. So that the P-51 would have sharp jarring changes on the graph - where are the F-104 would be smooth.</p>

<p>In the beginning I was wondering why any plane has a sub-pressure shockwave. I took me a second look, to realize that no supersonic plane has such an extreme delta-wing-canard combination as to say the fuselage is in between the wings, not even the Eurofighter Typhoon.</p>
<p>And for &lt;Mach2 I don't like the razor sharp edges of the F-104 anymore but guess a sweep is more appropriate.</p>

<p>The picuture looks right to me. I thought the plane looks like this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-104_Starfighter" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-104_Starfighter" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-104_Starfighter</a> Anyhow I was mutivated by the fact that civil supersonic planes and old spy planes want to fly as high as possible: Sliding on the surface of the atmosphere. So I think a high altitude supersonic plane should look like a boat&#160;;-) So I tried to draw an innovative shape as the planes of the past are already known and pictured to great detail. But you may be right, that series of picures of area curves throughout history is needed: Subsonic plane, Bell x-1, DeltaDart ,transsonic planes (Chessna Citation X, Boing 747, B-1 in low level flight, Boeing Dreamliner ) , Nasa blunt nose plane, Japanese concorde successor. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnero_8897.html" title="User:Arnero">Arnero</a> 15:09, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the comment about Brewster's angle in the context of thin film polarizers is at best confusing, and probably outright wrong. The response is mostly due to the variation in the interference in the film with angle of incidence rather than Brewster's angle. When you make a thin film polarizer, you aren't constrained to keep the angle at or even near Brewster's angle. Unlike Brewster's angle, the polarization can change dramatically with wavelength. Perhaps there are thin-film polarizers that do use an internal Brewster's angle reflection, but this certainly need not always be the case.--<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrleffler_03c1.html" title="User:Srleffler">Srleffler</a> 14:15, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>&gt;variation in the interference in the film with angle of incidence<br />
This does not distinguish between directions of polarization, only wavevector directions</p>
<p>&gt;Perhaps there are thin-film polarizers that do use an internal Brewster's angle reflection, but this certainly need not always be the case<br />
So why are you so certain?</p>
<p>&gt;Unlike Brewster's angle, the polarization can change dramatically with wavelength<br />
Yes thats a difference, but I think the only one. One usually uses thin film polarizers for narrow bandwidth lasers and there the compactness is of greater importance. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnero_8897.html" title="User:Arnero">Arnero</a> 16:07, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to Macleod's book (see ref. below), a MacNeille prism works the way I think you have in mind, with a thin-film stack designed such that light passes through a series of thin-film interfaces at Brewster's angle. These polarizers have a very wide spectral range, but limited angular range for obvious reasons. Plate polarizers cannot be made based on this principle, because "the Brewster angle for normal thin-film materials...is found to be greater than 90° referred to air as the incident medium. In other words, it is beyond the critical angle for the materials. [In the MacNeille prism] this is solved by building the multilayer filter into a glass prism so that the light can be incident on the multilayer at an angle greater than critical."</p>
<p>Plate polarizers, on the other hand, depend on the fact that the width of the high-reflectance zone of a quarter-wave stack is different for s and p polarization. There thus exists a region at the edge of the reflection band where the reflection is high for s-polarized light and low for p-polarized light. Further layers are used to smooth out ripples in the transmission spectrum, etc. The spectral range for these polarizers is narrow, and shifts with angle of incidence like any other bandpass coating.</p>
<p>While cube polarizers <i>can</i> be made based on the Brewster principle, they are often made using the same principle as plate polarizers. The latter tend to have a broader spectral range than plate polarizers, because of the higher angle of incidence of the light at the coating layer interfaces.</p>

<p>So it has not to be exactly the brewster angle, but surly the design started with brewster angle and than made a compromise. And this design might also use Air-Glas Brewster's angle.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnero_8897.html" title="User:Arnero">Arnero</a> 17:23, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently, you wrote the following in the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_Field_Theory_f8e4.html" title="Quantum Field Theory">Quantum Field Theory</a> article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Only by accident electrons were not regarded as <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis%2C_7th_duc_de_Broglie_5056.html" title="Louis, 7th duc de Broglie">de Broglie</a> waves and photons governed by <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometrical_optics.html" title="Geometrical optics">geometrical optics</a> were not the dominant theory when <b>QFT</b> was developed.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't believe this is correct nor is placed in the correct place. If I understand the history correctly, fields were routinely described by planar wave propagators early on. This turns out to be essential to the theory. Second, there doesn't appear to be a rigorous definition of "de Broglie wave". As far as I can tell, it's just matter that exhibits wavelike behavior, which would naturally be described by the above system.</p>
<p>Geometrical optics is based on ideas like <a href="../../../h/u/y/Huygens%27_principle.html" title="Huygens' principle">Huygens' principle</a> (propagation of light as wavefronts not as rays) which also show up in QFT through planar wave propagation. So IMHO, the fundamental ideas were present from the begining. Further, the scientists involved in construction of these theories were aware of the above ideas. So it's not clear to me that your assertions are correct. A citation (so that this observation would be confirmed by external sources) would be a good idea IMHO.</p>
<p>Finally, this sentence appears in a discussion of quantizing classical fields. It's a historical remark which at best is tangential to the modern subject. Perhaps this indicates a need to create an article on the history of QFT, but I don't think the sentence is appropriate where it is, and perhaps isn't appropriate for the QFT article at all since little in the way of historical information is described therein. The little history there is appears to be used specifically to develope the concepts behind modern QFT. In particular, there are probably a number of failed approaches and routes not taken here. What makes this particular route worthy of note in explaining modern QFT? -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlHallowell_86e5.html" title="User:KarlHallowell">KarlHallowell</a> 08:04, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>So what does this sentence mean then?: There is no such thing as a wavefunction for a single photon in classical electromagnetisim, so a quantum field theory must be formulated right from the start.</p>

<dd>I had to look through the section to see the context. You can quantitize a particle by make it's classical position and momentum coordinates into quantum observables. Here, there are a finite number of operators (usually some multiple of 4 or the other dimensions that appear regularly in these theories). A photon is described by a continuous field with four vector components in classical theory. So literally there are an infinite number of variables that you'd have to convert to quantum observables. I don't buy the claim that this is an uncountable number of variables since the set X mentioned in the section usually has a dense countable subset (every point is arbitrarily close to some point in the subset) and the classical fields are continuous so we could restrict our attention to the countable subset.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even so that means at best a countably infinite number of position and momentum operators with complex relations between each other. Classical quantum mechanics is just too clumsy to compute this efficiently. Hence, the claim that QFT (implemented via the approach mentioned in the section) is "the way out". There probably are other ways to handle this, but QFT appears naturally in this problem. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlHallowell_86e5.html" title="User:KarlHallowell">KarlHallowell</a> 17:49, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your answer, but I got a bit lost. What I really wanted to ask (sorry for my unclear questions): Does the sentence "There is no such thing as a wavefunction for a single photon in classical electromagnetisim, so a quantum field theory must be formulated right from the start" infringe on <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wave-particle_duality.html" title="Wave-particle duality">Wave-particle_duality</a>, which states that even before diving into the math of <a href="../../../q/f/t/QFT_dc9e.html" title="QFT">QFT</a>, one has to treat a photon like a particle and a wave at the same time and should not favour any of them, like <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_equality.html" title="Sexual equality">sexual equality</a>. And isn't history such that great physicist always obeyed this law anticipating <a href="../../../q/f/t/QFT_dc9e.html" title="QFT">QFT</a> and only small minded people wanted to think black and white and ignored that duality. Of course there is no wavefunction for a single photon, but there could have been a <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion.html" title="Newton's laws of motion">Newton's laws of motion</a>. The sentence make it sound as if photons have to be treated differently from electrons ( <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html#Gender_Discriminatio" title="Discrimination">Discrimination#Gender_Discriminatio</a> ). But the real difference is the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boson.html" title="Boson">Bosonic</a> and the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fermion.html" title="Fermion">Fermionic</a> character. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnero_8897.html" title="User:Arnero">Arnero</a> 19:09, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My understanding is that an electron, classically (here, it is being treated as a pure particle not a wave-particle) can be described by a simple set of parameters (say position and momentum coordinates). Each of these parameters must be quantized. Even at this stage, you will see the manifestation of wave-particle duality since that was one of the inspirations for quantum mechanics (not so for QFT, but they would have it in mind IMHO) in the first place. A photon is actually a propagating electromagnetic wave. In the article, they mention that classically the EM field is described at every point in space by a 4-dimensional vector (ie, it is a <a href="../../../v/e/c/Vector_field.html" title="Vector field">vector field</a>). Each of these vectors at each of these points needs to be quantized under the old quantum mechanics approach. You also pick up a lot of dependencies since if two points are close to each other their fields tend to be close as well. So QFT appears more or less "naturally" as a means of handling this infinite number of quantized parameters with infinite dependencies. The wave-particle aspect appears pretty much as a corollary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The difference here isn't in whether these things are treated as wave-particles (they both are) or even in the difference between boson and fermion. But rather that the electromagnetic field requires a single index in its description while an electron (though matrix valued, ie, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinor.html" title="Spinor">spinor</a>-valued) does not. This leads to a new parameter called <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_%28physics%29.html" title="Spin (physics)">spin</a> which describes the number of indices and whether the field is a boson or fermion. If the field has nonnegative integer spin k, then it is a boson and requires k indices to describe it. Usually, bosons are mathematically described by real or complex <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tensors.html" title="Tensors">tensors</a> with k indices. Meanwhile, fermions are described by a spin of k+1/2, k again being a nonnegative integer. These fermions would require k indices. Usually, this is represented as a spinor-valued tensor with k indices. Finally, these theoretic results would have the photon being spin 1, and the electron being spin 1/2 (from an index counting argument), which experiment backs up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In summary, any field with one or more indices is difficult to describe using regular quantum mechanics since you have to quantize a multi-index tensor parameter at each point in space, and thus have to deal with the problem of quantizing infinite parameters. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlHallowell_86e5.html" title="User:KarlHallowell">KarlHallowell</a> 15:02, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am just interested in table-top devices at low (harmless for humans) energy scale. So I am fine with cavity quantum dynamics, where the field inside the cavity is described by a fourier series. And I do not need the highest frequencies. I already only have a finite number of parameters before I start quantizing.</p>
<p>I hate the fact, that people tell me "the classical electron is a particle". Classical physics did not go far beyond sensation. No invisible small particles! A lot of layman do not believe you, when you tell them they are made off small balls. I think, I will not discuss this anymore.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnero_8897.html" title="User:Arnero">Arnero</a> 14:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was the primary author of the area rule article, and like Megapixe, I'm also trying to figure out what your diagram in the article means. For the life of me, I can't understand what it is supposed to represent. I can't even figure out what direction we're looking at it from, is that a side view or a top view? Nor is it at all clear <i>how</i> this diagram relates to boom reduction. Further, I don't see what sonic boom reduction has to do with the area rule at all. After all, your own lable seems to suggest the "break" the rule deliberately.</p>
<p>Would you be upset if I simply moved all of this to the sonic boom article? It seems much more on-topic there.</p>

<p>No I am not upset.</p>
<p>Some new stuff: I read that jet engines emit a lot of noise out of their inlet / outlet. In case of supersonic fligth this noise travels within the sonic beam. Therefore inlet and outlet have to be above the wings, so that the noise is sent into space. One of my images is as side view, showing the inlet on top of the airplane. Maybe I also drawed an image showing the outlet on the top. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnero_8897.html" title="User:Arnero">Arnero</a> 09:49, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Update, after I looked at the image again:</p>
<dl>
<dt>After all, your own lable seems to suggest the "break" the rule deliberately.</dt>
</dl>
<p>Since every airplane starts from zero area at the tip and ends at zero area in the end, one has to break the rule. But one does this at the front of the airplane and in the end, and not in the middle. But most subsonic airplanes change area near the middle, because of their wings. Usually one part of the fuselage is put in front of the wings one after the wings. A conus on the fuselage is used to prevent excessive shock waves. I draw the picture the other way round ( not really original research, many concepts point in this direction). One wing in front of the fuselage and one behind. Wings can have razor sharp edges to establish the area with out creating shock waves. Because these razor are very wide a lot of area can be established without big shocks.</p>
<p>Off topic: The easiest way to reduce the boom is to fly high. For this lift is needed. Lift leads to shocks. I do not want to waste shocks. So all the shocks should be used for lift. Therefore overpressure shock should point downwards. And the underpressure shock should point upwards. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnero_8897.html" title="User:Arnero">Arnero</a> 12:23, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Answer first, modify within one week. This time it fits into my discussion, rather than into that of the article, because "my contributions" show, that I edited <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gramophone_record.html" title="Gramophone record">Gramophone_record</a> and needed a clear estimate on the quality of CD-sound. Using the DVD-format, the DVD is better, using an 1-bit DAC I have the feeling that the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gramophone_record.html" title="Gramophone record">Gramophone_record</a> is better. The <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_shaping.html" title="Noise shaping">noise shaping</a> article does not compare Gramophone_records with 1-bit DAC, but</dd>
</dl>
<p>mentions <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolute_threshold_of_hearing.html" title="Absolute threshold of hearing">Absolute_threshold_of_hearing</a>, so it has some argument. Another one would be that quatization error is reciprocal to frequency. No Gramophone_record-fan will belive me that DVD-audio is better, when I tell them I use noise shaping to the 100th order. And for technical applications I say a 1-bit DACs is as good as <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulse-width_modulation.html" title="Pulse-width modulation">pulse-width modulation</a> with the same clock (width measured in clock ticks), but does not need the antialiasing filter. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnero_8897.html" title="User:Arnero">Arnero</a> 20:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>sorry Arnero, i dunno what it is of you speak. that <i>quadruple the sampling frequency for each bit</i> rule is not applicable in the case of noise-shaped oversampling. usually the sampling frequency is about 3 or 6 MHz to get 18 to 24 bits (depending how resolution is defined) of resolution with a 1-bit converter. it's not an issue of threshold of hearing or of Fletcher-Munson curves or anything like that. it's that when noise shaping is not applied there is more noise error in the baseband (up to approx. 20 kHz) than it is when noise-shaping <b>is</b> applied. <a href="../../../r/b/j/User%7ERbj_42ae.html" title="User:Rbj">r b-j</a> 23:00, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then please improve the <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_shaping.html" title="Noise shaping">Noise shaping</a> article! More sources, some images, no suggestions, I haven read it thoroghly. Before this article is not easy to understand, I think worst case should be assumed for 1-bit DAC.

<p>I find absolutely trivial and unencylopedical the table you added to <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breaststroke.html" title="Breaststroke">Breaststroke</a>, so I deleted it. Bye and good work. --<a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_d110.html" title="User:Attilios">Attilios</a> 00:13, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I tried to answer to your questions about my edits of the <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalanche_transistor.html" title="Avalanche transistor">avalanche transistor</a> voice: you could find my answers on its <a href="../../../a/v/a/Talk%7EAvalanche_transistor_3086.html" title="Talk:Avalanche transistor">talk page</a>.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniele.tampieri_e763.html" title="User:Daniele.tampieri">Daniele.tampieri</a> 20:32, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could you comment on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chirped_pulse_amplification&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117109617" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chirped_pulse_amplification&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=117109617" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>? I don't see it. Whether or not the gain medium is depleted depends on the pulse energy, not the pulse duration. Or am I overlooking something? <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHankwang_1955.html" title="User:Hankwang">Han-Kwang</a> 23:36, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for your message, because I do not watch the discussion of the article. I will answere there, because I think this is only interesting for this single article. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnero_8897.html" title="User:Arnero">Arnero</a> 16:26, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
