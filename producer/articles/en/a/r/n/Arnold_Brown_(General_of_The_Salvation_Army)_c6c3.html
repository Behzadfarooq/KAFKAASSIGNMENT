	    <p><b>Arnold Brown</b> (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_13.html" title="December 13">December 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a> – <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_26.html" title="June 26">June 26</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>) was the 11th <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generals_of_The_Salvation_Army_4631.html" title="Generals of The Salvation Army">General</a> of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Salvation_Army_ec7b.html" title="The Salvation Army">The Salvation Army</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>).</p>
<p>He was born in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, the son of <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officer_of_The_Salvation_Army_bdb8.html" title="Officer of The Salvation Army">officers</a> of the Army. While he was still a young boy, his family emigrated to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and it was from the corps in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belleville%2C_Ontario_d4fa.html" title="Belleville, Ontario">Belleville</a> that he entered training, becoming an <a href="../../../o/f/f/Officer_of_The_Salvation_Army_bdb8.html" title="Officer of The Salvation Army">officer</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>. A two-year corps command was followed by 10 years service in the editorial department at territorial headquarters, where he became assistant editor of <i>The War Cry</i>. During that time he compiled a history of the first 50 years of Salvation Army ministry in Canada, entitled <i>What Hath God Wrought?</i></p>
<p>Captain Arnold Brown and Lieutenant Jean Barclay were married <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, and they gave 42 years of joint service before they retired from active leadership. They were blessed with the addition of two daughters to their family, Heather Jean Brown and Beverley Ann Brown.</p>
<p>It was as publicity and special efforts secretary in Canada that Arnold Brown's public relations genius, initiative and drive found full scope, especially in the pioneering realm of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_programming.html" title="Radio programming">radio</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_program.html" title="Television program">television</a>. The <i>Living Word</i> TV series, beamed throughout North America, was the outcome of his enthusiasm and assiduously acquired know-how. Such responsibility took him to all <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">USA</a> territories and to <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, his name becoming well known in many parts of the Army world.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, the then Brigadier Brown was appointed as territorial youth secretary, an appointment in which he gave a vigorous lead to the young Salvationists of Canada and <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bermuda.html" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. Always an inspired leader of meetings and a fascinating speaker, his ministry among the young people of the territory made an indelible mark upon the lives and service of many of them.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, there came a return to public relations work, this time at International Headquarters, where Lieut-Colonel Arnold Brown was appointed as secretary for public relations, being promoted to the rank of colonel just a few months later. The genius that he had developed in earlier years was put to further use during his time as head of the PR department at IHQ. His imaginative leadership gave birth to the 'For God's Sake Care!' campaign, which raised the Army's profile significantly throughout the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, and changed the face of The Salvation Army's public relations work for all time. It was also under his direction that advisory boards were established in the UK.</p>
<p>General Brown had a long-standing involvement with the Rotary Club movement, rising to high office in the London club and internationally. In his capacity as a Rotarian he was invited to address many international conferences, including those in <a href="../../../l/a/u/Lausanne.html" title="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> and in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Canada, in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. Whenever he addressed Rotary, he proudly presented the story of God's Army and its contribution to the relief of suffering and need around the world.</p>
<p>Following an outstanding period of service in public relations, Commissioner Arnold Brown was appointed Chief of the Staff in October <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, where he served for five years before returning to Canada as territorial commander in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. Three years later, the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Council_of_The_Salvation_Army_aa1a.html" title="High Council of The Salvation Army">High Council of The Salvation Army</a> elected him to become the 11th General of The Salvation Army. He took office on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">July 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>.</p>
<p>Upon election, when asked what he wanted <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvationist.html" title="Salvationist">Salvationists</a> to do, General Brown said: 'Everything they can to make better known Jesus Christ and his saving power as the only hope for a sinning, suffering world; everything they can to demonstrate indisputably in what they say and do that the grace of God enables men and women to live clean and holy lives filled with the joy of service to God and their fellows; in short, everything they can to bring Heaven to earth.'</p>
<p>When General Brown came into office, plans were already well in hand for the Army's fifth international congress in London, and the General gave masterly leadership and direction to the proceedings over a period of 10 days in the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>.</p>
<p>General and Mrs Brown travelled extensively during the four-and-a-half years the General was in office, giving energetic, imaginative and inspired leadership to the Army all around the world. General Brown was as much at home in the presence of kings and presidents as he was in the company of Salvationists from the humblest of backgrounds, and both received him just as warmly.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, General Brown inaugurated the International Staff Songsters in London, and he continued to maintain a lively interest in their ministry, both in the UK and many other countries to which they have travelled in the past 22 years.</p>
<p>General Brown received many honours during his lifetime, recognising his contribution to the field of literature as well as his work in the interests of the poor and underprivileged of society. He was made a Freeman of the City of London in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, an Officer of the Order of Canada in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> and, also in 1981, an honorary Doctor of Divinity at the Olivet Seminary in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">USA</a>.</p>
<p>Many books were written by General Arnold Brown, including <i>What Hath God Wrought?</i>, <i>The Gate and the Light</i> (autobiography), <i>The Mountain the Wind Blew Here</i>, and <i>With Christ at the Table and Occupied Manger - Unoccupied Tomb</i>.</p>
<p>General Arnold Brown died at age 88 in a hospital in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>.</p>
