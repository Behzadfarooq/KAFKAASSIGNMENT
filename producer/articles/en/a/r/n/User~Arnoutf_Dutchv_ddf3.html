<p>Despite centuries of relations between <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Netherlands_cf8a.html" title="The Netherlands">the Netherlands</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, including fighting <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Dutch_Wars_7e02.html" title="Anglo-Dutch Wars">some of the most destructive wars</a> in their respective histories against each other, most Dutch people feel ambivalent towards the British. British people (who most Dutch people will call "<i><a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a></i>") are viewed as being a bit quaint and old fashioned, even though <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophone.html" title="Anglophone">Anglophone</a> television programmes and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_literature.html" title="English literature">English literature</a> in general are held in high regard. Typically <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">Americans</a> are thought to be principally "<i>good</i>" people but somewhat uneducated and badly guided by their <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politician.html" title="Politician">politicians</a>. While <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> are seen as beautiful countries, ideal for holidays, their inhabitants are somewhat frowned upon. The <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_people.html" title="French people">French</a> are considered to be easily agitated, talkative and shallow as well as obstructionists, intolerant, and lack skills at negotiating.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_people.html" title="Italian people">Italians</a> (as most, if not all, people living around the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean.html" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>) have a positive image but are regarded as being too emotional. In Dutch society, extravagantly flaunting ones emotions (whether positive or negative) is seen as lack of control. Peoples and cultures who are disapproved of or looked down upon are those whose religious or political customs are seen as intolerant, such cultures with a taboo on regarding men and women as equals.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Of all European nations, the Swiss generally are admired most. Their country is described as being "<i>spotless</i>" and the people as "<i>keeping to themselves</i>" a trait shared with the Dutch.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Special cases are the Germans and Belgians. For many years, most recently since <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a>, a strong animosity existed towards Germans. They were said to be <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rude.html" title="Rude">rude</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrogant.html" title="Arrogant">arrogant</a>, noisy and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intolerant.html" title="Intolerant">intolerant</a> and in fact most other antonyms of characteristics the Dutch pride themselves on. This is mostly without knowing these German people personally. For many Dutch people it was not a question of "<i>why</i>" they disliked Germans, they just did. According to "The Xenophobe's Guide to the Dutch", "<i>Telling a Dutch person that <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">their language</a> seems very similar to <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> is unlikely to benefit your relationship. Remarking that the two nations are similar in many ways will probably get you thrown out of the house.</i>" Perhaps strangely, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germans.html" title="Germans">Germans</a> are generally unaware of the fact that they are disliked by their neighbours and often think it is merely a soccer phenomenon when the anti-German feelings are most visible, as the Dutch and Germans have had fierce soccer rivalry ever since the Second World War. Although the post war rivalry on Germany's side is actually a reaction on the behaviour displayed by the Dutch<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>, Dutch antipathy towards Germans goes back to the early <a href="../../../1/5/t/15th_century.html" title="15th century">15th century</a> when Germans were seen as uneducated, grumpy peasants who served as cheap labour to the wealthier Dutch.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup><br /></p>
<p>Over the last year (2006) a remarkable shift has been observed in attitude towards Germans. Another reason may be that the newer, younger generation does not have the emotional ties to past events.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgians</a> on the other hand have an entirely different image, they feature prominently in Dutch <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html" title="Joke">jokes</a> in which they are often portrayed as being stupid and uneducated but this is commonly accepted to be a completely made up stereotype, originating at the time of the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgian_Revolution_86b1.html" title="Belgian Revolution">Belgian Revolution</a>, in which the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish.html" title="Flemish">Flemish</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walloons.html" title="Walloons">Walloons</a> seceded from the Netherlands. Generally they are admired for their <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">educational</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health.html" title="Health">health</a> system. Most if not all Dutch people consider the Belgians to be the closest related people. It should however be noted that the Dutch, when they speak of Belgians, nearly always mean the Flemish (the Dutch speaking inhabitants of Belgium) rather than the Walloons whom most hardly know.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p>Thanks for taking this initiative, Arnoutf. Well as mentioned on the talk page, I consider the points of view section silly, unencyclopedic, silly and downright silly. If we must have a point of view section, I advise to keep it to our direct neighbors only for which there must be plenty of sources available. The opinions on other nations come across as "kort door de bocht" and look like original research to me. Dennnnis 14:37, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Despite centuries of relations between <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Netherlands_cf8a.html" title="The Netherlands">the Netherlands</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, including fighting <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Dutch_Wars_7e02.html" title="Anglo-Dutch Wars">some of the most destructive wars</a> in their respective histories against each other, most Dutch people feel ambivalent towards the British (who most Dutch people will call "<i><a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English</a></i>") <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophone.html" title="Anglophone">Anglophone</a> television programmes and <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_literature.html" title="English literature">English literature</a> in general are held in high regard. Typically <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">Americans</a> are thought to be principally "<i>good</i>" people but somewhat uneducated and badly guided by their <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politician.html" title="Politician">politicians</a>.</p>
<p>The Dutch are, compared to most other cultures, rather reserved in public and do not often touch each other or display anger or extreme exuberance. This is why people and cultures who display these "<i>vices</i>", for example those living around the mediteranian, are regarded as being too emotional. In Dutch society, extravagantly flaunting ones emotions (whether positive or negative) is seen as lack of control or even as having a psychological disorder.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dutch people judge a foreign culture by comparing it to their own, cultures whose religious or political customs are seen as intolerant (compared to Dutch standards) are looked down upon.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>For many years, most recently since <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a>, a strong animosity existed towards Germans. They were said to be <a href="../../../r/u/d/Rude.html" title="Rude">rude</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrogant.html" title="Arrogant">arrogant</a>, noisy and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intolerant.html" title="Intolerant">intolerant</a> and in fact most other antonyms of characteristics the Dutch pride themselves on. For many Dutch people it is not a question of "<i>why</i>" they dislike Germans, they just do. According to "The Xenophobe's Guide to the Dutch", "<i>Telling a Dutch person that <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">their language</a> seems very similar to <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> is unlikely to benefit your relationship. Remarking that the two nations are similar in many ways will probably get you thrown out of the house.</i>"</p>
<p>Perhaps strangely, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germans.html" title="Germans">Germans</a> are generally unaware of the fact that they are disliked by their neighbours and often think it is merely a soccer phenomenon, as this is when the anti-German feelings are most visible. The Dutch and Germans have had fierce soccer rivalry ever since the Second World War, eventhough the post war rivalry on Germany's side is actually a reaction on the behaviour displayed by the Dutch.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dutch antipathy towards Germans goes back to the early <a href="../../../1/5/t/15th_century.html" title="15th century">15th century</a> when Germans were seen as uneducated, grumpy peasants who served as cheap labour to the wealthier Dutch.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup><br /></p>
<p><a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgians</a> on the other hand have an entirely different image, they feature prominently in Dutch <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html" title="Joke">jokes</a> in which they are often portrayed as being stupid and uneducated but this is commonly accepted to be a completely made up stereotype, originating at the time of the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgian_Revolution_86b1.html" title="Belgian Revolution">Belgian Revolution</a>, in which the <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish.html" title="Flemish">Flemish</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walloons.html" title="Walloons">Walloons</a> seceded from the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Generally they are admired for their <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">educational</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health.html" title="Health">health</a> system. Most, if not all, Dutch people consider the Belgians to be the closest related people. It should however be noted that the Dutch, when they speak of Belgians, nearly always mean the Flemish (the Dutch speaking inhabitants of Belgium) rather than the Walloons whom most hardly know.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
