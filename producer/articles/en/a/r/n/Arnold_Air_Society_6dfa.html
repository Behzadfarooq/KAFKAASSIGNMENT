<p>The <b>Arnold Air Society</b> (<b>AAS</b>) is a professional, honorary, service organization advocating the support of aerospace power. AAS is open to officer candidates in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Reserve_Officer_Training_Corps_4945.html" title="Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps">Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps</a> (AFROTC) and at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_Academy_ee12.html" title="United States Air Force Academy">United States Air Force Academy</a> (USAFA), and is formally affiliated with the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Association_7778.html" title="Air Force Association">Air Force Association</a> (AFA). In addition to AFROTC or Academy commitments, AAS members must complete candidate training, attend meetings, and contribute to their respective Squadrons and ROTC detachments. Doing so enhances the officer candidate experience of cadets as well as builds stronger leadership, organizational, and professional skills.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Air_Society_6dfa.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Arnold Air Society was first proposed as an idea for an extra-curricular organization by ROTC cadets at the University of Cincinnati in the summer of 1947. After having their idea approved by active members of the Air Force, the cadets wrote a constitution for their new, honorary society. They called it the “Arnold Society of Air Cadets” in honor of General <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_%E2%80%9CHap%E2%80%9D_Arnold_e4cc.html" title="Henry “Hap” Arnold">Henry “Hap” Arnold</a>, the first and only 5-Star General of the Air Force.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Arnold Air Society grew quickly. It focused on high morals, physical fitness, and a positive attitude toward the Society and its goals. Since it is the mission of ROTC and the Air Force Academy to produce leaders, AAS enhances that mission by building these values into cadets early on, and ensuring that they maintain these standards.</p>
<p>Arnold Air Society was officially recognized by the Air Force in April of 1948. It was then the goal of the Society to recruit and build more Squadrons to make the Society bigger. Within the next year, an additional twenty squadrons were formed across the country. Another important concept of Arnold Air Society was the National Conclave. The National Conclave (NATCON) is held annually to review the policies and procedures of the Society. The first NATCON was held at the University of Cincinnati in 1950. At this time, all Squadrons from around the nation can gather to vote on new leadership for the upcoming year as well.</p>
<p>The first Honorary Sponsor of Arnold Air Society was Mrs. Eleanor Arnold. General <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Doolittle_7131.html" title="James Doolittle">James Doolittle</a> was chosen to be the Honorary Commander following General <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Arnold_6e09.html" title="Henry Arnold">Henry Arnold</a>’s death in 1949. Following the first National Conclaves, the Society’s official name became Arnold Air Society, a deviation from the original title. Following the second National Conclave, AAS became officially affiliated with the Air Force Association, and at the fourth and fifth NATCONs, it was proposed that the organizational structure of the Society be changed.</p>
<p>After the first few years of existence, the Executive Board was formed, which would be responsible for national leadership and organization. The Executive Board makes decisions that are vital to the structure and success of Arnold Air Society as a whole. In its early stages, many of the primary awards and policies were founded which are still in practice today.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Air_Society_6dfa.html" title="Edit section: Entry Requirements">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Entry Requirements</span></h3>
<p>Each prospective member for Arnold Air Society must be a member of a local AFROTC detachment and at least meet those academic and physical standards. If these criteria are met, then the individual can enter the Candidate Training Program.</p>
<p>During the six to eleven week training program (at individual squadrons' discretion), the candidate must attend at least 90% of all candidate activities. Also, the candidate class must complete at least one service project that benefits their detachment, university campus, or their community. In addition, candidates must gain the signatures of all of the active members of their squadron, unless otherwise stated by the squadron commander. The candidate class is highly encouraged to attend at least one of the squadron’s active members meeting.</p>
<p>Other than the physical and military standards that all candidates are expected to reach, there are also academic standards as well. The candidate will be taking a National Test at the conclusion of their candidate training program. The candidate must pass the test; the passing score is 80%.</p>
<p>Many squadrons have a final training event that varies from hours to days as the culmination of the candidate class' training thus far. This event goes by many different names; however, the most popular title is the Extended Training Exercise (ETE). This event is usually extremely difficult physically and mentally. The bonds and relationships between the candidates in their respective classes have been tested and forged throughout the six to eleven weeks of training. ETE will test these bonds and promote the skills of teamwork and leadership in a practical manner.</p>

<p>The nation has been broken into eleven numbered areas (I though XI), which in turn are composed of squadrons.</p>
<p>National Headquarters is chosen yearly by the National Conclave, and may not be hosted by the squadron for more than two consecutive years. National HQ is led by the AAS National Commander, an AAS C/Brig Gen. The recommended national staff is as follows, with the Vice Commander holding the position of AAS C/Col and all other staff AAS C/Lt Col.</p>

<p>Squadron positions are similar to their area counterparts, and are elected by squadron members IAW squadron by-laws. The commander is an AAS C/Maj, Deputy Commander an AAS C/Capt, and other staff members AAS C/1st Lt's.</p>
