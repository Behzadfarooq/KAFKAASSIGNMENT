<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Murray_c3f2.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma.html" title="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, Arnold Murray is a former <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_%28armed_services%29.html" title="Marine (armed services)">Marine</a> who fought at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chosin_Reservoir_7c8d.html" title="Battle of Chosin Reservoir">Chosin Reservoir</a> during the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_war.html" title="Korean war">Korean war</a>. He began his ministry in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> after ordination by "Soldiers of the Cross," headquartered in <a href="../../../e/n/g/Englewood%2C_Colorado_6848.html" title="Englewood, Colorado">Englewood, Colorado</a>. He has two sons, Dennis and David who both participate in the ministry with their father. His wife, Anna, is deceased.</p>
<p>Shepherd's Chapel is registered as a non-profit under the "Soldiers of the Cross" name, in Arkansas. Verified at Arkansas Secretary of State Site: <a href="http://www.sosweb.state.ar.us/corps/search_all.php" class="external free" title="http://www.sosweb.state.ar.us/corps/search_all.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.sosweb.state.ar.us/corps/search_all.php</a> (Select "All Types"; Name: "Soldiers of the Cross"; RA: "Arnold B. Murray"; RA City: "Gravette"; RA State: "Arkansas" and search).</p>
<p>In 1978 Murray copyrighted his interpretation of the King James Bible, called the "Shepherd's Bible" (Registration # TX-42-142). This was in the form of booklets, quoting scripture along with his explanation following it, similar to the way he teaches now, only in written form. Murray has not authored any books since. Despite numerous attempts by various ministries asking Murray for biographical information, Murray keeps his life private.</p>
<p>Mr. Murray claims to hold a doctorate, but refuses to identify the college which issued this doctorate, or the institution where he received his undergraduate degree. He states that he believes that degrees do not advance ones status or favor in the eyes of the Lord.</p>
<p>Murray does not solicit donation except for stating "If we've helped you, help us keep coming to you" at the end of each program. He does not draw a salary and has not during his fifty year career as a preacher.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> He is not a member of the ECFA (Evangelical Council for Financial Accountablity). Shepherd's Chapel has a Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Recently, Murray's son Dennis Murray has taken over some of the reins of Shepherd's Chapel, since his father is advancing in age. It is Dennis Murray's voice that welcomes viewers during the opening of each program.</p>
<p>Dr.Arnold Murray is back on the air. His absence was not due to his age, but rather a personal injury.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Murray_c3f2.html" title="Edit section: Preaching style">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Preaching style</span></h2>
<p>Murray teaches using expositional preaching, utilizing the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_James_Version_5f0d.html" title="King James Version">King James Version</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong%27s_Concordance_c942.html" title="Strong's Concordance">Strong's Concordance</a> almost exclusively.</p>
<p>Murray makes a point of not naming the preachers and denominations he disagrees with, saying <i>"let's just stick to studying <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>'s word."</i> Murray declines to answer questions about particular <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_denomination.html" title="Christian denomination">denominations</a> within <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and other <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religions.html" title="Religions">religions</a>. In doing so, he never risks offending his audience by naming names of denominations, preachers or organizations. He does mention "revolving reverends" and "one-verse Charlies," but never names them.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Murray_c3f2.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>Murray has come under some scrutiny for his political and spiritual views, which he terms <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing.html" title="Right-wing">right-wing</a>. He claims to disagree with <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a> views, and teaches that all races are equal and equally loved by God. He often uses the term "tribes". For example, when he refers to the "tribe of <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain.html" title="Cain">Cain</a>", his wording is ambiguous as to whether it means "all murderers belong to Cain's tribe", or "descendants of Cain (Cain's tribe) are predispositioned to murder." He is a proponent of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Israelism_2bd2.html" title="British Israelism">British Israelism</a>, among other unorthodox views.</p>

<ul>
<li>In mentioning God the Father, Murray often refers to him as both "The Father," and "Our Father." He refers to Jesus as "Jesus" and "Yeshua". He refers to the Holy Ghost as the Holy Spirit. He does teach the Trinity, but in a manner that some may refer to as <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modalism.html" title="Modalism">modalism</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Murray teaches that all the races were created on the sixth day of creation based on the scripture of Gen 1:26 and <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam.html" title="Adam">Adam</a> and Eve were created after the seventh day. Traditional <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> teaches that all people were descended from one man and one woman who were created on the sixth day. Murray also teaches a difference between <i><a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam.html" title="Adam">Adam</a></i> and the <i>ha'Adam</i> to document the above.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Murray teaches that God first created man in a spiritual body, there was a rebellion led by Satan, then God placed those souls into flesh bodies, born innocent on Earth and to die once in the flesh, finally returning to God in spirit for judgement. He also says that the "elect" are those who sided with God during the rebellion of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Murray teaches the doctrine of the "<a href="../../../s/e/r/Serpent_seed.html" title="Serpent seed">serpent seed</a>" (God, speaking to Satan, Gen 3:15 "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." ), which is the belief that <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a> beguiled <a href="../../../e/v/e/Eve_%28Bible%29_9690.html" title="Eve (Bible)">Eve</a>, and that <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain.html" title="Cain">Cain</a> was the offspring of the union. He sites as documentation the mistranslated word "again" which Strong's Concordance #3254 documents should rightly be translated "continued" meaning Cain and Abel were fraternal twins. He further states that the first time the twins both gave their first fruits to God at the same time, traditionally would be at the day they came of age, on the same day. Further, he uses the Strong's Concrdance to document that the descendants of Cain are called <i><a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenites.html" title="Kenites">Kenites</a></i> [Strong's Concordance verifies the definition of Kenites to mean "Sons of Cain". He claims that these people are referred to in Matthew 13 as the "tares".</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Murray_c3f2.html" title="Edit section: Eschatology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Eschatology</span></h3>
<p>Murray teaches there are two tribulations. The sixth trump tribulation <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapture.html" title="Rapture">Rapture</a> is the Anti-christ, effectively pretending to be Christ, and deceiving many, convincing them to "fly away" with him before the seventh trump. He teaches that the seventh trump tribulation is God's wrath. According to Murray, those who think the first ones taken from the field in the first tribulation <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapture.html" title="Rapture">Rapture</a> are those deceived and are mistakenly worshiping the anti-christ, thinking he is Jesus which therefore would describe them as those having "the mark of the beast" mentioned in Revelation 13.</p>
<p>To support his teaching, Murray cites:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mat 24:40 "Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left."</dd>
<dd>Eze 13:18 "And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?"</dd>
<dd>Eze 13:19 "And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?"</dd>
<dd>Eze 13:20 " Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Using Strong's Concordance, he distinguishes between the terms <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheol.html" title="Sheol">Sheol</a>, keber, <a href="../../../g/e/h/Gehenna.html" title="Gehenna">Gehenna</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hades.html" title="Hades">Hades</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tartarus.html" title="Tartarus">Tartarus</a>, and the lake of fire, while some Christians do not distinguish between the terms, or infer them to mean the same thing (viz., <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a>). He teaches that the <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_of_Fire_86bb.html" title="Lake of Fire">Lake of Fire</a> is an <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annihilationism.html" title="Annihilationism">annihilation</a> of the soul; that souls judged wicked cease to exist (blotted out) at the end of the millennium testing. (He bases this on Ezekiel 28 and other passages.)</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Murray_c3f2.html" title="Edit section: Other Teachings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other Teachings</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Teaches that there is a separation of time between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2 (See <a href="../../../g/a/p/Gap_creationism.html" title="Gap creationism">Gap creationism</a>). He cites the alleged mistranslation of the word היה in Gen 1:2, which incorrectly translated as "was", should have been translated (according to Strong's Concordance) correctly as "became", thus reading&#160;: "Gen 1:2 And the earth became without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep" He states that this teaching is also supported by other scriptures in the Bible.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Teaches that there were 8 Adamic souls on Noah's Ark, and 2 (male/female) of every flesh including human flesh. Traditional Christianity only considers that there were 8: Noah, his wife, Noah's 3 sons (Shem, Ham and Japheth) and their wives. Murray teaches that that possibly 2 of the other souls on the ark would include Kenites.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He believes and has stated as fact an <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> that <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> scientists have discovered a "missing" day in time that corresponds to the Bible's account of the sun's standing still in the sky (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Joshua_3669.html" title="Book of Joshua">Joshua</a> 10:13). Murray was observed doing this on May 5, 2005. <a href="http://www.snopes.com/religion/lostday.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.snopes.com/religion/lostday.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He teaches that the Bible supports the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Penalty_2ea6.html" title="Death Penalty">Death Penalty</a> for those convicted of murder and rape.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He teaches that the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapture.html" title="Rapture">Rapture</a> of the righteous before Satan's tribulation at the sixth trump is a false doctrine, and that those who believe it will be deceived by Satan during that tribulation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Teaches the doctrine of the Father, the Son, and The Holy Spirit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Murray rejects the use of the term "Reverend" for himself, claiming that only <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> is entitled to this term.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Teaches that the single instance where "Easter" appears in the bible is obviously mistranslated, saying that the the original word is "pascal" and should have been translated correctly as "Passover". He also states that the word "Easter" refers to the goddess "Ishtar", and is a fertility rite ceremony. He states that Webster's Dictionary documents this.</li>
