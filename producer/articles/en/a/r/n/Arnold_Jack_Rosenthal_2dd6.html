<p>Rosenthal was born in Alexandria, the seat of <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapides_Parish_8613.html" title="Rapides Parish">Rapides Parish</a> and the largest city in central Louisiana, to Bernie F. Rosenthal, Sr., and the former May Kaffie. His only sibling was a younger brother, Bernie F.

Rosenthal and his brother were the former owners of the Joy <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theater.html" title="Theater">Theater</a> in Alexandria and several defunct <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drive-in_theater.html" title="Drive-in theater">drive-in theaters</a> as well. Additionally, the Rosenthal brothers had business and land interests in <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natchitoches_Parish_dd37.html" title="Natchitoches Parish">Natchitoches Parish</a>, their mother's birthplace. Rosenthal is a member of the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> Congregation Gemiluth Chassodim in Alexandria. Rosenthal, who is divorced, resides in the family home on Albert Street.</p>
<p>Rosenthal graduated from Bolton High School in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>.

<p>Before he first ran for commissioner, Rosenthal entered the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic</a> primary for the <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapides_Parish_8613.html" title="Rapides Parish">Rapides Parish</a> seat in the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_State_Legislature_122c.html" title="Louisiana State Legislature">Louisiana State Senate</a>. This <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_primary.html" title="Closed primary">closed primary</a> came four years before Governor <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Washington_Edwards_f7d7.html" title="Edwin Washington Edwards">Edwin Washington Edwards</a> initiated a change in Louisiana election law through the creation of the multiparty <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_primary.html" title="Jungle primary">jungle primary</a>. Rosenthal was seeking to unseat incumbent Cecil R. Blair (<a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>), a veteran member of the <a href="../../../h/u/e/Huey_Long_16fe.html" title="Huey Long">Long</a> <a href="../../../f/a/c/Faction.html" title="Faction">faction</a>. Also in the race was <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floyd_W._Smith%2C_Jr._1cb7.html" title="Floyd W. Smith, Jr.">Floyd W. Smith, Jr.</a>, who had been the mayor of Pineville from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> and thereafter a Pineville alderman. Smith was related to the Longs and a native of the Long stronghold of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winnfield%2C_Louisiana_a6ac.html" title="Winnfield, Louisiana">Winnfield</a>, the seat of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winn_Parish_4822.html" title="Winn Parish">Winn Parish</a>. Rosenthal finished a strong third in the race, and Blair then defeated Smith in the Democratic runoff by about 2,000 votes.</p>
<p>Blair's victory was his last; in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, he was unseated by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_State_Legislature_122c.html" title="Louisiana State Legislature">State Representative</a> <a href="../../../n/e/d/Ned_Randolph_9ab5.html" title="Ned Randolph">Edward Gordon "Ned" Randolph, Jr.</a> Randolph served two terms in the state Senate, and, in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, he was elected to the first of five terms as mayor of Alexandria. Rosenthal and Smith became friends and political allies as a result of the 1971 senatorial primary. Rosenthal, however, said that his failure to win the Senate election was the biggest disappointment of his political career.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Jack_Rosenthal_2dd6.html" title="Edit section: Commissioner Rosenthal, 1973-1977">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Commissioner Rosenthal, 1973-1977</span></h2>
<p>In the spring of 1973, Rosenthal upset incumbent Finance and Utilities Commissioner Carroll E. Lanier in what turned out to have been the last election under the commission form of municipal government. In the sharply-divided campaign, Rosenthal promised voters that he would "lower your utility rates". Alexandria, at the time, drew much of its operating funds from the sale of city-owned water and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric.html" title="Electric">electric</a> utilities. Once in office, Rosenthal was hampered by his desire to cut the rates because of the automatic "fuel adjustment" charges authorized to compensate for rapid increases in <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_gas.html" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> prices. The city uses natural gas to operate its electric generating plant.</p>
<p>Elected with Rosenthal were his fellow Democrats, (1) Mayor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_K._Snyder_a211.html" title="John K. Snyder">John K. Snyder</a>, who directed the fire, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanitation.html" title="Sanitation">sanitation</a> departments, and (2) <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_P._Hebert_889f.html" title="Malcolm P. Hebert">Malcolm P. Hebert, Sr.</a>), a <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_engineering.html" title="Mechanical engineering">mechanical engineering</a> graduate of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Louisiana_at_Lafayette_1eb3.html" title="University of Louisiana at Lafayette">University of Louisiana at Lafayette</a>. Alexandrians joked that the purpose of Hebert's department was to "fix the potholes and to feed the monkeys," a reference to Alexandria's once pot-hole-filled streets and its small but impressive municipal zoo.</p>
<p>In addition to executive duties over each department, the commissioners served as a 3-member legislative body to pass <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordinance.html" title="Ordinance">ordinances</a> and resolutions. Under the arrangement, any two of the commissioners could block actions of the third. Rosenthal hired Floyd Smith as his administrative assistant, a decision which troubled Snyder and Hebert. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, Snyder and Hebert joined to dismiss Smith. Rosenthal was outraged that Snyder and Hebert had made it impossible for him to hire his preferred assistant. After the abrupt dismissal of Floyd Smith, Rosenthal hired the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> activist, Charles Frederick Smith, Jr., who would later be elected to the city council under the mayor-council government. (C.F. Smith was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Alexandria mayor in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>).</p>
<p>Rosenthal retained Miriam Haworth Taylor (<a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>) as his executive secretary. She had joined the finance and utilities department in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> and had served under Commissioner Lanier. After the change in government format, Mrs. Taylor was secretary to several Alexandria mayors.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Jack_Rosenthal_2dd6.html" title="Edit section: Rosenthal quarrels with other officials">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rosenthal quarrels with other officials</span></h2>
<p>During his tenure of office, Rosenthal frequently quarreled with Snyder and Hebert on matters, both minor and major. When Snyder and Hebert continued to voice 2-1 votes against him, Rosenthal tried to heal the breach for a time, but the troubles continued. Rosenthal also accused the veteran city secretary-treasurer, Ray Robert Allen (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">July 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, in <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yell_County%2C_Arkansas_f811.html" title="Yell County, Arkansas">Yell County, Arkansas</a>), of "insubordination" and the failure to submit a balance sheet of the finance department. Rosenthal proposed a "finance coordinator" position to supervise Allen, who enjoyed <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_service.html" title="Civil service">civil service</a> protection as the secretary-treasurer. The coordinator position was filled by Mrs. Velda Lee. Allen filed a slander suit against the commissioner, but he obtained no judgment. Rosenthal left the council in 1977, and Allen was elevated to the new "finance director" position under the revised form of government. He retired from civil service several years thereafter and still resides in Alexandria. Allen's situation demonstrated how elected officials may come and go but civil service-protected administrators remain, often on their own terms.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Jack_Rosenthal_2dd6.html" title="Edit section: Running for mayor, 1977">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Running for mayor, 1977</span></h2>
<p>Rosenthal ran for mayor in 1977, but he never gained traction in the campaign. He finished with only 429 votes out of 13,273 cast, a mere 3 percent. Especially galling to him was the fact that the top two candidates were men with whom he had many political disagreements: Mayor Snyder, who sought reelection, and former Commissioner Lanier, who hoped for a comeback four years after Rosenthal had defeated him. In the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_election.html" title="General election">general election</a>, Lanier defeated Snyder by a 68-32 percent margin for a term of 5.5 years, 1.5 years longer than the norm because of the transition from the commission to the mayor-council form of city government. The "reformer" Lanier hence became mayor even though he had been viewed as the "insider" four years earlier.</p>
<p>Rosenthal and Snyder were in the same graduating class at Bolton High, but the school was so large that the two never knew each other as teenagers. At the time, all white youngsters in Alexandria and Pineville attended Bolton, which is located in the city's Garden District west of the downtown area.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Rosenthal, still bitten by the political bug, waged an unsuccessful challenge in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> to Rapides Parish <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_Attorney_151f.html" title="District Attorney">District Attorney</a> Edwin O. Ware, III. Rosenthal filed for the position with only minutes remaining to submit candidacy papers. Ware, a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservative</a> Democrat, had presumably expected to run unopposed. Rosenthal received more than 40 percent of the vote in the contest. Ware, having first been elected in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, decided not to seek a third term as district attorney in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. Once again, Rosenthal ran for district attorney in a failed bid to succeed Ware.</p>
<p>Rosenthal thereafter challenged state Representative <a href="../../../j/o/c/Jock_Scott_ddb5.html" title="Jock Scott">John Wyeth "Jock" Scott</a>, then a Democrat who was seeking a second term. Scott switched to the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. Scott, an attorney and later a college <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html" title="Professor">professor</a>, defeated Rosenthal by a large margin in the jungle primary held on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_27.html" title="October 27">October 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>. Scott polled 7,419 votes (76.9 percent) to Rosenthal's 2,229 ballots (23.1 percent). Though a Democrat, Rosenthal had endorsed President <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Ford_de6d.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald R. Ford, Jr.</a>, in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> election in which Scott and Ned Randolph had organized voters for <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Legal_troubles" id="Legal_troubles"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Jack_Rosenthal_2dd6.html" title="Edit section: Legal troubles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legal troubles</span></h2>
<p>In 1983, Rosenthal formed a temporary law partnership with former state Senator George T. Oubre, Sr., of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._James_Parish_bca5.html" title="St. James Parish">St. James Parish</a>. Oubre had run unsuccessfully, losing to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_J._Guste_7390.html" title="William J. Guste">William J. "Billy" Guste, Jr.</a>, for <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_general.html" title="Attorney general">attorney general</a> in the 1971 Democratic primary, the same election in which Rosenthal had run for the state Senate. The two obtained a $50,000 loan from the Louisiana National Bank in Baton Rouge, and neither made payments accordingly. When the bank sued, Rosenthal purchased the note for sum $54,000 and then sued Mr. and Mrs. Oubre for repayment. Oubre claimed that he did not owe Rosenthal because Rosenthal owed Oubre half of the original $50,000 as a result of other expenses encountered from their partnership.</p>
<p>Rosenthal encountered other legal problems too. He pleaded guilty to two counts of <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire_fraud.html" title="Wire fraud">wire fraud</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_11.html" title="March 11">March 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, in U.S. District Court in New Orleans. In return, prosecutors dropped the remaining twenty-four counts against him and two business partners from New Orleans, John B. Levy, an attorney, and Harry Caire, a <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_public_accountant.html" title="Certified public accountant">certified public accountant</a>. He agreed to cooperate with the government in its case against Levy and Caire.</p>
<p>Rosenthal was accused of being part of a scheme to deplete the assets of Continental Service Life and Health Insurance Company of Baton Rouge. He headed a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holding_company.html" title="Holding company">holding company</a> in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware.html" title="Delaware">Delaware</a>, which purchased Continental Service. Prosecutors said that Rosenthal, Levy, and Caire sought to substitute disputed <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortgage.html" title="Mortgage">mortgages</a> on property belonging to an uncle of Levy in return for Continental Service low-interest <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipal_bond.html" title="Municipal bond">municipal bonds</a>. The bonds were sold to make a 60 percent first payment on the company. Prosecutors said that some $3 million was plundered from the company. The company assets became so depleted that Insurance Commissioner Sherman A. Bernard placed the firm in conservatorship. It since went out of business.</p>
<p>Judge Peter H. Beer, a Carter appointee of the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans, sentenced Rosenthal to twenty-two months in prison, assessed a $2,000 fine, and three years <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probation.html" title="Probation">probation</a> after having completed the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarceration.html" title="Incarceration">incarceration</a>.
