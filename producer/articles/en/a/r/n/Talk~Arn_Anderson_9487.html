<p>For a while, it was said that Arn was Ric's best friend. I always took this to be something more than Kayfab. But now days they say that Flair's best friend is Triple H. I'd hate to think that Arn got the boot cause Triple H has more clout.</p>
<p>Anonymous, 10/9/06 @ 11:01 am: I think the HHH/Flair relationship seemed like it was just kayfabe. While HHH probably admires Flair and his career, it seemed that the creative team just planned to have Flair make another Flair out of HHH. Thankfully, this stopped before HHH matched Flair's number of title reigns. As we now know, their onscreen relationship changed drastically and they feuded and grw apart for good. As for Flair and Arn, I still think they are good friends in real life. As long as Flair continues to wrestle, I wish they would show that onscreen more.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Talk%7EArn_Anderson_9487.html" title="Edit section: Retirement Injuries">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement Injuries</span></h2>
<p>Is it true that Arn's injuries that he retired over were caused by a Torture Rack or something by <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luger_0f7a.html" title="Lex Luger">Lex Luger</a>? If so, it would be interesting to see that in the article, along with any confirmation of heat that may have existed or still exists between the two.</p>
<p>The Torture Rack situation is not true. As stated in his biography, in a match in 1994, he was thrown into the ring ropes. The top rope broke from the turnbuckle, but he was able to land on his feet. Six months later, the exact events happened again, but this time he landed full-force onto concrete and hit his neck and upper back. He never took time off to heal. As time passed, with no down time, the injuries got worse and worse. I am a Chiropractor and I see this a lot. It is similar to whiplash injuries, but most people can take time off. In his biography, Arn states that the first sign of problems was, during a match, his left arm suddenly went numb and unresponsive. Later on, they found a rib, possibly torn away from the spine during the accident, was popping in and out of joint, causing shoulder discomfort and weakness. But, upon seeing his Chiropractor in Charolette, North Carolina, and consulting medical experts in Atlanta Georgia, the damage was found to be much more severe and surgery was deemed the only option to keep his left arm functioning at all. Surgery occured in Atlanta in late 1996 and was successful in repairing most of the damage, but there does remain some muscle weakness, loss of fine motor control, and loss of muscle mass in his left arm. However, he would be readmitted in March 1997 with symptoms akin to cardiac arrest and pulmonary failure. I have ribs that are damaged and I have patients with similar problems and when they hurt, they mimic the signs of cardiac arrest and pulmonary failure. He spent four weeks in the hospital during that time, crediting his recovery to his wife, his physical therapist, and the fact he did not want his children to be orphans. In July, while working out, a friend saw him at a gym and gave him a hearty slap on the back (he recounts this in his retirement speech). He dropped the water bottle he was carrying and could not regain use of his left arm for several hours. He realized that to step back in the ring and take another injury to the neck could leave him paralyzed or worse. Hence, his retirement and subsequent speech on WCW programming.</p>
<p>I know that's a long piece of information. Most of it is in his biography. I was lucky enough to have him personally sign mine at a show years ago. I have thrown in some information from my professional and personal perspective to help others understand what he went through and continues to deal with.</p>
<p>I have followed his career for a long time, so I am an encyclopedia on Marty's career.</p>

<li>- I took this opportunity to update his Personal section with most of the information above, edited to retain Neutrality.</li>
