<p>Another big neutrality problem with this article is that it neglects to address Rüütel's opinions on peanut butter.

<p>I still think the article is not NPOV enough; it doesn't try to report in some segments, but rather to criticize Rüütel. (And one can find an Estonian daily newspaper comment pro or against anything Rüütel said or did.)

<dd>I'm not aggressive at all; conflict-resolution is the opposite of aggressiveness. But as your first statement and your summaries suggest, you have very strong opinions here; you just do not like Rüütel. My question is simply, can we try to find a working solution all can live with, or do you insist on your view?

Throughout the presidential election campaign, Rüütel has been criticised for not having participated <a href="../../../r/i/i/Riigikogu.html" title="Riigikogu">Riigikogu</a> round and not taking part in debates; his career as one of the communist-era Estonian SSR's leading functionaries has been severly criticised as well.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></i> which of these <i>facts</i> do you find not NPOV?

<dl>
<dd>The first two sentences, or their information, is still in the article, of course. Removed is only "his career as one of the communist-era Estonian SSR's leading functionaries has been severly criticised as well", for which one article in a weekly newspaper is not good enough. I also don't think this was a key criticism; his "commie past" was not really a main issue in the process; it is more an issue for you.&#160;:-) If you have an AP or BBC or scholarly source for that this was a main concern of the story, I'll let it stand, of course. The scientist suppression as an incident you can put in, with precise citation etc., of course. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 16:11, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Ok, Constanz, I think your reversal again, which includes removing the POV label, update information, periodization of the presidency, sequencing, etc., is a form of vandalism - plus the contents conflict over the incriminated passage. Let me ask you whether, if I let the - very cheesy, and POV - passage you want there in the text and change back the others, you will remove the update changes again. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 16:14, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As is clear from your comments, you are interested in gradstanding and soapboxing against Rüütel, whom you perceive as a "commie leftover"; your point is not to present decent articles on Estonian politics. EE is not comparable to the BBC (it's a private weekly newspaper); also, on the English wikipedia, foreign-language sources that are not checkable for most users are only occasionally okay, and not if there are alternatives. You haven't added anything, by the way, just removed things, including update infomation - because you did not like part of the changes I did (removal of party-political grandstanding), you also removed, several times, update information, such as that Rüütel's term will expire. This is a classical case of vandalism. And for the NPOV, why should others add there, once one has the label. Once again, Wikipedia is not about grandstanding and soapboxing; quit using it for your own views, laudable as they might possibly be. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 06:41, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I don't know why adding information known and accepted by majority of our people should be 'soapboxing'. On the contrary, removing factually accurate stuff (of which you obviously are unaware of) may qualify as attempts to hide criticism, to censore the page or whitewash. I know your way of arguing from Fatherland Union article - no sources, but a lot of ambitious beliefs.Constanz - <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConstanz_9594.html" title="User talk:Constanz">Talk</a> 06:54, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Our people" is a strange criterion. Anyway, it seems that, in spite of your extremely offensive and unfriendly mode of speech, you at least don't revert updates anymore, and what you did now is finally getting close to Wiki policy (such as adding Taagepera, who however is not only a political scientist but also an old political enemy of Rüütel, and the founding chairman of a political party that opposed him even now). Still, the entire point of your changes is not to inform, but to preach against Rüütel, and whether that is laudable or not, it's not Wiki. I therefore asked to have it checked (that is why we have these mechanisms here); if the admins come out on your side, then of course I accept that and the POV warning can be removed. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 07:16, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, let us see, it would be nice if you have abandoned by now your somewhat skeptical relation towards wikiguidelines like neutrality and adminship. Anyway, you still haven't commented how pointing out critical facts or intepretations on a stateman could be against wiki - see articles on other politcians for comparison. Your failure has been so far that you haven't bothered yourself to add any facts in favour of the guy - in case you think the article has too many critical stuff.--Constanz - <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConstanz_9594.html" title="User talk:Constanz">Talk</a> 08:02, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You create an undue bias by adding multiple party-political accusations into the biography, even after the election. That's against policy. And why should I add positive things to Rüütel?
