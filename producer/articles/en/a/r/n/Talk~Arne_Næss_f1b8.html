<p>Someone should do something with this article. (I'm not competent enough myself, neither when it comes to philosophy nor the English language.) An example of something totally wrong written in the article as it is now, is that <i>Interpretation and preciseness</i> was Næss' thesis for his Ph.D., but that book is actually from 1953. The title of Næss' doctoral thesis was <i>Erkenntniss und wissenschaftliches Verhalten</i>, published as early as 1936. <a href="http://www.sum.uio.no/staff/arnena/#About" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sum.uio.no/staff/arnena/#About" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>I agree that deep ecology is important, but is it justified to call Næss the foremost Norweigan philosopher of the 20th century? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 134.173.92.124 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_134.173.92.124_ff02.html" title="Special:Contributions/134.173.92.124">contribs</a>) 29 April 2006.</small></p>

<dd>It is correct to say that Næss is widely regarded as the foremost Norwegian philosopher of the 20th century. For many years he was the <i>only</i> Norwegian professor of philosophy. In addition to the reference I've added to the article, see <a href="http://www.tibet.ca/en/wtnarchive/2000/6/7_1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tibet.ca/en/wtnarchive/2000/6/7_1.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.aschehoug.no/lf/aschehougagency/innhold.php?textID=857" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aschehoug.no/lf/aschehougagency/innhold.php?textID=857" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and also <a href="http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/content/v21.1/4_Drengson_Life_and_Work.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/content/v21.1/4_Drengson_Life_and_Work.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which states: <i>In a Norwegian survey of young people (pre-teen to twenty) an overwhelming majority said that the person they would most like to talk with was Arne Naess.

<p>Prof. Arne Naess did not 'pin himself to a fjord' - that is absurd. How could one do that. What he did was chain himself to a rock with other protesters against the damming of a river for hydro-electric power above the third highest waterfall (Mardøla falls) in Europe. He was carried away (and gently so due to his prominence) by the local police. Unfortunately, the river was 'regulated', but this action gave the eco-movement in Norway a major impulse. This introduction ought to be corrected as it is misleading, but it is uneditable.

<dd>The information I've got has come from secondary sources, cited in the reference section. Do you have any material suporting your different account of the situation? In particlar do you have a date for this? --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 14:47, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure why <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProEdits_9168.html" title="User:ProEdits">ProEdits</a> said "the introduction ... is uneditable": it's as editable as the rest of the article. ProEdits had added the same comment to the article itself, which is not really appropriate, so I've removed it from there, and for the time being instead added a "not verified" tag until this can be settled. Is it possible that there were <i>two</i> actions, one at a fjord as <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> says is stated in <i>Thinking like a mountain</i> (could you please quote details if you have a copy handy, Salix alba?), and another one at a waterfall?

<dd>My sources only have one sentance on the subject. I suspect ProEdit is closer the truth. The Nowegian pages on the waterfall and <a href="../../../../nn/k/a/m/Kampen_om_Mard%C3%B8la_2808.html" class="extiw" title="nn:Kampen_om_Mardøla">nn:Kampen om Mardøla</a> have some more info, but I can't translate this. Dates seem to be 26 July 70-26 Aug 70. Accounts still seem to vary as to the eventual outcome of the protest. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 11:59, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Næss has participated in at least to non-voilent protests regarding rivers and waterfalls. Mardalsfossen is a waterfall that is now regulated (protests occuring in 1970) and the Alta-Kautokeinovassdraget (protests occuring in the late 1970's) was a river in the far north of Norway where there is now built a dam. So both protests failed. I konw that Næss was chained up and carried away by police officers during the Mardalsfossen protest. Less sure so about the Alta-Kautokeino protest, but quite possible. Nevertheless you can't be pegged to a fiord. So they were probably chained together possibly anchored in some rocks or a tree.80.202.240.192 18:50, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here I translate the relevant information from <a href="../../../../nn/k/a/m/Kampen_om_Mard%C3%B8la_2808.html" class="extiw" title="nn:Kampen_om_Mardøla">nn:Kampen om Mardøla</a> 'Kampen om Mardøla' [trans. The Battle over Mardøla' is a Norwegian documentary film from 1972 about the Mardøla demonstration in the summer of 1970. Wednesday, 26 August 1970 5 a.m. The police take action. At the Mardøla Falls, the police ask the demonstrators to be removed with the philosophers Arne Næss and Sigmund Kvaløy in the vanguard. The first tent had been pitched on Sunday, 26 July 1970. Next day, the site workers were met by the plackards stating «Stop excavations until the court case is over» , «Stop: Mardøla must continue to run through Eikesdalen» «Stop: concerns only excavating machines» I am posting this on the main page, which I could not manage to edit previously for some unknown reason. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProEdits_9168.html" title="User:ProEdits">ProEdits</a> 31 August 2006</p>
<p>The change in the original absurd account about pinned to a fjord seemed necessary - though I do not know how to deal with the citation difficulty that arises. I was in Norway following events minute by minute at the time - I knew Næss and Kvaløy. I have not time to research the newspapers and other sources where my account would be validated as completely correct. I also happened to have translated the commentary on Sturlasson's film for him, so my translation can be relied on, I think I can safely say. It was I who wrote the account of the theory of preciseness and interpretation since I found no succinct and well-informed account of these materials anywhere, especially not in English. After about 15 years of teaching this theory weekly and setting examinations in it at the University of Oslo from 1968 to 1984, I think my account should be acceptable even though I not published it anywhere. If Wikipedia's policy does not allow for material from active original researchers then something should be done. Arne Næss is still alive and might even be interested in validating this himself. Any comments?<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProEdits_9168.html" title="User:ProEdits">ProEdits</a> 31 August 2006</p>

<dd>We might be able to use the Sturlasson's film as a reliable source. The fact you translated it, does not really conflict with wp policies, especially if we <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. I'm sure you acount is more acurate than my very brief sources. A couple of minor points, my sources say the action was sucessful, although the dam still seems to have been built. Secondly we tend to do quote using ''quote'' giving <i>quote</i>, rather than the the «quote» suntax. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 02:50, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is correct that the demonstration at the Mardøla Falls was successful, but only to some extent. Rather than closing the falls for hydro-electric power station permanently, a period of weeks or months was granted during which the water was released over the falls, rather than being totally dammed up. It is the third highest water fall in Europe and was also a source of tourism.Further, the protest was successful in raising national awareness about the degree of destruction of Norwegian nature through unhampered hydro-electric development, leading to government intervention in restricting the ease with which such undertakings could previously be achieved. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProEdits_9168.html" title="User:ProEdits">ProEdits</a> 03-09-06</p>

<p>Thanks Salix Alba for making my entry acceptable and posting it! I would like to note that the person who removed my edit )SSS108 or Gerald Moreno)is an obsessive and long-term stalker and defamer of me in dozens of his web pages (which URLs he purposely advertised by his link to his SSS108 page) and hundreds of slanderous board postings, all because I have defected from his guru Sathya Sai Baba after seeing 'behind the scenes', and my daring to tell my experiences and criticise this guru's fantastic false claims and reported behaviour. It is likely that he will return if he finds the slightest opportunity. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProEdits_9168.html" title="User:ProEdits">ProEdits</a> 21:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
