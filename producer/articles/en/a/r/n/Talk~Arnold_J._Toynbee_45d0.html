<p>As a novice user interested in the ideas and contributions of Arnold Toynbee, I find the article distinctly lacking. I also notice more emphasis on the issue of criticism (though it remains unclear to what exactly, it feels as if the article is just trying to make it clear that there sure is a lot of criticism out there) and pretty little on Toynbee's ideas and achievements. Also, surely a work of the scope of a Story of Civilization should merit a bit more attention? What about a bibliography? --190.48.103.105 13:30, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>To anon. editor adding bibliography: there is no format standard at this point for books - but upper case is not it.</p>

<p>Noted. Thanks. Do you want me to lower case it all? This is the first Toynbee bibliography on the web, as far as I am aware, and relies on S. Fiona Morton. It includes all published items of 70 pages or more in length listed in her work, Bibliography of Arnold J. Toynbee, OUP, 1980, including his contributions to works by others, other than</p>
<p>• his contributions to the 13th and subsequent editions of the Encyclopædia Britannica, which may have exceeded 70 pages per edition</p>
<p>• material published only outside the English-speaking world (reprints of journalism or of locally delivered lectures, selections from his works for Japanese or other readers, etc)</p>
<p>• translations of his works.</p>
<p>Dialogues published in the English-speaking world and books edited by Toynbee, or co-authored with one other writer or collaborator, are mentioned even where his contribution may have amounted to fewer than 70 pages.</p>
<p>Publication dates are for first editions (first publication of the relevant material in this form). Revisions to subsequent editions are not normally shown. The place of publication is London unless otherwise stated. If a work was published simultaneously in the UK and elsewhere, only the UK details are shown.</p>
<p>For his journalism and his many other contributions to books, see Morton.</p>

<dd>Yes please do lower case. Please note that Wikipedia has to be careful on all copyright matters. I think it is questionable whether any copyright can obtain on simple lists of works, but I'm not sure the same can be said for bibliographical details. I tend to err on the side of giving quite spare lists of titles and dates. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 20:19, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Had also concluded lists could not be copyright. Some of the amplification is from me anyway. How much of it to give in an encyclopedia environment is also a tough call. Will rethink that point when I do the format change.</p>

<dd>One way would be to create a section of the article surveying the major works.

<p>It should be noted that during the Holocaust, Toynbee was among those prominent British personalities who slandered Jews attempting to escape to Israel as Nazis. His anti-Semtic record should be noted.</p>

<p>I'm surprised to hear of this and assume it's just an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack on his theories. I've read much of the 2-volume abridgment of Toynbee's <i>Study of History</i> and found nothing in it which offends me as a Jew. If he made any anti-semitic remarks I'd like to see these compared and contrasted with his views of Jews and Judaism as expressed in his main work. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 14:24, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This stems from a rebuttal to a stand Toynbee took in 1947 with the end of the British Mandate that rights of Palestinians still needed to be respected. It is available somewhere on the internet, but of coarse to the charge of anti-Semitism, there is no substance. It's just an example of the flaming rhetoric of the times, someone tried to exaggerate that Toynbee was opposed to the creation of the State of Isreal. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 16:25, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This might shed light on the record,
<dl>
<dd>"[Sir Lewis] Namier objected to Toynbee's presentation "because," Toynbee explained, "by this time he had become an ardent Zionist, while I . . . was becoming more and more doubtful whether the mandatory power was going to succeed in reconciling its commitments to the Palestinian Arabs with its commitments in Palestine to the Jews. I feared that the Arabs, were going to get an unfair deal. . ." <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/israel_studies/v004/4.1friedman.html#FOOT55" class="external autonumber" title="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/israel_studies/v004/4.1friedman.html#FOOT55" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 00:04, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think he said things like Zionism shouldn't go the way of apartheid, not that the word was then used; but took South Africa as a negative example. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 08:33, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was an emotional time; the State of Isreal was in its infancy, and I don't beleive it can be said Toynbee opposed its creation, he just spoke up about Britain's commitment under the mandate, and was criticized by paranoid critics, as these things usually get exaggerated. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 16:46, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A new reader having plowed through the entire -word article would have learned little about Toynbee's theories. Only 775 of th 2300 words are about him, and the 450 words about his approach to history shed little light on his views: they don't even list all the stages in a civilizations lifecycle and ignore completely Toynbee's concept of "<a href="../../../a/f/f/Affiliation.html" title="Affiliation">Affiliation</a>".

<dl>
<dd>I agree; most analysis like this always claim Toynbee's Theory of Challenge &amp; Response is related to <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environment.html" title="Environment">environment</a>; that may be the first example he uses in his text, however the threory recurs again and again and again, as social challenges, political challenges, economic challenges etc. This would be an excellent place to expand upon, and clarify some of Toynbeee's ideas. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 16:29, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Toynbee does mention environment, but his point about challenge and response is wider than that: he speaks of the need for the challenge to be not so much that it overwhelms you (like colonizing Greenland), but not so easy that you lapse into idyllic laziness (like people who live in sub-Saharan Africa, picking breakfast off a tree branch). I gotta crack open my copy of it again.</p>

<p>I made some corrections today to the page. I tried to tone down some of the statements made. I would seriously suggest that if people want to critique his work in this manner that that seperate sections be created on the page both cases can be presented.</p>
<p>I dont think its right to combine a description of his career and ideas with a hostile dismissive critique of them at the same time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Looks good. While I disagree with many, many of Toynbee's conclusions, his method of approach and investifation is unparalleled, and deserves study just for that reason. Also, Toynbee didn't write his works for the academic community, where all the rejection comes from. And it is quickly obvious to anyone reading, his work is not simply an academic "school" of historiography. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 17:33, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually I don't think this is the right way to go. We report on criticisms; when they are from distinguished figures like Geyl, they have to be given full weight. Simply mollifying the language in any case doesn't change the argument. I shall add something on the other side. But I have ample evidence that historians don't rate Toynbee. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 20:45, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Recently someone propounded a theory to me that Tonybee must have had a research staff assisting him, and that some work may not be his own; this is entirely possible seeing it's difficult to imagine one person can amass such an indepth amount of detail. And being outside academia would give you the license. Though I don't know what relevence such speculation is (except perhaps professional jeolousy, seeing academic historians can't use other peoples work and put thier name on it, or maybe get paid what Toynbee was getting paid). I hope this speculation goes no farther, cause it still shouldn't detract from what Tonybee amassed. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 21:03, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I dont mind the criticism of his work being brought up, but reading it this morning, it seemed to go a little too far. Comparing it to the Spengler and Huntington pages, it left the impression that Toynbee somehow far worse and utterly discredited as compared to either of them. I get concerned whenever I read anything about Toynbee because there is a group of people who hate him based on middle east politics out of all proper proportion. - anonymous</dd>

<dd>This introductory statement, " <i>found little response in the discipline of comparative history that most occupied him.</i>", is false. (And I attribute it to the professional jealousy stated above). True, <i>A Study of History</i> is huge. True, it occuppied him for at least 27 years (really closer to 40). However, I am looking right now at about 12 cu. ft. of the <i>Survey of International Affairs</i> that he edited during those same years. And he was probably more well known in those days as editor of that publication than as an historian. In conclusion (1) history didn't "occupy him most" (2) the current affairs of his day occuppied him regularly as anyone in the publishing business knows the pressure of meeting deadlines. Where he found time to research &amp; write <i>A Study of History</i> I'll never understand. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 05:23, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, there we hit a typical Wikipedia issue: the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparative_history.html" title="Comparative history">comparative history</a> page is the tiniest of stubs. That means there is not much basis for talking about his effect on comparative history, either way.

<dd>How about a rewrite of the first paragraph to be more generally about him and then moving the whole issue of "A study of history" after that. Right now, the placement is so up-front that creates a wrong impression. - anon</dd>

<dd>Toynbee's notoriety should include (a) longtime Director of the <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_104b.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a>, and (b) longtime editor of its publication <i>Survey of International Affairs</i>; <i>A Study of History</i> is coincidental or a sidelight to those two roles he played. The above is especially important, given the time in question, i.e. from the failure of the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Nations_d214.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the founding of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_of_World_War_II_922c.html" title="Alliance of World War II">Alliance of World War II</a>, the creation of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nation_c7de.html" title="United Nation">United Nations</a> Organization, the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, etc. It can be seen that much of Toynbee's writings is intimately involved in all these events. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 00:39, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The inserted quotation by Anon user is extrememly close to the "meat" we have been discussing here. Toynbee said as much in Vols. IX &amp; X of <i>A Study of History</i>. I would suggest an inclusion, perhaps somewhere introducing the quotation, that this is in keeping with his larger overall thesis of a "dominant minority" (i.e., his theory of <a href="../../../m/i/m/Mimesis.html" title="Mimesis">mimesis</a>), when he states in context,</p>
<dl>
<dd>" It seems to me likely to be imposed on the majority by a ruthless, efficient, and fanatical minority".</dd>

<p><br />
Please clean-up or add to this site. There is very little information on his theories. Even worse, the "critizism" section is empty of any substantance. I cannot tell what these critics believed was wrong with Toynbee's theories. Calling it "Philosophy of Mish Mash" does not explain what part of the theory is "mish mash" or where his arguments go wrong. Please flesh this section out. Thanks.</p>

<p>I note that the article twice mentions that Toynbee was an academic at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_London_fd08.html" title="University of London">University of London</a>. Whilst there is some centralisation of certain resources (examinations, libraries etc) the UoL only really exists in an abstract sense; it is a composite of 30 or more institutes and colleges, the larger of which are basically universities in their own right (amongst which the LSE is prominent). I therefore don't understand how one can be a research professor at the 'University of London', and thus this passage seems a bit misleading (it's particularly tautological to talk about the LSE AND the UoL (although I'm not certain when the LSE joined the federation)). I suspect it would be better to explicitly state which college or institute he was a professor at- can anyone enlighten me? <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 22:55, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
