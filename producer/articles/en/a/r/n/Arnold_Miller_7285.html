<p>Miller was born in Leewood, West Virginia, a small town in the Cabin Creek area east of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charleston%2C_West_Virginia_1570.html" title="Charleston, West Virginia">Charleston</a>. His mother was the former Lula Burgess Hoy. Miller's father, George, had gone to work in the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal_mining.html" title="Coal mining">coal mines</a> at the age of 9 in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_County%2C_Kentucky_2f8e.html" title="Bell County, Kentucky">Bell County, Kentucky</a>. At the age of 14, George Miller was forced to leave Kentucky by thugs employed by the mine owners because of his union activism.<sup id="_ref-Kline_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kline" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>When the mine owners broke the UMWA locals in the Cabin Creek area in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, Miller's father and maternal grandfather were blacklisted and unable to find work. Although Miller's mother was pregnant, his father George took a job in <a href="../../../f/a/y/Fayette_County%2C_West_Virginia_6b85.html" title="Fayette County, West Virginia">Fayette County</a> working for the Gauley Mountain Coal Company (where he became president of the local miners' union). However, the strain proved too much on the marriage and Miller's parents divorced.<sup id="_ref-Kline_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kline" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Arnold Miller was subsequently raised by his mother and maternal grandparents. His grandfather, Joseph Hoy, had been president of one of the early local miners' unions in the Cabin Creek area. But rather than follow in his grandfather's and father's footsteps, Miller wanted to attend college and become a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forester.html" title="Forester">forester</a>. Limited income and economic opportunities led Miller to quit school after completing the ninth grade. At the age of 14 in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>, he got a job loading coal in a local coal mine (where his grandfather worked as a miner). The Cabin Creek area had been the site of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_Mine_War_of_1912-1913_7421.html" title="West Virginia Mine War of 1912-1913">Paint Creek-Cabin Creek mine strike of 1912-1913</a>, and Miller became a Mine Workers member. It was a dangerous time to be a unionist in West Virginia: Private security forces from the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin-Felts_19bc.html" title="Baldwin-Felts">Baldwin-Felts</a> detective agency outnumbered miners three to one, and had standing orders to break up any group of three or more miners wherever they were -- often beating or shooting miners as well.<sup id="_ref-Kline_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kline" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, Miller volunteered for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a>. He was trained as a machine-gunner, and severely wounded in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Normandy_a39c.html" title="Battle of Normandy">Normandy invasion</a> of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> (most of one ear was shot away). He spent nearly two years in the hospital and underwent surgery 20 times.</p>
<p>Miller returned to the Cabin Creek area in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> after the war. He served a three-year apprenticeship in an automobile garage and returned to the mines as a mechanic. He married Virginia Brown on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_26.html" title="November 26">November 26</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> (they divorced in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>) and had three children, a boy and two girls.<sup id="_ref-Kline_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kline" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller joined the United Mine Workers and became active in Local 2903. Local 2903 had led the 1912-13 strike and was known for its activism. Miller was first elected to the union's <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workplace_safety.html" title="Workplace safety">safety committee</a> and later became local president. Although he briefly considered moving to <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, Miller instead decided to become active in national union politics in order to get the union to be more responsive to miners' needs.<sup id="_ref-Kline_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kline" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Black_lung_activism" id="Black_lung_activism"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Miller_7285.html" title="Edit section: Black lung activism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Black lung activism</span></h2>
<p>After 24 years as a coal miner, Miller was diagnosed with <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumoconiosis.html" title="Pneumoconiosis">pneumoconiosis</a>, or "black-lung disease."</p>
<p>Miller sought assistance from the national mine workers' union in obtaining workers' compensation from his employer. But UMWA president <a href="../../../w/2E/a/W.A.__Tony__Boyle_eae1.html" title="W.A. &quot;Tony&quot; Boyle">W.A. "Tony" Boyle</a> refused to help. "They were not just not with us, they were against us," Miller later said.<sup id="_ref-McGrory_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McGrory" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Stymied by his union, late in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> Miller organized other ill miners into the West Virginia Black Lung Association and won introduction of a black-lung bill in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_Legislature_4770.html" title="West Virginia Legislature">West Virginia state legislature</a>. When Miller led other miners, their families and supporters on a march on the state capitol, Boyle sent legislators a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegraphy.html" title="Telegraphy">telegram</a> advising them (as Miller put it) "not to worry about those so-and-so miners."<sup id="_ref-McGrory_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McGrory" title="">[2]</a></sup> Boyle's behind-the-scenes lobbying had a significant effect at first. When Miller met with the president of the state senate, the legislator "told us raggedy miners to go back to the mines where we belonged. I got hot and told him, Mr. Jackson, we are going to stay here until the snow flies and we are going to turn you out to pasture.' "<sup id="_ref-McGrory_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McGrory" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite Boyle's efforts, the political pressure exerted by the black-lung miners was effective in the long run. Media images of hacking, dying miners -- most of them young men in their 30s and 40s -- caused a public outcry. Throughout the lobbying effort for the bill, Miller accused UMWA of ignoring rank-and-file miners' needs. This undercut Boyle's power, which rested on his claim that he alone represented the legitimate concerns of mine workers. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_18.html" title="February 18">February 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Miller and thousands of other West Virginia miners launched a 23-day <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">wildcat strike</a> to demand enactment of the black-lung bill. The strike led the legislature to pass the bill, which was the first of its kind in the U.S.<sup id="_ref-McGrory_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-McGrory" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In August <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, Miller stopped working as a miner and briefly went to work for Design for Rural Action, a community service organization, before being elected president of the West Virginia Black Lung Association.<sup id="_ref-Peterson_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Peterson" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>The United Mine Workers was in turmoil by this time. President <a href="../../../w/2E/a/W.A.__Tony__Boyle_eae1.html" title="W.A. &quot;Tony&quot; Boyle">W.A. "Tony" Boyle</a> autocratic and bullying, and not well-liked. From the beginning of his administration, Boyle faced significant opposition from rank-and-file miners and UMWA leaders. Miners' attitudes about their union had also changed. Miners wanted greater democracy and more local autonomy for their local unions. There was a widespread belief that Boyle was more concerned with protecting mine owners' interests than those of his members. Grievances filed by the union often took months -- sometimes years -- to resolve, lending credence to the critics' claim. Wildcat strikes occurred as local unions, despairing of UMWA assistance, sought to resolve local disputes with walkouts.</p>
<p>In 1969, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Yablonski_9548.html" title="Joseph Yablonski">Joseph "Jock" Yablonski</a> challenged Boyle for the presidency of UMWA. In an election widely seen as corrupt, Boyle beat Yablonski in the election held on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_9.html" title="December 9">December 9</a> by a margin of nearly two-to-one (80,577 to 46,073). Yablonski conceded the election, but on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_18.html" title="December 18">December 18</a>, 1969, asked the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Labor_8b38.html" title="United States Department of Labor">United States Department of Labor</a> (DOL) to investigate the election for fraud.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, three <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitmen.html" title="Hitmen">hitmen</a> shot Yablonski, his wife, Margaret, and his 25-year-old daughter, Charlotte, as they slept in the Yablonski home in <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarksville%2C_Pennsylvania_901c.html" title="Clarksville, Pennsylvania">Clarksville, Pennsylvania</a>. The bodies were discovered on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_5.html" title="January 5">January 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. The killings had been ordered by Boyle, and the hitmen paid $20,000 in union funds for the job.</p>
<p>A few hours after Yablonski's funeral, several of the miners who had supported Yablonski met in the basement of the church were the service was held. They met with attorney Joseph Rauh and drew up plans for a reform caucus within the United Mine Workers.<sup id="_ref-Peterson_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Peterson" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The day after the killings were made public, 20,000 miners in West Virginia walked off the job in a one-day strike -- convinced Boyle was responsible for the murders.</p>
<p>Yablonski's murder sparked action. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">January 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, Yablonski's attorney waived the right to further internal review and requested an immediate investigation of the election by DOL. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">January 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Supreme_Court_e75f.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a> granted <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Trbovich_19f3.html" title="Mike Trbovich">Mike Trbovich</a>, a 51-year-old coal mine shuttle car operator and union member from District 5 (Yablonski's district), permission to <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intervenor.html" title="Intervenor">intervene</a> in the DOL suit as a complainant -- keeping the suit alive. The Department of Labor had taken no action on Yablonski's complaints while he lived, but after his murder, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Secretary_of_Labor_c3b3.html" title="United States Secretary of Labor">Labor Secretary</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_P._Shultz_ac01.html" title="George P.

<p>The <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Management_Reporting_and_Disclosure_Act_32e8.html" title="Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act">Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act</a> (LMRDA) of <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a> regulates the internal affairs of labor unions, requiring regular secret-ballot elections for local union offices and providing for federal investigation of election fraud or impropriety. DOL is authorized under the act to sue in federal court to have the election overturned. By 1970, however, only three international union elections had been overturned by the courts.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Miller_7285.html" title="Edit section: Miners for Democracy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Miners for Democracy</span></h3>
<p>Miners for Democracy (MFD) formed in April 1970 while the DOL investigation continued. Its members included most of the miners who belonged to the West Virginia Black Lung Association and many of Yablonski's supporters and campaign staff. MFD's support was strongest in southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and panhandle and northern West Virginia, but MFD supporters existed in nearly all affiliates. The chief organizers of Miners for Democracy included Yablonski's sons, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph__Chip__Yablonski_2ff1.html" title="Joseph &quot;Chip&quot; Yablonski">Joseph</a> (known as "Chip") and Ken, Trbovich and others. Initially, the group's sole purpose was to keep the DOL investigation of the Mine Workers alive.<sup id="_ref-Rasmussen_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rasmussen" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>DOL filed suit in federal court in 1971 to overturn the 1969 UMWA election. As the case progressed, MFD turned its focus toward building a union-wide political organization capable of contesting any new election. A number of union members were seen as potential MFD candidates, including Miller, Trbovich and miner Elijah Wood.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a>, Judge <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Bryant_cef1.html" title="William Bryant">William Bryant</a> threw out the results of the 1969 UMWA international union elections. Bryant scheduled a new election to be held over the first eight days of December 1972. Additionally, Bryant agreed that DOL should oversee the election, to ensure fairness.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Over the weekend of <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_26.html" title="May 26">May 26</a> to <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">May 28</a>, 1972, 800 MFD delegates from 16 UMWA districts gathered in <a href="../../../w/h/e/Wheeling%2C_West_Virginia_3a33.html" title="Wheeling, West Virginia">Wheeling, West Virginia</a>. Miller and Trbovich both sought the group's endorsement for president, with Trbovich the leading candidate going into the convention. But by Sunday, Miller had been elected MFD's presidential candidate, receiving 70.9 votes out of to Trbovich's 57.1 votes. As a consolation, Trbovich was elected the group's vice presidential nominee, receiving 84.1 votes. Harold Patrick, national co-chairman of MFD, received 76.4 votes to win the secretary-treasurer nod.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller's victory over Trbovich was something of a surprise. Many believed the delegates had been swayed UMWA District 17 president Jack Perry. Perry had been a founding member of the Logan County Black Lung Association. According to <a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecil_Roberts_%28unionist%29_9420.html" title="Cecil Roberts (unionist)">Cecil Roberts</a>, then an MFD supporter and now president of UMWA, "...Arnold Miller's election as UMWA president in 1972 was largely attributable to Jack's impassioned lobbying of MFD convention delegates to support Miller."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[8]</a></sup> Many delegates felt Miller was more likely to win any election than Trbovich. Many miners held discriminatory views toward people of Eastern European descent like Trbovich, while others felt he was too militant. Miller, meanwhile, already had a strong base in the black-lung movement.<sup id="_ref-Peterson_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Peterson" title="">[3]</a></sup> Trbovich, who had been campaign manager for Yablonski's campaign, was bitterly disappointed.<sup id="_ref-Falling_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Falling" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>, 1972, the Labor Department certified Miller as UMWA's next president. The vote was 70,373 for Miller and 56,334 for Boyle.</p>
<p>Arnold Miller was the first candidate to defeat an incumbent president in UMWA history, and the first native West Virginian to lead the union.</p>

<p>Miller proved to be a weak president. "Whoever talked to him last had his ear," one staffer said.<sup id="_ref-Different_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Different" title="">[10]</a></sup> He was markedly indecisive, changing his mind repeatedly and putting off decisions. Eventually, the reform movement he led began to stall.<sup id="_ref-Franklin_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[11]</a></sup> "He was not an exceptionally good United Mine Workers President..."<sup id="_ref-Rasmussen_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rasmussen" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>It became clear that Miller, whose only previous administrative experience had been running a 200-member local, was not capable of managing a 250,000-member union. Miller proved naive about union politics and only reluctantly controlled meetings (most of which turn into "parliamentary pandemonium, quarreling, shouting and ... nearly coming to blows"). As meetings spiraled out of control, Miller would become curt, even angry.<sup id="_ref-Turmoil_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Peterson_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Peterson" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Miller_7285.html" title="Edit section: Staff problems">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Staff problems</span></h3>
<p>Miller named a number of Yablonski supporters to prominent positions in the union. He appointed 35-year-old Chip Yablonski <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_counsel.html" title="General counsel">general counsel</a>. John Sulka became executive safety director, and Meyer Bernstein director of public and international affairs.</p>
<p>But Miller also staffed his team with a number of young, inexperienced people. These individuals, who often did not have mining or union backgrounds but who supported Miller's reformist cause, had filled critical roles in the presidential campaign. From the ranks of the campaign staff came Richard Bank, a 27-year-old Charleston lawyer (named executive assistant to the president) and Edgar James, a 27-year-old graduate student from <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland%2C_Oregon_1e41.html" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> (who became an assistant to the vice president). These appointments and others like them caused friction in the Miller administration from the start. "He suddenly felt he was not educated enough to run the Union. He relied on some of the college people who were non miners and they tended to isolate Arnold from the coal miners."<sup id="_ref-Rasmussen_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rasmussen" title="">[5]</a></sup> The college-educated staffers also alienated other, less educated, more conservative, leaders such as Trbovich, who claimed the young staffers were "leftwing radicals from New York and Boston..."<sup id="_ref-Turmoil_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller also purged the Boyle-appointed executive board. Miller dismissed 20 of the 24 board members, then named 13 of his own and seven of Yablonski's supporters to the board. Miller believed he had given himself a solid majority on the board, but to his dismay Boyle cronies still dominated the board. Miller assumed that miners who had won election in 1972 were MFD supporters. But many were actually Boyle men who had been elected by the rank-and-file merely because they were better known than the MFD candidates. They had supported MFD as a means of hanging onto power, not because they supported Miller or the democracy movement. Even many Miller supporters on the board broke with him before the year was out, claiming that he was mismanaging the union.<sup id="_ref-Turmoil_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller's district appointments suffered the same fate. Most district officers owed their loyalty to Boyle and the district leaders he had appointed. Miller drew on this pool of talent for his district appointments, and ended up appointing more Boyle men. Conflict between the Miller administration and district leaders quickly broke into the open.<sup id="_ref-Rasmussen_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rasmussen" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Despite the Miller administration's problems, Miller made a number of changes which democratized UMWA. At the union's <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> convention, Miller won support for virtually all the changes he proposed. Among the most important reforms was letting UMWA districts elect their own presidents and other officers.<sup id="_ref-Turmoil_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup> Miller "certainly got democracy restored to that the Union and the local union meetings were always democratic meetings with some of the guys serving as the local officers -- they were good guys. It was good to see they were accountable to their membership."<sup id="_ref-Rasmussen_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Rasmussen" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller's democracy movement extended to collective bargaining as well. The union's constitution was amended to give union members the right to ratify contracts, as well as formulate contract proposals. Tentative agreements were now reviewed by a "bargaining council" rather than the president and his aides. Additionally, Miller built a large and competent research department to assist with contract negotiations.<sup id="_ref-Franklin_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Navarro_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Navarro" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>A third Miller reform came in the area of politics. Miller established UMWA's first <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_action_committee.html" title="Political action committee">PAC</a>, the Coal Miners' Political Action Committee (COMPAC). COMPAC gave the union the financial and political leverage it needed in order to become more effective on the state and national level. COMPAC put financial muscle behind the union's political endorsements, giving the union legislative access and more political influence. COMPAC quickly began pressing Congress on the need for a federal black-lung program by lobbying and organizing demonstrations.<sup id="_ref-Turmoil_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, Miller greatly expanded the union's workplace health and safety staff. The number of staff rose dramatically from three in 1972 to 40 in 1975.<sup id="_ref-Turmoil_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Falling_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Falling" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller's reforms won the union significant new numbers of members. Miners had once shunned the union for its authoritarian ways but now joined in large numbers. By the end of 1974, UMWA had started 50 organizing campaigns. Eighteen went to election, and the union won 10 of these. In Miller's first two years in office, UMWA membership climbed by 77,000 members to 277,000 -- nearly a 40 percent increase.<sup id="_ref-Falling_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Falling" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Montrie_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Montrie" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p>As Miller's problems mounted, his reform program collapsed. He began sacrificing additional reform proposals to ensure the success of the few which had already been implemented. He openly fought with Yablonski supporters, and became suspicious of the young intellectuals on his staff as well. He also became somewhat paranoid about his enemies: He sold his home in D.C. and moved to a small, secure apartment in <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlington%2C_Virginia_fc7c.html" title="Arlington, Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a>, kept a baseball bat by his desk, and carried a <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_%26_Wesson_M%26P_b8c7.html" title="Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P">Smith and Wesson .38</a> handgun to local union meetings. His leadership style became increasingly autocratic, and he adopted the trappings of power (for example, like Boyle, he began using a huge limousine) and fired staff frequently.<sup id="_ref-Franklin_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Funeral_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Funeral" title="">[16]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Turmoil_6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Peterson_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Peterson" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller's first major political defeat came in early 1973. For the first time in UMWA history, a budget was not only proposed but was also debated by the executive board. Miller budgeted $14 million for organizing, additional safety staff, and government relations. But he lost control of the council meeting. He could not obtain a motion to cut off debate or hold a vote, and the meeting ran for 14 days. In the end, the board cut $2 million from Miller's budget.<sup id="_ref-Turmoil_7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>In early <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, Trbovich led a second executive board rebellion against Miller. After lengthy and acrimonious debate, the board voted to cut the Miller-proposed budget for organizing and political activity by a third.<sup id="_ref-Turmoil_8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup> In retaliation, Miller took away Trbovich's supervision of the union's safety division.<sup id="_ref-Falling_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Falling" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>Amidst these troubles, Miller faced renegotiating a national coal collective bargaining agreement. UMWA's bargaining demands included a 40 percent wage and benefit increase, stronger health and safety language, guaranteed sick leave, and higher employer contributions to the union's health and pension funds.<sup id="_ref-Chilling_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Chilling" title="">[17]</a></sup> UMWA struck on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_12.html" title="November 12">November 12</a>, 1974. A tentative agreement was rejected twice by UMWA's bargaining council (once prior to and once during the strike). Finally the government threatened to bring a Taft-Hartley injunction against the union to force the miners back to work. A settlement was reached on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_10.html" title="December 10">December 10</a>.<sup id="_ref-Navarro_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Navarro" title="">[13]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Recesses_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Recesses" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 1974 agreement was the richest contract in UMW history. But the membership's unhappiness with the new collective bargaining agreement led to a continuing wave of wildcat strikes, and significantly slowed the union's organizing growth.<sup id="_ref-Falling_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Falling" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Different_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Different" title="">[10]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Walk_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Walk" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1975, Miller fired John Sulka, the union's executive safety director. The cause of his termination was disagreement over how strongly the union should continue to pressure employers on safety. Miller felt miners were not giving his reforms a chance to work, while Sulka wished to continue to move forward.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[20]</a></sup> Later that year, Chip Yablonski resigned as general counsel.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller became increasingly defensive as well. He added security at union headquarters, and demanded that all staff travel plans be cleared through him so he could detect plotting. When he suspected one of his secretaries of plotting with a political challenger, the door to her office was removed.<sup id="_ref-Horse_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Horse" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Trbovich, too, continued to attack Miller. In early June, 1974, Trbovich circulated a letter among UMWA's board of directors accusing Miller -- and, to a lesser degree, Patrick -- of gross financial mismanagement. He accused Miller of overspending and paying raises to staff who contributed little to the union's mission, and reiterated charges that Miller had let the union fall into "radical" hands. Miller denied the charges, and counter-attacked. He accused Trbovich of keeping a public relations consultant on the payroll for six weeks longer than necessary, forcing Miller to fire her. The board's meeting turned into a shouting match between Miller and Trbovich. By that time, Trbovich had the support of 16 of the members on the board and an opposition slate was forming to challenge Miller in the 1977 presidential election.<sup id="_ref-Falling_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Falling" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller's troubles continued into <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>. At a meeting of United Mine Workers locals in northeastern Pennsylvania in early May, Miller and Trbovich engaged in a shouting match in front of the members. "This union is on the verge of financial disaster!" shouted Trbovich. Miller snapped back: "That's a damn lie and you know it!" Immediately after the meeting, Miller suspended Trbovich for insubordination. His claim was that Trbovich had refused to investigate financial and management problems in the union's organizing programs out West. The union's board of directors reinstated Trbovich in late May. Then the board, led by Trbovich, cut $3 million from Miller's proposed $13.9 million budget. In February 1977, as Congress debated surface mining reclamation legislation, Trbovich led a revolt of 15 board members. Despite Miller's support for a ban on surface mining, the letter opposed the new legislation and suggested a state-by-state regulatory approach instead.<sup id="_ref-Montrie_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Montrie" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Turmoil_9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The ongoing internal problems continued to affect UMWA organizing.

<p>So that elections would not interfere with collective bargaining talks at the end of the year, UMWA's elections were moved to June.</p>
<p>The 1977 election was a three-way race. Opposing Miller were secretary-treasurer Harry Patrick, running on the MFD ticket, and executive board member Lee Roy Patterson, running as head of the Boyle faction.<sup id="_ref-Turmoil_11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Horse_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Horse" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p>Initially, Miller's candidacy was somewhat conservative. He focused his campaign on his record of ending corruption, enhancing mine safety and winning sizeable pay increases. But in order to shore up support during the campaign, Miller agreed to seek additional democratic reforms advocated by militant District leaders. One reform would given local unions the right to strike on their own.<sup id="_ref-Walk_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Walk" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller won re-election. He received 40 percent of the vote. With only half of all eligible miners voting, Miller won the race with the support of just 20 percent of the membership. Few observers believed he would emerge strong enough from the election to control the union's executive board and bargaining council and avoid a national strike in December.<sup id="_ref-Turmoil_12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Horse_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Horse" title="">[22]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Pits_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pits" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>When the national bituminous coal contract expired in 1977, UMWA struck on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">December 6</a>.</p>
<p>The right of local unions to strike was the primary issue in the negotiations. During his re-election campaign, Miller had been forced to accept as a collective bargaining goal the right to strike over local issues. But the owners rejected Miller's demand because they saw he was unable to bring wildcat strikers back to the bargaining table.<sup id="_ref-Krohe_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Krohe" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[27]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Walk_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Walk" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>UMWA's negotiating position was not an enviable one. Power utilities and iron and steel manufacturers had built up stockpiles of coal, the number of coal mines controlled by UMWA had fallen,<sup id="_ref-Pits_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pits" title="">[25]</a></sup> and the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_oil_crisis.html" title="1973 oil crisis">1973 oil crisis</a> had ended (lowering the demand for coal).<sup id="_ref-Navarro_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Navarro" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller had also hurt himself. He had fired many of his supporters<sup id="_ref-Pits_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Pits" title="">[25]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Turmoil_13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Turmoil" title="">[12]</a></sup> and most of the research department staff. Miller relied instead on a law firm for bargaining advice, which confusion among UMWA negotiators and sent mixed signals to the employers.<sup id="_ref-Navarro_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Navarro" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sporadic violence broke out, and a few governors mobilized their state police and National Guard. But for the most part, the coal fields remained calm.<sup id="_ref-ToWork_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ToWork" title="">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>A tentative agreement was reached <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">February 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, which imposed penalties for wildcat strikes and chronic absenteeism, turned the union's health and pension plans over to the employers, forced workers to pay part of their health insurance premiums, and instituted a bonus system for productivity increases.<sup id="_ref-Bullish_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Bullish" title="">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p>A second tentative agreement was reached.

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_6.html" title="March 6">March 6</a>, President <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Carter_64a2.html" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> involved the national emergency provision of the <a href="../../../t/a/f/Taft-Hartley_Act_2cf3.html" title="Taft-Hartley Act">Taft-Hartley Act</a> and a federal district court issued a temporary injunction ordering the miners back to work on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_9.html" title="March 9">March 9</a>.<sup id="_ref-ToWork_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ToWork" title="">[28]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Ends_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ends" title="">[31]</a></sup> The striking miners ignored the injunction, and the federal government did little to enforce the order.</p>
<p>But a growing number of union members had backed off their earlier demand for the right to strike over local issues. Many miners began to realize that the strikes were hurting the union's organizing chances and lowering employer contributions to the union health and pension funds (which were near bankruptcy).<sup id="_ref-Walk_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Walk" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Eventually, UMWA and mine negotiators settled on new, improved dispute resolution procedures which they hoped would lower the number of wildcat strikes.<sup id="_ref-Krohe_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Krohe" title="">[26]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[32]</a></sup> Once more, Miller and his leadership worked hard to convince members that the contract was a good one.<sup id="_ref-Decide_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Decide" title="">[30]</a></sup> This time, the mines approved the tentative contract by vote of 57 percent to 43 percent.<sup id="_ref-Ends_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Ends" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>The pact was widely seen as concessionary for giving up union health and pension benefits, imposing health insurance premium co-pays, reimposing productivity-based wages and failing to win the right to strike over local issues.<sup id="_ref-Franklin_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_29.html" title="March 29">March 29</a>, 1978, just ten days after the coal mining contract was ratified, Miller suffered a stroke while on vacation in <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_Beach%2C_Florida_4661.html" title="Miami Beach, Florida">Miami Beach, Florida</a>. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">April 12</a>, 1978, while still in the hospital, Miller suffered a mild heart attack.</p>
<p>Miller's deteriorating health made him into a mere figurehead. Vice president Sam Church quietly assumed the day-to-day operations of the union.<sup id="_ref-Different_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Different" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mostly recovered by the fall, Miller exhibited many of his autocratic, defensive habits. He told the union's executive board on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_29.html" title="October 29">October 29</a> that he was considering resigning. Then, in the same speech, he accused Church of plotting to against him to seize the presidency of the union.<sup id="_ref-Different_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Different" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Miller continued to fight with the union's executive board and leadership, but ill health ended his presidency. In November 1979, Miller suffered a second heart attack while at his home in Charleston, West Virginia. By this time, his political opponents had decided that his erratic behavior and poor physical condition justified putting him on involuntary leave. Church traveled to Charleston. At Miller's bedside, Church negotiated Miller's resignation. In return, UMWA's executive board agreed to give Miller the title of "president emeritus for life" and guaranteed him his full salary as well as medical and pension benefits until the end of his term of office (which would end in l982). Miller resigned the presidency of the United Mine Workers on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>, 1979.<sup id="_ref-Franklin_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Franklin" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The UMWA executive board named Sam Church president. Church proved to be as autocratic as his old political mentor, Tony Boyle. Two years later, Miller told reporters that he was sorry he named Church his running mate and that he was "not very happy" about Church becoming union president.<sup id="_ref-Funeral_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Funeral" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, Miller announced he was running for president of the Mine Workers again. However, his candidacy proved to have little support and he exited the race quietly.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[33]</a></sup> That year, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Trumka_bb6e.html" title="Richard Trumka">Richard Trumka</a> defeated Sam Church for the presidency of the Mine Workers, becoming the second person to defeat an incumbent UMWA president.</p>
<p>Miller's health continued to deteriorate. He collapse in May 1985 and entered a coma.</p>
<p>Miller died on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_12.html" title="July 12">July 12</a>, 1985 in Charleston, West Virginia. His political nemesis, Tony Boyle, had died in prison just six weeks earlier, on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>.</p>
<p>Noting Miller's passing, UMWA president Richard Trumka cited Miller's commitment to democracy and the health of miners as a lasting legacy. "Possibly Miller's greatest achievements were the internal reforms he instituted within our union and the historic breakthrough he led in the area of black lung legislation," Trumka said. Trumka observed that Miller had achieved these goals "in the face of what seemed, at times, overwhelming odds."<sup id="_ref-Funeral_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Funeral" title="">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1972, documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple intended to make a film about Arnold Miller, Miners for Democracy and the attempt to unseat Tony Boyle. When miners at the Brookside Mine in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlan_County%2C_Kentucky_5763.html" title="Harlan County, Kentucky">Harlan County, Kentucky</a>, struck in June 1972, Kopple went there to film the strike and UMWA's response (or lack thereof). The strike proved to be a more interesting subject, so Kopple switched the focus of her film.</p>
<p>The film Kopple made, <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlan_County%2C_USA_15e9.html" title="Harlan County, USA">Harlan County, USA</a></i>, won the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Documentary_Feature_80e5.html" title="Academy Award for Documentary Feature">Academy Award for Documentary Feature</a>.</p>
