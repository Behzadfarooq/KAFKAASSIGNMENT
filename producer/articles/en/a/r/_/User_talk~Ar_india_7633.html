<p>Ideology -By Chandrashekhar</p>
<p><br />
The society we live in can be described as a complex system, at best as an aggregate of several subsystems, like the various social, economic and political institutions. In analyzing such a complex system, to know what is wrong and where the problem stems from, is the most difficult part. It requires a detailed understanding of the whole system as well as insight into its functioning. The problem and solution are interdependent in such a manner that the extant and understanding of solution is always proportional to the extant and understanding of the problem. So, “Knowing the Problem is Knowing the Solution ”.</p>
<p>Knowing anything requires understanding and knowledge system.</p>
<p>Knowledge System:</p>
<p>Reality is a continuum. Knowledge system, in shortest, is fragmentation imposed upon the continuum of reality. Fragmentation is always a necessity for understanding of the unknown. Every fragment in the knowledge system becomes a construct or an entity that is defined in the knowledge system. This very fact shows that different knowledge systems can be build on the same reality based on different possibilities and patterns of fragmentation.</p>
<p>1. Give easy and detailed understanding of the reality which inherently involves fragmentation.</p>
<p>2. Facilitate integration of the fragmented understanding thus obtained to know the reality the way it is.</p>
<p>The best knowledge system,out of the various possible, is the one which is best in its functions.</p>
<p>The preliminary understanding that is attained by the knowledge system is bound to be fragmented in nature since it bears the elements of the knowledge system. The next step, which is often overlooked in this direction, would be to have that integrated understanding of the continuum of reality. Faulty understanding is often the result of the residue in understanding from the knowledge system, and at times due to the faulty perception.</p>
<p>The knowledge system fragments reality and requires integration to reach the completeness of understanding. This process of fragmentation to completeness inevitably necessitates the existence of levels of abstraction. They are result of imposing structured understanding over the continuum of reality. The concept of levels itself is an abstract concept and not to be taken literally. Nor is it the case that these levels of abstraction have some natural basis.</p>
<p>Levels of Abstraction:</p>
<p>Entities are abstraction and should not be viewed as objects or elements as such, but patterns residing over continuum of reality, or in physical world, over continuum of material. So, the structure of knowledge system that is built over the patterns or entities will have a continuum of the levels of abstraction.</p>
<p>Taking the entity as an object rather than patterns leads to fundamental problem with understanding, because then there will be no place for the levels of abstraction. The understanding that is built in this way is very crude in nature, incorrect and prone to sophistry.</p>
<p>There are levels of abstraction in the knowledge system, which can approximately be projected as a hierarchical system. In understanding phase the approach is kind of bottom up while in action phase the approach is top down. While designing the system the approach is taken bottom up, but when system is put into action the approach is always top down. Violation of this always ensues loosing contact with reality and practicality.</p>
<p>The problem that resides at higher level of abstraction has a longer causal chain before it manifests itself in the material world. So, it requires subtle and profound understanding to identify such a problem. Due to the indirect implications, the difficulty of problem formalization is proportional to the level of abstraction from where it is originating.</p>
<p>Much confusion arises by flattening many levels into one, where they should not be. On the flipside by introducing many levels instead of one in the understanding will result in redundancy and pointless complexity, which also ends up in confusion.</p>
<p>If the fundamentals of understanding are bound at the lower level of abstraction then the understanding is much more fragmented and hence faulty. Any knowledge system that binds the fundamental understanding at lower levels of abstraction is bound to lead to fragmentation. The nature and reality are basically a continuum and hence fragmented understanding is fundamentally incorrect.</p>
<p>Deriving Principles:</p>
<p>Any conscious action is an upshot of intent coupled with understanding. Knowledge system is what shapes the understanding whereas intent comes from the instincts in the end. The intent has to go through the understanding in order to materialize into action. The intent gets transformed into action at every level of abstractions. Any action, at any level, carries the intent to the lower level of abstraction till it culminates in the action of the material world. This intent that flows through the levels and transforms in various actions is the deriving principles of the action at various levels, and ultimately the physical action.</p>
<p>By simple understanding, it is obvious and apparent that action must not oppose the deriving principle. If so, then it defeats the purpose, the intent, and implies the fundamental mistake in understanding and knowledge system. Fragmentation leaves the possibilities of such phenomenon. Hence, fragmentation must be eliminated as much as possible.</p>
<p>Party Ideology:</p>
<p>The ideology of “Paritrana” is based on understanding the problem at the highest levels of abstraction and taking action which is consonant with the deriving principles.</p>
<p>The ideology has both the components of knowledge system and understanding. The integrated understanding and in depth understanding of deriving principles is of more value compared to analysis of action patterns.</p>
<p>The simplicity and wisdom of the glorious past is lost in the complexities of pseudo intellectualism and pointless debates on petty issues, all of which are at a lower level of abstraction. The wisdom of the ages is extremely simple and can be distilled and offered as</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The Intent</p>
<p>The happiness is a construct hard to define. Finer concepts are harder to define. Yet happiness in some sense everybody knows and doesn't need any explanation or definition. Though “happiness” is not equivalent of “ ” since it carries much shallow meaning but that's the nearest translation in English. The happiness of humankind ultimately lies in understanding of its own instincts, along with understanding the world around.</p>
<p>Ultimately it is the human nature, from which everything is derived. Without going in much detail, humanity exists in such a manner that happiness of all the people is interconnected. The happiness of one man is ultimately derived from happiness of others.</p>
<p>The basic human nature of expansion is ultimately the deriving principle of all the instincts. Empathy is far more fundamental that apathy and like is far more fundamental than dislike. Though a detailed discussion of analysis is out of the scope of this document, suffice it to say that it is this nature of expansion, which is deriving principle of empathy, ambitions, desires, morality and consciousness, the source of all that is fine and all that is crude.</p>
<p>Explicit categorization and viewing the principle as the aggregate of those elements is one of the fundamental mistakes in the perception. It is an integrated object, existing as a whole monolithic concept with the component elements as projection or manifestation of it, in various dimensions or levels of understanding.</p>
<p>It is the continuum of instinct or elements of nature that take different shades, and gets categorized as different elements, and in fragmented understanding, leads to the concept of reconciliation of conflicting tendencies rather than perfection of balance.</p>
<p>Expansion and greed are ultimately the shades of the same innate drive which is the root of all the instincts of morality, righteousness, ambitions, desires and in the end feelings and emotions.</p>
<p>Though this statement is not without its entailments and implications the simplest understanding of happiness for a conscious entity is, “process of expansion or the state of unison”, again the detail of which is beyond the scope of this document.</p>
<p>The Understanding:</p>
<p>Expansion is the basic drive of mankind, and when generalized, has the natural corollary of conflict. So conflict is an element in the composition of any social entity.</p>
<p>Higher entities evolve as the entities at lower level merges in the existence of the higher level entity. Higher entities exist as abstractions which ultimately reside on the entities with narrower existence. Completeness at higher level, when viewed from a lower level of abstraction, or if fragmented understanding is imposed upon it, appears as contradiction. Similarly contradiction in a fragmented knowledge system can appear as completeness.</p>
<p>At a higher level of abstraction, society has components of both conflict and expansion. They exist simultaneously at varying degrees and intensities. And in fact, they are existentially interdependent. When the basic motivation of human beings in a social setting comes from needs and necessities, then the conflict component predominates. The conflict component by its very nature opposes and inhibits expansion. This leads to fragmentation of society at every level and suffering in general.</p>
<p>Prosperity elevates the basic motivation of human being and hence facilitates expansion. The role of prosperity is not to be viewed as bringing material satisfaction to individuals and leading to happiness. In fact material comforts themselves, other than elevating the level of motivation, have very little to do with happiness. Such is the complexity of human nature. The role of prosperity is to facilitate the expansion of individuals leading to happiness at both individual and collective level. The interdependence of happiness of people leads to an increase, either in collective happiness or collective suffering.</p>
<p>Prosperity is just a mean to happiness and not the happiness itself. Prosperity as a mean is the manifestation of the deriving principle of collective happiness at a lower level.</p>
<p>Existence of System:</p>
<p>The “system” is the nearest translation of “rajya” that is taken in this document. The system itself is an abstract concept. Everything in a society in action is very complex, but there exists a pattern at some level where the actions of each individual are somehow directed and fits with that of others. The system is not to be viewed as separate entity interacting with individual or the aggregate of individuals. It is an abstraction imposed upon the ordered actions of individuals forming a pattern.</p>
<p>The intent of the existence of the system is to channelize and direct the efforts and resources of the country in a direction such that they add up in the larger aggregate, where every bit of effort and resources gets its meaning and place. This improves the efficiency of the society as a whole and maximizes the gain of every individual as a part.</p>
<p>The system evolves and exists to maximize the collective and hence individual gain and it always exists in such a manner that one sacrifices some of his possible gains which he could have otherwise attained, in favor of continuation and existence of system. However, individual comes in the position of making this extra gain that he is not making is because of existence of system. The existence of the system is a delicate state of existence which maximizes the gain of every individual but puts every individual in a position of making extra gain at the expanse of the system.</p>
<p>Co-operation at collective level is always collectively beneficial. This co-operation is attained by the system that puts people in their respective roles. Thus everybody benefits with no one losing.</p>
<p>The deriving principle of the system is, again, the happiness of the people, albeit at a lower level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Role of “ ”</p>
<pre>
is a bit involved construct that encompassed morality, logic and governing elements of reward and punishment . Morality is derived from human nature and understanding of instincts, logic is mental component that shapes and regulates its application. means the system of reward and punishment that makes people do what they should and stops them from doing what they should not, it is physical projection of “ ”.
</pre>
<p>For stability, continued existence and efficient functioning of the system, everyone should perform its role well its duty towards system. The efficiency and stability of the system, that are interdependent anyway, is directly proportional to the degree of element of “ ” in the system. The concept is an intricate one and is not to be viewed as a mere system of reward and punishment. It can be understood as an element that keeps people in their duty. In less organized societies the punishment side predominates. In more organized societies the reward side predominates.</p>
<p>Morality and social consciousness, as an internal factor, keeps people in their duty, but when morality and the conscious of the people are not enough to stop them from compromising their duty towards society and harming the society as a whole, it is , the physical projection of “ ”, as an external factor, keeps them in their duty.</p>
<p>Society is an aggregate of continuum of all kind of possibilities of human being. There will always be those, whose altruism, consciousness or morality will make them sacrifice even their own gains in favor of others, i.e. society or the system. Then there are those who simply follow the system and habitually remain in their duty. And there will be those whose sense of morality is corrupt or distorted enough or understanding faulty enough to make them deviate from their duty to the extant of compromising the society or the system. Society has to exist to handle all kind of possibilities. The existence of such individuals must be accepted, who will compromise the collective gain in favor of their own petty gain whenever they can.</p>
<p>System must have a property or mechanism to reward those that ready to sacrifice in the line of duty and check those who deviate from their duty. In the absence of “ ” opposite happens and system deteriorates and everyone suffers.</p>
<pre>
is not to be taken crudely or in literal sense since  is not what makes the system exist, nor it is the system, nor does it increases the efficiency of the system. It's an existential necessity of the system in order to render justice or  in the physical world.
