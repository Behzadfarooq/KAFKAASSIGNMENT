<p>Your help and common sense is needed. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelisi_9a88.html" title="User:Kelisi">User:Kelisi</a>, has been producing some maps and trying to replace the CIA maps for several Caribbean and South American countries. In my opinion these new maps (which have more detail than the CIA maps) are vastly inferior. They use garish colours, terrible decorative fonts, use a horribly large pixel size and are generally ugly and crowded, and look terribly amateurish and like they were produced on a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> or something. Here is a list of maps he has produced . <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&amp;target=Kelisi&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=6" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&amp;target=Kelisi&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=6" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&amp;target=Kelisi&amp;hideminor=0&amp;namespace=6</a>.

<ul>
<li>I am contacting people who previously helped to vote to delete a generally objectionable photograph by a vote of 88 to 21, and who might be unaware that immediately after that image was voted to be deleted someone posted <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html#Autofellatio_2" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">another which was very similar in content.</a> My objections to this, and the previous image that was voted to be deleted might be based upon reasons far different from any that you have, but I <b>do</b> object to it, and consider the posting of such images to be acts of asinine stupidity, which burdens the project and its major educational aims in ways that they should not be burdened, and can be extremely detrimental to the acceptance and growth of WIkipedia's use and influence. Thus far those who I believe to be in the extreme minority of Wikipedians who would like to include these images, many who have been channeled to the voting page from the article with which it is associated have dominated the voting, 23 to 12 (as of the time that I composed this message). I would like to be somewhat instrumental in shedding a bit more light upon the issue, and if possible, helping to turn the tide against its inclusion. It might also be necessary to begin making an effort to establish an explicit Wikipedia policy against explicite photographic depictions of humans engaged in erotic, auto-erotic, or quasi-erotic activities. To my limited knowledge such images have <i>not</i> been accepted as appropriate <i>anywhere</i> else within this project, and frankly I can agree with those who are casually labeled <i>prudes</i> for opposing their inclusion, that they should <i>not</i> be. <b>Vitally important information that might be unwelcome by some is one thing that should never be deleted, but <i>un-needed</i> images that can eventually prevent or impede many thousands or millions of people from gaining access to the great mass of truly important information that Wikipedia provides is <i>quite</i> another matter.</b> There are vitally important distinctions to be made. Whatever your reasons, or final decisions upon the matter, I am appealing for more input on the voting that is occurring at <b><a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html#Autofellatio_2" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion</a></b>. ~ <a href="../../../a/c/h/User%7EAchilles_a41f.html" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> <a href="../../../a/c/h/User_talk%7EAchilles_ced4.html" title="User talk:Achilles">†</a> 21:39, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>Speaking of which, I noticed your comments. The vandalism issues should be greatly resolved (on all wikis) because of the recent bugfix that disables image redirects. (See <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimeheadnyc_Sandbox_9829.html" title="User:Limeheadnyc/Sandbox">my sandbox</a> for a demonstration, or lack thereof&#160;:).

<p>There is a disagreement over the form of template to be used for popes. One user designed what I think was an extremely clean, visually attractive layout. One or two others replaced it with the standard and IMHO decidedly inferior version. IMHO we should be using the new version as a replacement standard, not using the inferior standard as the one to use.

<p>Yes, my reasoning in reverting was that while the anon was correct, the point is a technical and a very temporary one.

<p>Hey there, I randomly came across your page while looking through recent changes (I think you had just edited <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>) and noticed that you worked for British rail through privatization. I'm a transportation reporter here across the pond, one of the things I focus on is rail -- Amtrak etc -- and I'd love to pick your brain sometime about what you thought about privatization and how it's worked out there. It'd be nice to be able to get a real view of the way things worked out there from someone who isn't a politician with an axe to grind. Nothing official-like, just interested to chat between rail wonks. Drop me a note or email sometime (katefan0 at gmail dot com). · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 21:56, Apr 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thought you might be interested to know there's a few notes on the issue of Scottish legal tender on <a href="../../../p/o/u/Talk%7EPound_sterling_c970.html" title="Talk:Pound sterling">Talk:Pound sterling</a> now; you seem to be right about pennies being legal up to 20p, according to the best legal reference I could dig up at short notice. (I'll try and chase up the actual references sometime in the next couple of weeks, and finally have something solid to rely on). Since it's possible SPICe was right after all, as the reference is a bit old, I've switched to an example using silver rather than pennies for the "up to X amount" note.</p>
<p>But, dear God, it's convoluted. There's the intriguing footnote that Bank of England notes are legal tender in Scotland - it just happens that they don't issue any in the right <i>denominations</i> to be legal tender... there seems to be some phobia of solid rules on this topic. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimgray_a1bc.html" title="User:Shimgray">Shimgray</a> 01:57, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Salaam</p>
<p>I am having trouble with several of the administrators who have been deleting my article about my country (Winkaland). They are calling it "Patent Nonsense" and saying that I am schizophrenic. My article does not violate the policy which I read about Patent Nonsense. It is clear, lucid and I truly believe it would make sense to a person reading it. Obviously it discusses a country and it's monarch. I haven't even had time to address the delicate political situation with Iran and Armenia because they keep destroying my article! I admit there are very few articles on the internet about my country but that is because it is very remote and very poor and Iran and Armenia are do not recognize it (but the parthians did) so they are saying that because I do not have any evidence so it doesn't exist so I am schizophrenic. The policy I read said that there is some sort of tribunal to decide but the admin is very hostile and I became angry and their antagonizing and so we are not on good terms so I don't think I will be given a fair opportunity to challenge their application of the policy. Please help me any way you can if you have time. - Also one of their gang made some sexist demeaning remarks calling me "cute" - this was in response to my posting of a "nonsense" on his user talk page because of his arbitrary posting on mine and deletion of my challenge on the discussion page - but I was very insulted and asked for an apology and none was recieved, if you could do anything to help I would very much appreciate it. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I noticed you'd been working on Man United-related pages and could do with your opinion on something.</p>
<p>The history section was split out of the page last year (I think) but someone then wrote another history section in the main page. Both pages are now well over the recommended maximum size for a Wikipedia article, and it's getting to the stage where I suspect people are editing them without reading them all the way through (which would explain why the Glazer takeover is mentioned twice in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_0c9f.html" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a>, in roughly the same amount of detail each time.</p>
<p>So, my idea is to create new pages for different eras in United's history, merge the relevant bits of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Ferguson_31d9.html" title="Alex Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Manchester_United_2790.html" title="History of Manchester United">History of Manchester United</a> and the History section of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_0c9f.html" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a> into each new page and put summaries of each new page on Manchester United, with comments asking people not to make the summaries too long. The new articles would have titles like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manchester United pre-1945</li>
<li>Manchester United 1945-1968</li>
<li>Manchester United 1968-1986</li>
<li>Manchester United 1986-present</li>
</ul>
<p>I think something like this is necessary to keep the pages manageable, but obviously don't want to make such big changes to other people's work without hearing what people think first. Please let me know what you think, at the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EManchester_United_F.C._9945.html" title="Talk:Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United talk page.</a></p>

<p>Your opinions are earnestly sought on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion#Template:Crowns|Template" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion#Template:Crowns|Template" rel="nofollow">for deletion:Crowns</a>. To put it simply, there were various lists on crowns and state symbols buried on files, hardly touched, and full of unwritten articles. I created a series of I'd say thirty articles on crowns, types of crowns, crown jewels etc, at considerable time and effort. I created a provisional template to link the articles together, which I planned, once I had all the information in place, to separate into a series of templates as there was too much information for one large one.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a>, who has been waging war on templates for ages (usually as a minority of one, through he usually forces his opinion on pages - such as his deletions of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Template%7ECommonwealth_Realms_639f.html" title="Template:Commonwealth Realms">Template:Commonwealth Realms</a> from articles on Commonwealth Realms - by wearing people down on the issue) nominated the template for deletion. While some users have praised the template for creating a workable themed group with a visual unity via the template, a couple of people are determined to delete the template and use their beloved, hideously ugly, lists, the same lists that had proved to be a dead end for all these articles before.</p>
<p>The antics of SimonP makes me wonder why bother doing any serious work here, when all one get is attempts by a small number of people to replace professionally laid out information by visually unattractive, frequently complicated and because of the ease of edits, perrennially inaccurate long lists. I would very much like to hear your views on the matter on the TfD page linked above. <font color="#006666"><b>Fear</b><font color="#FF6600"><i><b>ÉIREANN</b></i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/25px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Ireland.svg_cb65.html" /></a>\<font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl">(talk)</a></sup> <font color="black">21:40, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</font></font></font></font></p>

So for instance, <i>der Fuß</i> is correct but <i>der Fluß</i> is now incorrect (although still used as the reforms are of mixed popularity; the few major papers to officially switch over have - to the best of my knowledge - changed their minds).</font></font></font></font></p>

<p>Arwel,</p>

He has been mounting a stalking campaign against me (that is why he was banned.) I've been blocking his sockpuppets all right. He is bound to come back for the umpteenth time tonight. He is particularly targeting <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom_9ca6.html" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">George VI of the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Geldof_005d.html" title="Bob Geldof">Bob Geldof</a> and some other articles because I edited them lately. I'm going to protect the above two but he is bound to try other royal articles now.</p>

<dd>Pretty sure; All the users edits were duplications of material, in between other forms of vandalism. An incomplete survey gave me the impression that that user was the sole cause of the duplication (he did it again after it was fixed). <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThue_a090.html" title="User:Thue">Thue</a> | <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThue_d7b8.html" title="User talk:Thue">talk</a> 15:35, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
