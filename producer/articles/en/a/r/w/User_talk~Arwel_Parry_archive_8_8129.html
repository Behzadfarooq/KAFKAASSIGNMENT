<dd>It's only been open for 4 days. Canada Day and Independence Day holiday weekend in Canada and USA, so I'd be inclined to give it a few more days just in case anyone else wants to join in. As it stands, with three deletes and two keeps (and one anon IP on its only contribution to Wikipedia), yes, I'd say non-consensus keep.

<p>If you head over to the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alessandro_Del_Piero_51ec.html" title="Alessandro Del Piero">Alessandro Del Piero</a> page and take a quick read you'll notice that it sounds like a paper written for an 8th grade english class on someones hero. I've listed some things on the talk page that I believe need to be cleaned up (note that it is in no way a complete list). I'm unfamiliar with the clean-up and NPOV tags and which to use in what situation. Could you guide me a little bit here and list the page for clean up and tag it that its not NPOV and then let me know where you do stuff like that so in the future i'll be able to do it. I appreciate any help you are able to give. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 01:33, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, it is a bit hagiographic, isn't it? I've put a cleanup template "{{cleanup-date|2006-07-06}}" on the page, and I note you've already listed many of its deficiencies on the talk page, which is very useful. I've not put the NPOV message up, since I think that should be covered by the cleanup, but if you want to put it in, it's either {{NPOV}} or {{POV}} (they both point to the same template). By the way, I'll be offline until sometime next week after today, just in case you leave me any more messages! -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 11:15, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I notice that you seem to be one of the "keepers" of the current events in sports article. I noticed that the July article still had several "current" references and so I took an attempt to clean it up to make it look like June. If you have a chance, can you please take a look and make sure that I did it correctly?

<p>Since GoldToeMarionette was strictly following Wikipedia Policy, there should not have been a Check User completed by Jayjg. Hall Monitor only blocked the account because it was labeled as a sockpuppet by Jayjg's completed Check User. Absent policy violation it should not have been processed in RFCU or been blocked. I am asking for your help to confirm that policy was not violated, administrative action should not have been taken, and request that the administrative action be reversed by unblocking GoldToeMarionette and unprotecting the talk page.

<dd>Thank you. You appear to have shared an AOL IP address XXX.XX.XX.X which was banned for 31 hours yesterday for vandalising the page of a Brazilian football club - this is the 12th time since March that this particular IP address has been blocked. The block has been lifted, but for information if this happens again, if you log out and log in again AOL will probably allocate you another IP address. AOL now provides Wikipedia with the true IP addresses of many, but not all, of their customers, so this sort of collateral damage should become less common in the future. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 15:02, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

I don't believe it meets the "international interest" criteria; how a car crash victim progresses in hospital isn't notable enough - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">we aren't an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, after all. – <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChacor_c07b.html" title="User:Chacor">Ch</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChacor_1f31.html" title="User talk:Chacor">acor</a> 12:52, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While the progress of a car accident victim is not inherently newsworthy, the wide distribution of <i><a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Gear_4d67.html" title="Top Gear">Top Gear</a></i> worldwide (est. audience 350 million, apparently) makes it likely that there <i>is</i> considerable interest in Richard Hammond's condition.

<dd>Cheers for the reply. I still don't know. I myself do watch the show on BBC World on occasion, but it really seems to me a bit too much to be following the day-by-day progress of someone who was stupid enough to be driving at 480 km/h.

<p>It isnt going to be a day by day progress report. It just happens that Thursday was when a major incident happened and today is a follow up. (Borisjohns 13:20, 22 September 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Hi Arwel, I'm redesigning the main page at cy-wikisource (<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/cy:Hafan" class="extiw" title="s:cy:Hafan">s:cy:Hafan</a>) and I want to say "Our newest texts". I've written "Ein testunau ni newydda", but I'm not sure it's right. Is it "Ein testunau newydda ni"? Is it something different altogether? Thanks! <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 19:18, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Gosh I'm rusty! "newydda" sounds very informal, I think you'd need at least an apostrophe on the end. "Ni" at the end of the sentence, anyway. I don't think I've ever worked out comparatives for "newydd" before - possibly newydd, newyddaf, newyddach / new, newer, newest, but it just doesn't look right to me. I'd probably go more for somethng like "Ein testunau diweddarach ni", "our most recent articles". What do you think? -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 19:40, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I thought <i>-ach</i> was comparative (= -er) and <i>-af</i> (colloquial <i>-a</i>) was superlative. That's what my grammar books says, anyway, and what makes sense etymologically (<i>-af</i> is distantly related to the Latin <i>-imus</i> ending of the superlative). So it would be "Ein testunau diweddaraf ni", wouldn't it? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 19:47, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Please explain why you consider removing UK Gov. Copyright images, vandalism - when they are embedded in some cases in info-boxes that resist changing labels? Also the main image had a selectively quoted rational that neglected to show that <i>each</i> use of the copied image requires a fee to be paid. Are you willing to pay the fee to the UK Government? Also the image was used wrongly to illustrate articles of royal persons who have there own (copyright) coats of arms - so you seem to uphold effectively calling all these people the King or Queen of the UK, etc. - and I do not see how that can be justified. You seem quite interested in carving out a police state for yourself by intimidation, and merely using “guarding” wiki from vandalism to hide real infringements of civil liberties and misinformation that undermines Wiki credibility. <a href="../../../t/a/u/User%7ETauex_a315.html" title="User:Tauex">Tauex</a> 11:51, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You realize I wasn't the one who changed that info. Therefore I'm not the only one who is thinking that it is wrong. Therefore citing a source wouldn't be a bad idea. I may not know the english law that you're referring to, but I do know that, acording to FIFA and UEFA, the four British nations are considered different countries. That's why Celtic FC and Manchester United played in the Group Stage of this season's Champions League. According to FIFA Rules and Regulations, a player is only eligible to play for a country if he is born in that country, if any of his parents of grandparents or if he meets the residency requirements. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 20:55, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for <a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKralizec%21_c54e.html#Date_wikilinks" title="User talk:Kralizec!">your message</a> regarding date links in <a href="../../../s/m/s/SMS_Ostfriesland_8e26.html" title="SMS Ostfriesland">SMS Ostfriesland</a>. Perhaps I am mistaken, but I was under the impression that no <i>official policy</i> exists on date linking. While the <i>guideline</i> at <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSNUM_3545.html" title="WP:MOSNUM">WP:MOSNUM</a> indicates that "the date should almost always be linked to allow readers’ date preferences to work," the <i>guideline</i> at <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONTEXT_5f0d.html" title="WP:CONTEXT">WP:CONTEXT</a> states that editors should not create the "same link multiple times, because redundant links clutter up the page and make future maintenance harder." In the absence of an official policy, and as these two guidelines appear to contradict each other, I generally try to use the ‘link only to important dates’ rule of thumb. Reviewing the <i>Ostfriesland</i> article, I agree that I was overly stingy and removed far too many date links, breaking even my own rule of thumb. Thanks for fixing those. However I feel that you linked too many dates. As an example, does a 562 word article really need four links to <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>? Thank you for your assistance in helping me to understand this complicated issue. --<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKralizec%21_e8c2.html" title="User:Kralizec!">Kralizec!</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKralizec%21_c54e.html" title="User talk:Kralizec!">talk</a>) 01:50, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. Regarding 4 links to "1920" in a 560-odd word article, yes, the links are needed when it forms part of the date, as it is needed to satisfy the user preferences of people who have selected ISO format dates as their display preference, e.g. 1920-11-05. I was involved in the original debate in 2003 which led to the creation of user date preferences, as there were huge edit wars between people who used "European format" and "American format" dates and viewed the other as the work of the devil; it has always been the intention that ALL dates must be wikilinked in order for preferences to work, where "date" means a combination of day and month, or day and month and year, but not necessarily "standalone" years which have indeed tended to be delinked in the last year when there was no particular reason to link to them.

<dl>
<dd>It's a guideline, but a guideline which has stood for over three years now and I think it's fair to say that removal of date wikilinks is extremely likely to be reverted. I note that in the talk page for the MoS there's one participant who's opposed to linking dates, but he appears to be very much in the minority. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 00:33, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
