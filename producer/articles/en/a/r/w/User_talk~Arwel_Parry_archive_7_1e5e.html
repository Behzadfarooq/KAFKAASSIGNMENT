<p>Hey, this is in reference to the pic query on the liverpool fc talk page. Ok, so if one can't get copyright free pics, then the only thing to be done is to mail the sites for permission, right? and if that doesnt bring forth a response, then....? Just a thought..if u see a suitable pic on a page, save it on your comp and edit it using photoshop or something, then it won't be EXACTLY the same as the original, will it? In which case, can it be uploaded? Sneaky, i know... <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinda_crazy_3614.html" title="User:Kinda crazy">Kinda crazy</a> 15:36, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Arwel Parry. An article you have written, entitled <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_presidential_election%2C_2004.html" title="Ukrainian presidential election, 2004">Ukrainian presidential election, 2004</a> is believed to contain some information on a man named <a href="../../../m/y/k/Mykola_Rohozhynskyy_aa13.html" title="Mykola Rohozhynskyy">Mykola Rohozhynskyy</a>. An article has been written about this man, but the information is unverified. The man is listed on Preliminary Votes. If you could send us some sources on this man, we would be happy to check them against the article. I have questioned the writer of this article, <a href="../../../k/p/a/User%7EKpalion_93cc.html" title="User:Kpalion">User:Kpalion</a>, who led me to you. I have looked over this article and have found only his name, nomination, etc. Have a nice day. Or night. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreemaster4_4c4e.html" title="User:Treemaster4">User:Treemaster4</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I only wrote the initial version of that article, before things got complicated with reballots and the revolution! This candidates' name was originally spelled "Mykola Rogozhynsky" rather than in the Ukrainian transliteration, and the details were obtained from a site in Ukraine which I can't find now. It's annoying how Wikipedia's popularity means its contents get copied all over the web so that it's extremely difficult to find other sources after a couple of years. The original site I used doesn't appear to be still online, so I'm at a loss as to how to verify the information! -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 00:52, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Arwel--why did you delete Bert Convy from the list. It took me so much time because I had trouble with the columns and the parameters (as I explained to "Durova").</p>
<p>There was no vandalism or falsehood. You reverted back to the previous user (before me) without even looking at what I had done. All I did was add one name, of a person who qualifies on that list. I plan to add more. I hope I won't have the same problems as I did before, but I had to make all those revisions to get the spaces and columns and parameters right.</p>

<dd>Sorry, we all make mistakes, however multiple (18 in your case) edits to an article in a short period of time (55 minutes) from an anonymous user is highly suggestive of vandal behaviour, and when we're combating vandalism at the rate which always occurs around midnight - 4 a.m. UTC we don't always have time to check everything. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 12:19, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello there. I was wondering if you would have a look at the Crewe page and just look over my contribution to the Trivia section, namely the Bedford Street Information. If you have any spare time, could you rustle up a photograph of the street as I want to create an article about it. Namely referring to it's history, current state and possible future. I feel this article is worthy of creation due to the history of the street (it's ties with the railway works &amp; WW2 bombings) and it's current condition (featuring practically every type of house). Cheers! - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaft121_b770.html" title="User:Shaft121">Shaft121</a> 09:53, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh, I hadn't noticed that there are so many different types of house on that street, now they've built on the old Bedford St School. Unfortunately I've no digital camera, so can't provide any handy photos until I get a better paying job (or an inheritance...). Might be worth noting that people tried to get a bus route along the street back in the 1990s, but too much parking on both sides meant they couldn't get a bus through! -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 22:00, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes I've made note of that from my mother who lives on the street. One of the stops was actually outside number 25 (I think) which is near to her house. The new houses on the street consist of flats, your average two up two down new-build as well as three storey houses. I just needed the bungalow fact checking. I'm pretty sure there is at least one but I'm not sure if it is a business or residential property. Thanks for your help though. If you do have other contacts in Crewe, could you get them onto it? I would appreciate it seeing as you are the only other person from Crewe I have seen on here&#160;:) - <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaft121_b770.html" title="User:Shaft121">Shaft121</a> 22:51, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arwel Parry, its simple. If I edit something in an article or create an article, its contents are ALWAYS validated by one sourse or fans. And for your info, the reports of Chris's leaving Doctor Who were not released until the first episode aired in England.</p>
<p>I'll say it again, NEVER delete something I put in an article. You forget that THE MEMBERS of wikipedia make this Encylopedia, NOT THE ADMINS.</p>
<p>Our job is to create the articles and to correct them if they are wrong. You lost that right, when you agreed to become an admin. YOUR JOB is to make sure they are not vandalized. End of story.</p>
<p>And if any other admin reading this has a problem with my views, so be it. But the members in general are getting tired of you guys doing something to our work without telling us. Other members its fine, we have a code of honor. Admins its not fine cause you all think wikipedia belongs to you, it doesn't. It belongs to US, THE MEMBERS, NOT THE ADMINS.</p>

In the case of my reversion, firstly, please note that I did not use <b>any</b> Admin functions to remove your edit, I made the same sort of edit as any other Wikipedia user can. Secondly, saying "Many US fans of Doctor Who believe..." is inherently unverifiable and should be removed - how many is "many"? Thirdly, one of my cousins has been involved in the Welsh television industry for nearly forty years, latterly owning her own production company - I dare say that she is <i>much</i> better informed about what went on at BBC Wales than you are. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 12:20, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't care if your cousin is Prime Minister Tony Blair himself. For all you know, I may have someone on the inside that actually WORKS on the show.

<dd>It's not <i>my</i> responsibility to produce verifiable information about what <i>you</i> are trying to put in an article - that's for you to produce. "For all I know..." about you - precisely, I know damn all about you because you have totally failed to provide any information about yourself whatsoever on your user page, and could be anyone from a high-school fan to Walter Cronkite (though I suspect you are nearer the former); I will not give much more weight to the opinions of a "red link" user than I would to an anonymous IP address. Why should I defend myself against your claimed experience? You say you write for a living, but from the experience of what you have written on various peoples' and articles' talk pages in the last 24 hours you seem to specialise in producing words which do not exist in the English language, e.g. "<i>creditbility</i>" and "<i>sourse</i>", and to be unable to produce a coherent argument beyond "don't touch what I have written because I am always right" — nobody, not even the Pope these days, claims to be infallible and I point out the notice which appears below the edit box every time you edit: <b>"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it"</b>. If you are unable to follow the rules of Wikipedia, including <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civilty</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a>, then I suggest that Wikipedia is not the place for you. As to who my cousin is, since she's not agreed to be dragged into a Wikipedia argument then I'll not name her, but she certainly exists and has been producing programmes for Welsh TV since the 1970s, and the company is still active in the Welsh "<i>fflic</i>s" even though it was recently bought out by another group. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 20:13, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In other words, her company was on the verge of being bankrupt, and she had to sell to save her arse. Good, then I don't have to worry about writing her arse to see if you're telling the truth.

<p>Arwel - I appreciate how frustrating dealing with this guy has been and kudos to you for trying to work things out with him. I'm affraid, however, that your frustration has gotten the better of you in your most recent post. Please don't call another user an "idiot" no matter how much an idiot you think he/she is.

<p>Why did you reverted infomation about geographical name of Czech Republic - Czechia? --Exekutor 21:46, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>a) Because Wikipedia policy is to use the common name used by English-speakers. The question of "Czech Republic" or "Czechia" has been argued <i>ad nauseam</i> on <a href="../../../c/z/e/Talk%7ECzech_Republic_f8a8.html" title="Talk:Czech Republic">Talk:Czech Republic</a> for nearly two years. The term "Czechia" is almost unknown by English speakers and is virtually never used by them, it is <i>never</i> used in English-language newspapers (I just looked on the front page of the Prague Post website to check that even English-language newspapers published in the country do not use "Czechia"). One part of the previous discussion on <a href="../../../c/z/e/Talk%7ECzech_Republic_f8a8.html" title="Talk:Czech Republic">Talk:Czech Republic</a> states that Google finds 170 references to "Czech Republic" for every occurrence of "Czechia". The fact that the Czech and German languages use short forms of the country's name is not relevant to practice in the English language.</dd>
<dd>b) The actual change which had been made was ugly, and simply changed "Czech Republic" to "Czechia", leaving the opening sentence ungrammatical "The Czechia...". -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 22:28, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's OK.

Google test is not lie detector. It think, term Česko (Czechia) would be noticed in the first sentence.--Exekutor 00:51, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but the problem is that both the references you have given are in the Czech language, where "Česko" is now an accepted term. The English language Wikipedia uses the standards of the English language, where "Czechia" has <i>not</i> found favour with the overwhelming majority of English speakers. Wikipedia is a secondary source, not a primary source – that is, we can not use "Czechia" until it is commonly used by other users of the English language, in speech, in broadcasts, and in publications. Wikipedia is not a proponent of new usages. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 01:28, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I have created a template in an attempt to standardise the articles about the various ITV stations. I thought they were beginning to look quite messy with a couple of logos at the top as thumbs.</p>
<p>Before I add teh template to all of the articles, would you mind taking a look at them and see what I might have missed, or what could be better? I've added them to <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyne_Tees_Television_e547.html" title="Tyne Tees Television">Tyne Tees</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granada_Television_60a4.html" title="Granada Television">Granada</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_South_34c1.html" title="Television South">TVS</a>.

<dd>And...? Sorry, but spamming a few dozen administrators' talk pages with a totally unexplained reference is no way to try to resolve your problem. Explain what is the matter and what you want done about it. Having looked at that talk page, it appears to be a total mess which is largely incomprehensible – not written to a minimal standard of the English language – and I have no intention of getting involved in it. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 10:55, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is an editor who is blocking me b/c he claims I am a sockpuppet. If you look at the Tim Pat Coogan page (and discussion page), you will see that he is engaging in blatant censorship in blocking my edits to the wikipage and my edits to the Discussion Page as well. What is he afraid of?</p>
<p>My Coogan edits are cited and sourced, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would look into this matter. Demiurge engages routinely in censorship and only is stopped when he is caught red-handed by other Wikipedians on articles as diverse as Ante Pavelic, pre-Code (re movie censorship!!), Eamon de Valera, Tim Pat Coogan (see above) and many others.</p>
<p>This wannabe censor is going to wannabe an administrator someday (pbly soon)--don't you think it is important to know if he is a censor/apologist on his "pet" issues before he is allowed to become an administrator. Do you want a self-appointed censor or apologist for the Catholic Church to become a Wikipedia Administrator??</p>
<p>Just review his edits, and those he made to the Coogan wikipage and Discussion Pages.</p>

<p>Hello Arwel Parry/archive 7 –</p>
<p>I'm trying to get some discussion going on two proposals regarding the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> page, but so far have gotten little to no response. Since you have recently edited the current events page, I'm asking for your input on these two proposals:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>One proposal (this is the big one) involves putting the daily events from the current events pages into article-templates, a lá the monthly pages from 2003 to 2005, as well and having a consistent number of recent days on the current events page instead of a monthly archive. This would allow for the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">current events</a> page and the respective month pages to be updated simultaneously without the monthly archival. For more, see <a href="../../../c/u/r/Talk%7ECurrent_events_efc4.html#Another_Proposal:_Overhaul_of_the_Current_events_page" title="Talk:Current events">the current events talk page</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Another proposal involves merging the content of the regional current events pages (such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_and_Irish_current_events_2230.html" title="British and Irish current events">British and Irish current events</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_current_events.html" title="Canadian current events">Canadian current events</a>) into fewer continental articles.

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your input on one or both of these issues would be appreciated. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 22:15, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
