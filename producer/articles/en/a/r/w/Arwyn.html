<p><b>Arwyn</b> is a fictional character, the chief protagonist in <a href="../../../c/r/o/CrossGen_6668.html" title="CrossGen">CrossGen</a> Comics' now defunct comic book series <a href="../../../s/o/j/Sojourn_%28comics%29.html" title="Sojourn (comics)">Sojourn</a>. Not quite a superhero in the traditional sense, she doesn't wear tights or a cape, but wields a very powerful <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altwaals_Weapons_34e1.html" title="Altwaals Weapons">magical bow</a>. The series lasted for thirty-five issues, including a prequel.</p>
<p>Her name is a variant of "<a href="../../../a/r/w/Arwen.html" title="Arwen">Arwen</a>".</p>
<p><a name="Character_Details" id="Character_Details"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/w/Arwyn.html" title="Edit section: Character Details">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character Details</span></h2>
<p>Arwyn is a gorgeous woman with shoulder-length blond hair. She likes to wear green and gold clothing but, because she is an <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archer.html" title="Archer">archer</a>, she wears little armor. She prefers not to fight close up though she can use a sword.</p>
<p>Arwyn was born in Gerrindor, a city of artisans in the kingdom of Middelyn in the world of Quin (also known as the Five Lands). She won a post in the Royal Archers, an elite force that protects the monarchy. There she was partnered with Darian, a man who would someday become her husband.</p>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>Arwyn and Darian were sent to Henredon. The city had been terrorized by some serial killing. At first it was just their livestock, but soon men were slaughtered. Desperate for assistance, the town elders sent a plea for help. In response, Arwyn and Darian were sent there to investigate. There, they tracked down and killed a pack of creatures called Dread Wolves, wolves of huge size and intelligence. The final battle left Darian nearly dead. As he recovered, the two fell in love.</p>
<p>They married and continued to work for the king of Middelyn. Only when Arwyn found she was pregnant did the couple move to Gerrindor, where Arwyn felt content to raise their child. She gave birth to a baby girl they named Neera.</p>
<p>When Neera was three months old, Darian surprised Arwyn with a dog, Kreeg, a guard dog to watch over their family. As a Royal Archer, Darian's duties would keep him away for days, sometimes weeks. Kreeg was Darian's way of watching over his wife and child.</p>
<p>For years, they lived in relative peace, until <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mordath.html" title="Mordath">Mordath</a>, a conqueror of the past, was impossibly resurrected. As he promised long ago upon his death, Mordath led the trolls and conquered all of the Five Lands. Gerrindor was the last to fall, an afterthought. Arwyn had been target practicing in the woods when she saw the smoke and rushed to her husband and daughter's side.</p>
<p>She was too late. She found them dead, slain in their home. Stunned, Arwyn was attacked by several trolls. She fought back, not for survival but for revenge. With Kreeg by her side, Arwyn succeeded in slaying the trolls. That day, she swore that she would kill Mordath.</p>
<p>She traveled to Mordath's fortress, snuck in and attempted to kill him. She failed. Mordath's resurrection had given him great power. He ordered Arwyn captured and imprisoned. She would be used as a symbol of the inevitable failure of all rebellion.</p>
<p>In Mordath's dungeon, Arwyn met <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gareth_%28Sojourn%29_18e6.html" title="Gareth (Sojourn)">Gareth</a>, a fellow prisoner. With his help, Arwyn managed to break free of the prison. She cared more about killing Mordath than surviving, but was nonetheless forced to run. As they were about to be overwhelmed by Mordath's trolls, a pale woman in a blue cloak appeared out of a light. The woman spoke, "I'm here for you", gestured and the three (including Kreeg) vanished.</p>
<p>They reappeared in the ruins of Orelyn, miles away from Mordath's fortress. The woman's name was <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danik.html" title="Danik">Neven</a> and she had chosen Arwyn to be the one to gather the fragments of Ayden's arrow in order to summon Ayden, the legendary hero who had slain Mordath three centuries ago. Arwyn was suspicious, wary of Neven. Even when Neven handed over Ayden's bow, choosing Arwyn as the wielder, Arwyn remained unconvinced.</p>
<p>However, the trolls had tracked them to the ruins. Once again forced to fight for their lives, Arwyn and Gareth fought the trolls. Ayden's bow turned out to possess amazing power, capable of turning arrows into mobile explosives. Once the pair escaped the trolls, Arwyn decided to turn her quest for vengeance into a quest for the five fragments of the arrow of Ayden.</p>
<p>Arwyn's quest took her across Middelyn. The first part of the arrow was found in the horde of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiara.html" title="Shiara">Shiara</a>. Although Shiara (a shape-changing <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon.html" title="Dragon">dragon</a> tried to kill them), they were able to make a deal with her. Shiara agreed to kill Mordeth in exchange for Ayden's bow, once Mordeth was dead. Unfortunately, Mordeth was stronger than the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Dragon_ba19.html" title="Red Dragon">Red Dragon</a> and Shiara died from her injuries, using the last of her strength to bring Arwyn and Gareth to safety.</p>
<p>The second piece was found within the sacred Ankharan sword known as the Dawn Sword. Arwyn had set aside her quest to help the Ankharan rebellion, discovering the fragment after winning a battle to retake the Ankharans largest city.</p>
<p>The third was worn as a necklace by the Urnethi Hive Queen, found with the aid of the thief(and Gareth's ex) Cassidy.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Ayden (the owner of Arwyn's magic bow) is in fact <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altwaal.html" title="Altwaal">Altwaal</a> in disguise.</p>

<p>Unlike the other CrossGen comics, the main character of Sojourn (Arwyn) is <b>not</b> a <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigil-Bearers_dcb6.html" title="Sigil-Bearers">Sigil-Bearer</a>. Instead, her sworn enemy, Mordath is the Sigil-Bearer on the world of Quin. On all the other worlds the Sigil-Bearer is the hero, but here, he is the villain. Sigil-Bearers are difficult but not impossible to kill.</p>
