<p>Nice to meet you, Arwel, and I hope you stay. There are several other Welsh people here, including me -- but I can't remember much about TWW. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 21:55 Feb 5, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>S'mae Deb! I remember "Tinker and Taylor" on TWW when I was a kid (though reception was terrible, we had a badly-sited mountain between us and the transmitter); my main memory of TWW was their coverage of the Aberfan disaster when I was 8&#160;:-( ... <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 03:10 Feb 6, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I just want to say that it's great work you're doing on <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> etc.. a gentle reminder though to use wiki markup, and follow the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">manual of style</a>.

<p>Thanks for the hints, and your updates to the ITV page. I think I'm starting to get the hang of this thing now, and I'm disambiguating some of the company names -- there are too many "ABC Television"s in the world! <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 03:10 Feb 6, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi again. The railway line articles you're writing look great.

<p>Hi, I was wondering what you thought about this:</p>
<p>The obverse of the coin depicts the Lord Protector <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> as a laureated Roman emperor, with the inscription <small>OLIVAR D G R P ANG SCO HIB &amp;c PRO</small>, while the reverse shows a crowned shield depicting the arms of the Commonwealth with the inscription <small>PAX QVAERITVR BELLO 1656</small>.</p>
<p>There's just something jarring about all-caps. &#160;:) I think I've seen it in this style in numismatic books, but I don't have one at hand to check. - <a href="../../../h/e/p/User%7EHephaestos_c32a.html" title="User:Hephaestos">Hephaestos</a></p>

<dd>Ah! That looks like a good idea&#160;:-) Looks neat. I've just altered all the coin descriptions I put in tonight. For now though, to quote Zebedee of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magic_Roundabout_1fab.html" title="The Magic Roundabout">The Magic Roundabout</a> it's <i>time for bed</i> as it's gone 2 a.m. here! -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 02:17 Mar 18, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're quite welcome on the 5 pence image; I intend to work on it more later. I'd like to have it look more "mint condition." I'm also working on the reverse of the Noble.</p>
<p>I should clue you in about my project. I've been grabbing images off of ebay. To avoid possible (though remote) copyright issues, and since I've been wanting to brush up on my Photoshop skills, I've been taking out the flaws in the coins in Photoshop before posting them here, thus making the image a derivative work (there's little doubt that the pattern itself is public domain).</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine, the Noble is a bit of a wreck after 600 years, which is why it's taking me longer. &#160;:) My main concern is that I don't add or erase anything I shouldn't. (This is a lot of why I asked the diameter question by the way, but I guess it doesn't really matter much, given that people run different screen resolutions.)</p>

<p>On your British currency pages you have been using the format <i>British coin [type]</i>. This strikes me as 'ugly'. A nicer, and more common fomat, is <i>[type] (British coin)</i>. Have you considered this? <a href="../../../t/w/o/User%7ETwoOneTwo_b3fe.html" title="User:TwoOneTwo">212</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm. Well actually, 212, I'm just continuing the naming format that was in use long before I discovered Wikipedia -- in fact I've just checked the change history and notice that this format was in use when you last edited this article in February of last year! Anyway, there's some discussion going on in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritish_coinage_0df3.html" title="Talk:British coinage">Talk:British coinage</a> about this, so there may be changes... -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 01:15 Mar 24, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow. Someone else on wiki who remembers the old money! As to article size, I think it is 32K. Anything larger than that and many browsers can't edit a page. If they try, they wipe out anything over 32K (which can be damned annoying if three and a half paragraphs just disappear. Size will of course be affected by using images that take up a lot of space. If necessary, break it up to pre and post date x. One the the largest pages I was involved in was the <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_potato_famine.html" title="Irish potato famine">Irish potato famine</a> and there we had to break it in two. Another large one I did (largely through to the number of images rather than text alone) was the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_Tiara_a10b.html" title="Papal Tiara">Papal Tiara</a> page. If the article is under 32K it should be fine. (You can check the size by doing a search (on the wiki system rather than this damned annoying google search we have to use at busy times) and it should say how many k an article is up to. I am looking forward to reading your article. God, I still remember the 6d, the thruppence, those massive pennies, etc. And getting a present of ten bob once. (I worked in a shop once and to annoy our accountant, a gang of us doing a till check converted the decimal money into pounds, shillings and pence. I can still remember his 'what the hell?' reaction when he asked what was in till two and someone shouted up £144, 10 shillings and sixpence. Even worse when someone turned the takings into guineas. The account laughed. The boss gave one of his 'pissed off' looks and the younger staff looked in bewilderment. 'Shillings? Guineas? Thruppence? What the fuck are they?' (And watch older customers look all nostalgic. PS - I believe Britain <i>already</i> has a mock-up ready of what British euro coins would look. A bit presumptive, I would think! <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">STÓD/ÉÍRE</a> 00:16 Apr 3, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ten bob? God, I thought I was doing very well if one of my relatives gave me a half-crown!&#160;:) I remember scaring myself once when I was about 10 that I didn't have enough money for the bus fare for the 4 miles home - the fare was 1/6 and I only had one coin on me, which said <small>ONE</small>... I thought it was a shilling, but fortunately it said <small>FLORIN</small>! The penny article is now 30K long up to the end of Bloody Mary's reign, which seems a good point to break it temporarily... <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a></dd>

<p>Reading your articles on Japanese ships, I notice you using "IJN" as a prefix. I remember Epopt or somebody declaring this wrong, and my own printed reference works don't use it, although many (like Morison) don't use USS either, so the absence may not mean much.

<p>You're very welcome! Actually that one didn't take long to fix up, as the original was an uncirculated coin.

<p>I did a revert on the <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Paisley_879b.html" title="Ian Paisley">Ian Paisley</a> page. I don't know if the person who did the changes was being ultra cautious, ultra NPOV or was just a big fan of Paisley (I think the latter, given that they changed <i>bad</i> health to <i>good</i> health when it is patiently obvious to everyone that big Ian is physically failing. I changed everything back and left a note on the talk page explaining the changes and why they aren't POV but are factually accurate. (I know about Paisley's depression thanks to a medical doctor who treated Ian and inadvertently let it slip in a conversation about clinical depression versus bipolar depression.) I had heard rumours but discounted them as the usual unsubstantiated gossip. But he noted (as I had being a political anorak) Paisley's regular disappearances from public view and explained why (which obviously I am not going to repeat. Suffice to say that what he said suddenly explained something that had puzzled me about Ian and also explained the strange complexity of Ian's character; the out and out bigot who can make your skin crawl and the warm, affectionate, funny, utterly unbigoted man who had the SDLP's John Hume over for Boxing Day dinner - much to the astonishment of a journalist who picked the 'wrong' moment to visit Paisley about something and walked in on the Paisleys and the Humes eating christmas cake together and sharing cake recipes! Anyway thanks for letting me know about what was happening to the article.</p>
<p>BTW, if you get a chance, could you look at Republic of Ireland/temp to see if it is OK. In particular is the history bit too big and heavy or useful and explanatory.

<p>Hi, Arwel. There is a row brewing on the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> page. Put simply, we have an agreed template, structure and text. One user, Scipius, some months ago tried to muck up the page through ludicrous and factually inaccurate changes. (Last time it was to rename the R of I page <i>Ireland</i>, even though that infuriated Irish users, offended Northern Irish users and ignored the approach we had which was to keep <i>Ireland</i> for events before partition, and after that to keep it largely for all-island issues - culture, heritage, etc) In the end he was told to back off, that the consensus was against him. Now he is back, trying the same mucking around. This time he wants to dumb down the agreed template text to remove relevant contextual information he almost alone thinks irrelevant, change facts to his own inaccurate understanding of them, etc. (eg, remove factual information on the formal name of the state - or rewrite it in an inaccurate manner, remove important information that explains <i>where</i> the state came from (ie, partition, the Irish Free State, etc) which he wants confined to a history page, blur facts about the relationship between irish and english (his text implies equality. Officially however the former a <i>the national language</i>, the latter <i>a</i> secondary language, etc.) He tried to ignore the consensus last time. He now wants to pull the same stunt again and highjack the page to introduce his own factually inaccurate version again. If you could visit the page and join in the chorus of telling him to stop messing the article it would be most appreciated. It took a lot of effort the last time (from a lot of Irish people who were furious at what he was trying to do!) to stop him. Every bit of help in stopping this nonsense before it becomes a full scale edit war a second time would be most appreciated. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 03:31 10 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arwel, I have been checking through current RN ship articles, after finding that a large part of the HMS <i>Sceptre</i> article was lifted straight from the RN website. I notice that you have done something similar with the article on HMS <i>Glasgow</i>. The RN website is under <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Copyright_1d49.html" title="Crown Copyright">Crown Copyright</a>, and so it is not public domain.

<p>I tried with Eloquence but for some reason which I find baffling he won't accept what he we say and intends changing dates around to mm/dd/yy. Whenever I catch him doing it I will simply revert as often as it takes. But I really do not understand his attitude. The fact that this agreement was reached is widely known but as it was never written into the manual of style he insists it didn't happen. Eloquence is normally a superb contributor so why he is so determined to ignore everyone and bulldoze his viewpoint through. I have asked Mav and John Owens to have a word with him but he seems determined. I wish I knew why. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 22:51 21 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>May I ask why you did not convert <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crewe_Alexandra_F.C._cf8f.html" title="Crewe Alexandra F.C.">Crewe Alexandra F.C.</a> to the British format? See, this is what I am talking about: A mess of stylistic inconsistency on different pages. This is absolutely unprofessional.

<dd>I presume you are talking about the one occurrence in that article where a particular day is mentioned? Because I was not looking for any dates to amend -- I was correcting a particularly glaring error in the year that the current manager was appointed, and a spelling error I had introduced. That date has been in the article for as long as the history goes back, when it really was the standard format. However, thank you for bringing the error to my attention. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 01:06 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

Eloquence has suggested as a compromise, that he could tolerate British english if non-Americans agreed to use American mm/dd/yy dating. I delivered a rather long and sharp attack on his arguments on the above page. I'd love to hear your views on it. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 12:03 22 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

I'm not sure his talk page is the best place for either it though so you might want to find an article talk page to put it on instead. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 23:39, Oct 26, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

"<i>OTOH if each article has to be nearly doubled in size to fully describe both the historical and current counties of the same name that's going to be a hell of a job...</i>" - There is surely a simple solution to this, and one I have suggested before: For each county, have two pages - County (historic) and County (administrative). Clearly state which one is being delt with at the top of each page, and all confusion is avoided. It also solves the problem of places like manchester, birmingham, bournemouth etc. by allowing it to say (for example) "Bournemouth is in the historic County of Hampshire (historic) and was in the administrative county of Dorset (administrative) until becoming an UAA". Similarly: "Huntingdon is the historic county of Huntingdonshire (historic) and the administraitive county of Cambridgeshire (administrative). The fact that there can be two pages means that referal will not be confusing - i.e. a town stated as being in historic cambridgeshire won't be refered to the page about administrative cambridgeshire, and vice versa. Of course, some will also require County (lieutenency area) since this is sometimes different from both administrative and historic boundaries. However, all in all, I think adopting this would make matters much more clear. Would you agree? <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 00:28, 27 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.s. Another benefit - articles on historical figures may well say "<i>Joe Soap</i> was born in 1887 in <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridgeshire.html" title="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a>"; however, as it stands, this redirect would be to <i>administrative</i> cambridgeshire, which would not be correct due to later boundary changes. If my proposal were adopted, this would be avoided by writing "<i>Joe Soap</i> was born in 1887 in Cambridgeshire". <a href="../../../8/0/2E/User%7E80.255.html" title="User:80.255">80.255</a> 00:32, 27 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't blame me, I just work here.&#160;;) I do like the way certain people have rephrased the 1911 brittanica in some articles because they considered it too modern for them. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorwen_cc7a.html" title="User:Morwen">Morwen</a> 12:29, 7 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>No problem. I deleted two pages he created as well. Unfortunately IP blocks only last 24 hours. I look forward to seeing the new interface at cy. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 11:26, Nov 8, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>To paraphrase Bob Dylan "silly ideas are everywhere , just reach out and grab one!" Hi Arwel, wow you are some numismatist, Sir T.B. was probably the first Brit/ Eng. numismatist ( see <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceni.html" title="Iceni">Iceniarticle</a>. (Unless of course you can tell me of earlier collectors) . I have some v. oldish coins ( 1790-1810) but cannot describe them accurately to you; always good to know of other UEA alumini on the wiki and a sysop now to boot, congrats!!<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorwikian_2eda.html" title="User:Norwikian">Norwikian</a> 16:16, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
