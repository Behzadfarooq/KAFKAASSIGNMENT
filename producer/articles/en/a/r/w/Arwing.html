The <i>Star Fox: Assault</i> Arwing.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game.html" title="Video game">video game</a> series <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fox_%28series%29_990e.html" title="Star Fox (series)"><i>Star Fox</i></a>, the <b>Arwing</b> is a fictional prototype <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerospace.html" title="Aerospace">aerospace</a> fighter craft, developed by Space Dynamics. Its name originates from that of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argonaut_Software_7e1c.html" title="Argonaut Software">Argonaut Software</a>, developer of the original <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fox_%28video_game%29_13da.html" title="Star Fox (video game)">Star Fox</a></i>.</p>
<p>The Arwing is a single-seat swing-wing fighter and is the most powerful fighter in the Cornerian Defense arsenal. The Arwing's most prominent feature is its Gravity Diffusion system, or G-Diffuser. The G-Diffuser serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acts as an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gravity.html" title="Anti-gravity">anti-gravity</a> system to enable maximum maneuverability in an atmosphere.</li>
<li>Powers the Arwing's shield system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Arwing is armed with one standard laser, though it is possible upgrade to twin lasers and then to hyper lasers or plasma cannons for greater firepower. Also, the lasers can be charged to increase their power further regardless of upgrades and then home in on targets once fired. The Arwing also carries Nova Bombs as secondary weaponry.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/w/Arwing.html" title="Edit section: Star Fox">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Star Fox</i></span></h3>
<p>The original Arwing, also called the "SFX Arwing" in the <i><a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Power_90d1.html" title="Nintendo Power">Nintendo Power</a></i> <i>Star Fox</i> comic series, was developed by the Cornerian Defense Engineering Department as the most sophisticated Star Fighter in the galaxy. As such, it is equipped with state-of-the-art weapons; the Primary Weapon is a laser cannon, secondary armaments include Nova Bombs. The Laser cannon comes in a single shot by default, and can be upgraded to Type-A Twin Lasers and upgraded again to Type-B Twin Plasma Blasters.</p>
<p>In Part 2 of the <i>Star Fox</i> comic, an updated version of the SFX Arwing is built and piloted by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_the_Star_Fox_series_e369.html#Fara_Phoenix" title="List of characters in the Star Fox series">Fara Phoenix</a>. The new model Arwing doesn't seem to be much of an update from the original four but it has better performance and maneuverability as well as being equipped with new systems. Equipped with Hyper Boosters that allow it to outspeed even the old model Arwing, the new model is first painted in a purple color scheme to signify that its new systems are still in testing. It's later painted in the standard white color scheme to signify that testing has finished and the Arwing and its pilot are now part of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fox_team_6431.html" title="Star Fox team">Star Fox team</a>.</p>

<p>The unreleased <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fox_2_67c9.html" title="Star Fox 2">Star Fox 2</a></i> features three different variations of the original Arwing: General-Purpose, Assault, and Interceptor. Each fighter has the ability to pick up a new secondary ability — for example, the Interceptor can pick up and use the Super Shield powerup. However, new abilities replace the old ones for the remainder of the game. Additionally, each Arwing has the ability to transform into a bipedal robot, allowing it to walk, jump, swim, and press buttons. Targeting is generally more accurate in this mode, and the ship retains its special abilities.</p>
<p>Essentially, the Arwings in this game are the most versatile, as they combine the functionality of the Arwing, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmaster_%28Star_Fox%29_6a97.html" title="Landmaster (Star Fox)">Landmaster</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Marine_%28Star_Fox%29_6e36.html" title="Blue Marine (Star Fox)">Blue-Marine</a> into one.</p>

<p>The Arwing introduced in <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fox_64_8e71.html" title="Star Fox 64">Star Fox 64</a></i> was an evolved design from the original version. However it had a basic design and was relatively small, it was not able to come to a complete stop in mid-air because it only had one very primitive G-Diffuser. This version could also handle temperatures up to 9000 degrees, as explained during the team's mission to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Fox_planets_and_locations_4c8b.html#Solar" title="List of Star Fox planets and locations">Solar</a>.</p>

<p>The Arwing featured in <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fox_Adventures_d421.html" title="Star Fox Adventures">Star Fox Adventures</a></i> is about the same as the <i>Star Fox 64</i> design.</p>

An Arwing from <i>Star Fox Adventures</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It had a more rounded fuselage and a small storage area so <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_the_Star_Fox_series_e369.html#Prince_Tricky" title="List of characters in the Star Fox series">Prince Tricky</a> can come along with <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_McCloud_1582.html" title="Fox McCloud">Fox McCloud</a> to help him on his quest. Due to a lack of funds, the Arwings in <i>Star Fox Adventures</i> - along with the <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Fox_3805.html" title="Great Fox">Great Fox</a></i> - have been falling into a state of disrepair. The Arwing's special cannons that allowed for homing attacks have broken off, and the wings are shabby and rusted. This version of the Arwing bears strong similarities to the <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-wing.html" title="X-wing">X-wing</a>, particularly the nose. <a name="Star_Fox:_Assault" id="Star_Fox:_Assault"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/w/Arwing.html" title="Edit section: Star Fox: Assault">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Star Fox: Assault</i></span></h3>
<p>The available Arwing introduced in <i><a href="../../../a/s/s/Star_Fox%7E_Assault_737f.html" title="Star Fox: Assault">Star Fox: Assault</a></i> bears much more resemblance to the original Arwing last seen in the original game. This Arwing has a more complex and symmetric, slicker design and was at least two times bigger than its predecessor. It is 45.76 feet long and 22.16 feet high.</p>
<p>It has touch pad controls and is able to come to a complete stop in mid-air thanks to its four G-Diffuser engines. It is also the first and thus far only Arwing version to have a wing walker riding along, allowing the pilot to engage targets to the front while the wing walker dealt with threats to the side or rear in a fashion reminiscent of a <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>-era ball turret gunner. Of course, the Arwing becomes less maneuverable while carrying a wing walker, unable to roll or make sharp turns to avoid causing the gunner to fall off.</p>

While Peppy continues to fly the <i>Assault</i> version of the Arwing, other prominent characters have new, unique fighters such as Slippy's Bullfrog, Falco's Sky Claw, and Krystal's CloudRunner, each with different statistics.</p>
<p>The Arwing's stats identical to the Arwing II's except the Arwing has twin lasers and has a 3 second time bonus rather than 2. However, the Arwing II's laser's can be upgraded in certain paths to twin or plasma, and in other paths it can obtain a Multi-lock.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/w/Arwing.html" title="Edit section: Nova Bombs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nova Bombs</span></h2>
<p>A <b>Nova Bomb</b> is a weapon on the Arwing. In later games in the series, they are simply called "Smart Bombs" (or just "Bombs").</p>
<p>Nova Bombs produce a large blast radius that is devastating to fighters and causes damage to stronger vehicles, such as fleet ships. To add to its effectiveness, the Nova Bomb is a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precision-guided_munition.html" title="Precision-guided munition">smart bomb</a> that can lock onto enemies and hit them directly. They are also referred to as smart bombs because they do not damage members of the <i>Star Fox</i> team. Nova Bombs can also be remotely detonated.</p>
<p>Throughout the series the weapon has been essential to defeat some enemies. The Sarumarine <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">submarine</a> on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Fox_planets_and_locations_4c8b.html#Zoness" title="List of Star Fox planets and locations">Zoness</a> in <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fox_64_8e71.html" title="Star Fox 64">Star Fox 64</a></i> could only have its cannons blown off with Nova Bombs. <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andross.html" title="Andross">Andross</a> in <i>Star Fox Adventures</i> could only have his weakness exposed by one. Andross's inhaling attack could also be stopped with a Nova Bomb.</p>

The Smart Bomb (Nova Bomb) in <i>Star Fox: Assault</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The maximum number of Nova Bombs that can be carried by the Arwing has varied throughout the series. In <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fox_%28video_game%29_13da.html" title="Star Fox (video game)">Star Fox</a></i>, the player started with three but could carry a maximum of five. This remained true in <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fox_2_67c9.html" title="Star Fox 2">Star Fox 2</a></i>, although the Nova Bomb could be replaced with a stronger shield or a shield recharger. In <i>Star Fox 64</i>, the Arwing also started with three but could carry a maximum of nine. In <i>Star Fox Adventures</i>, the Arwing could only carry three and the player started without any. In <i>Star Fox: Assault</i>, the player again started without any bombs. The maximum number is nine. In <i>Star Fox Command</i>, the Arwing only carries two bombs, while other ships carry one to three.</p>
<p>In <i>Star Fox: Assault</i>, a variation of the Nova Bomb called a Cluster Bomb (also called "C-bombs" due to the large C) is unlockable for use in multiplayer matches. Rather than one large explosion, the cluster bomb gives off several grenades, giving out several small explosions, similar to fire burst pods.</p>
<p>In <i>Star Fox Command</i>, players can choose precisely where the Bomb will detonate by using the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_DS_b235.html" title="Nintendo DS">DS</a> <a href="../../../s/t/y/Stylus.html" title="Stylus">stylus</a> to drag and drop a bomb icon onto the radar screen. A Bomb will then be fired and explode when it reaches that position.</p>
<p>The vehicles capable of carrying Nova Bombs are the Arwing fighter, the <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfen_%28Star_Fox_series%29_1e17.html" title="Wolfen (Star Fox series)">Wolfen</a>, and the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmaster_%28Star_Fox%29_6a97.html" title="Landmaster (Star Fox)">Landmaster</a> <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank.html" title="Tank">tank</a>, although this function was removed from the Landmaster in <i>Assault</i>. Additionally, all fighters in <i>Star Fox Command</i> can carry at least one bomb.</p>

<p>Also, in <i><a href="../../../o/c/a/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_Ocarina_of_Time_9ec9.html" title="The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></i>, <a href="http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i176/betazelda64/snap0023.jpg" class="external text" title="http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i176/betazelda64/snap0023.jpg" rel="nofollow">a miniature Arwing</a> enemy was discovered in the game's code by a pair of hackers named Cendamos and JayTheHam. From this, they made a code which made the enemy appear in <a href="../../../k/o/k/Kokiri_Forest_07ee.html" title="Kokiri Forest">Kokiri Forest</a>. The Arwing would occasionally attack, and could be easily defeated. Upon hitting the ground, the Arwing would explode, and leave behind flames which would die down quickly. Why this enemy existed in the first place is unknown, but it could well have been a test enemy that was left in the final code or it was a joke enemy.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../s/m/o/WarioWare%7E_Smooth_Moves_fbb4.html" title="WarioWare: Smooth Moves">WarioWare: Smooth Moves</a></i> three levels resembling those from the original game are made playable with the Wii Remote. The player tilts and twists the controller to steer, and presses A or B to fire.</p>
