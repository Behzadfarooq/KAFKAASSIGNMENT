<p>Hi Arwel</p>
<p>At <a href="../../../g/r/a/Talk%7EGranada_Television_6b6d.html" title="Talk:Granada Television">Talk:Granada Television</a> there's an interesting, if strange, excursion into the alledged activities of the alledged son of Sidney Bernstein. Whilst I'm glad the contributor put this here rather than on the Granada live page, I'm wondering if it is actually potentially libellous.</p>
<p>If so, I don't have a clue what to do about it. Therefore I come straight to my fount of all wikiknowledge (you!) and ask for advice yet again.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<dd>Belated felicitations. Do you collect banknotes? I was thinking of buying a couple of white fivers from Ebay. A genuine one and an Operation Bernhardt one and sticking them in a frame side by side and putting it up on the wall in the hall.

<dd>Thanks (though once you get to this age you start to regard birthdays a bit ambivalently!). No, I wouldn't describe myself as a banknote collector - sometimes notes come into my posession for a while, but I don't usually keep them long (current notes even less so!). I did manage to correctly guess which was the genuine white fiver and which was the Bernhard one in the British Museum's Money Gallery 2 or 3 years ago, but I cheated - it was obvious that the one dated after May 1945 was the genuine one! -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> 23:21, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Arwel. Something appears to be off in the table in your article - a link to the Olympic Stadium in Atehns appears to have crept in there, and there's something odd about the table itself - is it really meant to consist of political parties? I'd suspect vandalism, but you're the only one who's edited it. The wiki has been limping and farting over the past fw minutes; maybe something blew up when you were editing it? I'd try to fix it, but I haven't a clue what you intended to go in there!

<dd>I honestly don't think it qualified as nonsense. It was a badly formed and named article about a website used for gaming discusion. But it was comprehensible text, and i had no trouble understanding its meaning. I strongly suspect that the site would have been found non-notable on AfD, but I didn't have time to do a google check, and in any case non-notability is not a speedy criterion except for individual people.

<dd>I see what you're getting at; fair point. In fixing one misleading sentence (re: 'Irish'), the replacement is still slightly misleading in a different way. Question is, do many people in Northern Ireland consider themselves 'Northern Irish'? It's not something I'm aware of....</dd>
<dd>Anyhow, I've made that a separate sentence; hopefully it tidies things up without getting *too* off-topic. Let me know if you think this is still vague. Cheers!</dd>

<p>Arwel, the rec.sports.soccer.stats group put together a list of all the wartime/victory games with their line-ups and the first one he appears in is the Wales game in 1942. They don't name their sources and I haven't been able to find a definitive answer but I think it's likely that they are correct. Perhaps a list of his international appearances would be appropriate? It's a bit difficult because none of the games Soo played in were actually official England games, the wartime and victory games not being considered that.</p>
<p>The problem with your East Asian terminology is that it leaves open that another type of Asian may have played for England before Soo. My OED is buried in the garage so I can't see what it has to say about that, but the online American Heritage dictionary has this to say:</p>
<p>--</p>
<ul>
<li>Asian</li>
<li>1. A native or inhabitant of Asia.</li>
<li>2. A person of Asian descent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage Note: Asia is the largest of the continents with more than half the world's population. Though strictly speaking all of its inhabitants are Asians, in practice this term is applied almost exclusively to the peoples of East, Southeast, and South Asia as opposed to those of Southwest Asia such as Arabs, Turks, Iranians, and Kurds who are more usually designated Middle or Near Easterners. Indonesians and Filipinos are properly termed Asian, since their island groups are considered part of the Asian continent, but not the Melanesians, Micronesians, and Polynesians of the central and southern Pacific, who are now often referred to collectively as Pacific Islanders. --</p>
<p>My linguistic habits have been utterly corrupted by the amount of time I've spent in the US so I'm not going to change it back but I would like to resolve the ambiguity.</p>
<p>btw, thanks for finding the Frank Soo info - how did you come across it? I'm an avid Luton Town fan (born and grew up there) and had not heard of him.</p>

<p>Hi Arwel, I was concerned to see you post on the above's talk page that if he was blocked for 3RR, you'd unblock him. First, it's usually best to defer to the blocking admin's judgment, unless a clear error has been made. But secondly, you should be aware that this individual is causing problems with reverting elsewhere. He reverts constantly at <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_Huntingdon_Animal_Cruelty_9aa1.html" title="Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty">Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty</a>, either deleting the intro entirely or deleting the photograph. The page has already been protected once because of it. He won't discuss a compromise, won't outline exactly what his objections, simply declares it POV and deletes, as though he is the only judge of NPOV on Wikipedia.

<dd>Unfortunately SlimVirgin appears to be on something of a mission. He has obvious POV views on animal rights issues: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Geni#SlimVirgin" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Geni#SlimVirgin" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Geni#SlimVirgin</a> and he is persisting a biased view of Huntingdon Life Sciences, including an objectionable photo, which has had objections from me and other users on the article's talk page, stretching back six months. He, on the other hand, is the only one to come out in favour of this particular image, and seems to believe he is the sole judge of what is NPOV. I would suggest you be careful with what he says, as he has sadly decided to start something of a campaign against my edits, pursuing me to different parts of this site, e.g., this entry, on an article on Tony Blair, without any consideration of what as actually said. 87.74.12.83 12:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am on no mission. This anon is a problem editor, who reverts a lot and won't compromise. Having reverted four times within 18 minutes at <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>, he reported dbiv for 3RR, yet expects not to be blocked for it himself. I won't block him because I'm involved in a dispute with him elsewhere, but I hope that, if someone else does block him, Arwel will not unblock him early, as he indicated he might.

<dd>Thank you, Arwel. I was concerned that you seemed to want to unblock him because you agreed with his edits, but 3RR should be enforced regardless of content; that is, we're not allowed to judge by the content whether, or for how long, to enforce 3RR. Anyway, my point was simply to let you know that this user is causing problems elsewhere with the same behavior, so you'll know it isn't an isolated incident. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:45, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Arwel. You blocked User:216.11.82.82 for a week. I support your block; indeed, one of the warnings on <a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.11.82.82.html" title="User talk:216.11.82.82">User talk:216.11.82.82</a> was written by me. However, as a fellow administrator, I am surprised that you decided to block this IP address for such a long time. I have almost no experience with blocking vandals and you seem to have lots, so I wondered whether you could please explain your decision. It is my understanding of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy</a> that the first block should generally be for 24 hours. This is particularly true for IP addresses which are shared by more people. The IP address 216.11.82.82 is used by donald.oaklandschools.net, so it seems safe to assume that it is a school computer.</p>

<p><sup>Hi. I can't do any blocking on wicipedia - there seems to be some glitch. Can you have a look, please? <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 22:31, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</sup></p>

<dd><sup>Hi Deb - lucky you caught me when you did! I've just been offline for a week thanks to having to look after my Mam when she's not well... Anyway, are you trying to block someone and using the drop-down menu of periods of time to block them for? I think this is the problem - when the box first appeared, I tried editing the periods into Welsh but found they didn't work, which is why I changed them back to English. Obviously someone else has tried to do it, too. Could you try putting "24 hours" or "7 days" or whatever in the "arall" box and seeing if it works? -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 23:03, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</sup></dd>

<dd><sup>Okay, that seems to have worked. Diolch. Hope your Mam is feeling better. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 23:04, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</sup></dd>
