<p>Hi! Arwel Parry! While I was browsing here, I have discovered that "I HAD new messages"! (I hadn't log on with my nickname, I was 212.85.1.101) so I checked... It seems that somebody has been using these very same computer to vandalize? And it seems to have been recent... Right now I am in East Ham (London) Public Library, computer number 13.

<p>Hi Arwell, you asked on my talk page whether it was deliberate that the link to MS&lt;caron&gt;K Z&lt;caron&gt;ilina got corrupted to "MS&lt;caron&gt;K Z&lt;caron&gt;ilina during my edit to Current Sports Events of 10:11 yesterday 8 Aug. No it was not deliberate, and I would never do that. I'm using IE6. Could that be the culprit?

<p>The acronym NK stands for <i>nogometni klub</i>, i.e. football club, whereas HNK prepends <i>hrvatski</i>, i.e. Croatian to it. The same thing annoys me as well -- some clubs include it, and some don't, and it's somewhat hard to decide which club has which prefix because theoretically they can all use both. It appears that some also include it just for kicks, i.e. to explicate that they're from Croatia, whereas they are <b>not</b> registered with the Croatian football federation with the HNK prefix, rather just with the NK prefix! It seems that "Rijeka" is one such club, but I could be wrong. They've got the H on the emblem but I've always heard only of NK being mentioned WRT them, and see also the domain name (.hr domains are always named after registered legal entity names).</p>
<p>I think I'll need to dig into <a href="http://www.hns-cff.hr/" class="external text" title="http://www.hns-cff.hr/" rel="nofollow">the Federation's web site</a> and try to find if they maintain an official list of club name registrations anywhere. Failing that, Googling for clubs' individual web sites might prove useful.&#160;:/ --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 13:37, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arwel, I have copied the follwing to Angela as well as yourself. I hope you understand why.</p>
<p>Arwel. I find myself in dispute with a number of users at the moment and I don't have the fight in me to spark off another RFC so I'm appealing to your good sense to sort something out without resorting to that. I would understand if you'd rather not get involved though.</p>
<p>I feel that <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">User:Netoholic</a> has acted with the upmost disgrace on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28television%29_2a37.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (television)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (television)</a>. A few days ago I and a number of other users noticed that pages related to TV programmes were being moved by him, so we questioned what was going on and he said that he was moving them under the guidelines at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28television%29_fd20.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television)">Wikipedia: Naming conventions (television)</a>. When I looked at this page I discovered that the policy had been written by Netoholic a few hours earlier. So on the talk page I questioned what was going on. On that page there was a straw poll that had no indication of when it was due to finish. The so-called convention that Netoholic adopted had 5 votes and one of the other options had 2 votes. Several users argued with netoholic that this straw poll had not received enough publicity and no result had been declared, and questioned the so-called consensus policy that Netoholic was adopting. I ended up arguing with Netoholic on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_b869.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions</a> because in my opinion he was falsely claiming that some kind of consensus had been reached, when in actual fact more people had complained to him about the policy he was implementing than had actually voted for it. During this argument several more people cast their votes on the straw poll including you. I made a proposal that the straw poll be declared null and void; that the so called policy be declared a draft proposal; and that we restart a new poll with proper procedures and sufficient publicity. Several users agreed with this and <a href="../../../g/t/r/User%7EGtrmp_2ffc.html" title="User:Gtrmp">User:Gtrmp</a> drew up a poll and put it in his user space. At this point the policy that he had implemented was losing the straw poll. Netoholic decided to ignore the suggestions of starting with a clean sheet. He drew up his own poll which rather than list different options, is just to decide whether the policy he drew up should be endorsed or not. Furthermore he has put a time limit 20 days on it. So if we are to change his policy it would need 20 days before we even got to the stage of beginning the vote on an alternative, and then I guess another 20 odd days before any change in policy is implemented. Quite frankly I'm disgusted. Oh, he also moved the page to an archive thus losing the history. I have fixed this now though. You can see precisely what was going on if you look at the page before Netoholic expunged the content <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28television%29&amp;oldid=5377713" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28television%29&amp;oldid=5377713" rel="nofollow">here</a>. He has also moved around some other comments from one page to another so it might be difficult to follow exactly what's going on.

<p>I'm spamming this... sorry</p>
<p>At some point in the past you expressed an opinion on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28television%29_2a37.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (television)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (television)</a>. I have instigated a new poll on that page. I am hoping that this poll will properly allow all users who have an interest in the subject to express their views fairly before we come to a consensus. I have scrapped the poll that was previously in place on that page because I believe that it was part of an unfair procedure that was going against the majority view. I am appealing to all users who contribute to that page to approve my actions. I would appreciate it if you could take the time and trouble to read the page carefully and express an opinion and vote as you see fit. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMintguy_20fd.html" title="User talk:Mintguy">(T)</a> 16:56, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Arwel. The best way to do this seems to be to create a page in the Wicipedia: namespace, with the same title as the text of the page MediaWiki:Booksources - which would be <a href="../../../../cy/f/f/y/Wicipedia%7EFfynnonellau_llyfrau_allanol_8b23.html" class="extiw" title="cy:Wicipedia:Ffynnonellau_llyfrau_allanol">cy:Wicipedia:Ffynnonellau llyfrau allanol</a>, I think. This is similar to the MediaWiki: pages, except it uses <tt>MAGICNUMBER</tt> for the ISBN instead of $1 (see <a href="../../../b/o/o/Wikipedia%7EBook_sources_341d.html" title="Wikipedia:Book sources">Wikipedia:Book sources</a> for en's version). It should override the default BookstoreListCy in the language file entirely - so you may want to add the default ones back as well. Hope that helps&#160;:-).

<p>I've never seen that view expressed before: is there a policy for it? On casual inspection I can't find one. Does this mean that every time I shift the language links from the top to the bottom I have to reference <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Complete_list_of_language_Wikipedias_available" class="extiw" title="meta:Complete_list_of_language_Wikipedias_available">Meta:Complete list of language Wikipedias available</a>?

<p>That still doesn't tell me where I have to go to get the appropriate list, or where this policy is spelled out. Can you answer these questions?

<p>Hello all - my FIFA data-mining program is now nearing completion - I have already used it to post a complete article which details all of the matches invovled in <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_2006_-_European_Qualification_Groups_ecd5.html" title="Football World Cup 2006 - European Qualification Groups">Football World Cup 2006 - European Qualification Groups</a>. I can post articles of equal detail for each confederation with ease now.</p>
<p>I am debating with myself as to whether I should go one step further and give each match it's own report - complete player listings, substitutions, yellow/red cards, goal scorers, names of referee and other match officials&#160;; 85 percent of the program to do exactly that is written...</p>
<p>Let me know what you think of the article I have posted for the European qualifiers - if there is any way in which it can be improved/tweaked.</p>
<p>I look forward to receiving any feedback you can offer. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphod_Beeblebrox_d699.html" title="User:Zaphod Beeblebrox">Zaphod Beeblebrox</a> 09:44, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi there Arwel,</p>
<p>Have altered my program to take into account the earlier bug - tables should be sorted now.</p>
<p>When I mentioned Match Reports, I was really thinking about maybe giving each qualification group it's own page where users could look up more detailed information - for all completed games, the "Match schedule" table would include a link which would take you to another page where more detail on that game would be available. I could easily produce a 8 to 10 line summary of each game with full match details on it - have 20 or 30 of those to a page and they should still remain fairly readable. Such a page would be called Football World Cup 2006 - European Group 1 Match Reports for example. -- <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZaphod_Beeblebrox_d699.html" title="User:Zaphod Beeblebrox">Zaphod Beeblebrox</a> 12:44, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, didn't know how else to get in touch with you. I was banned for a week for 'vandalism' to the John Peel site after he died. I have only been on the John Peel site once, and did not make any changes of any sort. Nor have I ever vandalised anyone else's site. I would be grateful if people didn't bar me without checking with me first, especially as someone obvious someone has got hold of my id (or something....) BScotland.</p>
