<p>Sadly, images like Image:Rajaactor.jpg can't be included on Wikipedia. You <i>can</i> upload publicity images created by the movie studios, DVD covers, movie posters, or television or movie screenshots. This is none of those. -- <a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZanimum_8561.html" title="User:Zanimum">Zanimum</a> 19:00, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In recent times, most of the Tamil films dubbed in Telugu have done roaring business. The success of these Tamil films has naturally made the Telugu producers insecure. If such a situation continues, the Andhra producers will end up a financial mess, hence the emergency meeting. Their demand is that no film of any language should be dubbed in Telugu. Those who make a living through the dubbed films have naturally voiced opposition. One suggestion was to levy a higher tax on dubbed films, as they do in Karnataka. A majority of the producers want total ban on Telugu dubbed films. Since some producers have already got the dubbing rights for many new Tamil films, the decision will be made after 2 or 3 months. Such a measure taken by the Kannada film industry flopped. So, let's see how far the Telugu film industry is going to fare.

<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>

<p>I recently found that the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article on Wikipedia is the first item that comes up when you search for "Jesus" on the world’s most widely used search engine, Google.</p>
<p>Please edit the Jesus article to make it an accurate and excellent representation of Him.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article may be a person’s first impression of Jesus. It would be nice if their first impression was from a Christian or the Bible, but for so many in these new days it probably comes from the Internet. Watch the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> page to keep it focused on Him. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Also, watch out to follow Wikipedia's <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Policies and guidelines</a>.

<p>Hi Arjun and thank you for bringing in the Tollywood films in the "Years in film" lists. I made a class assessment round, trying to be as consistent as I am with all films. Very well taken care of, congratulations. Most I assessed as class stub, due to the upgrading instructions we have decided on in WP Films. Please, let me know if some of them should be class start, as I am not familiar with how WP Indian cinema guidelines go. <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> <small><a href="../../../h/o/v/User_talk%7EHoverfish_2aee.html" title="User talk:Hoverfish">Talk</a></small> 09:41, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A tag has been placed on Isha Sahani, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable</a>, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add <code>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}</code> on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.</p>
<p>For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">for biographies</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">for web sites</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">for bands</a>, or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">for companies</a>.
