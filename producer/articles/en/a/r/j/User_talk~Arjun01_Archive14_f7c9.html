<p>I really wish I understood the whole fair use thing. What difference does it make what images are used?

<dd>Okay basically read <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">this</a>. That should be more informative. You can use any other image! It is really that simple, most images on wikipedia are non-fair use...except for all the business and tradmark images. Try looking around in <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Michigan" class="extiw" title="commons:Michigan">Commons</a>.

<p>Thanks. I hope I do not say anything offensive so please bear with me. I know next to nothing about Hinduism.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there different sects of Hinduism?</li>
<li>Do these sects get along?</li>
<li>How prevalent is the notion that the Vedic creation story actually is true in Hinduism and in India?</li>
<li>Are there ever any charges that Vedic science is pseudoscience?</li>
<li>Is the ISKCON a non Hinduism sect? Are they nondoctrinal&#160;? Fringe?</li>
<li>Are there ISKCON representatives or Hinduism believers who are similar to ISKCON in India or in mainstream Hinduism?</li>
<li>How different are the beliefs of ISKCON from Hinduism as a whole? And in what ways?</li>
<li>What is Hindutva? Are they connected with Hinduism in any way?</li>
<li>Why did the US state department issue concerned reports about Hindutva's influence on school textbooks in India?</li>
<li>Who is a Hindutva and who is not? How can one tell the difference?</li>
<li>Who is Swami Prakashanand Saraswati? Is he well known?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for so many questions. I really know nothing at all and I am just trying to understand.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 22:16, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for answering. I hope I did not offend and I do not want to offend in any way shape or form. Permit me to ask a few more questions then:</p>
<p>Roughly what fraction of Hindus would you find who claimed, based on Vedic scriptures or teachings:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I believe that man was alive at the same time as dinosaurs",</li>
<li>"I believe that the earth is more than 5 billion years old,"</li>
<li>"I believe that man does not evolve physically with time"</li>
<li>"I believe that my ancestors were NOT rat-like creatures, and before that lizards, and before that fish, and before that primitive sea creatures"</li>
<li>"I believe all living creatures on earth do not have the same ancestors"</li>
<li>"I believe the earth has been through multiple cycles of rebirth and men were recreated each cycle"</li>
<li>"Man is descended from demigods and goddesses at the start of each cycle"</li>
<li>"the following are sciences: astrology, vastu, yogic flying, Vedic creationism, transcendental meditation or ayurveda."</li>
<li>Would agree with
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>It is a fact that in the world almost all the academic literature in English about Hinduism, even by Hindu writers, bears the western influence, and that, none of these books represent the correct view of total authentic Hinduism. Historians forget that one cannot determine the history of Bharatvarsh on meager archaeological findings of coins, toys and pots. Whereas the general history of Bharatvarsh is already written in its scriptures and the Puranas whose texts and the philosophical descriptions are the outcome of the Gracious and benevolent minds of eternal Saints.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>would agree with
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>In no way could there be any comparison of the western religions (which are based on mythologies) with the Hindu Vedic religion which is eternal, universal and is directly revealed by the supreme God.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>would agree with
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Divine writings cannot be analyzed in a material way. How could a worldly being, possessed with the vehemence of his own passions and desires, try to argue with the writings of Sages and Saints whose entire life was a divine benevolence for the souls of the world? You should know that all of our religious writings are Divine facts, and facts always remain facts, they cannot become myths. Using the word myth for our religious history is a serious spiritual transgression.</p>

<p>The "Hendrix" vandal (IP 68.80.30.39) is back at it on several articles. I'm getting tired of rv'ing his nonsense. If you have time could you roll back his last flurry of vandalism. I test4'd him last night and reported him to AiV. But I got a "passive" admin who was too "nice nice" and let him go. Frustrating!

<dd>My watchlist currently has 3245 pages. I browse strictly through VandalProof. So I have a very thorough blacklist to aid me. VP is only working at 25% right now due to a few glitches that no one has any time to fix. But I muddle through. I actually don't "sit" at a computer very often. I have a wireless laptop in just about every room in my house(even one out by the pool) All of them are piped back through my office proxy. So as I'm walking from room to room....I periodically stop and check my watchlist. Rv the baddies....MAYBE make a valid edit here and there...and then walk away for a while. My "wiki-stress" = 0 as I don't really follow the entire "community" too closely. I just do what I do(very well I might add) and then I move on. I have made some good "Wiki-friends" along the way. And I've seen a few who let Wiki get to them and quit. I'm still here...for now anyways. It's an interesting hobby that helps me pass the time in my semi-retired state. For almost 25 years I've been an Engineering nerd running a successful business that spans across Canada. Prior to my Engineering career, I was a road weary guitarist in a hundred different bands playing jazz clubs, seedy dives(behind chicken wire no less), KofC dance halls, army bases(like Spinal Tap) and even a few 10000 seat arenas. I've been paid to play to a completely empty rooms.(hated those gigs) Even did some brief stints in a couple of bands that opened for a few "fairly" notable Cdn Rock acts like Triumph, Moxy, Teaze and Mahogany Rush. Did a couple interesting shows opening for Bob Seger.(we were actually opening up for the opening act...that's pretty low) Turned down an support slot with some unknown(at the time) artist named Petty(managers can be stupid sometimes!) And, right near the end of my musical journey, did 3 shows with Motorhead.(before anyone had ever heard of them) With those kind of miles, nothing that happens here on Wikipedia ever gets to me. The "anger" in my user name has nothing to do with my disposition(Anger/22 was actually my nickname/number when I played college hockey) I could leave here tomorrow and not miss it. But I won't. Maybe???

<dd>Wow <b>that is awesome</b>! Same here on wikipedia I No comprendo wikistress, as this is supposed to be fun and enjoyable. Once that feeling is gone I am out. As for my work on here I am actually on it fairly limited. One minute I am on the next I am away for hours . I am just so busy in real life with school, music and many many others that would be silly to explain here. It feels like yesterday when I first logged on to wikipedia under the screen name Littlewing1, I made hardly any edits and I didn't know how to exactly help out. But now as Arjun I have found my way around here pretty eaisily and can be found in a number of places. My interests are amazingly diverse on minute I am reverting vandalism the next I am working on the Hinduism article and the next I am fixing refs to the Stevie Ray Vaughan article. As for my music career I am somewhat new, I picked up the Guitar about 2 <sup>1/2</sup> years ago when I just wanted to impress a friend. But then I became a Guitaraholic (and that is where I am now&#160;:D). I play at various places but it is kind of hard to find anything descent due to my age! I am a what you would call a <a href="../../../v/o/o/Voodoo_Chile_5fcb.html" title="Voodoo Chile">Voodoo Chile</a>. My friends sometimes poke fun of me since I am a devout Hindu and one minute I can be found meditating and the next I can be found soloing to Jimi Hendrix's songs.

<dd>being a chameleon is much more interesting than just "sheeping in" with the pack. Not too long ago, I was in a posh conference room in Detroit. Across the table from me were 4 "extremely stiff" suits. I imagined these four men(all of them at least 10 years younger than me) had probably been "stiff" their entire lives. And they were about to sign over huge amounts of money to a man that, in 1975, had waste-length hair and was front row centre at a Led Zeppelin concert. Wikipedia is an intersting concept. I enjoy reading random articles. But take just about everything I read with a grain of salt. Both of my sons are high school teachers. And they both tell their students not to use Wikipedia as a resource. I don't know that I scrutinize it that much, but I can understand their leaning. If I were to acutally "sit" and edit here, I'd probably go nuts. I can "one-button" it 'til the cows come home and not get uptight about anything I see here. If the vandals only knew just how easy rv'ing their foolishness is. Of course, if a vandal "knew anything" they wouldn't be a vandal then would they?

<p>Yeah, I've been rockin' out since I was a baby (rather literally, my daddy played metal and hard rock all the time, at which I would dance and head-bang walls...ouch!). I'll go to my public library some time this weekend to look for some books on strat players. Once again, I'm sorry I haven't contributed to the Guitarist Wikiproject. I know I love Guitarists, I just can't find what to do for that project. Copyediting seems to be my only achievement. So, for now, I'll be reverting some vandalism here and there. Hope that's okay. And besides, I've just joined the Sailor Moon WikiProject, and I've been totally absorbed in copyediting an episode article. Matter of fact, I should get to it...I'm determined to copyedit at least one article by myself, then let someone else proofread it. It's pretty tough, but life isn't always easy, I'm told. Well, back to the subject...I'll go the library sometime on the weekend, and I'll root through my personal library for any books related to Strat players. Well, copyedit's a callin'! --<a href="../../../t/o/h/User%7ETohru_Honda13_199a.html" title="User:Tohru Honda13"><span style="color:#90f"><b>Tohru</b></span></a> <a href="../../../t/o/h/User_talk%7ETohru_Honda13_4510.html" title="User talk:Tohru Honda13"><span style="color:#f0f"><b>Honda</b></span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tohru_Honda13_22b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tohru Honda13"><b>13</b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/o/h/User%7ETohru_Honda13_Autograph_Book_13e5.html" title="User:Tohru Honda13/Autograph Book">Sign here!</a></sup> 04:23, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">wdefcon template vandalism</span></h2>
<p>I am going to go out on a limb and assume that Fatdoggys edits to the template are in good faith. I think he is a fairly inexpereinced editor who is trying to update the wdefcon template! Feel free to give him some points on why you consider that vandalism. (I think he is trying to update it and does not know how to resign his name or something like that). I have been helping this user a little bit recently and I have no reason to believe he has anything but best of intentions. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 18:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay sure I will give him/her a rundown of the template. Basically I considered it vandalism that Fatdoggys replaced Anthony cfc with his username, and then the template got kind of messed up. Sorry if I seemed to Drastic. Cheers! — <a href="../../../a/r/j/User%7EArjun01_13e5.html" title="User:Arjun01">Arjun</a> 18:39, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No problem! I wasent trying to be an ass. I just remeber when I first started. If i did not know the ins and outs of wikipedia, and wanted to update something by myself, i would probably try to emulate another users actions (I still do that today, copying templates, cool user page ideas etc). I think he just wanted to update the status and use his name (so he just replaced the other name with his name?). Just a guess.
