<p>Mr Bachmann, I have raised my objections to the last save done by you. There are factual errors and misrepresentation made by you which I have pointed out.</p>
<p><b>Rajputs</b> (from the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatpurusha.html" title="Tatpurusha">tatpurusha</a> compound <i><span lang="sa" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" class="IAST Unicode" style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS', 'GNU Unifont', 'Lucida Sans Unicode'; white-space:normal; text-decoration: none" xml:lang="sa">rājaputra</span></i>, "son of a king") are a prominent social group of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal.html" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. They claim descent from the ancient royal dynasties of the region. Among <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindus.html" title="Hindus">Hindus</a>, Rajputs are one of the principal groups belonging to the <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya.html" title="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a> <a href="../../../v/a/r/Varna_%28caste%29.html" title="Varna (caste)">varna</a> within the Hindu <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste_system.html" title="Caste system">caste system</a>.</p>
<p>My reply:</p>
<pre>
0 Rajputs are sons of kings i.e a compund of raj and putra and not an obscure tatpurusha compund. This place is for commoners and not sanskrit pandits.
1 Rajputs are not a prominent social group of Pakistan or Nepal.
2 They do not claim descent from ancient royals. They ARE descendants of royals with written genealogies going back to Ram, Lava and Kusha.
</pre>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Rajput dynasties played a prominent role in the history of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_India_acc8.html" title="North India">northern India</a>. They developed an ethos of warlike chivalry that served as the benchmark for other Indian communities as the latter ascended to regional dominance. This martial ethos did not preclude patronage of the arts: distinctive forms of painting and architecture developed under the aegis of Rajput courts, and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindustani_classical_music.html" title="Hindustani classical music">classical music</a> found support. Thus, the Rajputs have contributed directly and indirectly to many facets of the Indian crasis.</p>
<pre>
3 This is out of place. Rather at this point page should mention origins of rajputs and what are there chief areas of inhabitation.

   4 This painting is out of place. Rajputs were kings who ruled large parts of India. To show a few of them as sepoys is truth but hardly relevant to this page. Instead there should be fotos of kings who ruled.

<p>The 1931 census of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_India_bca4.html" title="British India">British India</a> was the last to record caste affiliation in a manner that provides reliable information on Rajput demographics. Any present-day estimates are therefore speculative; they also vary widely.</p>
<p>The 1931 census reported a total of 10.7 million people self-describing as Rajput. Of this population, about 8.6 million people also self-described as being <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a>, about 2.1 million as being <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> and about 50,000 as being <a href="../../../s/i/k/Sikh.html" title="Sikh">Sikh</a> by religion. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Provinces_of_Agra_and_Oudh_dbcd.html" title="United Provinces of Agra and Oudh">United Provinces</a> (being approximately present-day <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttar_Pradesh_a21c.html" title="Uttar Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> and <a href="../../../u/t/t/Uttaranchal.html" title="Uttaranchal">Uttaranchal</a> combined) reported the largest population of Rajputs, at 3,756,936. Next came the undivided province of <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjab_%28British_India%29_dbfa.html" title="Punjab (British India)">Punjab</a> with 2,351,650. The (then united) province of <a href="../../../b/i/h/Bihar.html" title="Bihar">Bihar</a> &amp; <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orissa.html" title="Orissa">Orissa</a>, largely co-terminus with the eponymous present-day provinces, reported a Rajput population of 1,412,440, while <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajputana.html" title="Rajputana">Rajputana</a>, which was almost co-terminus with the present-day state of <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajasthan.html" title="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, reported a figure of 669,516.

<p>The traditional occupations of the Rajput are war and agriculture. As many scholars have pointed out, these areas lend themselves uniquely to the ingress of groups that were not formerly affiliated with those professions. The gradual accommodation of the new entrants into the social and family circle of the traditional community is the essential <i>quid pro quo</i> of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskritization.html" title="Sanskritization">Sanskritization</a> that the aspirant community essays. This phenomenon of gradual inclusion has indubitably obtained in the case of the Rajputs, with certain <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jat.html" title="Jat">Jat</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> dynasties being among the most recent to venture the claim of affiliation with the Rajput community. In view of this, to seek a single and common, definitive origin for every present-day Rajput is widely recognised as being an exercise in futility. We however present both traditional legends and some scholarly speculations made by researchers on the origin of the Rajputs.</p>
<pre>
7 This is false. The author is ignorant about rajput lineages and how they were are protected. This gradual assimilation of people into rajput fold is just not correct. Also the author is claiming things legendary which are beleived as true by all rajputs. This is malicious,

<p>As <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya.html" title="Kshatriya">Kshatriyas</a>, the Rajputs regard themselves as being descended from the <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedic_civilization.html" title="Vedic civilization">vedic</a> warrior class. Legend ascribes to the Rajputs an origin stemming from certain <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> deities; every Rajput must eventually belong to one of three great patrilineages, being:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnivanshi.html" title="Agnivanshi">Agnivanshi</a> lineage, claiming descent from <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agni.html" title="Agni">Agni</a>, the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> Fire-god;</li>
<li>the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Suryavanshi.html" title="Suryavanshi">Suryavanshi</a> lineage, claiming descent from <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surya.html" title="Surya">Surya</a>, the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> Sun-god;</li>
<li>the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandravanshi.html" title="Chandravanshi">Chandravanshi</a> lineage, claiming descent from <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandra.html" title="Chandra">Chandra</a>, the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> Moon-god.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some scholars also count <i><a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagavanshi.html" title="Nagavanshi">Nagavanshi</a></i>, <i>Rishivanshi</i> and <i>Vayuvanshi</i> as traditional lineages. The <i>Yaduvanshi</i> lineage, claiming descent from the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> god <a href="../../../k/r/i/Krishna.html" title="Krishna">Krishna</a>, are in fact a major sept of the <i>Chandravanshi</i> lineage.</p>
<p>The aforementioned three patrilineages (<i>vanshas</i>) sub-divide into 36 main clans (<i>kulas</i>), which in turn divide into numerous branches (<i>shakhas</i>) to create the intricate <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajput_clans.html" title="Rajput clans">clan system</a> of the Rajputs. The principle of patrilineage is staunchly adhered to in determining one's place in the system and a strong consciousness of clan and lineage is an essential part of the Rajput character. As the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Britannica_0925.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">EB</a> (1911) states, this tradition of common ancestry permits a poor Rajput yeoman to consider himself as well born as any powerful landholder of his clan, and superior to any high official of the professional classes. Authoritative listings of the 36 Rajput clans are to be found in the <i>Kumārpāla Charita</i> of Jayasimha and the <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prithviraj_Raso_3eb2.html" title="Prithviraj Raso">Prithvirāj Rāso</a></i> of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandbardai.html" title="Chandbardai">Chandbardai</a>.</p>
<p>Among the legends mentioned above, the one which addresses the origin of the <i><a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnivanshi.html" title="Agnivanshi">Agnivanshi</a></i> Rajputs is particularly interesting, not least because they were the earliest to rise to political prominence. This legend begins with the <a href="../../../p/u/r/Puranas.html" title="Puranas">puranic</a> legend wherein the traditional <i><a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya.html" title="Kshatriya">kshatriyas</a></i> of the land were exterminated by <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parashurama.html" title="Parashurama">Parashurama</a>, an <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avatara.html" title="Avatara">avatara</a> of <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishnu.html" title="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>. Later, the legend says, sage <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasishta.html" title="Vasishta">Vasishta</a> performed a great <i>Yajna</i> or fire-sacrifice, to seek from the gods a provision for the defense of righteousness on earth. In answer to his prayer, a youth arose from the very flames of the sacrifice -- the first <i>Agnivanshi</i> Rajput. In some versions of the legend, <i>all</i> the Rajput lineages rose thus from the sacred flames.</p>

<p>Many scholars view the <i>Agni kunda</i> (fire-sacrifice) legend as suggesting, in an allegorical manner, the possibility that people who were not hitherto regarded as kshatriyas/Rajputs could come to be regarded as such after the customary fire-sacrifice based purificatory rituals. This legend has been used as the basis for Modern Historians tend to view rajputs as descendants of Scythic pastoral people. This theory has been substantiated by anthropological research which has yielded compelling proofs of them being scythic.Evidence has been traced to their geneology too.Many Rajputs who call themselves of Yadav lineage too have been found to be of same scythic stock somewhat similar to Pathans following jewish customs (like circumcision on 8th day) who like Rajputs also trace their lineage from Jadon ,nothing to do with yaduvansh of lord Krishna</p>
<pre>
9 This is pure non-sense. Mainly Brits wrote that rajputs are scythic. Rajputs do not beleive this.

13 in the section below the errors are too numerous to write all of them. The first line itself is wrong. Delhi sultante was not founded by Aybak. It washes over Khilji's invasion as a walk in the park which is misrepresenting history. There was a lot of treachery invloved and the other page seems to record them well.

15 This section below is written by an ignorant historian. Impression created is rajputs gave daughters to mughals happily.  This is erroneous. Such was the tumult of one person giving there daughter to muslims that Maharana Pratap banned all marriages of his rajputs with this other group. Some rajputs to this day do not marry with those rajputs who gave there daughters away. So author is creating a false impression either deliberately or out of ignorance.

<p>Babur's son <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humayun.html" title="Humayun">Humayun</a> was an ineffectual ruler who perforce spend long periods in exile. His son was made of a different mettle; <a href="../../../a/k/b/Akbar.html" title="Akbar">Akbar</a> consolidated his inheritence and expanded what had been the "Delhi sultanate" into a wide empire. A main factor in this success was indubitably his co-option of native Rajput chiefs into his empire-building project; his reign countenanced, for the first time, the involvement of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindus</a> in the affairs of the empire. The Rajput chiefs collaborated with alacrity, an alliance cemented by marriage, with numerous Rajput noblewomen being wed to mughal grandees. The Kachwahas were the first to give a daughter to Akbar; they pioneered a trend that soon turned pervasive and played no small role in extending Rajput influence across the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_sub-continent.html" title="Indian sub-continent">Indian sub-continent</a>, from <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bengal.html" title="Bengal">Bengal</a> to <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> to the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deccan.html" title="Deccan">Deccan</a>. Indeed, two successive mughal emperors, <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehangir.html" title="Jehangir">Jehangir</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shah_Jehan_c345.html" title="Shah Jehan">Shah Jehan</a>, were born to Rajput mothers.</p>

16 This section below is complete bullshit. Rajputs were far richer then mughals and had bigger and more beatiful castles then mughals.  Even the thought of Taj Mahal was conjured up by ShahJahan when he had revolted against his father and was living in Jag Mandir at Udaipur courtesy of Rana Karan Singh, grandson of Maharana Pratap.
</pre>
<p>Rajput chiefs served as mughal officers and administrators across the mughal empire and enjoyed much influence in the government. In this period, the <i>aristocratic</i> image of the Rajputs can be said to have finally crystallized; consequently, caste-divisions became rigid. The trend of political relations between Rajput states and the central power was the precursor for similar relations between them and the British.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<pre>
18 Language used below is borderline malicious. Mewar has a unique position in Hindu mind and not just rajput mind. Battle of Haldighati was not as cut and dry as written here. Amar Singh did not enter vasssalage immediately as this section makes one believe. He fought close to a dozen wars with mughals after his father's demise.  I wonder what is the author trying to prove by glossing over the truth?

<p><b>Third Jauhar:</b> However, these relations were not universally approbated. <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mewar.html" title="Mewar">Mewar</a>, which justly enjoys a unique position in the Rajput mind, held out and valiantly gave battle to Akbar. After a brave struggle, during which the ladies of the fort perfomed <i>Jauhar</i> for the third and last time in its history, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chittor.html" title="Chittor">Chittor</a> finally fell to Akbar in <a href="../../../1/5/6/1568.html" title="1568">1568</a>.</p>
<p>Mewar's ruler, Udai Singh, had retired to the nearby hills prior to this event; he was succeeded, while in exile, by his son <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rana_Pratap_0e1b.html" title="Rana Pratap">Rana Pratap</a> as head of the <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sisodia.html" title="Sisodia">Sisodia</a> clan. Even in exile, the Sisodias did not rest; they harassed the mughal administrators of the land enough to cause them to make accommodatory overtures. <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rana_Pratap_0e1b.html" title="Rana Pratap">Rana Pratap</a>, a present-day Rajput icon, rebuffed every such overtures of friendship from Akbar, and rallied an army to meet the mughal forces. He was defeated at the battle of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Haldighati.html" title="Haldighati">Haldighati</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_21.html" title="June 21">June 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/5/7/1576.html" title="1576">1576</a> and was forced to withdraw to the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Aravalli.html" title="Aravalli">Aravalli</a> ranges. However, he carried out a relentless guerilla struggle from his hideout in those hills.</p>
<p>Although Rana Pratap never gave in to the mughal power, his son Amar Singh entered into the vassalage of the mughals and thus regained control of his state. The Rajputs thereafter remained loyal to the mughal dynasty and empire for over two centuries, until that empire disintegrated. Indeed, even as late as in the 19th century, Rajput courts rarely failed to formally affirm their loyalty to the (by now entirely powerless) mughal emperor in all their official <i>communiques</i> and documents.</p>
