<dd>My apologies then. Though I've been uploading these images repeatedly, but they keep getting reverted and re-credited to Serebii.

<dd>He has no clue what he's talking about, regretfully. Especially since the 'official' official art of Mukubird is identical to what we currently have. In terms of Rampard's image, it was uploaded and sourced to the official Japanese Pokémon website. I have minor doubts, but until art of Rampard comes out in the official style, it's the best there currently is. I'd treat it as vandalism-- I'll aid in reversions. --<a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrEmmDee_a207.html" title="User:ArrEmmDee">ArrEmmDee</a> 00:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would recommend the 3RR noticeboard or <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>. i'd go the 3RR route first, since he's reverted Mukubird 6 times already within the past hour. -<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJeske_Couriano_ed31.html" title="User:Jeske Couriano">Jeske</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../j/e/s/User_talk%7EJeske_Couriano_5803.html" title="User talk:Jeske Couriano">Mail goes here</a>)</sup> 00:43, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
