<dd>thank you for your understanding. of course, while e-mail or another medium would be more preferable for "debate", one can have dialogue with others on user talk pages, but if it is done in a contentious manner it simply denotes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_battleground" title="WP:NOT">battle-ground mentality</a>, although a number of other edits i did not cite may have been from article talk pages. to imply that the article is being deliberately misused by an editor or group of editors is not <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> and is a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith assumption</a>. the issue is about constant misuse where series of comments are made which do not serve to enable constructive and useful discourse about the improvements of an article. it is important to consider that while one continues to participate on wikipedia. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 04:48, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can you prove atheism?

<p><a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a> is the lack of belief in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">theism</a>.

<p>I meant, can you prove that atheism as (roughly) defined in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theism.html" title="Theism">Theism</a> is true. I.e. can you prove that there is no deity. Thanks for the link to God of the gaps though, that's an interesting article. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 03:41, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is not up to me to prove that there is no deity. If it were, there would be no need for missionaries. It is standard logic that the one whom makes the claim has to prove it, "extraordinary claims take extraordinary evidence!" As it goes however, it is possible to present natural laws, that happen to explain away "arguments of proof" about Deities (<a href="../../../g/o/d/God_of_the_gaps.html" title="God of the gaps">god of the gaps</a>), but there is no way for me to <i>not</i> prove something, like there is no way for you to <i>not</i> prove the exsistance of Santa Clause and the Easter Bunny. If you can prove that santa clause does not exsist, then I can prove your deity does not. Then you'll see how rhetorical things can get. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomerset219_eb29.html" title="User:Somerset219">Somerset219</a> 03:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know it is not up to you to prove that there is no deity; I was merely interested to know if you had a proof. As regards "arguments of proof" of the existence of God, I think that Thomas Aquinas' five ways cannot be explained away using "natural laws." That's not saying that they are all valid, though I personally believe that at the very least, even if there is an infinite regress of causes, there has to be something which causes the chain. By the way, the existence of natural laws cannot be proven. Any natural laws that we have deduced are nothing more than the result of scientists saying, "this appears to be how things work." I'm not saying that they're not right, I believe in science as much as the next reasonable person. I'm just saying that science is based on assumptions. Outside of the realm of science, it is not always reasonable to demand proof. There are some things which, even if false, cannot be falsified. So if you believe in the law of excluded middle, this means that there could be things that, even if true, can't be proven. For example, I didn't demand proof that there is no god, only asked for it (haha). My best friend fed a ganesha idol milk during that day that ganeshas all around the world were drinking milk, and I have no explanation for that. Because of that and other things which I have been convinced are miracles, I believe in the supernatural. I hesitate to call this proof of god's existence, though I hope to find some eventually.

<dd>interesting, however science is there to make calculable observations that are repeatable. Its there to help us interact, deal with, and control our environment, it isn't there to give you the meaning of life. What I was talking about was more on giving answers with out proofs. Science is there to "funnel and propel" our <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knowledge.html" title="Knowledge">knowledge</a> so we can build on those lessons learned (<a href="../../../c/o/m/Computers.html" title="Computers">computers</a>).</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../g/o/d/God_of_the_gaps.html" title="God of the gaps">God of the gaps</a> is a good example of the mentality of religion, which is why I consistantly bring it up. Religion tends to try to explain things that aren't everyday occurances, or what you call <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a>. In other words, I am not saying that science has all the answers, I'm saying that making up a subjective conclusion with out understanding all the variables probably isn't the wisest desicion. A scientist studies the natural world, which is our life. I would rather have a computer technician (scientist) tell me how a computer works (natural world), than a used car salesman (Priest). Just because one doesn't understand the concepts of the natural world, doesn't make <i>any</i> answer for it right. If anything, God is an idea of those things we don't understand, but in no way can you better understand those things by believing it. People want the easy answer, there is none, and believing someones answer with out understanding why is not only stupid but can be dangerous (<a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_terrorism.html" title="Religious terrorism">religious terrorism</a>). <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomerset219_eb29.html" title="User:Somerset219">Somerset219</a> 23:17, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>thank you for standing up for me against Aminz's silly assertion. I made my vote according to my understanding of wikipedia policy and was rudely accused of misuse of wikipedia by Aminz. All I can say is "he who smelled it, dealt it." For me it was not a matter of being pro or anti Islamic, but a matter of whether the article merited the space it took up. I spend a lot of my time on the AfD discussions as I adhere to wikipedian deletionism- the belief in strict adherance to wikipedia standards in the articles. If it isn't contributing to the greatness of wikipedia, then it is wasting space. The article in question seems to be proselytizing. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_hornet_0ed2.html" title="User:Green hornet">Green hornet</a> 03:57, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for notifying me of the deletion debate. After looking it over I agree that the page has serious problems. But I did go ahead and vote speedy keep, because your second nomination was made only a few hours after the last nomination closed.

<dd>It was not until I had learnt Arabic and read the Qur'an in the original that I realised the precise meaning of certain verses. Only then did I make certain discoveries that were astounding. With my basic ideas on the Qur'an - which to begin with were inaccurate, just as those of most people in the West - I certainly did not expect to find in the text the statements that I in fact uncovered. With each new discovery, I was beset with doubt lest I might be mistaken in my translation or perhaps have provided an interpretation rather than a true rendering of the Arabic text.</dd>

<dd><b>Only after consultations with several specialists in linguistics and exegesis, both Muslim and non-Muslim, was I convinced that a new concept might be formed from such a study</b>: the compatibility between the statements in the Qur'an and firmly established data of modern science with regard to subjects on which nobody at the time of Muhammad - not even the Prophet himself - could have had access to the knowledge we possess today. Since then, I have not found in the Qur'an any support given to the myths or superstitions present at the time the text was communicated to man. This is not the case for the Bible, whose authors expressed themselves in the language of their period.</dd>

<dd>In La Bible, le Coran et la Science (The Bible, the Qur'an and Science), which first appeared in the original French in 1976 and which subsequently appeared in English in 1978, I set forth the main points of these findings. On November 9, 1976, I gave a lecture to the Academie de Médecine (French academy of Medicine) in which I explored the statements of the origins of man contained in the Qur'an; the title of the lecture was Données physiologiques et embryologiques du Coran (Physiological and Embryological Data in the Qur'an). I emphasised the fact that these data - which I shall summarise below - formed part of a much wider study.</dd>

<p>An interesting philosophical point. I myself am a pragmatist and an instrumentalist towards truth. I don't believe truth exists in some external world, or at least there is no way to prove such a conviction. We don't have truths, we just have assumptions that happen to work. Knowledge is, in my view, based on some form of solidarity, consensus with in a group; between groups there is pluralism, a multiplicity of opinions. There is no way to decide which truth is better than the other.</p>
<p>On wikipedia this view is reflected in the way I deal with debates, edit wars and disagreements, I try to remain always oriented towards compromise. As such I can assert what I believe is true, but have to give in when others have other views. For wikipedia is not about truth, but about consensus <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 23:24, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Under the sharia? Are you kidding me? Less than 10% of the Dutch population is islamic, their birth figures and levels of religiosity are declining. Such a minority could never grab power; instead, like any good democrat we must respect the opinions of the minority. BTW We have a more serious chance of becoming a protestant theocracy than a Islamic caliphate, seeing we have a theocratic protestant party in parliament since 1918.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What your saying maybe funny if you don't live here. The people who are saying we are in the danger of becoming an islamic caliphate, are part of the problem in the Netherlands as long as islam is not treated with the simple democratic respect, recognized as a part of the Netherland, the segregation between black and white is kept in place and youth in the large cities do not have perspectives to better life, both economically and socially, we are breeding fundamentalism and terrorism, not by our tolerance but by our intolerance. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 07:56, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, immigration, both from asylum seekers and family migration (the biggest two sources) has rapidly declined because of government policy, which I don't support: as the majority of asylum seekers is from non-islamic countries and they are treated inhumanely by the Dutch government.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, Christianity was as bad: now Christ may not have committed any attrocities, but the pogroms against the Jews, defended because Jews were responsible for the death of Christ and the crusades against the muslims, defended because the Muslims held Jerusalem, the city of Christ, were attrocious. The Old Testament isn't the least violent book on the world either. And I won't go into the wars between Catholics and Protestants which last till today. No people has never been at war for religious reasons. The Islam, sadly, is not different.</dd>
<dd>Finally, we can all interpret religions the way we want too ("Islam is violent at its core" etc), but we can never know how it is to live in one, unless you do live in one. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 08:33, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I want to stress that you can't say anything about a religion if you're not in it, how well you have researched it, it still is a prejudice, since you can only understand a belief system if you are in it.</dd>
<dd>The Central Bureau of Statistics tell me that according to their prediction in 2050 3,458,362 people will be from non-Dutch origin. 1,084,099 will come from Morocco and Turkey. Currently about 700,000 people are from Moroccan or Turkish extraction. Not all these people are per definition muslim obviously. Immigration has fallen from 133,404 persons in 2001 to 92,297 in 2005.Migration from Turkey has fallen from 7,000 to 3,500; Morocco from nearly 6,000 to 2,500. The more than half of the migrants, come from within the EU, the US or Australia/New Zealand.</dd>

<dd>It includes all allochtonen, that is upto the third generation.</dd>
<dd>The sentence "In fact, many Muslims probably do not have a very good grasp of many aspects of Islam." shows the flaw of your argument. How can you not understand your own religion? You can only understand a religion by being part of it. You might call it post-modern, but it is rather obvious, the only people who truely understand Islam are muslems themselves, who live, deal and struggle each day with their own religion.</dd>
<dd>You can interpret scriptures in a very different way, as long as there are pacifist christians and people who go at war over their own religion, that seems rather obvious. I know Christian who accept evolutionary theory and christians who reject it, on basis of the same Bible.</dd>
<dd>Materialism and atheism are as unprovable as any religion, because it is based on the assumption that the world out there exists and that the way we perceive it is correct. That is a very <i>useful</i> assumption, but not one you can prove. Personally I'll stick to being a pragmatist (things are true, facts are just useful) and agnost (the question does God exist, cannot be usefully answered), because I prefer to have a philosophical perspective that is not assume things about the world which I can't know. I have no epistemic basis for that (obviously), but I think that this position is most useful.</dd>
<dd>The majority truth might be more useful, but it is not more true. Especially not from the position your arguing because if your an atheist and materialist, you can't possibly think that moral truths exist. Where are those moral truths? How can you perceive them? Materialism almost per definition leads to some relativist position about moral truths. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 09:50, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The basic assertion of "relativist" philosophers like Kuhn (although he wouldn't appreciate that adjective) is that you can not understand beliefsystems if you aren't part of them. We can't understand the way Aristotle thought about nature, because we live in a completely different world, the same is true for Islam.</dd>
<dd>Still the whole point is that we can interpret religions in a certain way, if we are outsiders, by looking at their scriptures but we can never fully grasp their meaning. So the islam in your interpretation is aggressive, but the Islam in the interpretation of many muslems is a religion of peace.</dd>
<dd>My positions may seem to shift, because I have to have two kinds of answers, unlike materialists.
<ol>
<li>How we have knowledge, a question of fact</li>
<li>How we should have knowledge, a normative question.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>On the first, I think it is becoming clear that knowledge <i>is</i> dependend on groups, paradigms, solidarity etc. Having knowledge is a group process and not objective. So knowledge is always consensus.</dd>
<dd>On the second, so how do I deal with this subjectivity as an individual: by pragmatism. That is how I personally deal with knowledge.</dd>
<dd>These two fuse on wikipedia, where knowledge (i.e. things included in wikipedia) is that which is not deleted by the community and therefore our edits have to be pragmatic: by being bold we can include some of our perspective, by removing information we can prevent edit conflicts.</dd>
<dd>BTW, in Islamic countries I'd be hanged for sodomy, that's the exact reason we (the Netherlands) have to open our borders for those who have lost their faith and those who flee islamic countries. If you have claim to have superior views, you must open your borders to those who agree with your superiority and not close them because you fear those who agree with you. (But this is a very specific European problem). <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 12:40, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think are epistemological differences, especially those concerning the ability to understand religions cannot be reconciled. I respect your realism and materialism, although they are a bit naive. We can argue it over and over, but I'm very convinced of the idea that an Islamic (or an Aristotelean) lives in a completely different world, in which words have other meanings (even things which seem unambiguous to you), which one cannot grasp, if you are not in this world. If you don't, than that's a respectable position though. Just like being a pacifist muslem is a defendable and respectable position.</p>
<p>At least, I'm sure that gay people who flee from Iran, because they'll be hanged there, think our society is better for them, but our minister of migration wants to send them back. But that's our problem. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 23:38, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think our positions are to clear: but one final note the Quran can't be wrong, only your interpretations of that book can be negative. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 09:05, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You do realize that this is a translation of the original text in to English, (the Quran was not written in English!). I took a Latin and Greek in high school: translation of ancient texts is always a matter of interpretation. As a philosophy student I read Nietzsche and Heidegger: the same thing, you can't just read their German, you have to interpret the text, to understand it, in your own way.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore religious text are often metaphorical and can be interpreted differently.</dd>
<dd>Finally if you like me believe that truth depends on group opinion, like I do, than semen comes from your lowerback if you're a muslem, just like if you are an Aristotelean the things fall because they seek their natural place.</dd>
<dd>There is not one external objective truth, at least for me. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 10:14, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I really believe is that there is no objective and realist way to tell where semen comes from. <i>Anything goes</i>. Only if you accept certain basic assumptions ("the scientific method leads to objective knowledge") this can be true. Off course <i>I</i> believe in evolution theory (I think this is an extremely convincing theory), but I have to accept that according to some people we were made from clay by God. These people live in a different paradigm, in a different world: a world where some God created the world in seven days, made people from clay and from other people's bones, and sent his son to be crucified. I might not believe in that but Christians do, and how stupid I may think such a perspective is, it is true for them. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 10:38, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The core of pragmatism is that there is no objective way to gain knowledge, so we have to deal with it in another, in this case pragmatic way.</dd>
<dd>The core of my argument is that <i>all</i> religion suffers from the same problems Islam does, so attacking Islam is arbitrarily chosing one religion and bashing that. And that's very dangerous. You appear to have chosen this group not because their argument is flawed but for some other reason. Why have you chosen to crusade against Islam? The United States could use some atheist missionaries to prevent gay marriage from being banned, end polygamy amongst morms, prevent evolutionary theory to be removed from schools and to end the grasp of the Christian Right within the Republican Party on the government.</dd>
<dd>Paradigm shifts are inherently problematic. Consider the copernican revolution, for one moment all the people thought the world was the centre of the universe and then the sun was. Their world radically changed.</dd>
<dd>BTW do you know where semen comes from? Do you know the exact translation of the sentence? If lower back just means "the area above your legs and below your chest" it is a pretty good description.</dd>
<dd>Although I <i>really</i> don't understand the last sentence, I agree with the previous bit, you can't hold an individual of a religion responsible for his beliefs he is raised that way. Therefore trying to convert them is probably not useful either. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 23:10, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you don't really care where semen comes from it is very useful to believe that it comes from somewhere down below, you have an answer and you can focus on more important things.</dd>
<dd>Ahh, the bloody edges of Islam, you do realize that two of the largest conflicts currently were caused by aggressive American (Christianity inspired) foreign policy (Iraq and Afghanistan) and one is kept in a cycle of violence because of American support for one of the two sides (Israel).</dd>
<dd>And the Old Testament does not sanctify rape and pillage? And as always how well you've read the Quran doesn't really matter, you can't understand a religion unless you're in it. The majority of muslems in the Netherlands do not rape, pillage or make war on a regular basis. Who are you to say that they practize their religion badly? It is there religion!</dd>
<dd>When Christianity was dominant in Europe 500-1500 Europe was characterized by war, rape and pillage, and Islam was a relatively peaceful and tolerant religion, that actually read and incorporated Aristotelean philosophy in their religion.</dd>
<dd>What are they supposed to do? "leave their own" what do you mean by that.</dd>

<dd>So group A pillages, murders, invades Iraq and Afghanistan and fares war, but you say "Hey they are not doing what their scriptures tell them, in my interpretation, but they do do the same as the entire Old Testament exemplifies so I wont bother them with that" and group B pillages, murders and fares war and you say "Hey they are doing what their scriptures tell them to, in my interpretation, so I am going to bother them with that". In both cases there is suffering but you chose one and not the other: because you are prejudiced against one of them. In my view both bring suffering.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore there are good reasons to say that Islam is/was actually the more enlightened religion.</dd>
<dd>The position of the Jews under Islamic control in the Middle Ages, in Spain and the Balkans was <i>much</i> beter then the way they were treated in the Christian countries. In Islamic countries (you the religion that starts of by murdering thousands of Jews) they have to pay some increased taxes and in Europe they suffered from pogroms, (while their saviour was himself a Jew). Did you realize that the reconquista triggered a huge migration of Jews to outside of Spain, because Islam treated Jews better than Christianity?</dd>
<dd>When the muslims invaded Spain it was ruled by warlords, when they left, they left cities, trading posts, culture and castles.</dd>
<dd>About Thomas of Aquinas, Islam incorporated Aristoteles in their religion when it was founded, Christianity only did so 1000 years after it was founded. Which one is the more enlightened religion?</dd>

<p>I keep up bring up Christianity to point your hypocrisy: Christianity is fine, but Islam is evil. It is extremely inconsistent. Both religions defended slavery, pillaged, fared war and raped. I don't see a difference: both religions interpreted their Holy Scriptures in such a way that this was acceptable. You agree with one interpretation but disagree with another. This depends on your interpretation and not the "nature" of the religion, because that does not exist. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 16:55, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The lack of civility in your tone is of the dogmatism of your position. To you it may appear that I have no knowledge of religion, but you are extremely dogmatic in your interpretation. Like I do not want to see the inherent aggressiveness of Islam, you do not want to see the simple fact that you are basing your dogmatic position on the subjective interpretation of an outsider.</dd>
<dd>The real issue here is that you attack one faith and defend another based on your own arbitrary interpretation of those religions, denying the simple fact that people who live in a religion best know how that religion works.</dd>
<dd>And that in the end is your business as well. But the danger of your position is that as long people feel the need to attack Islam the societies on this side of the Atlantic will further segregate into an Islamic minority and a liberal/Christian majority, where the Islamic minority feels the need to embrace its own religion, in the defense of fundamentalist liberal attacks and to defend its own interest. A natural reaction against such (intellectual) aggression, but this will not bring a harmonious and stable society.</dd>
<dd>Your dogmatism might be harmless on that side of the Atlantic, but on this side relativism is a necessity. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 08:35, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are tuns of liberal muslims in the Netherlands, since I'm very interested in politics, I can point you to prominent Dutch politicians who are both muslim and preach Dutch values: Naima Azough (greens), Tofik Dibi (greens), Mohammed Rabbae (greens) Fatimah Elatik (social-democrats), Khadija Arib (social-democrats), Samira Abbos (social-democrats), Nebahat Albayrak (social-democrats), Ahmed Aboutaleb (social-democrats), Fatma Koser Kaya (social-liberals), Nihat Eski (christian democrats), Coşkun Çörüz (christian democrats), Hikmat Mahawat Khan (populists). All of them are religious muslim but still operate within parties that preach western values. Euro-islam is reality! And we can foster this development by not crusading against these religions but show tolerance. You can't just wave these people away and say: they don't know islam, because for me (and them) you can know islam by being islamic. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 13:38, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two things,</dd>
<dd>First, if you are so committed to truth as you say you are free-speech is one of your most fundamental rights: no government should ever ban an opinion because there is a chance that it is true</dd>
<dd>Second, jailing people (btw, because most of these Imams are non-European, we can send them out of the country) will do what now? It will only increase the feeling of segegration and discrimination of those muslems, making terrorism more not less likely. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 08:14, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I defend the freedom of speech, of any person, on basis of Mill's argument (in <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Liberty_7773.html" title="On Liberty">On Liberty</a>). He's a famous pragmatist towards morality and a realist towards truth, but I think his opinion is compatible with pragmatism towards truth. He says that we should never forbid one opinion for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a chance (even a minute chance) that this opinion is true, than you'd be banning a truth. Societies can have strong consensus about untruth (in your argument Iran for instance does);</li>
<li>If the opinion is untrue, it should not be forbidden because defending your opinion against those of others in an intellectual debate will prevent your opinion from becoming a dogma. If other opinions are allowed to exist, you'll be forced to constantly defend your own position: instead of hammering a truth in stone, you are forced to live it.</li>
</ol>
<p>You shouldn't ban nazi rallies or deport orthodox imams, because it is beneficial for society to debate these issues. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 13:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One point about your last post: you said that people should integrate into Dutch society. Simple question: which Dutch society. I don't believe that there is one set of Dutch values which 90% of the people share. There is a lot of debate and insecurity in the Netherlands about our own identity. In the end I think that migrants can not be assimilated into one Dutch society, because it doesn't exist. <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 10:15, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're wrong <i>Islam doesn't give license for muslims to kill critics of islam.

<dd>Of course not. Why do you think so. Islam is something and Muslims are something else. For example when you call all of the Muslims terrorist, although it's unjust but it doesn't relates to Islam exactly.

<dd>I am sorry again, but there are many verses of Quraan that tell that do not kill them until they slaughter you. I have examples in your own talk page(<a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a>). Brother, if all the people of palestine become Jews, Israel will welcome all of them. Here the difference starts. In the past, Israel has given its nationality to all the Jews of the world. We all know that. They only reason why they stopped this because they had many people converting to Jews just for nationality. In any other case, they say WELCOME. What you will say about this? If you are the citizen of USA, you will say that we don't have to do anything with Israel. No my respected friend, it is only USA behind the scenes. You can clearly see the USA protecting Israel in UNO.</dd>

<p>I do not know but you could never get right figures. My request to you would be to stay away from bringing carcass out from the cupboard. Why do you want this? Do you think that the women raped go and report? Even in some cases they may not tell their husband, father, mother or brother-sister even. Killing was on both sides even rapes could be on both sides. The figures could be absolute false (on higher side). Why know this and compare or keep it open for debate? Most of the victims and accused may not be living now. Balance must be old. What is the sense of opening the wound and adding venom against each other? Not justifying but the rapes and killings on Indian women do not take place now by own relatives? My uncalled for advise, divert your mind to something else.</p>
<p>I searched on Wikipedia and found no results. Which invasion are you talking about?</p>

<p>Aminz and Arrow740. This is too much. Remember wikipedia policies re to verifiabilty, notable sources and so on. Saying Muslims are anti-semites (re pigs and dogs) or Jewish are racists (chosen people) is OR. It is so damn obvious that there are people out there who are Muslims anti-semites or Jews recists. So what?! IMHO, as i always love to be clear and not looking to be mean or offend anyone but if you both understand this than you are into the game of wikipedia. If not than you are a pain in the ass just abusing your knowledge.</p>
<p>If Arrow740 thinks Muhammad was anti-semite than it is his POV and no problem w/ that. On the other hand, if Aminz argues that it is not the case than it is his POV and no problem w/ that. BUT DON'T MAKE A FUSS OUT OF IT. Your problem guys is that you got a temperament and that's not a good thing to edit this encyclopaedia. You got to leave that temperament in your closet and walk the way out w/o it. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> → <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki Me Up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 11:25, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your message. I dont edit here frequently so I apologize I'll not be able to participate much for now but I saw the issue. I think there should be an effort to split that page into more divisible sections. Its very long. The splitting up will help reduce the edit wars in my opinion and let you make your points. Also another way to make sure your edits stay in place is to make sure your view is balanced and includes the other side as well (thats the way it ends up here anyway). Splitting up is the first thing that should be done.--JohnsAr 01:18, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

I've requested for a mediation, here <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_Reforms_under_Islam_%28610-661%29_da67.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Reforms under Islam (610-661)">Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Reforms under Islam (610-661)</a>.

<p>It was not pro-Islam material, but a short overview of the academic view on the matter.

<p>Surely you've heard of Sam Shamoun's nasty little insults on all opposing him? And surely you know of Faithfreedom.org's constant insults to Islam (I.E showing pictures of Muhammad just to annoy Muslims)?</p>
<p>I shouldn't have said "lies" (for some people will just reject that they're lies no matter what); but rather I should've said that they insult and violate Islam so much that you shouldn't use them as a source for critics.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmyrifle9_e75f.html" title="User:Armyrifle9">Armyrifle</a> 00:39, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Add on - About the "lies in the Qur'an", they claim that the Qur'an says stuff about "killing infidels" and such, but it's the Hadith that claim that. It may not sound like something to make an argument about, but it is (IMHO). <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmyrifle9_e75f.html" title="User:Armyrifle9">Armyrifle</a></p>
<p>Add on - I can debate you about the Qur'an endlessly, but I don't want to. My main point is that Ali Sina and Sam Shamoun (of faithfreedom.org and Answering Islam, respectively) are known for their blatent insults to one's religion and violating one's religion thus ignoring what you (the Muslim) ask from them (such as Ali Sina posting pictures that clearly show Muhammad's face). Thus, you shouldn't really use them for sources of debate, seeing as to how they do these things blatently, what's stopping them from lying about the religion so that it can lose a few converts?</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmyrifle9_e75f.html" title="User:Armyrifle9">Armyrifle</a></p>
<p>It seems you have perverted what I said. I did not state that I don't like them because they disagree with me. If that was the case, I wouldn't continue to get into this argument because there would be no case for me to attack them with.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that there is nothing stopping them from lying about Islam seeing as to how they hate the religion so much. If I debated a Christian, I wouldn't lie about his/her religion seeing as to how I'm a critic. These people (Ali Sina/Sam Shamoun) have shown their hatred for Islam and what I'm trying to say is that there is nothing stopping them from lying, and that some have even claimed that they were lying (and have contradicted themselves).</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmyrifle9_e75f.html" title="User:Armyrifle9">Armyrifle</a></p>
<p>I'll refer to what I said earlier.</p>
<p>"but rather I should've said that they insult and violate Islam so much that you shouldn't use them as a [reliable] source for critics."</p>

<dd>Why do you assume I was thinking about some kind of "conspiracy"? Or was that a joke? Conspiracy was the furthest thing from my mind. In fact I was really just curious, because of how you wrote it ... "we're all" and because you injected it into a conversation between two other people as if you wanted it to be heard. I think that's enough to make anyone curious. Thanks for the clearly logical response--the people who think he's unreliable dream of proving it.

<dd>"I think you're fighting a losing battle if you think your work on wikipedia will cause more people to believe that the religion of God is Islam." you asked me a question, the answer is there in the arabic. i don't know how you derived this statement though. quickly, i'm not talking about merely the poem which is accepted as a forgery. i am talking about Guillame's actual reconstruction of ibn ishaq for which he states he used plenty of other sources, which suggests we don't have ibn ishaq's original work today. regardless, what you may find 'morally objectionable', i do not in the least.</dd>
<dd>ibn hisham in general is not bad at all, for the most part it is pretty accurate. it is a basic historical text which even very new students of knowledge cover. yet you talk of it as if it's something you have just uniquely discovered (as you do with all polemic you espouse): do you out of naivety assume that all Muslims do not know more about the sira than you, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Spencer_4b9f.html" title="Robert Spencer">Robert Spencer</a> <i>et al.</i>? some of what the uneducated polemicists present in the form of evidences is true, yet many times it's either what they don't say, or <i>how</i> present the evidences which is the real deception.</dd>

<dd>i wouldn't ask as my interest has not been stimulated, and the answer is already in the Book of Allah. approaching something with an open mind necessitates not possessing preconceived notions, which i am not convinced you have achieved. these apparent external contradictions are all very easily explicable, internal even moreso, the answers are there if you would but sincerely search for them. i won't remove your lattermost comment per your request, though i repeat that i have no interest in discussing this with you. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 14:29, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, actually I have carefully examined them many times and have read many of their articles since they are the standard Islamophobic hate websites. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 14:05, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well there's a lot I disagree with. That bigot Ali Sina loves cherrypicking. Bring him a quote from any book that seems to make the Prophet look bad and he'll love you. Bring him a quote that does the opposite and he'll start a rant about how it's not reliable even if it's from the same book. He also seems to have a big ego. If you happen to start a debate with him, he's already the winner (it doesn't matter what the opposing sides arguments are). Why? Because since he is the owner of the website, he's the judge of the debate as well. Do you know why Ali Sina would never debate in public? Because if he did, everyone would see that he is actually not a Persian, but an American born here in the states. That would shoot down the credibility of all the rest of his arguments. It has nothing to do with "I'm scared of Muslims." He's such "a big debater" and can't even get the courage to tell his own "Muslim family" of his own apostacy? But anyway, he was never Muslim, and there's no proof that he ever was other than his testimony and nor do I believe has a Muslim family. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 14:19, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What I think of his arguments about Islam are quite simple actually: I'm Muslim. People like <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Sina_7a6a.html" title="Ali Sina">Ali Sina</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Spencer_4b9f.html" title="Robert Spencer">Robert Spencer</a> don't need to tell me what "true" Muslims believe in and that the only true Muslims are people like Osama. Why? Because I'm Muslim and I can figure it for myself without the assistance of people who are simply riding the wave of and trying to cash in on the surge of anti-Muslim bigotry. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 14:26, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you think I start compiling a list of errors or bias while I'm reading their articles? No, I don't, but there are a lot of other websites that already do that. All other Muslims are perfectly capable of finding the true nature of Islam as long as they are not brainwashed by people like Osama. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 14:33, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have found that it is best to examine the motives of the person who states such an idea. Ali Sina consistently names types of logical fallacies while he's debating, and yet you've never noticed all the sorts of evidence against his ideas that he chooses to ignore. This is called a "biased sample." <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 14:59, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is consistency, which these arguments do not have. Ali Sina will pick any quote from Sahih Muslim, for example, that supports his POV and use it, and reject any quote that doesn't support his POV simply based on his POV. You are already familiar with this, I'm sure. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 15:13, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My dear brother, You said that Islam means Submission, not Peace. I agree with you. This is also a well known meaning, but there are many others. Islam means submission to Allah's will. I Honestly and deeply agree with you. But my dear brother, your study of Islam is not at all. Actually, you are looking at Islam from a false angle. I'll give you a little example, easy for the average person, who knows Muslims.<br />
You may have observed that when the Muslims meet with each other, they say "Assalam-o-Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu". Which means "Be Peace and Mercy of Allah on (all of) you".<br />
Obviously, you can say that that it means that "be submission on all of you". I'll still agree with you my dear friend. This never forcing you to the Submission. The Anti-muslims will tell you only those meanings to you so that they can prove that the Islam forces to the submission.</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p>My dear friend, I'll tell you an interesting fact. Many Muslims say that it is not right to say "Assalam-o-Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu" to non-muslims. So, many Muslims who will not say this to you. They are not doing good. Our Prophet Muhammad himself said SALAM to many non-Muslims.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Now, if the Salam means Submission to God(Revert to Islam), then why some Muslims do not say these words to non-Muslims. The fact may be interesting to you that the word "Salam" means Peace, or exectly, it means non-violence. Islam is derived from Salam. It means Peace. If you have any Indian friend, ask him what the word "SHAANTI" means. He will say Peace, or "Be Peace". When the Indians quarrel, they use these words:"Shaanti! Shaanti!" to attain peace. The word "Shaanti" of Hindi(Indian) is the same of the Word "Salamati" in Urdu and "As-Salam" in Arabic. All these mean Peace.<br />
Now you may think that if they have the word Islam from Salam, then the meaning will also be changed. No my brother, not at all. 'Salam' is the VERB and 'Islam' is its NOUN. This difference is just like the difference in 'Be Peaceful' and 'Peace'.<br />
I hope that my brother's question is answered.<br />
<br />
Regarding your next question related to your Quraanic verse against non-Muslims, Please read the following carefully:</p>
<p>This is a Quraanic Verse: <b>2:191, "And slay them wherever ye catch them"</b><br /></p>
<p>Imagine for a non-Muslim to read this simple yet highly thunderous line under the heading "Quran's teaches about non-Muslims". Initial thoughts? shock? horror? what a cruel and disgusting way of deluding people. What Mr Sina doesn’t tell the relatively unaware reader is; if you read verse 2:190 all the way through to 2:194, you gain a very different picture, one which if read in full may even provoke alternative thought. Lets read it in full and see….</p>
<p><b>"Fight in the way of Allah against those <i>who fight against you</i>, but begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors. <i>And</i> slay them wherever ye find them, and <i>drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter</i>. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship <i>until they first attack you there</i>, but <i>if they attack you</i> (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers. But if they desist, then lo! <i>Allah is Forgiving, Merciful</i>. And fight them <i>until persecution is no more</i>, and religion is for Allah. But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrong-doers. The forbidden month for the forbidden month, and <i>forbidden things in retaliation</i>. And one who attacketh you, attack him in like manner as he attacked you. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is with those who ward off (evil)." <i>2:190-194</i></b><br />
<br />
Now my brother, Fight against fight is 100% according to the Golden rule!. You might say that there is no need for fighting in the MODERN WORLD. If the world is so modern, why the fight will occur? And when there will be no fight(attack), there will be no response as attack. Also, This verse does not means that every one starts fighting with wrong ones, but this the duty of the state to stop the attackers. The civilians are never asked to fight. However, in the days when the Islam was spreading, there were so many jelous people all around there. The tried to kill the Prophet Muhammad. There were no courts at that time, no Law, they were thirsty of the Muslim blood. That is why, Prophet had to migrate from his hometown Mecca, to the nearby City Madina. Those killers were again jelous, they tried to prove the Muhammad false, as there are enemies for every good man. If you were at that time, what could you do?<br />
The reason why Islam was against the Jews is that there were many Jews neaby and all around the city Madina. They were also against Muhammad due to their faith.</p>
<p>&lt;vr&gt;&lt;vr&gt; Once the Muslims had to buy a well from those at much high cost, to drink water(yes, high cost for water!!! even when those jews were rich. They didn't allowed muslims to drink water from their wells). After buying the water from them, Muslims opened the well free for all. Not for only Muslims, but for all. For those Jews also.<br />
<br />
Now, Ali Sina can prove that I am against the Jews. So he can tell the jews and ask them to kill me by his LOGICAL GUN. But my brother, am I calling the jews bad as a whole? But the Ali Sina can think of that(he can also prove!!!). He was never a Muslim because Muslims read these stories in schools. Ali Sina never told any of them to you. He just says that he is an ex-Muslim, so that you people believe that those translations are true.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Dear brother, the person Ali Sina tells you the big big lies. You can browse the following link to have some of your answers: <a href="http://www.faithfreedom.com/ali_sina_exposed/sinas_unbelievers_explained.html" class="external text" title="http://www.faithfreedom.com/ali_sina_exposed/sinas_unbelievers_explained.html" rel="nofollow">Ali Sina Exposed</a><br />
<br />
I don't know who is behind this website. This is just a small website. But Ali Sina represents this site to be the Major Opponent to make the visitors fool. Thats a few pages website.<br />
<br />
If you want to know about Islam, go there: <a href="http://harunyahya.com/m_site.php" class="external text" title="http://harunyahya.com/m_site.php" rel="nofollow">Harun Yahya.com</a><br />
<br /></p>
<p>You can also read the RELIGION OF ALI SINA(are you shocked when I used the word religion?) here:<br />
<a href="http://www.globalfreemasonry.com/global_freemasonry.html" class="external text" title="http://www.globalfreemasonry.com/global_freemasonry.html" rel="nofollow">Ali Sin'a RELIGION!!!</a></p>
<p><br />
I hope that you'll not mind if you have to read some of the text by open eyes. No other Faith has such great Idiology. The other religions are nearly vanished(its hard to find a christian, all those you see around are just labled christians. Many of them are athiests). Islam is the only religion(left) which cannot be vanished by sword because it has the power of reply, the Power of Resistance. It has the sword for defence. Ali Sina wants to take this sword from us. It just like a robber may have to steel the gun from guard before he can play the GAME. But the rules of Islam are very strict. It can not be vanished by logic, as it itself has the Logic. Similarly, it can not be vanished by Power, as it itself has the Power. But my dear, this power is the power of resistence. The more you punch a wall, the more you get injured.</p>
<p>Again, my dear friend, Ali Sina will tell you that this person thinks that ONLY Islam has the power and only Islam is true. My dear brother, if you read christianity, you'll find Muhammad there. If you read Hinduism, you'll find Muhammad there. There are clear indications in those books. But those books are changed by man. No christian can prove that the Bible is word of God. Even if he proves, the which Bible will he prove? My dear brother, we have the Quraan. We also have Hadis, but the Hadith is not exactly the holy word of God, it is a collection made, years after Muhammad. Quran was always kept in the same text. After 1400 years, no word of it has been changed. But again, Ali Sina changes it while the translation. Or he only shows you one side. If I say that "My student said that 2+2=5", then I am not wrong. But Ali sina can prove me wrong with his stupid LOGICAL gun by taking the text "2+2=5". He can prove me wrong. But in an illogical way, while using the LOGICAL GUN. Isn't he really great.</p>
<p><br />
At last, my dear friend, we call the Christians and Jews as the "People of the Book". They are our brothers. May be you are also. Islam never forces a non-Muslim to become Muslim. BUT those who deny ALLAH, Allah will punish them. Every man born in the universe, at least once in his life believes in ONE GOD. But then he becomes BUSY. That's ok, but when he denies Allah, Allah does not like this. My friend, today, please look in the mirror at yourself. Are you created by a chance? You are composed of trillions if cells. Out of them, only once cell is a super computer, far more faster and perfect then the one computer in front of you. Can man create one single cell? Even if after all the scientific improvements, it creates life, then how the first life was created? If the man created a man is no proof that the man is created by Chance.<br />
On the other hand, the creation of a man is again indication to the creator. The one. Who is not born, He does not has children.<br />
<br />
Can you take me to the end of the universe? Can anyone. Can anyone???? Can you just Imagine it?????<br />
Then for what you deny the LORD, the Allah, the creator?<br />
If I use a pirated copy of a software, the software house will start case against me in the court. I cannot use a copyrighted CD while changing the credentials to me, or anyother. This will be illegal. In this modern world, the man has learnt the RESPECT OF COPYRIGHT. Allah never says to stop efforts. He says that more you go deep, more you will find the signs of Allah.<br />
But respect the credit to Allah, being the creator. That is what the humanity tells and this is the real GOLDEN RULE that you have to respect all and their credentials. If you do not respect this, then how you can be called a modern human?<br />
My brother, again, Ali Sina can warn you that I am adressing to you as a ____. He can use any word, he has a good vocabulary, but of of bad words.<br /></p>
<p><br />
Dear brother, I stop here and please, I do not want a debate with you.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>At the end, I would like to say you "ASSALM-O-ALAIKUM", which means "May Peace and Mercy of Allah on all of you".</p>

<p>I believe that there will be a day when man will be finally able to create a man. That (artificial) man will have lot of more power then us. He will have lots of more abilities then the man we have today. Dear brother, we will give him its own will. How we will stop him frim the sins.<br />
We will teach him:"O Robot! if you will be doing the sins, do not forget that we have set a time period in you! After that, you will be expired. You cannot go anywhere, we will identify each and every of your cell. Then you will have to turn to us and that will be your Day of Judgment. You have to answer the question we will ask. If you were found guilty, we will burn your IC's, your CPU and We will distrub your communication system. No one will be able to help you, the sinners. SO, always be away from the sins." May be you will also like to add these lines:"If people try to use you for sins, stop them by hands, this will be the best option for you. If you could not stop by hands, stop by your tounge. If you cannot stop them by your tounge, never believe in them because this the least we can expect from you. If you believed in them, you will be in great loss."<br />
Actually, we will be teaching him ISLAM, the true religion, the religion for us by the creator.<br />
<br />
The God gave ourself the power of will, the idea of good and bad. Every person in the universe, at least once in his lifetime believes in a single God. Nearly everyone believes in God, but the people who convert to disbelievers, they have just one or two points to prove their logic.<br />
On the day judgment, Those people will be asked why they denied the God? and they will give the logics like you. There will be a question:"Didn't you see the clear signs?". They will have no answers. In fact that those will be in graet loss that day!<br />
<br />
You can disbelieve God if you never saw miracle in your body. But no person disbelieves honestly. They are not honest to theirselves. they kill their innerself by their own hands. The God never kills the innerself. This is the man who kills his human nature for superiority.<br />
<br />
We are sent to this world to worship God. But it is the SATAN, who will not let us worship the God. He is our enemy and he gives us great rewards when we do sins. He gives us great initiatives.<br />
<br />
I believe that the Person like Hitlor can go straight to heavens if there were no signs of Allah for him. But this is not possible. This is the satan that agreed him to have the temporary joy. Temporary is always temporary. He did this for joy. He also had the innerself like all of us have. The Satan did not killed his innerself. The Hitlor killed his innerself with his OWN hands. That was a deal between Satan and Hitlor. Hitlor wanted the temporary fun/joy/happiness. Hitlor paid in human skulls and satan returned the money, the land and many other rewards to him. I believed that many times, Hitlor thought that it was not good, but then, he found his joy again in the bloodshed. He denied God. If this was not happened, Hitlor will go straight to heavens.<br />
<br />
That is case with you and me. We have done many sins that we don't know. May be i have killed a person by some accident. I disobeyed the redlight and gone away, may be there were many killed behind the scene due to this. If I don't knew that, I'll not be questioned.<br />
<br />
But in this case this question will be asked to the state, my parents, my teachers. Why you did not told him the law. So my brother the God did not created any problem for us. we create problems for ourselves by diobeying or disbelieving God. If you disobey God, may be sometime you obey him and revert to the truth. If you disbelieve, you have no logic. You have denied the truth. You have denied the true signs.<br />
<br />
<br />
God is never injust with the man. <b>He says clearly that stop the evil by hand. If not possible, stop by tounge. If still not possible never believe in evil, this is the least expected from man.</b> My dear respected brother, I am glad to know that you believe in One God. The message of God I just written is the Concept Of <b>JIHAD</b> in Islam. This is actually the Golden Rule. This is the most misunderstood philodophy.<br />
<br />
So, you can be a great mant in the sight of Allah, even if you disbelieve in evil. But this does not means that close your eyes before the evil comes. Try to stop at any level. Try to defeat him. Even it is defeat of evil if you disbelieve in evil. The evil will cry. You will win and you will go straight to heavens, no dout about that.<br />
<br />
The cause we reject the other religions is not that they are bad. We first believe in Jesus and the other Prophets. No muslim is a muslim if he does not believes in Jusus.<br />
But you also know that these are religions have nearly no power against evil. You may never find a true Hindu in USA. In america, you cannot believe in Hinduism. This clearly takes you to the disbelieve in God. You become a disbeliever of God. Same case with Christianity. The weak logics will make people disbelieve in God. Islam is the only religion which has the force of resistance, the force of reaction. The harder you punch the wall, the more you get injured.<br />
<br />
<br />
The people like Ali Sina clearly tell lies to you. They are not new in Islam. Islam has clear instruction about people like that. They cannot make a single believer to disobey God. But they produce questions. If a Muslim rejects Islam, he rejects all the other religions. Will you give a thousand dollars and take one dollar instead? So a muslim can not be a good christian, he cannever be a hindu, he can never take other religion. The only option left is the religion of disbelief. So my respected brother, if we start believing secularism, it initiates to disbelief in God. <b>So the non-believers usually come to you as seculars</b>. My friend never obey them. The are not seculars. Why they come to you if they are seculars. They just initiate the disbelief. Islam is a challange to them.<br />
My dear friend, com and defeat the evil just by disbelief in evil. You don't have to do anything difficult there.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that my brother's question is answered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yours respectfully,<br />

<p>My dear brother, forst of All, I would like to say <b>Assalam-O-Alaikum</b>, which means may Peace and Mercy(of Allah) be on you all. Then, sorry for not reading your first message completely.<br />
<br />
<b>Undesting a Text</b><br />
You may know the great English writer William Shekspear(please correct me if the spelling is wrong). If you translate the books of William Shekspear to Hindi and give the translations to an Indian ans request those books to read himself, may be he would stop reading after reading some pages and get bored. By chance, if he reads them fully(this will be a difficult task), he will tell you that the author is mad(remember that hi is saying to william shekspear). If by chance, you give this book to a person who is against English or Mr. William, what he will say, you know it better my friend, there is no need for me to explain. Now, concider if you give this book to a person who is against English and William and you also REQUEST him to write against these books. In this case, if you give him on book, he will write 100 against William and his writings. That is why the William is only studied in English. The people who teach his books are from english background. Isn't this a possibility that every person gives you a different meaning. But if an English-knowing person will tell you it will become interesting for you to read it. Brother, I hope you understand that fact.<br />
<br />
<b>Telling Lies: A human right??</b><br />
Same case is with Islam. We believe it to be the word of God. The second authentic book(s) near us is the collection of Hadith books. Majorly, we believe 6 books to be authentic. No SINGLE person who has average knowledge of Islam believes that these 6 books are completely authentic. By using word authentic, we do not say that it is the word of God Almighty. By authentic, we do not say that these are 100% the words of our beloved Prophet Muhammad. These are not even the words of their companions. These are the referances. We have methods to verify a hadith. I do not want to go into detail, but my dear brother, these were collected in the form of books years after Muhammad(may be centuries), and by different personalities. The Quraan is authentic near us. It was written on thousands of HEARTS!. There are millions of People who may not know the meanings, but have preserved all of its words into thir memory. Still, after 14400 years, this is never changed. There is no tolerance for those who change it. If someone tries to change this, I'll be the first to stop. I'll have no fear. I'll like to die but to preserve the Quraan. I believe that every Muslim will be the first to stop. We have NO FEAR when we defend our religion. We do not request ANY benifit to protect the religion. My dear friend, those people have found tricks!. The come to you you and tell you that the religion is wrong. That's Ok, every one has the right to say, but the truth. They come to you and tell lies. Is telling lies a HUMAN RIGHT?<br />
<br />
<b>Mother of all the Sins</b><br />
My respected brother, telling lies is the sin that is the cause of nearly all the other sins. The prophet Muhammad said that Lie is the mother of all the sins. I can send you to jail or put you to death(not in all states of USA) by paying a few people to tell some lies in the court. So, this is not the HUMAN RIGHT. There is nothing to judge the statements. But my friend, when a person is exposed, he must have something in REWARD. The punishment must be able to have fear in the minds of general people to stop them from telling lies.<br />
<br />
<b>Mistakers vs Liers</b><br />
Sometimes, people tell something to you that is not true. If they also didn't know that. The are not the liers, they are mistakers(not a correct word, i am not very good at english). But they must be warned. Brother you can think that Ali Sina may be a mistaker, but you can judge by his statements. I suppose you to be the respected Judge. I don't know you. Still that is clear to me that every one can understand my message, but he must be a HUMAN. I believe that you are!. I have already given examples to you.<br />

<br />
Regarding the verse you advised me to read. Quraan says that "Killing one innocent person is like killing all the mankind". You told me that this verse is about Jews only.<br />
<br />
I am very glad to know that your anti-Islam knowledge is quite well. My dear respected brother, I am sorry to say that your knowledge about Islam is not at all, not at all, not at all.<br />
First, read the single verse correctly, by open eyes, as well as open heart also.<br />
<br />
<b>(Quraan 005.032)Translation(YUSUFALI):</b><br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land."<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.032" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.032" rel="nofollow">Holy Quraan(005.032)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>The Reason Behind!(the words NOT IMPORTANT to you)</b><br />
May be you forgot to read the first three words:"On that account:". OR, you may have ignored those words as they are NOT IMPORTANT and you readed the IMPORTANT or relavent part, or the ACTUAL CONTEXT(according to the Ali Sina). Dear respected brother, here the game starts. I am sorry to say that it is a football match starting with (1000/0) score. The opposite team can never achieve that target in any way because there is a given rule of time. In this case, the rule is humanity. When we start answering, we must have to defend us by violating the humanity rules(e.g. time of play, in the football case). Here we are caught and get trapped. All the stadium says us to be bad. If we insist, we are the violaters. If we fight, we are the terrorists. We have no help, just absuses from all over the stadium. My voice is nothing against the crowd. The camera man displays the crowds and we are defeated by the Golden Rule of DEMOCRACY. Here we start campgain against the Democracy and according to the golden rules, we start behaving like animals. Then the evil starts and our football team is banned. Our practice grounds are banned. If we still resist, we are put into death!!!....???<br />
<br />
<b>Cause Of Fight...Money???</b><br />
Brother, if you have to take the money, say $1000000000000000. You will never take it from a person who has a tank and you have a small stone. You will not fight to take this money when you are alone and they are hundreds. You will never fight if you are a child and they are grown up. You can clearly see many children stoning on Israili tanks. Sometime you will find in India, and there are many other examples. Are they fighting for Money??? For women? For sex? Actually, they are put into this fire and the evil is very happy when their dead bodies burn in fire, when they are shooted, when their mothers and sisters are raped, when their Old fathers, young sons and brothers are killed in front of them and there is no justice. The remaining people cannot be the scientists, they cannot be the poets, they cannot be good for mankind. I'll say that that those who remain will not be the animals, they will be the WILD animals. This is the way the evil produces the wild animals and he is happy on the fast production.<br />
<br />
<b>Loss on BOTH Sides</b><br />
The evil is more happy when those animals again kill MAN on other side. On both sides, there is Man, The evil has played the GOLDEN MOVEMENT in the game and is now far away, just enjoying the rest of the game. All the Golden Rules are now against the innocents(of past). He(the evil) enjoys killing on both sides. He has no religion, he has no fear of God. That is why my brother, I do not believe in irreligion, or no-religion. The secularism also leads to irreligion.<br />
<br />
<b>I am not the final authority</b><br />
These problems start from the initial evils taken by the people like Ali Sina. I may be wrong. But O my friend, I suppose you to be the JUDGE of today. I suppose that you make the good decision according to your own sole.<br />
<br />
<b>The philosophy of Reason</b><br />
Comming to the point, if some one says to you:"Because of that reason, I'll kill you". You cannot prove him the killer until you prove that reason wrong. So, you may ask:"For what reason?". He will tell you that reason. (IMP:)He cannot say you that you have two eyes because that fits on himself. He will never say that you have brown hair, as this fits to many of his lovers. He will never tell you a reason that fits on a ggeneral man. AGAIN, he will not tell you a reason that fits on himself and on other people as general.<br />
<br />
So, the Prophet Muhammad must have to give the reason (that he believes or he has) that does not fits on Him, and the Muslims as a whole. So he will give a reason that does not fits on Islam as general.<br />
<br />
<b>The verses NOT IMPORTANT</b><br />
Now, what reason he gave can be read in the previous verses that were NOT IMPORTENT TO YOU. I hope that your english is better then of mine.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>"Recite to them the truth of the story of the two sons of Adam. Behold! they each presented a sacrifice (to Allah): It was accepted from one, but not from the other. Said the latter: "Be sure I will slay thee." "Surely," said the former, "Allah doth accept of the sacrifice of those who are righteous. If thou dost stretch thy hand against me, to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee: for I do fear Allah, the cherisher of the worlds. For me, I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well as thine, for thou wilt be among the companions of the fire, and that is the reward of those who do wrong. The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: he murdered him, and became (himself) one of the lost ones. Then Allah sent a raven, who scratched the ground, to show him how to hide the shame of his brother. "Woe is me!" said he; "Was I not even able to be as this raven, and to hide the shame of my brother?" then he became full of regrets. On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land."<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.027" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.027" rel="nofollow">Holy Quraan(005.027)</a></p>

<p><b>What are the actual Meaning</b><br />
I'll not tell you the Actuall meaning because. . . . . ..... <b>I may be a lier</b> in sight of you!<br />
<br />
<b>Use your Golden Rule or Humanity or anything to understand</b><br />
Alhamdulillah(thanks God), Alhamdulillah, and 100s and thousands of times Alhamdulillah, that the God has given you the eyes to see and the brain to understand. He has given you the world's most complex machinery. Man has not created a single computer like your ONE cell. You are the best of all the creatures. You are not an animal, you are the Human, the perfect. My friend use this gift from the ALLAH to understand these lines. If these verses are against the Golden Rule, come and take me in the court, in any court. If this is not the Golden Rule, if this is not the Humanity, I'll not be away from you at the Day of Judgment, I'll be in great loss if this is not the Golden Rule!!!. May my Allah protect me from telling a single lie. What you understand from these lines? Tell me my friend!<br />
<br />
<b>I am not The Judge</b><br />
My dear friend, I am NOT the judge. The final judge is OUR Allah. One can understand that the person told you this verse may not had read the Quraan. I accept my dear brother. Any thing can happen. BUT it is now your responsibility to tell the truth(whatever you understand now, whatever according to you and only you and your Golden Rule and your Humanity and your/OUR anti-terrorist philisophy) to that person.<br />
<br />
The people, like Ali Sina are not mistaking, the are denying Islam and spreading the misconceptuans. If you do not stop them, you are from them. The least accepted or expected is to not believing in them. If you believe or spread their evil thoughts, you will be a sinner and one day WE have to be in the court of Allah, wo will do justice with all(not only with the Muslims, but with ALL).<br />
<br />
<b>Dangers of these Lies</b><br />
The people who spread the misconceptuans are ACTUALLY responcible for the bloodshed ON BOTH THE SIDES. If you spread these misconceptuans, you will be responsible for a muslim killed by a non-muslim AND a non-muslim killed by a muslim(BOTH). Regardless of the the fact that who wins the game, you will put yourself in a GREAT LOSS, that the Quraan tells us about. And every man faces loss is due to some benifits that he had sawn before. BUT no one has seen the FINAL DAY. My dear brother, if someone becomes a billionaire or a trillionaire just due to telling one lie, the Golden Rule, the Quraan tells us that you cannot purchase happiness with money. Those millions and trillions of dollars will not help you in the grave and at the DAY OF JUDGMENT, those will be proofs of your sins.<br />
<br />
My dear brother, do not collect the proofs of your sins as these are against you. Do not get shares in the evil, you will have to share the punishment too. That punishment, no one knows about. We all have to revert to the origin, no one can hide. Cut yourself in thousands, what you(physical) will do with you(the not physical body). All of you will go to Allah and he will do the Justice.<br />
I hope that my brother's question is answered.<br />
<br /></p>
<p><b>Concept of God in Islam</b><br />
At the end, my dear brother, I'll like to tell you the concept of GOD in Islam, with a common example that you can understand, being a computer user.<br />
<br />
There are many popular games in the computer market/field. There are FPS games, there are turn-based games, there are real-time-strategy games. Many Programming languages are used to create those games. Nearly every pupular language has functions and sub routines. Please search if you are anot familiar to these words.<br />
I'll give you the example of Real-Time-Strategy games.<br />
The real-time strategy(RTS) games produce real time results. You can see reports at real time. Nearly in all gamea, you can view the real-time results when you pause the game. In RTS games have there is the option to view results of anynomous user at any time. The example is AGE of Empires, StrongHold Crusader, and there are many others<br />
<br />
So, if you play the RTS game, you can get report whenever your army kills or when it is killed/attacked. This report is real time, and for humans(us). There is report of nearly every thing that you want. The game developers can make anything in this game. The reports are every time the real-time reports. Do not forget that this system/software is created by man.<br />
In sight of Allah, we are like those characters of the game(not for fighting). The report is automatically sent to the God in real time, when we do any thing. Everything is recorded. To count our sins, the Allah has no need to place two physical bodies on our shoulders. My dear brother, these are the Sub-riutines and functions executed in real time when we do the sins. This simple logic may give you an idea(may be, not prove) of the existance of God and how the God gets informed of us.<br />
<br />
My brother, in those games, you can go anywhere. There can be no limits. You can go to -1000000000000000000x or +10000000000000000000x(dimensions), or -100000000000000000000y, or +10000000000000000000000y, same is the case for z-axis. There are virtually no limits. You can open the 3G Studio and can create a game af any dimensions, may be infinity.<br />
So, those characters of the game can go anywhere in the game. They can find everything in the game. They can go every where. They will never find the Human/Actual player. Where ever they go, cay cannever hide. We can find them by clicking one button. They cannever hide. They can be killed, vanished, burnt, lost, drawn. My dear brother, you have only ONE button to undo, so simple it is. Even when you are the end-user. The developers have even more options.<br />
<br />
God is more perfect then Man. He has created Man. The man can go anywhere, but there are two function or two sub-routines attached with him. Each and every of the sin is counted, the same for good works. Man can go to moon, he can go to mars, the sun, any other galaxy, anywhere he want to be, but he cannot reach the God. He(man) can create a Man, but he will remain created. Creating a man never means that first man was created by CHANCE. Man cannever hide himself from God. He has an age and he has to die one day. All the reports will be shown to him and he will not be able to deny them.<br />
<br />
This is the concept of God in Islam that is the BEST of all. No concept is so clear in that if you look it as open minded. If you deny God, There will ne no fear in your mind and this is the root of sins(may be your children, may be their children start the disbelief). You will have no fear. You'll break the rules if there is no police, or no fear of being noticed/catched. That is why my dear bother, I believe in God. Islam gives you no fear, but the fear in Allah ONLY.<br />
<br />
<br /></p>
<p>I hope that you do not mind as you do not mind those who tell thoses verses(true or lie, its now up to you!). You always have option to delete this content. I'll never say a word to you at all. But my dear brother, Please please read it ONCE carefully, by understanding and then delete this article. You are the FINAL authority. I AM A little CREATURE OF GOD. But my brother, do not neglect my message at all.<br />

<p>In fact Islam means submission, as (almost) everyone knows. Your statement that killing one person is the same as killing all of mankind is also incorrect. You can read three translations of the Qur'anic verse <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.032" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.032" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In fact you'll see that it is Muhammad telling the Jews that if they kill a Muslim, they'll be in serious trouble. The next verse gives possible (harsh) punishments for them, as well as for anyone who causes Muhammad "mischief." As regards Muslims hating rapists, that is another matter.

<dd>A lot of the stuff in your post was true, and I already knew it. I believe in God too, just not the storm god who started out as one god of many and ended up the god of Abraham. You might be interested to know that India is the most religious nation on Earth, and that is largely because of the Hindus. You said you didn't want to debate, and that's fine. Here's a question that's not really about Islam. Is God not perfect? Yes. Does that mean he is as forgiving and merciful as possible? Yes. Then why would he send a man to eternal hell? Why not give him another chance on earth, if he screwed up? <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 08:07, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<b>Lies in article "Itmam-al-Hujjah"</b><br />
The writer(<a href="../../../i/t/m/Itmam_al-hujjah.html" title="Itmam al-hujjah">Itmam_al-hujjah</a>) gives a referance of a Quraanic verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Indeed those who are opposing Allah and His Messenger are bound to be humiliated. The Almighty has ordained: I and My Messengers shall always prevail. Indeed Allah is Mighty and Powerful".—<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/058.qmt.html#058.020" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/058.qmt.html#058.020" rel="nofollow">Quraan(058.020-21)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the writer: <i>(this verse means that)The Qur’an asserts that when the truth is unveiled to a people in its ultimate form by a Messenger of God such that no one has any excuse to deny it, then the rejecters of this truth are punished in this <b>VERY WORLD</b>. The decision for this punishment is made by the God after various phases of the preaching mission. <b>In this way, the court of justice that will be set up one day before the God is set up in this VERY WORLD</b> and the reward of punishment which will take place on the Day of Judgement is rehearsed in this <b>VERY WORLD</b>.</i><br />
<br />
<b>Knowledge of Islam</b><br />
The writes has no knowledge of Islam, not at all, not at all, not at all.<br />
The writer may has never read the Quraan by OPEN EYES. He may have a search from any online version of Quraan with keywords:"punishment, day of judgement", etc and he was successfull to find a verse. He never read the Quraan with open eyes!<br />
<br />
<b>The Golden Movement</b><br />
The Golden Movement has been played before the game is started and there is no court in this world for me to take the writer in. BUT I believe that this writer will not be away from me at the Day of Judgment. He had collected proofs against himself and published these on Wikipedia. May Allah revert him to the religion of PEACE, only Islam.<br />
<br />
<b>Teachings of Quraan</b><br />
Dear brother, Alhamdulillah(thanks God), the Quraan is exactly the humanity with peace. You talked about the mission to make this world peaceful.<br />
Dear brother, according to Quraan, LIE is a single sin, but produces nearly all the sins. <b>Lie is the mother of all the sins</b>, all the wars. Nearly behind every sin, there is a hidden lie.<br />
<br />
<b>Question(s):</b><br />
My question to you is that:Can we make the world PEACEFUL if we allow the liers to speak whatever they want? Is telling lie the Humal Right? What your golden rules(not the Quraan, as you don't believe in it) tell? Here I must say that the Quraan states clearly that such people must be stopped.<br />
<br />
<b>Jihad, the Golden Rule of Humanity</b><br />
Allah says that stop them by hands(i.e. power). If this is not possible or suitable, then by toung(i.e. speach and writings). If still not possible/suitable, then do not believe in them and this is the least accepted.<br />
Alhamdulillah, this is the Golden Rule of Islam called Jihad. According to this defination, I am doing JIHAD. I am a mujahid. Now tell me that Jihad is against Humanity. No my brother, telling lies is against humanity, but you don't feel that! Stopping anythig against Humanity, at any SUITABLE level, is Jihad!<br />
<br />
<b>LIE, a single sin?</b><br />
If you analyze the history, all the wars start from some lies, so my brother, I know your answer to the questions. However, it will be my pleasure to have your answer. I repeat the Question:"Can we make the world PEACEFUL if we allow the liers to speak whatever they want? Is telling lie the Human Right? What your golden rules(not the Quraan) tell?"<br />
<br />
<b>Where the lie is?</b><br />
So my brother, you may think that I am just asking for the punishment of the writer without proving him wrong. Dear brother, I make you the Judge of today. Read the verses of the Quraan:<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/058.qmt.html#058.018" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/058.qmt.html#058.018" rel="nofollow">(058.018-as long as you can read!)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>translation:"One day will Allah raise them all up (for Judgment): then will they swear to Him as they swear to you: And they think that they have something (to stand upon). No, indeed! they are but liars! The Evil One has got the better of them: so he has made them lose the remembrance of Allah. They are the Party of the Evil One. Truly, it is the Party of the Evil One that will perish! Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be among those most humiliated. Allah has decreed: "It is I and My messengers who must prevail": For Allah is One full of strength, able to enforce His Will." <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/058.qmt.html#058.018" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/058.qmt.html#058.018" rel="nofollow">Quraan(058.018-as long as you can read!)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The actual Meaning: 'Very World', or the 'Day of Judgment'?</b><br />
The actual meaning of these verses are:.....<b>NO!, I'll tell you. I make you the Judge without knowing you.</b><br />
What these verses mean(tell me whatever they mean according to you)? Where you can find this <b>very world</b>? Don't these verses telling about the <b>Day of Judgment</b>?<br />
Are those writers telling you the truth? Have they read the Quraan? Have they any knowledge of Quraan? Does the Humanity allows them to continue spreading this message?<br />
<br />
My dear brother, If they are wrong, stop them. If I am wrong, stop me. You can defeat the evil by not believing in it. This is what the Golden Rule of Islam tells. They are not fooling a muslim, you non-muslims are becoming fool. I'll stop them in favour of you. They are telling that every man with sword is your enemy, while they hide their swords.<br />
No my dear brother, if a Muslim kills any innocent non-Muslim(or any man), this Islamic sword will be against that Muslim who kills the innocent. Actually, this sword of Islam is against everyone who kills any innocent, regardless of a Muslim or a non-Muslim.<br />
<br />
<b>The Final Decision</b><br />
Dear brother, we muslims are not to announce the FINAL decision. There is no court in the world who can identify the truth. Why we have courts in every city? If Islam is wrong, they are also wrong. But if both are wrong and we ban the Judgment in this very world, I think that day will be the worst day for humanity. You must have some resistance, but against evil. <b>In this world, there is no FINAL judgment. But we should stop the evil at any level</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Rules as well as forece to implement!</b><br />
Can you prevent yourself from snakes by creating rules? Can you? Can anyone?<br />
But you can prevent man from sins by making rules. These rules are not against man, but to protect man from the evil of man. It is a truth that these rules stop many sins, but not all. Sometimes when that man behaves like a snake, your rules cannot do anything. You must use force, otherwise, it'll be toooo late. Using force, you must not be evil, as there is the FINAL day of Judgment and you will know the actual truth!<br />
<br />
By telling lies, those writers are actually hiding themselves behind you. They are creating a human shelter. They are telling you that this person is Mad. He will also kill you. So you also become against the Muslims. Those people never tell you about their sins. Someday, you will be finding them. They can be the Nazis, they can be the Israilis(not jews!) and similarly, they can be the Al-Qaida and Saddam. My dear friend, it will be interesting to you and a fact that the Talibaan, Al-Qaida and Saddam had very good relations with USA in the Past. This a half truth, the full is that USA produced them. Taliban were produced against Russia. Saddam against Arab. Now, America got enough power that it does not need them. So it'll try to destroy them.<br />
<br />
USA can drop the Atom-bomb. This country can play the magic shows like 9/11. This can use Islam against Russia as well as Islam itself. We must stop this country. Stop does not means that you go and fighting. The best thing you can do is:"Tell the truth and deny which is untruth". I hope that my message is clear to you!<br />
<br />
&#160;<br />
<br />
<b>The Second Lie, and there is NO END!</b><br />
The writer(<a href="../../../i/t/m/Itmam_al-hujjah.html" title="Itmam al-hujjah">Itmam_al-hujjah</a>) says:<i>"If the Messenger migrates with a considerable number of companions, he morally cleanses and trains his followers and prepares them for onslaught with adversaries"</i>.<br />
<br />
<b>Again, the Golden Movement has been played before the game starts</b><br />
According to nearly all Islamic books, The prophet Muhammad migrated with ONE companion, Abubakkar Siddiq. The purpose of migration was to protect Islam. The people in Mecca had planned to KILL prophet Muhammad. Do the writer thinks that he may have killed like the Jesus be crusified? The prophet had many companions in the nearby city Madina, so he migrated to Madina. BUT the non-Muslims of mecca, upon knowing, stopped the Muslims to migrate to Madina. Many muslims had migrated, but later, the non-Muslims started torchuring the rest.<br />
<br />
<b>Were they prepared to fight?</b><br />
If Muhammad wanted to fighted back, why he fought with non-Muslims when mislims were <b>313</b> and non-Muslims were <b>1000</b>???????? This was the first war against them. The 313 muslims had nearly nothing to fight with 1000. They were poors at that time.<br />
If someone migrates to come another day to slaughter, he will not come with one stone in hand, while they have swords.<br />
Those wanted to kill each and every Muslim. They prepared the army, attacked amd the Muslims had to fight. Otherwise, you know it better!<br />
<br />
My dear, those writers just tell you the lies. They have the Logical Guns that are more dangerous then the real Gun. Their Logical Gun is the mother of all the Sins. Who will stop them? According to your humanity, telling lies is a human right, then what can we do? We are really in great loss. Our Allah tells us that we must be patient. The day of Judgment is a reality. At that day, they will not be away from the final authority, the God almighty, the Allah.<br />
<br />
<b>Undesting a Text</b><br />
I would again like to say that:You may know the great English writer William Shekspear(please correct me if the spelling is wrong). If you translate the books of William Shekspear to Hindi and give the translations to an Indian ans request those books to read himself, may be he would stop reading after reading some pages and get bored. By chance, if he reads them fully(this will be a difficult task), he will tell you that the author is mad(remember that hi is saying to william shekspear). If by chance, you give this book to a person who is against English or Mr. William, what he will say, you know it better my friend, there is no need for me to explain. Now, concider if you give this book to a person who is against English and William and you also REQUEST him to write against these books. In this case, if you give him on book, he will write 100 against William and his writings. That is why the William is only studied in English. The people who teach his books are from english background. Isn't this a possibility that every person gives you a different meaning. But if an English-knowing person will tell you it will become interesting for you to read it. Brother, I hope you understand that fact.<br />
<br />
So brother, the ball is in your court. You can also play the foul game, or a fair play. Do not judge the game according to the laws I tell. Use the Humanity to judge. I hope that your final decision will be according to Humanity, as you said that your mission is PEACE!<br />
<br />
<b>My mission is Islam and your mission is PEACE</b>. Are we fool? Why we fight?<br />
Brother, actually, our mission is the same, <b>PEACE</b>. My dear brother, Peace cannot come from disbelief in God. You cannever make Peace in this world, unless people have Fear of the Day of Judgment. Islam is the only religion that makes this fear as a part of daily life. So, that fear will take the people away from the sins evenif there is no police. If you cannot catch me at this time, it doesn't means that it will never happen. If I believe that I'll be near you at the Day of Judgment, I'll never play the foul game. If I do not believe in God, you cannot stop sins when there is no police and no danger. You cannot have two security cams on each person. It is the fear of God that takes us away from the sins.<br />
My dear brother, Islam is the best of all the religions. <b>Islam has the MOST resistance against the religion of disbelief in God</b>. You may have many Hindu,Christians,Jews and Muslim friends. They all come from many poor countries. If you say that there is no God, Hindu will ask a proof. So shell do all, but the Muslim will stand against you. He will stop you without demanding any proof. We muslims believe in one God, Allah and we do not ask any proof to deny as well as to accept the God's existence. We just believe and this our religion.<br />
Dear brother, that is why <b>all the other religions are weak against the Religion of Disbelief</b>. So, the non-believers come to you as seculars. My friend never trust them. If they are seculars, why thay are against Islam? Actually they use secularism to defeat Islam. That is why every religion other then Islam produces seculars and these <b>seculars are easily converted to non-believers</b>. That is why Islam is the only option to stop the religion of disbelief. This religion of disbelief is actually the religion of Money, status, etc. In that religion, there is no fear of God. They just want workers. They just want Ants to work and to OBEY all the day, without any question. They just want to give you money to buy your happinesses. Can you buy happinesses with money?<br />
<br />
I hope that my message is clear. I apologize if I hurt the feelings of any disbeliever. They are not bad, but <b>The Religion of Disbelief is the Worst of all the religions</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>AsSALAM-O-Alaikum</b>(may PEACE ond mercy of Allah be on all of you)<br />

<p>Thanks brother for giving time and reading my posts. I'll not write on your page after this post.<br />
Brother, there is no hidden GUN in my posts and I am not here to convert you to a Muslim. Brother, I am against Liars. Even a gun, a tank, a bomb can not stop me opposing the lies. My brother, I am not against the people like you, the mistakers, but those who tell these lies to you.<br />
I always respected you, but sorry to post lengthy ESSAYS on your page. Brother, My page welcomes you. We can have discussion there.<br />
I was not the one, but you started against Islam, the religion of Peace. My brother, One of your questions/arguments against Islam is remained unanswered. That is the Marriage Of Aisha with prophet Muhammad(read it <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/058.sbt.html#005.058.234" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/058.sbt.html#005.058.234" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Brother, I had ignored this assuming that you have no knowledge of Islam. BUT now, you are showing to have a GOOD understanding of my religion, the Islam. May be this is very difficult for a muslim to reply this argument to a non-Muslim. However, I don't want you to accept Islam, however, I want to expose the evil that some people tell you. So, you may agree to debate with me on this single argument, which is really difficult to answer.<br />
Again, my job is not to convey any message of Islam, but to expose the lies which some people tell you. And my friend, never believe in lies even when there is a gun to your head!<br />

<p>Not only must they know full well that they are misrepresenting the Qur'an, but they are using an anon IP to do their reverts for them. It's the first thing that really gets to me: are you familiar with the concept of doublethink, not its popular usage but its very specific meaning in the book in which this phrase first appeared? On the one hand, the Qur'an is the literal, directly authored and inerrant word of God. On the other, it relies on us to misrepresent it in order to preserve its reputation. The latter contention is incompatible with genuine belief in the former, raising the question of why one should bother in the first instance.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:03, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What I mean is not that Robertson and Falwell aren't notable overall, but they aren't notable as critics of Islam. Guys who publish lots of books, columns, and web articles on that topic like Spencer and Pipers are more notable as critics of Islam. Likewise, Noam Chomsky would be more notable than Osama bin Laden as a critic of US-Israeli relations, even though bin Laden is a more notable person overall. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 00:14, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Calling radical Muslims "satanic" like Robertson does is invective, not criticism. Anyways, you don't have to take my word; a Google search of +"critic of islam" +spencer returns twice as many hits as +"critic of islam" +robertson. The reason why this is important is we had an editor a while back who was quite obviously trying to discredit the Criticism of Islam page by edit-warring to force the section on evangelicals (and their utterly non-scholarly comments) to be the most prominent section of the article. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 01:08, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ok. I will be going offline for the day soon too. I don't really know enough about Islam to discuss it. I lived in an Islamic country for three years but never met a fundamentalist or someone who was aggressive in ascerting their beliefs. However I have only very rarely come across Christian or Hindu or Jewish fundamentalists either so perhaps I am lucky. Personally I think most religions converge when they become fundamentalist... but I am probably wrong. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 14:39, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Repeat: I am an evangelical Christian and certainly don't think anything of the sort. But I understand there is a US type of virile fundamentalist Evangelical Christian who thinks like that and I apologise if you've ever met one. I think the mormons also think the only people who go to hell are lapsed mormons.

<p>I'm reluctant to edti this article for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm not a Muslim apologist. And to get the Muslim position stated clearly needs one. I would like them to address the deficiencies in the article before I come in.</li>
<li>I disagree with the apparent Muslim position to require literal interpretation of scripture on this point. This pervasive fundamentalism is not only something I don't agree with, but a position I can't effective edit from. So I couldn't present their case honestly. If I approached it the way <i>I</i> would, that'd be OR.</li>
<li>My real life is more important. This only sits on my watchlist because I thought the subject merited inclusion and I gave it some months to settle down.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I have no problem with science and religion, and consider them entirely compatible. My problem is when relionists insist that their <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a> is universally applicable, even to material phenomena; and scientists and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materialists.html" title="Materialists">materialists</a> presume that nothing exists that they can't see.

<p>Arrow740, It looks to me that when you edit you display quite a lot of frustration/irritation with Islam, fundamentalist Christianity and perhaps other religions. You also strongly assert lots of things about them (e.g. in edit comments including about some things which are pretty much impossible to know ...what the the Prophet was really like etc.). I do not think that these kind of feelings ever grow in vacuuo and I'd be interested to know why things like this make you irritable? --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 14:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. Actually I find really fundamentalist Christianity as scarey just because there is potentially more access to important resource. e.g. the aide to Reagan who said in response to concerns about global polution "the world is a used Kleenex, Christ will come again before these concerns matter", or equally the stuff being put around a decade ago equating the Soviets with the ant-Christ demanding we attack them. A few thousand people in a plane isn't really on my radar screen but nuclear weapons are, its true. Still gun crimes in the US kill far more than terrorists: why have the religious guys got to you? But it sounds like you are cross about people invading your homeland rather than making you feel bad which makes sense. In the US (where I guess you live) there seems to be deep nationalist symbolism in many people's psyche (saluting the flag at school etc.) which is hard to understand from elsewhere.I ask partly because 25 years ago I was on the edges of fundamentalist christianity (it exists a bit at universities here where people are susceptible). 20 years ago I was an angry young man about it but now I am a rather mellowed about the whole thing. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 09:17, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nice bold claim but I'm not sure that's true. Off the top of my head one of the longest standing local terrorist problems which we have here is Catholic versus Protestant in Northern Ireland. The Sudan is basically ethnic (black versus white) rather than religious. North Korea doesn't seem to be at all related to religion and is as a minimum right at the top of the danger list for war. It is very hard to argue that the civil war in Cote d'Ivoire (where I used to live) is related to Islam (as opposed to French Imperialism). And you could make a pretty good case that in Palestine Afghan Iraq cases the Islam groups were reacting to being persecuted/invaded/occupied rather than being the responsible party (I am not saying I agree with the case; but it is complex and has strong elements). Besides the first millenium and a half of Christianity was fairly bloody... --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 09:38, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I <i>am</i> a Christian but don't feel the need to defend it either:). However, people are still being kneecapped in Northern Ireland and on plenty of the problems around the world the Islamic party is as close to being the victim as anyone is. Isn't there quite a lot of problem with fundamentalist Hinduism and Sikhs in India though? I guess on track record on peace we'd all have to convert to Buddhism...I really don't think you are right to blame Islam but the question is so complicated that I am not really qualified to do the analysis. Anyone could write a leader in a paper about it but what the truth is behind it who knows. On principle trying to identify and attack a guilty party on a global scale though I don't think is likely to help: in general most religions do pretty well when attacked (they are developed to handle this). Endlessly patient dialogue is a much more effective approach. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 09:50, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When you say look into it, where do you think one should start? I have friends who are Islamic but many the liberal African version: they all say "jihad is an internal spiritual battle not about fighting other people".

<dd>"jihad is an internal spiritual battle not about fighting other people" This is wrong. Quran never mention Jihad as spiritual battle and many Ayats about Jihad came during battle times and clearly in that context. Those people use a weak-hadith to misguide themselves and others. Ask them their references from primary sources (like Quran and hadith). They will have only one hadith which even does not mention spiritual thing directly (but that what they infer from it) and weak-hadith too. Nothing else they will give you. I know it becasuse, I have asked them already. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ALM</a> 11:25, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nonetheless the view seems to be prevalent (e.g. <a href="http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/islam/blfaq_islam_jihad.htm" class="external free" title="http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/islam/blfaq_islam_jihad.htm" rel="nofollow">http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/islam/blfaq_islam_jihad.htm</a>) . Perhaps they take a different view on what primary sources are and how doctrine is derived from them. Generally, when I ask why I tend to get authority stated in terms of "my Imman is a good Imman and he says" rather than anyone refering to primary sources; Islam has a social construct definition. In the end even sorting about what constitutes Islam does not look to me like a trivial question: at least the analogous question for Christianity (which I understand rather better) is very complex (very many Christians including a majority of Roman Catholics do not consider the Bible as the unique ultimate authority: the authority is often considered to be the Church which wrote and chose the Bible). --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 11:39, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, I am against following any imam. I want to ask people (imam or no imam) their sources and make my own understanding. Some people due to criticism from west start preaching that view (superior Jihad is self-struggle) which is very disgusting. I dislike <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tablighi_Jamaat_db7d.html" title="Tablighi Jamaat">Tablighi Jamaat</a> because of such very wrong views. However, even if Jihad is referred to fight in Quran, it is very important to understand when to fight and what are the principles of fighting. It does not at all involve killing innocent people. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ALM</a> 11:53, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In terms of your own belief you are quite entitled to state what you think is "very wrong" or correct, as am I, but in the context of Wikipedia you of course we need to state our opinions as opinions. An example I see quite often is where Wikipedia contradicts the Roman Catholic Cathecism on what defines "the Catholic Church" (e.g. because the Church of England defines itself as a "Catholic Church" and these words are not registered trademarks owned by the Pope). There is a repeat re-edit by each new arrival. Equally pretty much every Islamic believer believes that their viewpoint defines what is true Islam, but the word is used of a much wider collection of liberal and modernists than some would like. I will have a bit more of a look through Islamic belief to try to understand it better. It is intersting. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 12:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And Here's the problem with anti-islamists, If Islam says fight to diminish cruelty (and that is the way of God) and these anti-islimists immediately catch the word 'fight' and say Islam preaching hatered. Now why does this above happen, Take an example:</p>
<p>Please carefully read the following conditions.</p>
<p>1- Given that a religion 'A' is the only true religion (way of life) acceptable to God.</p>
<p>2- It is told in this religion 'A' to fight and fight/kill those few infidels so that they cant harm manifold number of humans on earth.</p>
<p>3- Given that condition '2' is called the ways of God, then God asks people to fight in 'the way of God' and promises them the reward of fearless and eternal peacful paradise.</p>
<p>4- That religion 'A' covers the guidance on all the aspects of human living. It not only tells how to rule the humans, it not only tells how to behave in community and family but even it tells how to do daily little things in better way (even the minor looking things like manners of using washroom). While other religions dont cover many many aspects and are either theme based and are abstract, or they have human's intervension/curruption on them.</p>
<p>5- That religion 'A' Does not have any explicit sexual (literal or metaphorical, whatsoever) language in its scriptures while other some religions have.</p>
<p>6- That religion 'A' gives the most harsh punishments for the crimes which can be fatal for the society immediately as well as in the long run. So that religin 'A' stands the maximum resistent for the crimes and cruelty (by ordering capital punishments even considered very harsh by opposers of that religion 'A').</p>
<p>7- Given the condition '1', the devil will try his maximum to increase the hatered of that religion in the non-believers of religion 'A'. Also devil will try to decieve the believers of religion 'A' so that they weaken their faith (in that religion 'A').</p>
<p>8- That religion 'A' accepts some other scriptures to be from the Creator (God) but currupted by the Men with the passage of time, while that religion 'A' retains its scripture 100% intact alphabet by alphabet , to date.</p>
<p>9- Given that the '1' is true, i.e. religion 'A' is the only true religion of Creator, then all the evil forces will use their maximum energies to oppose that and decieve the people against that using what ever means such as Media Hipociry, Weaponary, False Allegations against them as well as declaring them terrorist on the basis of some decieved/weak believers of religion 'A'. While those evile forces commint terrorism by themselves, e.g. killing freedom of other nations in the name of 'freedom of speach' or 'democracy' or 'war on terror'.</p>
<p>10- Given the condition '1', i.e. that religion 'A' is the only true religion of God, it will ofcourse preach his believers to diminish cruelty by force, while this same religion asks not to take revenge as an individual, warn about the panalty of God for the believers who commint Un-Just acts. At the same time, this religion 'A' warns the believers of the order of death panalty if they kill any single human Un-Just. This same religion 'A' gives the respect to the females of its believers by telling them to cover their body while warning the men to lower their gaze if they coincidently happen to look at femals. That same religion 'A' orders the maximum capital punishment to the person who commits the worst crimes of humanity (and fat to society in the long run) such as rape, adultery, murder and theft.</p>
<p>11- That religion 'A' has many its holy book having many signs for the people of wisdom including many scientific predictions which would only be known to creator in the time if revelation of this religion. Those prediciton could only be known to man in very recent history such as 20th and 21st century.</p>
<p><br />
Please have assumption of the condition '1' in your mind and brainstorm on all of the points.</p>
<p>which is the only religion having that? <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualEye_6b62.html" title="User:VirtualEye">VirtualEye</a> 14:43, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've read it. The debate was good in the beginning, but now after looking at the responses from Ali Sina (who is simply complaining about Muslim attitude and taunting and not focusing on debate) are not encouraging at all. Hence, I think Khalid Zaheer would have withdrawn by now. Actually, it is Khalid Zaheer, not Ghamidi who is involved in correspondence. But anyway, I would strongly doubt that if such a debate would finish with a conclusion. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 21:22, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hadith by its very nature, is not authentic but it has historical significance, and this is why it is studied by religious scholars. Before contemporary times, people with <a href="../../../i/l/m/Ilm_ar-Rijal_fae2.html" title="Ilm ar-Rijal">Ilm ar-Rijal</a> used to criticize hadith, based on their content (e.g. if it goes along Qur'an) and its narration chains etc. But these days, scholars have taken such a strict action that no one is allowed to criticize hadith, even if it is completely against Qur'an. This is why, when people like Ghamidi criticize some hadith(not all, which would be ridiculous as well), people allege them that they reject hadith. Which is completely wrong, as it is very well known from his own books (and he also gives weekly hadith lecture on public TV as well). Regarding Ibn Kathir, even good scholars don't look at it as a very authentic source as it has collected very weak hadith in it as well.

<dd>Regarding Sina, just like you believe that Sina has put strong questions, similarly I believe that Sina hasn't understood Zaheer's argument properly, otherwise he would have been in the trouble of giving $50,000.

<dd>Very good question, Arrow! Nobody is rejecting hadith or Tafsir. Just as much contemporary scholars can be at fault, classical scholars can also be at fault. <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imam_Shafi%27i_ec46.html" title="Imam Shafi'i">Imam Shafi'i</a> once said: “I am convinced about the veracity of my opinions, but I do consider it likely that they may turn out to be incorrect. Likewise, I am convinced about the incorrectness of the views different from mine, but I do concede the possibility that they may turn out to be correct.” So no scholar is considered infallible. They used their own rational to prove their points and if someone else using the basic sources, come to another conclusion with a better logic, a good person should accept it. The basic sources of the religion are intact in any case i.e. Qur'an and Sunnah (which is not equal to hadith)</dd>
<dd>Regarding exegesis of Qur'an, it has always been a challenge for muslim scholars to explain Qur'an with hadith and then combining hadith to different parts of Qur'an. This approach is not fault-free. As hadith is not very reliable, and superimposing theme of hadith over Qur'an can be dangerous. What <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farahi.html" title="Farahi">Farahi</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islahi.html" title="Islahi">Islahi</a> and now <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghamidi.html" title="Ghamidi">Ghamidi</a> has come to the conclusion that Qur'an itself gives you enough clues that you can tell that which part was revealed at what point. This point is strongly purported in <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadabbur-i-Qur%27an_c838.html" title="Tadabbur-i-Qur'an">Tadabbur-i-Qur'an</a>. Ghamidi even considers Qur'an "Saga" of prophet's life. How this is done? This is done by extensively researching on Qur'anic Arabic in classical Arabic context. Using poetry from pre-Islamic society, they interpreted Qur'an on that basis (as Qur'an is in the Arabic of 1400 years ago). A whole concept of coherence in Qur'an came from this approach. Encyclopedia of Qur'an has complete section on Coherence of Qur'an attributed to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islahi.html" title="Islahi">Islahi</a>. This coherence was never seen before by scholars and was always a challenge, but now it seems that it has been very well exposed. Hence, now Qur'an is not an erratic book which starts one thing and then starts something else, but rather every <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surah.html" title="Surah">surah</a> has a theme and it is coupled with its immediate surah in its subject and there are seven different themes in Qur'an, each one of them in the order of revelation. Because of this very reason, these scholars differ from traditional scholars at various points. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 09:45, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Regarding Abrogation, Ghamidi believes that only Qur'an can abrogate itself. Hence, hadith cannot abrogate Qur'an. So if Qur'an says in <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/009.qmt.html#009.005" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/009.qmt.html#009.005" rel="nofollow">9:5</a> that all Arab pagans have to be killed, similarly, it says at other place a general rule in <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.032" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.032" rel="nofollow">5:32</a>, which is applicable after the prophet for all times.

<dd>Once again this is NOT at all main stream view that Quran Abrogate itself etc. These are view of few and those people are not much famous (at least in Sunni). It just like Allah did not know what will come next hence he decided to first give one Surah and then Abrogate it. These people decide whatever they wish to called abrogated.

<dd>Your objection, ALM scientist, is inconsitent with the views of Islamic exegetes, who differentiate between Allah's knowledge and Allah's will. Allah had known that a certain verse would be repealed; it was some sort of a pre-planned process. The theoretical basis for the <i>naskh</i> comes directly from the Qur'an: "And for whatever verse We abrogate or cast into oblivion, We bring a better or the like of it; knowest thou not that God is powerful over everything?"

<dd>I don't know much about abrogation but here is the view of one of the most prominent contemporary Shia scholar on a hadith saying that verse 9:29 has abrogated some other verses asking for good behaviour toward dhimmis: <i>The author says: In this tradition the Imam has taken the "speech" to mean behavior. We say: Do not speak to him but good; what we mean is: Do not deal with him but in a good and decent manner. This meaning will apply only if we take the word, "abrogated" in its terminological sense. But it may also be taken in its literal sense (as we shall explain under the verse: Whatever signs We abrogate or cause to be forgotten . . .2:106); and in that case this verse will not be in conflict with that of the fighting. It should be pointed out that such uses of words in their literal meanings (as against their terminological ones) are not infrequent in the traditions of the Imams.</i> <a href="http://www.almizan.org/Tafseer/Baqarah17.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.almizan.org/Tafseer/Baqarah17.asp" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

I find these exegesis dangerous, when done differently by prominent contemporary scholars from classical schools of thought. Very dangerous! And I think here the aspect of looking Qur'an in its context becomes more important, otherwise taking random verses and then correlation with hadith (isolated reports) is a major issue.

<p>The prophet wrote letters to the head of states in his life, hence their denial was equivalent to denial of the prophet. The Caliphs launched attacks against them as part of the religious obligation plus Qur'an made <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a> <i>shahid</i> (witness) over the whole world of truth (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/022.qmt.html#022.078" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/022.qmt.html#022.078" rel="nofollow">22:78</a>), hence they were entitled to do so, as they built an ideal society which was shown to the world as a role model. But if you look at history, after the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">sahaba</a>, no one attacked other for the same reasons.</p>
<p>Regarding your other objection, it is the content of the book rather than act of writing a book.

<dd>Just for a quick note, kindly see <a href="../../../t/a/d/Tadabbur-i-Qur%27an_c838.html" title="Tadabbur-i-Qur'an">Tadabbur-i-Qur'an</a> article, and Surah 5 and Surah 9, both came at the end, as both are at the end of their groups. Secondly, a ruling can still come at the end, but because that ruling has particular addressees, the verse is still valid, it is just that the addressees don't exist anymore. And Arrow! Just a last comment that please, if you really like western progress so far, as you've mentioned on my page, try to read Islam through western scholarship rather than people who are willing to do anything to willify Islam. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 02:05, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding hadith, it is wrong that Ghamidi rejects alot of hadith. You need to read his writings. He uses hadith in his works extensively and explains them through Qur'an, rather than explaining Qur'an through hadith. The authentic source of religion is definitely Qur'an and Sunnah, both of which come to us through perpetual adherence of whole umma, rather than invidividual and mostly isolated reports (this is the principle argument). Ghamid has very well explained all the actions of the prophet in his books. You should atleast look at <a href="../../../m/i/z/Mizan.html" title="Mizan">Mizan</a>, its polygamy section for prophet's marriages and Islamic Law of Jihad for military actions.</dd>
<dd>Regarding why this has happened, you should see <a href="../../../i/t/m/Itmam_al-hujjah.html" title="Itmam al-hujjah">itmam al-hujjah</a> article. God rehearses its judgement in this world through his Messenger, which the God will do on the final judgement i.e. separation of good and bad people and then bad people are punished. This act reminds that we will also have to be answerable to God one day. But to play the role of messenger i.e. to rehearse it again, thats not sanctioned by the Qur'an or by the prophet rather it is contradictory to Islamic teachings.</dd>
<dd>And lastly, regarding Muslim history, I'll tell you something very interesting which I just came to know recently, but I've to leave now. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 07:16, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My only mistake is that I gave you explanation for just one aspect of prophet's life. If you look at prophet's complete life, even from western scholarship, your conclusion would be different. It was not prophet's personal griefs, for which people were executed. At other places, when the prohpet was given choice, he has always forgiven. The prime example is of conquest of mecca.</dd>
<dd>I'd be alot more surprised if God sends his ambassador, and people challenge him even to the effect that his life is in danger and God doesn't punish his ambassador's enemies, which eventually becomes God's enemies. And God is definitely merciful, but it is merciful to those atleast who ask for mercy. What to do of those who challenge the God out of arrogance? Just as you think that my argument is absurd, I believe that your argument is also absrud. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 00:06, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think so. As Qur'an puts only two sins big enough for eternal damnation. 1) Making partners with God (which if happens with arrogance, I believe there is no way that person is going to be saved) 2) Killing an innocent. And secondly, Muslims don't need a Savior like Christians to bless their sins, they have a very merciful God to forgive them. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 00:24, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Mate! If this would happen, as you describe, it can only happen with some being which doesn't have free-will and freedom. If we have a free-will (which is wonderful - and I hope that most of us would go to paradise to enjoy it to its fullest), then this world is a place to test that who is worthy of going there. Otherwise, God could create animals and send them in paradise. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 03:34, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Who says that hell is temporary? I've told you earlier about the sins which can bring eternal damnation, as Qur'an at one point says for such people that they are such that even if they will get another chance, they will commit the same sins. Regarding Qadr, I think Beit Or made the exact comment, with which I fully agree. God knows what we will do, but our actions are because of our freedome of choice (and definitely only in a limited manner as we don't control the environment or choose our parents etc.). And lastly, it is true that environment does affect your actions, but then your actions will also be judged according to environment. If someone is born in a bad society and he decides to do something good, his reward will be a lot more than the person who does good in a society, where that good practice is norm. But the point is that human concious can be perverted if someone convinces himself to do bad so much that he doesn't feel bad about that action, but intrinsically, every human knows the basic ethics and has the ability to know about one true Diety. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 03:56, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>&lt;reset&gt;No body is born as a serial killer. Every human is born with the same soul. Environment can make someone do something really bad, but by the time he reaches his age of conciousness, he has to choose this lifestyle conciously. I am very hopeful that even a little bit of struggle from a person in such a situation can make a huge impact on his life and God would open new oppertunities for him. But if he (counciously) become hopeless from the God, and starts giving in to his desires, then he can finish up in something, which could definitely be avoided. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 04:36, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But the important thing is that you must first see that on which principle God created this World. Reward? (there are people who are suffering in this world, hence NO), punishment (there are people who are enjoying their lives, hence No), Justice? (there are people in this world who oppress the weaker ones, hence NO), Test (people are in different environments, good or bad conditions and are being judged accordingly, a poor is judged for his patience, a rich is being judged for his gratitude to God). The last one seems to fit the model of the world exactly. Hence, this whole life should be considered as a test. People who argue about God and His mercy, they try to think that God created this world on the principle of Justice or Reward, which God's scriptures definitely deny (and also evident from this very world). <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 04:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was listening to a talk. It was said that when jurists (especiall, four <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imam.html" title="Imam">imams</a>) and their followers were writing the <a href="../../../f/i/q/Fiqh.html" title="Fiqh">fiqh</a>, they were facing a certain situation. Muslim society had dominated Persia, Media and Byzantine. It grew as the most powerful and advance society in its time. The real issue with the jurists in those days was, "we are in control, now to how to run this world". Hence, those parts of the Qur'an were just looked and tried to be followed, which could be implemented in such a situation (whether rightly or wrongly), but the unfortunate thing happened that the next generations of Muslims simply reproduced the work of these early jurists and came up with a certain philosophy of worldview. The side-effect of this whole exercise was that those parts of Qur'an which talk about patience or when people don't have power then how to act etc. were all overlooked and never seen seriously. Examples are of prophets (heaps, almost all of them with the exception of Moses' later life and Medinan period of the prophet's life). For example, now if a Muslim reads Qur'an, he wouldn't try to take any help from the example of Jesus, which the Qur'an has given purposefully. Hence, I subscribe to this belief that we are stuck with the Islamic Jurisprudence of Islamic Golden age, which was done with a certain mindset, but in the same Qur'an, we can find another picture, which has always been overlooked but it has alot more occurings than the verses on which Islamists insist. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 08:25, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interestingly, the goals which contemporary Islamists have set, I believe that they are completely unrealistic, would bring the whole umma to frustration and no results. Past two centuries are evident. And secondly, the domination of world has never been an issue in the Qur'an. It is a self-made goal by Islamists to revive (their version of) Islam without going through the rigorous path of education, which is indeed much more difficult and asks for more patience. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 08:44, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Only direct addressees of the prophet were punished for denying the prophet. All the conquests beyond Arabia, to the best of my knowledge and what I've read, no one was forced. Rather classical Islamic Jurisprudence clearly prohibited forced conversions. Those lands were conquered by the "first four caliphs" as part of their religious duty, and not even fought with the same aggression, which prophet was himself asked to deal with polytheists of Arabia. And after <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a>, all conquests are normal conquests with minimal religious reasons. Abassid went to Spain, not because they wanted to convert Spain to Islam, rather they were being persecuted by Ummayyads. And then Muslims were struck with Crusaides.</p>
<p>And to the best of knowledge, <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a>' followers conquered <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canaan.html" title="Canaan">canaan</a> quite the same way Muslims conquered Arabia, and religion was expanded by other Hebrew prophets more or less like Caliphs did in their reign i.e. <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saul.html" title="Saul">Saul</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua.html" title="Joshua">Joshua</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a> just to name a few. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 17:57, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Arrow740. It is easy for us to get tangled up in an edit war. However, this time you must seriously reconsider the scope of your reverts<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=109325983" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=109325983" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. While some aspects of my edits (that you revert) can be disputed, others are very legitimate. Consider the follwoing:</p>
<ul>
<li>You removed "<i>Muhammad also ordered the restitution to the Jews of their holy scriptures.<sup id="_ref-EI_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-EI" title="">[2]</a></sup></i>" It is sourced and NPOV.</li>
<li>You replaced the previous Watt statement by "<i>According to Watt, leaders of the Banu Nadir paid neighboring Arab tribes to go to war</i>". It is clear Watt says no such thing. Watt's quote is available on the talk page, and I'll post it below. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 04:57, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Montgomery Watt has drawn attention to the fact that the Banu 'l-Nadir, driven out of Medina, had taken refuge in khaybar and that their chieftains and the chieftains of other Jewish groups, eager for revenge, were intriguing against Muhammad along with the Arabs tribes of the neighbourhood. So Muhammad had not only a just motive for attacking them, but there was also the positive necessity to destroy these enemies, more formidable even than the Quraysh because of their adherence to their own religion, their intelligence and their superior culture.</p>

<dd>If Itaqallah and Aminz act unreasonably, that is no reason for others to do so. Infact, I can't be held responsible for thier actions. However, please cite a few examples where Aminz has committed such behavior. Post them on my talk page as well as on Aminz's, so we can improve ourselves.</dd>
<dd>Also, if I already do, or in the future, revert blindly, please post the example on my talk page - you'd be doing me a favor. Thanks.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 05:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey you asked for Watt's "full quote". WHat do you mean by that? I presented it above. I am not sure I understand what exactly you want.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 17:31, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Above is not a quote from Watt. It's a quote from Veccia Vaglieri. It would be really strange if Watt talked himself in the third person.

<p>Again, I'll quote what Vaglieri says Watt says about Khaybar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Montgomery Watt has drawn attention to the fact that the Banu 'l-Nadir, driven out of Medina, had taken refuge in khaybar and that their chieftains and the chieftains of other Jewish groups, eager for revenge, were intriguing against Muhammad along with the Arabs tribes of the neighbourhood.

</blockquote>
<p>Before, you inserted the statement "<i>According to Watt, leaders of the Banu Nadir paid neighboring Arab tribes to go to war against Muhammad, leaving him no choice but to attack Khaybar.</i>" Watt is presented in EoI (which is the source provided for Watt) as saying no such thing. I told you this before. Yet you inserted the same thing in again<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;curid=3351048&amp;diff=109623739&amp;oldid=109595102" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;curid=3351048&amp;diff=109623739&amp;oldid=109595102" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>.

<p>You should restore Haykal's biography and put in in the top of the section - it is more notable than Mubarakpuri's, and is actually a rather good read.

<p>I'm not sure what is to be gained by making what IMO is quoting out of context, childishly precious over-reactions, and thus feigning insult helps anything – particularly on the edit summaries is poor form. If you have a problem use the talk pages, if that fails, use the appropriate place to file a PA complaint.</p>
<p>As for the article at hand, the fact remains that an American conservative right website is hardly the place to find a balanced NPOV reference to Islam. It's mere opinion, and if it is to be used, it should be presented as opinion. Furthermore, I’m not even sure how that article links in with the article – it’s not clear at all. I suggest it is just a gratuitous placement of opinion by people with POV agendas. Any reason why you support such openly POV editors? <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 03:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can you identify the point-of-view, yet uncovered in that article, which justifies the current POV tagging and precludes its nomination for GA?</p>
<p>Is there any solution for users who employ those tags as some sort of a protest without listing their specifici pov concerns with a corresponding message on talk?</p>
<p>Frankly, if I don't see a corresponding pov-label discussion on talk I delete the tag.

<p>Arrow740,</p>
<p>There is one week left for final changes to the 2007 Wikipedia CD Selection. I am after a couple of people of different religious views to have a quick look through the relevant pages on Islam, Israel, Palestine etc. I intend to ask Aminz as well. I don't promise to make any changes but I will seriously consider it if you think some of the version adopted are POV.</p>
<p>The 2006 CD has an estimated circulation of over 50,000 so its worth getting as good as possible. The most recent viewable copy is at&#160;: <a href="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/index/alpha.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://2007-wikipedia-cd-selection.fixedreference.org/wp/index/alpha.htm" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>. Changes planned are listed at <a href="../../../2/0/0/Wikipedia%7E2006_Wikipedia_CD_Selection_e83c.html" title="Wikipedia:2006 Wikipedia CD Selection">Wikipedia:2006 Wikipedia CD Selection</a> in terms of (1) articles currently included to exclude (2)articles to add (3) articles to update because the version listed is vandalised (4) sections to exclude (mainly on appropriateness to children) (5) string deletes and spelling corrections (to UK English) (6) redirects of common article names to the main article. Navigation and search pages are being sorted separately. Please let me know of any issues if you see any.

<p>A recent editor pointed this out to me: <a href="http://books.google.com/" class="external free" title="http://books.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/</a> We can find books on the topics we are looking for, search within the books and quote relevant statements into an article while providing the reference of a book. This way we dont have to buy these books. Google doesnt provide all the pages, but it has quite a few from each book. I've also mentioned this advice on the WikiProject Islam's home page. This is a very useful tool for us for finding sources opinions relevant to an article. I wanted to tell everyone of this but I went ahead and just put this advice on the project's home page so that should work.--<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt57_c690.html" title="User:Matt57">Matt57</a> 23:56, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you think the current lead of that article does justice to concisely recording the totality of article content and describing the importance of the subject? It seems Itaqallah cherishes every part of it, you and I are much the opposite, and no-one otherwise steps forward to venture their view despite being asked. It is one of the things that needs surgery or replacement for that art to have another chance at GA, as we learned from last review. Also, the same user has been making a [WP:POINT] about much of the picture content I've introduced to address another of the four highlighted GA-review issues.

When we want to include content in a given article we have to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribute</a> what is being said about that content so that the article has standing. All I've seen so far is editors saying, well it is an example of Arab slavery and thus it is Islamic.... sorry but Arab≠Islam. <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">Cite</a> a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for that image clearly indicating that it has to do with Islam and slavery and you'll have no more complaints from me. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott"><span title="Leave me a message.">→</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey" title="Go to my userpage.">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 05:53, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>I've seen him (Aminz) do that before, trying to silence Karl Meier. So the person whose work I was amending and reverting in the course of dealing with his POV complaint (ie. Netscott) didn't take it up but someone else wants to.

<p>you cited page 11 on the Abd article in support of the notion that the child must be alive for her to retain her status as umm walad. could you provide the relevant passage please? also, you have been citing Lewis and then conflating it with EoI under the assumption that they must be in agreement, which as we know is not necessarily true. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I did not understand the points which you were trying to raise regarding Buddhist views on the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advaita_Vedanta_350b.html" title="Advaita Vedanta">Advaita_Vedanta</a> article. Perhaps further discussion about them would be helpful on the talk page for that article. I will look forward to hearing more about these points there if you feel that is appropriate. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBuddhipriya_9b91.html" title="User:Buddhipriya">Buddhipriya</a> 05:31, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
