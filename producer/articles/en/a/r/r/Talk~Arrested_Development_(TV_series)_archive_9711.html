<h2><span class="mw-headline">Major vandalism</span></h2>
<p>First someone put a picture of genitalia, then they just erased the whole thing.</p>
<p>This was terrible. I wanted to view this show's page at work and a big penis pops up on the screen. Wikipedia needs to do a better job defending against hackers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedians are too used to this sort of thing. Most prominent articles get vandalized with genitalia, for the desired shock value. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-12-6 04:03</small></li>
<li>With the featured article most vandalism gets reverted in under a minute. Vandals get blocked after a few warnings.

<li>Shouldn't Ron be listed as an uncredited creator? <i>"Ron Howard had the original idea to create a comedy in the style of hand-held cameras and reality television, but with an elaborate, highly comical script resulting from repeated rewritings and rehearsals.

<li>Mitchell Hurwitz, Ron Howard, and several actors all say that "it is supposed to be like a documentary" on the DVD extras. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-11-25 06:29</small>
<ul>
<li>Ron Howard isn't the creator. Mitchell Hurwitz is the creator.
<ul>
<li>You misunderstood my comma. I've clarified it. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-11-27 05:27</small>
<ul>
<li>Although it is obvious that it's supposed to be presented like a documentry, does anyone think it would be worth mentioning it's lack of consistancy in comparison to shows like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Office_%28UK%29_eca7.html" title="The Office (UK)">The Office (UK)</a> (I'm not sure about the American version)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think it is misleading to write that this is presented like a documentary. It implies it is belongs in the same category as "mockumentaries" like <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Guest_9d38.html" title="Christopher Guest">Christopher Guest</a> films or, as noted above, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Office_%28UK%29_eca7.html" title="The Office (UK)">The Office (UK)</a>. It obviously does not. Regardless what the creator involved may have said, a shaky camera, narration, and a few comedic devices like archival footage and censoring do not a documentary (or, rather, mockumentary) make. Sure it refernces documentary techniques, but this is <i>not</i> a parody of documentary film.
<ul>
<li>And if you can find a reputable source to back up your claim, that's fine. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-12-5 13:36</small>
<ul>
<li>Why? The point about this statement being misunderstood is entirely self-evident. The point here is that, yes, this does have a "documentary feel" or, if you like, "documentary style" (this is what Hurwitz was geting at) but it does not "present" itself <i>as</i> a documentary (if it did, it would be a true mockumentary). I wonder if you think my saying this means I don't like the show. I love the show, it's just I feel this turn of phrase misrepresents what Hurwitz was saying and what the show is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NYPD Blue featured a "shaky camera" as well, but I don't think we consider that documentary. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 04:07, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think it is presented like a documentary, just because it does not take the same form as <a href="../../../m/o/c/Mockumentary.html" title="Mockumentary">mockumentaries</a> you have seen before, does not mean it is not one itself. "Mockumentaries are often presented as... <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cin%C3%A9ma_v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9.html" title="Cinéma vérité">cinéma vérité</a> pieces following people as they go through various events," this sounds like Arrested Development. I do not think that the actors need to acknowledge the presence of the documentary camera (which I think is what is at issue) for it to be a documentary/mockumentary. You wouldn't say that a <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> documentary was not a documentary because it was not like an <a href="../../../e/r/r/Errol_Morris_117d.html" title="Errol Morris">Errol Morris</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Jarecki_deea.html" title="Andrew Jarecki">Andrew Jarecki</a> documentary. This just has a different documentary style than the aforementioned films/shows. Otherwise I would like to know what specific elements make it not presented like a documentary? <a href="../../../t/u/e/User%7ETuesdayMush_6f11.html" title="User:TuesdayMush">TuesdayMush</a> 02:44, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The creators, directors, producers, and writers explicitly said it is meant to be a ficticious documentary and they continue to view it as such. Who are we to tell them it's not?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you think about it, it's similar to the kinds of documentaries where there aren't direct interviews. Kind of real-worldish.--<a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorourkeus_02fa.html" title="User:Torourkeus">Torourkeus</a> 03:04, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the DVD commentary tracks they talk about this issue a fair bit. They don't quite say that the final product is a false documentary, although perhaps that was one of their original ideas. Something they specifically mention in the commentary track is, how would the documentary crew have so much access to the prison, at all hours of the day. Other scenes throughout the series you can just watch carefully and realize that it couldn't possibly be a documentary; for example, they cut back and forth between two characters having a conversation, and if it were a documentary you'd be able to see cameramen in the background in those sequences. Compare it to something like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Office_1cc2.html" title="The Office">The Office</a>, a true example of a mockumentary. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathew5000_303f.html" title="User:Mathew5000">Mathew5000</a> 05:10, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>2points: -To a documentary, the show is similar, perhaps only in, human speech timing, the illusion of a long pause between the actors lines,- which in nature is reflex and ponder,- but usually in visual fiction the actors talk right after the other very quickly, this is editing, and this is getting in more time for commercials. -This show is more similar to the "reality shows" of the past few years than a "documentary",- what a slipery semantic slope that is. Initially i thought this show was more a effort at british television comedy like <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolutely_Fabulous_b11b.html" title="Absolutely Fabulous">Absolutely Fabulous</a>. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBook_M_d724.html" title="User:Book M">User:Book_M</a> 09.06|gregorian</p>
<ul>
<li>"style of hand-held cameras and reality television", description from first talk article describing Ron Howard's initial proposal for a show,- Arrested Development is LIKE a documentary, with the narration dry camera style,- cut away's to background information, but this show also refers to very cheesey film and tv procedures, like sped up time building, and have they ever used the wavey lines for a character thinking about a flashback? One of the first 'reality shows' of the current parlance of the term was an Australian series called <a href="../../../s/y/l/Sylvania_Waters_c308.html" title="Sylvania Waters">Sylvania Waters</a> which is almost exactly like Arrested Development in setting, stories and characters only more fake in that it was supposed to be people acting natural only with a film crew following them:) Like any filmed experience people act strange in front of a camera, real or fiction.--</li>
<li>Added discussion, but if the film makers have stated "documentary style" then i suppose that that is it on some levels, <i>Timing and filming style in hommage to documentary.</i></li>

<ul>
<li>On the DVD for the first season, which someone mentioned with the commentary track, the whole conversation ends up being that it started out as a fake documentary but is more like a reality television show or a cross between the two. This is in that it follows like a documentary as all the above arguments claimed, except with no "confessionals" and the stars ignoring the cameramen, to the most part.</li>

<li>When they swear, it's always beeped and their mouths are always covered by a shoulder, their hands, a glass, etc.</li>
<li>Or they just show the reactions of other characters when they hear one swear, so they won't risk showing obvious swearing. It's pretty cleverly done.J.J. Bustamante 16:19, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, I think it might be more clever to just not discuss Annyong. To the more perceptive audience members like us, we'd notice he disappeared, and it would imply how Lucille really just didn't care about the kid, so much so that he disappeared and she didn't even notice. I noticed they use a lot of subtle signs like that. Like, remember Michael's retarded girlfriend in Wee Britain? In one part, she was sitting on a bench for Wee Britain, and her body was covering the i and t, so it said "Wee Brain," alluding to her stupidity. Also a couple episodes earlier, George Michael said he has a "stupid girl problem," and Michael says that he doesn't even have a stupid girl. Few would notice that's a foreshadowing of the retarded girl. Just forgetting Annyong like that would be funnier for us who have the DVDs and watch it over and over.</dd>

<p>This doesn't seem like a very concrete connection, as Michael is a very common name. Does anybody have any proof of this connection?</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd say it would be more based upon personalities than simply the Michael connection: GOB being a hothead and the type to jump quickly into action; Michael the cooler head; Lindsay being the one trapped in a marriage to a man who is eventually disliked by the family, and finally Buster is not exactly the brightest bulb... so what you have is Gob/Sonny Coreleone; Michael/Michael Coroleone; Lindsay/Connie; and finally Buster/Fredo. There is also the criminal element, but beyond that, it has never been brought up within the series, but considering the intricate smaller parts of the series, the naming is hardly coincidental.

<p>This is some background to the show, from the Season 1 DVD, to be prosified and put into the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to creator Mitchell Hurwitz, the Bluth family does not represent his family "in any way."</li>
<li>The creator said the documentary-style was chosen in order to "inform the storytelling", so that, instead of everything being told in a linear fashion, the story could be told non-linearly. An example is the use of "archive footage" at key parts. He says it is a "great way, stylistically, to move the story along".</li>
<li>The narrator, as a result, becomes a central to the show. Test viewers who see "rough cuts" of episodes, without narration, find the story difficult to follow.</li>
<li>The actor behind George Sr. was informally asked to be a guest star on the show, but as a result of good audience testing, became a part of the cast.</li>
<li>Often times, an episode's script is created by the writers sitting together in a room and talking out the entire story, with random ideas thrown in as they go along.</li>
<li>Liza Minnelli was the first choice to play Lucille Austero. Ron Howard was previously directed by her father, and apparently she babysat for him. So he called her, and the creator discussed the part with her, and she was immediately interested. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-11-24 02:03</small></li>

<li>I have no problem with it, but what about adding the actual diacritical pronunciation, |jōb| , as well.

<dd>here's another definition for you: <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarcasm.html" title="Sarcasm">sarcasm</a>... My point was that the phrase "actual diacritical pronunciation" means <i>nothing</i>. Diacritics mean different things in different systems, the only "actual" pronounciation is that given by the IPA notation. &lt;ō&gt; (whatever that may mean in your notational system) has no meaning to me, and I don't know what meaning it might have to anyone else - but I find it extremely difficult to believe you seriously read &lt;|jōb|&gt; as being pronounced /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">dʒoʊb</span>/. --<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.135.179.53.html" title="User:86.135.179.53">86.135.179.53</a> 21:12, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is no need to get upset because you do not understand a form. I never suggested removing the IPA, but simply adding another common pronunciation type. If you must know IPA is not as international as it's initialism implies. In fact the IPA usage on the mainpage is the British/Euopeon format. The US IPA is |dʒɑb|. What is so difficult to believe about |ō| being pronounced ass a long O? it is the format in every school I've ever attended.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>except of course the vowel in the character G.O.B's name is not a "long O" (what does that mean exactly?). In a pure phonemic transcription, it's much closer to the dipthong [<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">oʊ</span>]. And for the issue on the IPA vs. regional pronounciation notations, see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28pronunciation%29_303e.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (pronunciation)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (pronunciation)</a>. --<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.135.179.53.html" title="User:86.135.179.53">86.135.179.53</a> 01:26, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm confused as to you can claim it's not a 'long O' but also claim to not know what a 'long O' is. Here are some examples: |tōn| or |toʊn] for tone, |kōn| or |koʊn| for cone, |jōb| or |dʒoʊb| for Job (The latter being the exact pronunciation of the character in question) I hope that clear it up for you.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Long O" = /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">oː</span>/. Not /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">oʊ</span>/. Describing /<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">oʊ</span>/ as "long" is a relic of the english vowel system as it was spoken hundreds of years ago, and in no way represents actual phonemic realization. See <a href="../../../v/o/w/Vowel_length.html" title="Vowel length">Vowel length</a> for a discussion on this. Now I have no idea where your "|ō|" representation comes from, but to me it makes absolutely no sense. It's rooted in assumptions and conventions on representation of english sounds, and in no way represents pure phonetic distinction. This is a clear example of why the IPA is used on wikipedia for pronounciation guides, not alternate systems like yours that contain inherant inaccuracies. --<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.135.179.53.html" title="User:86.135.179.53">86.135.179.53</a> 13:04, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Where did I say i had "no clue"? I said it makes no sense, in that it's based on assumptions and pre-formed prejudices, and horridly biased towards English pronounciation. The IPA, on the other hand, as it's name suggests, is international - biased towards no particular spelling convention; and capable of representing pure phonetic transcription. This is why IPA is used on wikipedia; whether it be in an article on linguistics or an article on a sitcom. --<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.135.179.53.html" title="User:86.135.179.53">86.135.179.53</a> 19:05, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>International does not mean Universal and despite it's inherient benefits the majority of Americans are not familiar with the British/European or American IPA formats. I have a stack of dictionaries that list, |jōb|, |jǔb|, |dʒoʊb| and |dʒəʊb| for the same word.</li>

<p>For God's sake, people. It's just two different formats for showing the pronunciation. I don't know about elsewhere, but in the US, "|jōb|" would be the most common way to do it. I'd guess the IPA format would be very confusing to most Americans. Check out www.dictionary.com.</p>

<li>It's postmodern due to the extensive use features like intertextuality and self-reflexivity, which aren't too common on network TV.

<li>I figured that's what was meant by this particular instance of "postmodernist." But I've also seen the term used as a criticism, e.g. (to paraphrase) in postmodern society there's nothing new under the sun, we've seen this all before, everything is merely a pastiche of previous ideas. According to those holding this view, <i>everything</i> on TV is postmodern. This is what I meant about "postmodern" being confusing, maybe I'm just dense but no one's been able to successfully explain it to me.

<li>The suffix makes all the difference in the world. They are different addresses, just as in Rd. or St. or Dr. or Ln. or Ave. Related or not in context is irrelevent. www.saveourbluths.org was registered by 20th Cetnury Fox on 19-DEC-2005 and www.saveourbluths.com was registered by Kirk S. of Katy, TX on 16-MAY-2005.

<li>Speculation? They purchased the domain, they advertised the domain (more clearly than any other shown on the show), but didn't --for the first time-- create the corresponding website. You speculate that they wanted viewers to go to Kirk Nobody's site comprised solely of a splash page. Talk about a leap of faith. There are many great sites out there for AD, Kirk's being the least of them. They did all the leg work and then *poof* nothing. At the very least they could have done a redirect to FOX's AD page, therefore they dropped they ball. If they hadn't this would not be a matter of dicussion on a dozen AD forums.
<ul>
<li>My understanding of a splash page comes from wikipedia — "usually providing no real information besides perhaps a note about browser requirements and sometimes a web counter." The Web page <a href="http://the-op.com/saveourbluths/" class="external free" title="http://the-op.com/saveourbluths/" rel="nofollow">http://the-op.com/saveourbluths/</a>, however appears to have a fair amount of info for fans interested in attempting to save the show and plenty of addresses and links for them to do so. Thusly, I do believe it could be Fox's line of thinking that they could get fans to spread the word (and raise viewership) without actually having to spend cash to develop the site. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabuBhatt_d0d9.html" title="User:BabuBhatt">BabuBhatt</a> 01:24, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Splash page, or spash screen, qualifies here. It was a simple* Flash presentation basically informing that a website will be up shortly. They have sense redirected to the-op.com, an excellent AD fan site. * I know you're going to misunderstand my use of 'simple' here. The flash had some animations and pics but no user-interaction, meaning clickable links to enter teh site or navigate through the site.

There's also no paragraph about the episode where the "order is cut" from season two (the name escapes me right now), and though this episode is, yes, much more meta-referential than that, I think it would be much more fitting to move most of the current paragraph to the 'Intertextuality and reflexivity' section, or at least work much of it into the Intertextuality and reflexivity text. - <a href="../../../v/i/e/User%7EViewdrix_e10c.html" title="User:Viewdrix">Viewdrix</a> January 3rd, 2006</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disbarred</span></h2>
<p>The article says "Tobias, a disbarred psychiatrist". I think <i>disbarred</i> is the wrong word, but I don't know what the right word is. Help? <a href="../../../i/k/e/User%7EIke9898_2b0c.html" title="User:Ike9898">ike9898</a> 15:18, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, 'disbarred' usually refers to lawyers being forbidden to practice. The equivalent for doctors (at least in my neck of the woods) is being 'struck off' (i.e. the medical register).

<li>"Tobias, a psychiatrist whos license (is/has been) revoked.", is how it's most often written in the states.</li>
<li>In Canada, it goes by license revoked as well -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarry_Zuckerkorn_d603.html" title="User:Barry Zuckerkorn">Barry Zuckerkorn</a> 18:44, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Previously it said that he is a "discredited psychiatrist," which is completely false; his medical license was revoked for using CPR on someone who was only sleeping and cracking their sternum (pilot episode). It has nothing to do with faulty psychiatrical theory, indeed he has published at least two books and no where do they come under scrutiny. Although "disbarred" is not the correct terminology it at least conveys the correct idea.
<ul>
<li>Disbar is incorrect because it literally means "to remove from the bar", the examintion that lawyers, and only lawyers, must pass to practice law.<small><a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPattersonc_dcf3.html" title="User:Pattersonc">Pattersonc</a>(<a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPattersonc_b549.html" title="User talk:Pattersonc">Talk</a>) 9:02 PM, Sunday; January 29 2006 (EST)</small></li>

<dd>Since there is no single verb which properly expresses that his medical license was revoked, I felt the sentence needed to be restructured. I rewrote the sentence as: "She is married to Tobias Fünke (<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cross_53d7.html" title="David Cross">David Cross</a>), a "<a href="../../../n/e/v/Never_Nude_26bd.html" title="Never Nude">Never Nude</a>," who became an aspiring actor after his <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatry.html" title="Psychiatry">psychiatrist's</a> license was revoked, and whose language and behavior often have inadvertent <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexual</a> connotations." — <a href="../../../t/u/e/User%7ETuesdayMush_6f11.html" title="User:TuesdayMush">TuesdayMush</a> 01:35, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>"benches have also been utilized for this purpose. In one scene Buster is partly obscuring an Army bench so our view reveals "ARM OFF" ..."</p>
<p>i believe that this is acutaly a joke after his hand has been rmoved...he looks at an "alarm off" button on an electric alarm clock.</p>
<p>can anyone verify? <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicalgit_87a7.html" title="User:Classicalgit">Classicalgit</a> 21:49, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>benches have been used twice now. once when buster covers up the words "army officer" - "arm off" and again in the second season when rita covers up "wee brittin" - "wee brain" the arm off on the alarm clock is a seperate occurance of the joke. The buster bench happens moments BEFORE his hand is lost, and the rita bench happens soon before we find out that she is not smart. the writers have many hand/seal jokes in season two prior to the hand loss. hand chair, seal award from army etc. -wabiD</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Spelling of GOB</span></h2>
<p>In the pilot episode, GOB's name is written out on screen as G.O.B. (George Oscar Bluth II). Should the spelling of his name be changed to include the periods (G.O.B. rather than GOB)? <a href="../../../t/u/e/User%7ETuesdayMush_6f11.html" title="User:TuesdayMush">TuesdayMush</a> 02:50, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes it should.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>ridiculous. his nickname is "gob", <i>based</i> on his initials. he is called "gob", not his initials. after explaining his nickname and its pronunciation, it should be spelled "Gob", just as on the DVD cases (where sense overruled the urge to show everybody, every time, that his name comes from his initials). yeah, we get it; his nickname comes from initials. now spell it like a name, for crying out loud. the same all-caps crowd still writes scuba as "SCUBA", and creates a scene whenever anybody refers to the first <i>star wars</i> movie as "the first star wars movie". probably doesn't matter though 216.8.14.211 16:44, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
