<p>Hi. First, Welcome to Wikipedia! Please, do verify an article's history and talk page before claiming "vandalism". I reverted the anon's edits because <b>then</b> he severely edited the article a couple of hours after I had added the tag. I didn't edit the article further (which also resulted in not removing the tag) to prevent altercations with the anon that were ensuing from connected discussions. When the anon complained about the tag, I told him to go ahead with his edits. Those tags are not untouchable, they exist to help the community work better together. I actually don't know why it was left there for so long after I declared that I would not be editing the article for now. You see, in most cases it's all about countext. No worries though. For more on vandalism, please check <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>.

<p>Please do <i><b>not</b></i> move a page if you don't know what you are doing. You created a multiple redirect that tangled everything together. To undo it I had to undo your move.

1. The previous move by Deb was without any consensus. High-handed act, resulting in an impractical title. You should be forbidding her to do such. (Most of which I have seen about deb's doings here, indicate that she does not necessarily know what she is doing.)</p>
<p>2. There was no tangled, no problematic redirect. At least not before you did whatever you did. Your move should be reverted. (Btw, speaking about problems created by less-than-thorougly-thought moves, have you yet repaired the problem you created to the attached Talk page when you made the ridiculous page <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_of_wied.html" title="Elizabeth of wied">Elizabeth of wied</a> (sic!) - see <a href="../../../e/l/i/Talk%7EElizabeth_of_wied_f19c.html" title="Talk:Elizabeth of wied">Talk:Elizabeth of wied</a>: does such exist still?) <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 00:40, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I notice that you've now accused the creators of the articles on <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Catherine_Grey_f9b2.html" title="Lady Catherine Grey">Lady Catherine Grey</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Mary_Grey_05d0.html" title="Lady Mary Grey">Lady Mary Grey</a>, etc. of being part of some sort of nebulous conspiracy to add "titulary" to article titles, when none of those creators appear to have any pattern of doing so; nor do they appear to have any connection to the people with whom you've been sparring. As someone who would prefer to work with you rather than against you, I would like to respectfully suggest that you relax a bit and try to assume good faith on the part of other users when you see an "incorrect" title, rather than getting angry. I know it's easy to get worked up about things in Wikipedia (I've certainly done so myself), but a calm and professional demeanor will, I think, greatly enhance your standing. Your campaign to remove titles of nobility from article titles is, as far as I can see, sound, and I realize you think you're doing a great service to Wikipedia by bringing them in line with the standards; but your abrupt movement of articles and attacks on people who protest have been rather high-handed, and I think that the more you do that, the more people will write you off as an obsessive crank rather than a useful contributor. (And if they do lodge a protest about your behavior, the fact that you're correct about moving the articles doesn't mean your behavior will be upheld.) Wikipedia is always under construction; taking an extra week to get some consensus on a move isn't the end of the world, and doing so is likely to defuse a lot of the hostility directed at you. Be that as it may, I wish you the best in your work and hope you obtain a peaceful resolution to your conflicts. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 03:42, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As far as I can see, certain namings were changes, not (always) made by creators of article. Admittedly, the edit history too often shows very badly where the heading comes from, and misunderstandings about such source can easily happen. It seems very obvious, checking the edit history of the first article you listed, that there was a renaming very recently, and that the curent heading is not from the creator of the article. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 09:04, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your beliefs, whatever such are, mean nothing here.</p>
<p>I have not given you any permission to change mine, nor use my signature.</p>
<p>Re your ideas, you seem to grasp the policy inadequately anyway, and are making baseless allegations. Your accusations do not hold water, unless there is sockpuppetry used in some vote.</p>

<p>Please stop insulting Deb. Deb is a highly respected user with a long and credible history behind her. She is only raising genuine issues to do with naming. She does not warrant your insults and accusations.</p>

<p>As I have not been insulting her, your request remains somewhat erratic. Let me say that her creation of bogus honorary consuls, bogus addresses, bogus consulates, and so on, makes me doubt her respectability, credibility and "genuine issues": <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3A69.10.141.71&amp;diff=19610149&amp;oldid=19600621" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3A69.10.141.71&amp;diff=19610149&amp;oldid=19600621" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3A69.10.141.71&amp;diff=19610149&amp;oldid=19600621</a>. Human actions are often somewhat stupid. Dear Jtdirl, (were you less hotheaded and less careless) you would comprehend that telling openly about actions made here are not insults nor improper accusations. (Have you thought that if accusations were forbidden, what is then your position having accused users from this and that all over.) However, I am assuming good faith, and using Hanlon's razor attributing actions rather to stupidity than to malice.

<p>PS: I don't usually check other User_talk: pages (so that I don't have to monitor a whole long list of User_Talk: pages - one for each person with whom I am having a "conversation"), so please leave any messages for me on my talk page (above); if you leave a message for me here I probably will not see it.

<p>The original arrangement of I-do-not-know-whose, to put two women into one article, was one of the reasons for the tendency to be screwn up. A "straightening" at that stage was of course doomed to highly likely be frustrated in future, thus I have not very much pity to you having done that - you could have separated the persons and made your straughtening only after that, whereby the straightening would have been on more tenable ground. Let me say that an illusion "things used to work fine" is almost delusion. My action was to put one of them, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_of_Greece_e043.html" title="Alexandra of Greece">Alexandra of Greece</a>, to her proper location here, and I followed very carefully the NC in doing that - and corrected a bunch of links. I would have been tolerant to the other to remain at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Alexandra_of_Greece_2bc4.html" title="Princess Alexandra of Greece">Princess Alexandra of Greece</a>, though I prefer another kind of location, towards which she has recently been moving.

<p>The originator of the article which then was solely about the Queen consort of Yugoslavia, was a certain user Jtdirl. He obviously then (in 2003) wanted her to be "Princess" in the heading of the article and thus created the article at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Alexandra_of_Greece_2bc4.html" title="Princess Alexandra of Greece">Princess Alexandra of Greece</a>, despite of the fact that it was well known to the writer himself that she was a deceased queen consort. Of course, the usage in history boks and works of reference to use pre-marital name without any title (e.g <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_of_Aragon_0c7a.html" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>) of deceased queen consorts has a long history and should have been familiar already in 2003 to any professional. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 20:34, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the hint. I have never heard that story before, but I'm sure it would have pleased King Georgios (Prince Vilhelm) to know that he was connected to the former rulers of Greece. No matter what, he was an excellent king. It's just too bad for Greece, he died so soon. I'll try to see if I can find the source behind the list.

<p>Here is the text of the 1923 constitution:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Art. 34. Puterile constitutionale ale Regelui sunt ereditare in linie coboritoare, directa si legitima a Majestatii Sale Regelui Carol I de Hohenzollern Sigmaringen, din barbat in barbat, prin ordinul de primogenitura si cu <b>exclusiunea perpetua a femeilor si coboritorilor lor</b>. Coboritorii Majestatii Sale vor fi crescuti in religiunea ortodoxa a Rasaritului.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The constitutional powers of the King are hereditary in the line of direct and legitimate descendants of King Carol I, male to male in order of primogeniture, with the perpetual exclusion of females and their descendants. The descendants of the King must be Eastern Orthodox.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So the King had no power to decide unilaterally that his daughter could succeed him. Since Michael's claim to be King of Romania depends on the text of the constitution under which he inherited the throne, he cannot ignore its provisions in the matter of the succession without negating his own status. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 23:01, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Gryffindor, you should really cease to move and also to name any pages here. It seems that expertised editors have recently been correcting your actions all around the place. Would it be sufficient to you to focus on <b>improving contents of articles</b>, not even trying to move them. I guess if you'd refrain so, thos work will be easier both to you and to a number of more expertised editors who recently have faced an increased workload particularly in articles where you have been. Then, as you have a habit to use/to add Royal Highnesses and other styles to articles, I would like to point you to read some ideas at <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypercorrection.html" title="Hypercorrection">Hypercorrection</a> - that behavior, also outside grammar, is an usual trap of novices and/or ignorants.

<p>Dear Gryffindor, your ability to assess namings of those is so flawed that there is no need to continue that. I will oppose your attempts to clutter article headings with stupid or unnecessary elements.</p>
<p>Additionally, Antares-Gryffindor, it seems that you have not grasped the manner WP is working. You are reverting contents blindly, trying to protect some repetitive styles (which anyway are to be condensed into one infobox). And, when you wrote your contributions (or possibly copyvios from websites) into articles, you of course did not retain any copyrights.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please answer the questions, why are you moving articles without waiting for a consensus first and thus creating a lot of trouble? Are you not aware of the damage you are creating this way? You should talk to the users first instead of trying to rename articles at your own whim.

<p>It is not becoming to come to <b>require</b> an answer to anything. As people are saying, you cannot force anyone to answer. It actually is also because there always are some extreme persons asking all sorts of things, and any answer will never suffice. Not to hint that you Gryffindor are one of such <s>crazies</s>, but you have certainly posed several questions rudely above. There would be better formuations to you, Gryffindor, to use if you actually desire real discussion: such as for example "I noticed your (whatever), and I was hoping you could further explain it".</p>

<p>Dear Gryffindor (neé <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares911_8cd1.html" title="User:Antares911">User:Antares911</a>), I already warned you against littering my usertalk page. That warning holds, and your violations against it are regarded as sort of spamming. About the issue you now brought, YOU have no right to use renaming tags improperly in Wikipedia. If you propose renaming, you need to write your proposition to the centralized page WP:RM, under the day when proposal is made, and only of such that are written there are to be tagged at the article talkpage. Instead, you have disrupted Wikipedia by leaving lone tags in very very many articles. Anyone is entitled to remove such lone ones, as improper. The Wikipedia community would thrive much better, were you Gryffindor to receive a ban to move any pages, a ban to request any moves of articles, a ban to write any styles into texts, and a ban to write any titles to article headings - and also some sort of "idiocy parole". <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 08:59, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>1) The edit I removed was not signed. It appeared to be by an anonymous editor that had been told several times not to leave unsigned messages on talk pages.</p>
<p>2) The removed text was disruptive, in the sense of <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a>. The "point" 217.140.193.123 was trying to make is that it's all <i>lameness</i>. Adding further lameness to illustrate that point is "Gaming the system", according to that guideline.</p>
<p>3) The anonymous user has been properly warned, see <a href="../../../2/1/7/User_talk%7E217.140.193.123.html#Track_record" title="User talk:217.140.193.123">User_talk:217.140.193.123#Track_record</a></p>
<p>I'm convinced you try to stop the lameness over WoO (and other topics of the same order) as much as I am. On second thought I think I maybe didn't give you a full answer yet why I didn't want to change my vote for the nth time: If I'd change it it would be again to the "no vote" option because of "it's absurd to try to solve this issue by a vote, while it apparently doesn't work towards consensus". I kept my vote on "WoO redirect to disambig" because I'm still convinced (but again, that's only my personal intuition, based on my personal wiki-experience) that will <i>ultimately</i> be the solution that is least challenged over a long period of time. So, no I don't feel like discussing this much further, it's taken enough of my time. And yes, a vote is not necessary to keep that solution in place (to which you helped, thanks!), because a reference to the <a href="../../../p/o/v/Wikipedia%7EPOV_02c5.html" title="Wikipedia:POV">wikipedia:POV</a> guideline suffises.</p>
<p>And I continue to try to keep those out that seem not so much intrested in improving wikipedia as in fighting their own feuds.</p>

<dd>Francis, a bit of advice: you cannot require anyone to sign their comments. And, comments on talk pages are not removed just because they are unsigned. Additionally, commenting is a recommended way to express the point, the undesired way would be not to comment, but to <b>make</b> it, for example writing lame articles or making lame wars. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 12:15, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please give me some time to answer, my edits are currently <i>very slow</i> because my webserver is under DOS attack since a few hours after my IP appeared on talk:WoO. So that's why I removed <i>my own edit</i> disclaiming involvement in a misunderstanding between 217.140.193.123 and Philip Baird Shearer, that has long been solved by apologies by Philip, see <a href="../../../2/1/7/User_talk%7E217.140.193.123.html#Apology" title="User talk:217.140.193.123">User_talk:217.140.193.123#Apology</a>. That edit of mine is of no relevance whatsoever to that page any more (since user 217.140.193.123 already quite some time ago removed that part of the WoO talk page that was the <i>origin</i> of the misunderstanding).</p>
<p>So, please give me 15 minutes to remove again what you have just been restoring, OK? I think my explanation above was also clear enough about the reasons why the anonymous "lame" paragraph could be removed.</p>

<p>Hi, The William of Orange discussion seems to have descended into some sort of bureaucratic struggle.

<p>No, no, I don't see how you can accuse me of personal attacks.</p>
<p>It's al standard procedure: "adding nonsense" is defined as one of the types of vandalism. <i>Any</i> vandalism in that sense can be related to the topic at hand (and clever vandalism usually is!). The next step, if not unambiguously sure the vandalism was <i>intended</i>, while e.g. it might have been unintended disruptive behaviour, is to give a test message.</p>
<p>If the disruptive behaviour continues, it's up to sysop at hand to judge on that (that is, after listing on the proper page requiring admin intervention).</p>
<p>So, finally I'm saying: it's not up to me to decide ultimately whether this was vandalism, it sure looks so to me, but it's only if the receiver ignores that his behaviour might have been perceived as disruptive that an admin'll have to make the discernment.</p>

<p><br />
Francis, I again repeat: you should not erase any comments of others from article talk pages. And, your judgement of what is nonsense is not necessarily objective. Also, as you have been a participant there, your should refrain from deciding if others' comments are nonsense or not. If you do not personally or for some other reason, like the comment, that however is no reason for erasure.</p>
<p>Again, I remind you Francis that you should understand that anonymous users are as entitled as you to contribute to Wikipedia and as entitled as you to comment on relevant issues at talk pages.</p>
<p>Francis, I reminded you earlier using words "you should refrain from making personal attacks". If you are not making personal attacks, then it is easy to you to refrain from such. Kindly be reminded that you are not allowed to ake personal attacks. And that some others may regard some of your comments as personal attacks.</p>

<p>As you have done work with some monarchies, please take a look at this too.

Deb decided to delete it - according to Deletion log, by doing "21:12, 31 August 2005 Deb deleted "Elisabeth of Bohemia" (Deleted to make way for move)". No AfD. She obviously wanted to move another article to that placement, leading in that case also to POV (see current <a href="../../../e/l/i/Talk%7EElisabeth_of_Bohemia_e788.html" title="Talk:Elisabeth of Bohemia">Talk:Elisabeth of Bohemia</a>) endorsing a royal pretension from era of religious warring in Germany. I think Deb has sort of proprietary attitude to certain articles and names, including this one. I cannot remember all contents of the old page, and anyway its GDFL history should be preserved, so it is incorrect to write a new similar page which does not credit earlier contributors.

It has never been my intention that somebody will read this before it's finished. Simple in that article I have put text from Thomas and Demetrius which can be in future article Demetrius because I have given to Adam Bishop propositon of deleting this article from Wikipedia. Yes greatest part of both articles will be from first. Article Thomas Palaeologus is finished for me, maybe I will add in future link to Andronicus but nothing else.

<p>"Derrick of Oldenburg" gets zero Google hits. "Dietrich of Oldenburg" gets 103. I doubt if anybody knows that Dietrich is the same as Derrick, and I doubt anybody has ever called him that. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 08:11, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's the English name. 103 hits is anyway a low number, such is usually caused by hits of genealogy sites which use too much non-English versions. There somewhere is some criterion that if google hits not thousands, google is not to be relied on. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 08:29, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>So give me one place where he's called Derrick. And just because it's an English name doesn't mean it's the name English speakers of. The King of Spain is Juan Carlos, not John Charles. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 08:37, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, Arrigo. Since you and <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> seem to be in a dispute, would you be willing for me to mediate between you two? I hope that if both of you agree, we can begin some productive discussion, and that some issues will be cleared up. If you are willing to give mediation a try, please let me know. Just a note: In the interest of full disclosure, I am not an <a href="../../../m/c/_/WP%7EMC_8667.html" title="WP:MC">official mediator</a> yet, but I'd be willing to help you two out if both of you agree.

<dd>I beleive the point of mediation is to help two dedicated <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedian.html" title="Wikipedian">Wikipedians</a> resolve their dispute. While there are multiple accusations of wrong-doing on both sides, I feel that if both of you were willing to resolve your differences with each other, that mediation would be extremely productive. Would you be willing to begin mediation and give it a try? My opinion is that there's no harm in trying. <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_1bb8.html" title="User:Flcelloguy">Flcelloguy</a> | <small><a href="../../../f/l/c/User_talk%7EFlcelloguy_7b23.html" title="User talk:Flcelloguy">A <font color="brown">note?</font></a></small> | <a href="../../../f/l/c/User%7EFlcelloguy_Desk_89ed.html" title="User:Flcelloguy/Desk">Desk</a> 00:16, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a vast potential of harm, as evidently <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">User:Francis Schonken</a> uses everything for building his less-than-sane accusations. I have no doubt that anything I utter during a mediation will find its route to Francis Schonken's so-called evidence, which should rather be called as collection of bias and fabrication. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 00:22, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How about if a mediation page is created, and that nothing written on those pages can go anywhere else? If both of you agree on that condition, I feel that mediation would become more productive.

<p>I regard this block inappropriate. My edits were not identical. The alleged fourth revert was different in content than any of the others. The alleged third revert was different in content than the others. In maximum, there are two clear reverts by me. Since cut-and-paste move is forbidden by WP policy, my alleged reverts anyway were to help keeping cut-and-paste situation from taking place, i.e they were defending against policy-breaking vandalism. Moreover, having seen how the complanant, <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">User:Francis Schonken</a> has not been blocked, although the same admin handled that matter too, I regard my this block highly partial. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 03:25, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Partiality had nothing to do with it. In fact, to my knowledge, I have had no dealing with Francis Schonken or you in the past. I viewed your edits as identical, and did not view his as being so. I also left Francis Schonken's case open for the review of another admin. But I only counted three reverts by him.

<p>The page has changed somewhat between those edits. For example, between 8 and 9 there is some changes: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Princess_Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=23422611&amp;oldid=23419664" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Princess_Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom&amp;diff=23422611&amp;oldid=23419664" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. 3RR is in question if the removal is always identical or if the original revision is the same in all reverts. Neither of those conditions are fulfilled here. (You chose erroneously e.g the revisions to be diffed in 8 - it is somewhat later, and the page had changed in between.) In fact, you yourself wrote "they are not completely the same". I think the block you administered, has come from some inexperience. Helping to avoid cut-and-paste move is working against vandalism, and my edits were mostly to return the content to the article after someone had destroyed them by making it a redirect. Besides, it is irrelevant whether you know or not Schonken: partiality comes already from uneven handling. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 03:59, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I took diffs between any two edits you made. 6, 7, and 8 ALL are the same as the previous revert you made. 8 was not erroneous- the two pages are exactly the same because you reverted to it. And, yes, there were edits between 8 and 9. But I noted that you reverted those edits. And that's why you were blocked. Look at 6, 7, and 8- they're the same. Why? Because you reverted them in full. And #9 was the same, except for a minor edit by Deb. And that's why you were blocked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also take offense to your anger at my perceived "lack of experience". I've been on Wikipedia since November 2004, and I think I have a reasonable grasp of 3RR. If you're not breaking 3RR, you're gaming the system, and if you'd rather, we can call the block for gaming the system instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as uneven handling, the two situations were different, and I treated them as such. I believe you broke 3RR, and he didn't. So, I didn't block him, but I did block you. Should another admin agree, they are free to block Francis Schonken. But I'm not going to. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 04:41, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am not angry. Rather, I pity. You try to make excuses of "gaming the system" when I only made edits to build these articles better and to avoid cut-and-paste situation. Funny that you do not see how Schonken more or less "gamed the system" in both of these articles, wanting to create cut-and-paste which can be regarded as vandalism. That you do not see it is yet one reason to feel pity. Well, between 8 and 9, I had added a relevant template. These were not identical reverts and did not violate 3RR. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 04:49, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You admit that you made 3 reverts. And #9 was exactly the same as the other 3, except for a template. Read 3RR again- that was a partial revert, which still violates 3RR. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">Ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 15:51, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If an older page is merged to a newer page, without merging also edit history, it amounts to the same as a cut-and-paste move. There is no essential difference: in both cases, a content created in an older page is moved to a newer page, without its edit history.</p>
<p>A redirect does not help. Also in cut-and-paste moves a redirect can be made and still it is a cut-and-paste move.</p>
<p>The one true harm of cut-and-paste moves, and similarly of mergers without merging the edit history too, is the fact that the material becomes much more difficult to trace. For example, if there is a copyvio, it is more laborious (and sometimes too laborious) to find its origin (and it is a pity in cases where the originator actually has been entitled to give the text to WP). And contrariwise, to trace all the places where a spotted copyvio has spread. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrigo_7e77.html" title="User:Arrigo">Arrigo</a> 04:10, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><s>Hi Arrigo, I wouldn't do "See also" sections at the bottom of pages with a link to a disambiguation page. A <i>dab</i> page should never contain more "info" than the actual page of the person, IMHO. If disambiguation is needed (which might be for some of the princesses Victoria you treated that way, but not necessarily all), maybe better to use a standard dab template at the top of the page, something like {{Otheruses2|Princess Victoria}}, or something more adapted to the situation. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 21:24, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<p>Hi Arrigo, as a result of your page move of 29 augustus 2005 of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander%2C_Crown_Prince_of_Yugoslavia_1fa4.html" title="Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia">Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander%2C_Crown_Prince_of_Yugoslavia&amp;diff=22065268&amp;oldid=21793485" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexander%2C_Crown_Prince_of_Yugoslavia&amp;diff=22065268&amp;oldid=21793485" rel="nofollow">diff</a> that article is littered with double redirects.</p>
<p>I see that yesterday your alter ego <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">user:217.140.193.123</a> has been busy adding to the confusion by adding double redirects in the sense of <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine%2C_Crown_Princess_of_Yugoslavia_44d6.html" title="Katherine, Crown Princess of Yugoslavia">Katherine, Crown Princess of Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_Princess_Alexander_of_Yugoslavia_608a.html" title="Crown Princess Alexander of Yugoslavia">Crown Princess Alexander of Yugoslavia</a>, the last one speedy deleted by Fvw, but resuscitated by you within minutes after the delete.</p>
<p>Please clean up double redirects.</p>
<p>Please also have a look at Flcelloguy's mediation proposal. The way I see your activities now (among others <b>creating redirect pages with the sole goal of creating double redirects</b> and doing so <b>with your IP instead of the user name</b> in order to make it look less suspicious), you're heading straight for a permanent ban. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 09:44, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
