	    <p>I don't know whether my brains is playing tricks on me, but i thought the central feature of Arrow-Debreu model is more to do with the anonymous nature of the markets. Ie Nobody care who supplies chair or steel in the market or who buy the same goods. I didn't see that from the Arrow-Debreu model article. The defination above is from "Toward new paradigm in monetary economics" by Stiglitz</p>
<hr />
<p>I agree that the description is somewhat narrow and have added an introduction with reference to the economic theory pages on the subject. I agree with the original author(s) that in financial economics the term is typically used with reference to AD-securities.</p>
<p>I would like to hear more on what BIC's are (from the original author(s) or anybody else informed on that subject). --Olejasz 14:18, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>BICs are nonsense. You can read some discussion at <a href="http://wilmott.com/messageview.cfm?catid=11&amp;threadid=24700" class="external free" title="http://wilmott.com/messageview.cfm?catid=11&amp;threadid=24700" rel="nofollow">http://wilmott.com/messageview.cfm?catid=11&amp;threadid=24700</a>, or the official site <a href="http://www.4bics.com" class="external free" title="http://www.4bics.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.4bics.com</a> for the self-published books of "Obi-Wan Yoda". --Ogdred 04:40, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Removed the re-addition of the BICs claim. I have looked, and cannot not even find so much as a definition of these anywhere (outside of the author's self-published work). Ogdred 19:50, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I will step out, and leave it to some other editor to decide the fate of BICs here. I am sure that the truth lies somewhere in between my offhand dismissal of them as "nonsense", and the author's press release describing them as "the most significant theoretical and practical contribution to derivatives analysis since the Black Scholes analysis or even since financial mathematics pioneer Louis Bachelier."(Obi-Wan Yoda: I truly believe it. If you understood what was written, I am sure you'd concur. Otherwise, you'd more effectively provide specifics to ridicule the pretention)</p>
<p>Honestly, Arrow-Debreu securities are a fundamental concept in finance. It seems strange, to say the least, to spend a third of this article on discussing an unproven concept (indeed, explained by the author himself). <i>Wikipedia is not a place for original research and self-promotion</i> (Obi-Wan Yoda:&#160;???), and the presence of a discussion of BICs in this article is entirely misleading (Obi-Wan Yoda:&#160;??? Anyone who is interested in Arrow Debreu securities would want to know about BICs.Is it not obvious???. It is a "for further study reference" properly qualified as "emerging concept")-- anyone coming to this page wanting to know what an Arrow-Debreu security is would think this is a concept that actually has seen some acceptance in the finance community, which as of writing it certainly has not.(*Obi-Wan: Samuelson once said "science progresses funeral by funeral". That which is considered acceptable will be considered garbage toorrow. That which is considered heretic today may be considered accepted paradigm tomorrow. Method to discredit innovations reminescent of the inquisition bring only discredit to their author. Rather, informed argumentation should be the criteria through which claims should be discriminated against. If you were a scientist I would expect more to disqualify *)</p>
<p>This just begs the question -- why not create an article on Basis Instrument Contracts, and take the proselytizing out of this page? --Ogdred 00:59, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Obi-Wan: If you checked, there is an article on BICs created April 3rd, 2006. There was an article before that date, I guess it was vandalized by another uninformed "wilmotter" or the like on a vendetta. This is not proselytizing. Anyone who is interested in Arrow Debreu securities would want to know about BICs. It is a "for further study reference" properly qualified as "emerging concept"</p>

<p>Hello, My name is Obi-Wan Yoda author of the BICs books. I have been recovering from a PPS condition and that has delayed the effort to bring awareness to BICs. I see there is an individual by the name of Ogred determined to erase my work from any outside mention. A lot of uninformed individuals have written strange things about the book in the wilmott forum. I thought it was a forum for discussion on quant finance. Between relapses, I tried to register several times to have an opportunity to explain, but was never allowed to post. This individual slandering(Ogdred) the book or BICs on that forum BICs seem to have turned to wikipedia with the same agenda.</p>
<p>My only expllanation so far is that BICs is perceived as unsettling the willmott business. But it need not.</p>
<p>Contrary to Mr./Ms. Ogred, to this date, I have not seen a single individual who has read the material and disputed a single claim in it. Lack of extensiveefforts to develop awareness is simply due to lack of resources I have put this post on watch and will respond to all curteous exchanges. If Mr./Ms. Ogred, would want to receive a copy of the book and engage here in a thoughtful and unbiased discussion here and on wilmott(after asking for my being allowed to speak there too), I'll gladly send him a copy free of charge.</p>

<p>Note:</p>
<p>Definition: A Basis Instrument Contract or BIC is a representative derivative contract that is an element of a set of classes of equivalence of contracts. Together, these contracts uniquely enable the static replication of any derivatives contract in a multi-period trading market without any model assumption.</p>
<p>Hence, BICs are derivatives contracts of reference through which any derivatives contract, however complex or illiquid can be decomposed. This absence of model assumption is the critical differentiating factor with the Black Scholes Merton replication method by continuous delta hedging or more generally, the derivatives hedging approach by greeks hedging. The characteristic features of BICs and the rationale for those are as follows:</p>
<p>1) A Basis Instrument Contract or BIC identifies two parties: one or more buyer(s) named A and one or more seller(s) named B.</p>
<p>2) The definition of each BIC comprises three dates:</p>
<p>• The contract agreement date t0, which is the date at which the binding rights and obligations on both sides of the contract are agreed upon.</p>
<p>• The premium payment date ti , with ,which is the date at which the party identified in the contract as the buyer A complies with its part of the agreement by paying the seller B an amount in units of basis currency known as the premium of the contract or the premium payment amount. The premium payment amount may be expressed as a function of the values of the fluctuating variables between time t0 and time ti</p>
<p>• The contract expiry date, also known as maturity or payout payment date tj, with tj &gt; ti = ti+1, is the date at which the party(ies) identified in the contract as the seller(s) B complies with its (their) part of the agreement by paying the buyer(s) A an amount in units of basis currency as determined as the payout of the individual BIC.</p>
<p>3) A BIC admits notional amounts that may be functions of the realized values of underlyings and related derivatives contracts whose value shall be known by the premium payment date ti at the latest. With their pre-agreement features, BICs may be somewhat reminiscent of Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) and Forwards. However, unlike FRAs or forwards, we do not know in general the numerical value of the notional of a BIC at contract agreement time.</p>
<p>The payout format of BICs at each payout payment date defined in what we call the BIC set format.</p>

<p>Predictably enough, Mr./Ms. Ogred had no interest in the truth or objectivity. No intellectual curiosity as all the other Wilmott special interests panderers,... Clueless Slander is so much fun ... it seems.</p>
