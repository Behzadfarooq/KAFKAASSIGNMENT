<p>I'm moving the following text out of the article. I don't know enough about the subject to comment on its accuracy, but it sounds very much like an attempt to persuade rather than inform. On the other hand, there's also lots of info. Someone more knowledgeable than me will need to sort the good from the bad. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 15:46, 15 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Historically speaking, the territory in the Caucasus that lies to the north of the Aras river, was never called Azerbaijan until the year 1918. Giving it this name created difficulties in the first half of the 20th century and in the succeeding years, and these cannot be ignored. History, as well as the works of ancient geographers and Islamic writers bear witness to the fact that the land to the north of the Aras River, which is now known as Azerbaijan, was known before as Albania (Alban). Classical writers, such as Strabon and others, called this region Albania, Armenian, or Alvanak (Aghvanak), while Iranians called it Aran. Aliyov, a historian in the former Soviet Azerbaijan, in his article "Sources Relating the Ancient History of Caucasus's Albania", wrote that in the Parthian era, the eastern part of the Caucasus was called "Ardan". Greek materials referred to this place as "Albania". Barthold, the famous Soviet scholar, believed that in the Islamic era and, according to Arabic sources, this name has taken the forms of "Al-ran" or "Aran", which probably is a transformation of the ancient Parthian name "Ardan".</p>
<p>There is no reason to doubt that Aran was separate from Azarbaijan and that the Aras River constituted the northern border of Azarbaijan, and Aran had never been called Azerbaijan. The academician Barthold most clearly mentioned the Aras River as lying between Azarbaijan and Aran or the ancient Albania (Collected Works, Volume 7, Moscow, 1971, page 123).</p>
<p>Prior to the invention of the name Azerbaijan to designate Aran and Shirvan, Tzarist Russian sources recognized only one Azarbaijan, the true Azarbaijan. The first volume of the Russian Encyclopedia (pages 212 and 213), which was published in St. Petersburg some 102 years ago (in 1890), stated: "Azarbaijan, which was 'Aturpatekan' in Pahlavi and 'Azarbadekan' in Armenian, is the rich industrial northern province of Iran. It borders Iranian Kurdistan and Iraq of Adjam to the south, Turkish Kurdistan and Armenia to the west, Russian Armenia and the Southern Caucasus to the north. Its border is marked by the Aras River". Had the name Azerbaijan been used for the land to the north of the Aras, undoubtedly, this encyclopedia would have used the name "Russian Azerbaijan" just as it had used the designations "Turkish Kurdistan", "Iranian Kurdistan", "Turkish Armenia", or "Russian Armenia". It can easily be seen that only one Azarbaijan existed and that was the Iranian Azarbaijan.</p>
<p>Following the Bolshevik Revolution and the ensuing turmoil in the Russian empire, Turkish politicians of the time became intent on establishing a puppet state in the Caucasus. In 1911, a party named "Mossavat" (Equality) was founded in Baku, which was supported by the Ottoman Turks. It held a joint congress with Turkey's Party of Federalists in 1917. In this congress, the two parties united and called themselves the "Democratic Party of Turkish Mossavat Federalists". Their goal was to unite Turkish-speaking people under the umbrella of Turkey.</p>
<p>The Mossavatis set up a government on 27 May 1918, and called the area the "Azerbaijan Republic". Their capital initially was Gandjeh, but after the occupation of Baku by the Turkish army under the command of Noori Pasha on 15 September 1918, the capital was transferred to Baku and their government was consolidated through the support of the Turkish army. They ruled Aran and Shirvan, calling these areas collectively as the Azerbaijan Republic for two years. This situation continued until 28 April 1920, at which date the Bolsheviks attacked Baku and declared the area as a Soviet republic. The Soviets persisted in using the invented name, calling this territory the "Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan".</p>
<p>Barthold disclosed the reason for choosing to apply such a name. In page 782 of the second volume of his Collected Works, he noted: "The name 'Azerbaijan' was adopted because it was presumed that through the establishment of the Azerbaijan Republic, the Iranian Azarbaijan and the Azerbaijan Republic will eventually become one." As can be seen, the name 'Azerbaijan' was used with a specific goal that became manifest at a later period. Somewhere else in this same volume, Barthold wrote: "Wherever and whenever a name should be required with which one can refer to the whole region of the Azerbaijan Republic, one can use Aran" (page 703).</p>
<p>From the very beginning, the use of the name "Azerbaijan" for Aran met with the protests of Iranian patriots, including Sheik Mohammad Khiabani and his comrades. But since this naming had been carried out, the Democrats siding with Khiabani decided to change the name of Iran's Azarbaijan to "Azadistan" (land of freedom). This fact was clearly stated in Kasravi's book titled "The Unknown Kings", where he expressed surprise at the use of the name Azerbaijan to refer to Aran, writing: "Why are our Arani brothers destroying their national history and their past at the onset of their national life? This itself is an enormous loss and there is no other example of such a strange deed in history" (second printing, page 265).</p>
<p>After foreign forces entered Iran in Shahrivar 1320 (August 1941), under the tutelage of the Red Army, a party was established in Tabriz called "The Party of Azerbaijan". It was mostly run by immigrants from the Caucasus and the executors of Soviet policy, especially the cronies of Mir-Dja'far Bagherov, the secretary of the central committee of the Communist Party of the Caucasus. At first, the leaders of this party clandestinely advocated the separation of Azarbaijan (from Iran). The excuse they used to carry out their aims was the prevalent use of the Turkish language in this area, which was actually forced upon the people of this region centuries ago, again through the immigration of Turks.</p>
<p>Kasravi wrote: "Their secret aim was separation from Iran" (Nameh-e Parcham, 2 June 1943). Three and a half years later, on 4 September 1945, Caucasian agents created another party named the "Democratic Party of Azerbaijan", which ostensibly advocated adherence to the Constitution and the establishment of provincial and state councils. Its real goal, however, was unification with the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan. The instigators of this idea for unification invented the names of "South and North Azerbaijan", whereas the land to the north of the Aras River had another name as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Democratic Party, who purportedly advocated the establishment of provincial and state councils, openly spoke about their secret aims following their escape from Iran and after finding refuge on the other side of the Aras. A message printed in the 'Azerbaijan' newspaper, which was the official organ of the Democratic Party, explicitly stated: "The people of South Azerbaijan, which is an indivisible part of North Azerbaijan, like all the peoples of the world, have their hopes fixed on the great people and the state of the Soviet Union" ('Azerbaijan' newspaper, no. 213, Baku, 23 December 1950). In another telegram to Mir-Dja'far Bagherov, the chairman of the Communist Party of the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan, these officials wrote: "Three whole years have passed since the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party that leads the struggle toward national liberation and the emancipation of the southern part of our motherland Azerbaijan, which has been suffering in the black hands of Persian chauvinists" ('Azerbaijan' newspaper, no. 81, Baku, 8 September 1948).</p>
<p>Following these actions, the terms "North Azerbaijan" and "South Azerbaijan" were skillfully manipulated into books and into translations from Turkish and Russian in order to inculcate this idea into the minds of readers. Some, knowingly or unknowingly, aided in propagating this idea. For instance, these unreasonable terms were included in history and geography textbooks and some of our translators repeated them. This practice has progressed to such an extent that a number of our local newspapers, without paying the least attention and consideration, have used these wrong and damaging terms, even in their recent issues, despite the fact that it is very easy to refute this be aware of the reality.</p>
<p>The author of the book "Corners of Iranian History" wrote: "The unification of North Azerbaijan with Russia played a progressive role and the only government that helped the people of the Caucasus against Iran and the Ottomans was Russia" (see pages 44, 192, 224). Did this reflect the real situation? How then can one explain the resistance of the people of that land in the past and the uprisings of Muslims, including the one led by Sheik Shamel in Daghestan, as well as the present reaction of the Caucasian and Central Asian people, and the Islamic movements in these republics? In many pages of this book, we find the terms North and South Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>These propagandists have been trying to pretend that Azerbaijan is a divided land and that it should be united someday. During the previous years, unification was to be realized with Soviet power. Today, the propaganda has taken another form, with American propagandists having involved Turkey and introduced it as a model. They use the wrong term "Azeri" in referring to the people and the land of Aran. The people of Aran should be called "Arani" as "Azeri" is a term that should be used only for the people of Azarbaijan. There is no link between the title "Azeri" and the people of Aran. And neither is "Azeri" the language of the people of Azarbaijan nor that of Aran. "Azeri" is one of the Iranian dialects, such as Kurdish, Lurish, Gillish, Mazandarani, Balouchi, Bakhtiari, and others. There is no relation between the old Azeri language and Turkish. There still exist in Azarbaijan groups of people living in the mountains speaking the Azeri dialect. The language spoken by the people of Aran is not Azeri nor is it ancient Arani. Rather, it is one of the Turkish dialects that has been mixed with local languages.</p>
<p>In the case of Azarbaijan and Aran, there are some who try to call Aran "Azerbaijan". This is a gross mistake. While the rulers of Azarbaijan ruled over Aran during certain epochs, Azarbaijan is a separate entity from Aran. At times, the rulers of Tabaristan ruled over Gilan and those of Gilan, such as the Buyids, ruled over Tabaristan; yet, Tabaristan and Gilan were separate and are considered separate lands now, even though they are adjacent. No one has ever denied the fact that Aran was under the rule of Iran and belonged to it, but taking the two as the same and using the damaging and wrong term of "North Azerbaijan" is a wrong approach.</p>
<p>It is not understandable why some refer only to what they are interested in and ignore most of the well-known writings. Bal'ami's work has long been revered as a Persian work, but, he was a translator of the Tarikh-e Tabari. The point that was noted in the Tarikh-e Bal'ami does not exist in the Tarikh-e Tabari (see Tarikh-e Tabari, Volume 5, page 1979, translated by Abolghassem Payandeh). But one should know that on geographical matters, the views of geographers are preferred. I do not wish to mention all such sources, but to clarify the situation of Azarbaijan and Aran, in the 10th and 11th century, which happens to be the time of Bal'ami, one can see the works of Ibn-e Khordad-beh who was the head of the 'Barid' (postal service) of Djebal (Media), and of Ibn-e Rosteh and many others, provided one is really seeking the truth and is not trying to verify one's own wishes and illusions.</p>
<p>Fanaticism is a sign of stupidity. Some accuse me of viewing the Mossavatis through the eyes of the Bolsheviks. The future will make everything clear and those who seek to deceive will be exposed to the nation. The final judgment will be made by men of reason, not by some ignorant fanatics.</p>
<p>I have not written anything regarding my beloved native land, Gilan; yet, I have dedicated a large part of my life to the study of Azarbaijan. This shows how much affection I feel for the people of Azarbaijan. When during my diaspora I was living in the mouth of the dragon, I did not ignore this sacred duty. My affection for the people of Azarbaijan cost me dearly during my migration. I had to suffer many deprivations. The separatists made my life and that of my family very difficult. I endured all these hardships for the sake of my country, of which Azarbaijan is a part.</p>
<p>Now that an independent republic has been established in the land of Aran, it would have been appropriate if it would stop abusing the name of Azarbaijan and would use its true historical name. Currently, Iran's enemies are unfortunately exploiting the existence of this misnomer by propagating false and misleading information. One example is Radio Liberty, which is run from Munich. It carries out its activities from a budget it receives from the US Congress and its broadcasts show the sinister goals that it seeks against the integrity of our country. You can also find similar things in the propaganda of some other countries. It is bizarre that a number of neighboring republics deviate from being sincere and honest, imagining the Iranian people as being ignorant of the facts. This is not so, as we do see and consider everything.</p>
<p>The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has proudly carried out its religious and neighborly duties toward the newly independent states bordering it. Even in the initial moments when its neighbors regained their sovereignty, Iran ignored the issue of name and some of their unjust behaviors, hoping that with the passage of time, its brothers and neighbors will pay due consideration and take notice of the facts. The Islamic Republic of Iran could make its recognition of the newly independent republics subject to certain conditions; however, in observing its religious and neighborly obligations, it did not choose to do so in order to enable the emerging states to achieve stability. The steps taken by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to promote economic cooperation proves this fact. Now it is appropriate for our Aranian brothers to take these factors into consideration and choose a path that will lead to strengthening the ties of friendship.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Q: Recently, in a book published under the title "Speaking with History", Nooreddin Kianoory accused you of repenting from the socialist ideas you had held for many years, that you returned to Iran and joined the regime of the Shah; in general, that you have publicly recanted your ideas and opinions in order to have gain important positions. What can you say about these?</p>
<p>A: Regarding the shift in scientific views, I should say that one is not born a scientist and from the beginning to the end of one's life, the scientific outlook of a person undergoes many changes. This is required for the growth and development of a human being. The distinction between man and animals is that man studies and thinks and through thinking, his perceptions evolve. This is the law of life. Hence, censuring people for changing their minds is inane and unreasonable. Whose intelligence ever remained on the same level as it was during one's youth? Only lunatics and retarded people could be so. Have the scientists who have made great discoveries in the social sciences, remained on their initial level of thought? Man studies every problem and arrives at new concepts and his knowledge develops. The most foolish people are those who think their own ideas constitute the pinnacle of human thought.</p>
<p>As to repentance, I came to Iran under the condition that no one demand repentance from me. I never repented publicly in any media. Those who accuse me of public repentance are liars and I should confess that truly, no one ever asked me to repent.</p>
<p>Equating development with repentance is in itself an indication of the lack of wisdom. In my life, and especially during my migration, I have learned many precious lessons that were not acquired cheaply. But these same experiences taught me not to keep my way of thinking on the same level as it was during my youth. It is surprising that while many of my writings contain many criticisms of Bolshevism and what I had predicted has been realized, still, you find people making such statements. Does this not indicate a lack of originality in their way of thinking and in the way their mind works?</p>
<p>I have been attacked from two sides, but I will bear these attacks for the sake of the integrity of Iran and for the sake of the existence and unity of my homeland. We die and what remains for our children and descendants is the homeland that both the old and the young should be proud of.</p>
<p>When I think about some of the false accusations, I cannot help from being reminded of what the famous Russian writer, Turgenyev, said: "One day a slick, old professional character told me while giving me advice that, 'Whenever you decide to hurt your enemy, accuse him of your own flaws and be ruthless in making such accusations. This is of dual importance. First, with this accusation, you pretend that you yourself are free of such flaws. Second, your accusations appear sincere and honest ... Here you can utilize the reproaches of your own conscience to your benefit. If you yourself are treacherous and devoid of conscience and honesty, accuse your enemy of treachery and dishonesty. If you are servile and subordinate, call your enemy an odious mercenary.'"</p>
<p>Would those who have characterized my book as arising from my feelings of spitefulness and enmity towards the people of Azarbaijan, characterize their own works as the result of their own enmity and personal vendetta against the non-Azeris who are wrongly called Persians? Are they not accusing others of having their own flaws?</p>
<p>I have written a book about Azarbaijan and others have also written articles about it. The right to judge these belongs to the community of (those who engage in) research and (those who follow) reason, not to fanatics and blind ignorants. The issue has been raised, and undoubtedly, it will be studied by researchers, then the facts will become clear. I did not write the book "Iran's Azarbaijan" in order to obtain a post. This favor I will leave to those who seek favors.</p>
<p>In the end I say: If returning to one's own homeland and working in a library as a researcher in the service of culture is the same thing as obtaining posts and affluence, this post and affluence I will gladly offer to Mr. Kianoory. In the 28 years following my return to my beloved homeland, I have only served in literary, cultural and research capacities and I am proud that the result of these efforts has been tens of books, authored and translated, as well as a role in putting together one of the most valuable encyclopedias of the Persian language. Now, we should see whether such services are valuable or whether the lies and the gibberish that some put together in order to sell the results of 50 years of treason, spying, betrayal of one's own country that make people hate everything associated with socialism, as service to their compatriots.</p>

<p>Hi - the article you deletetd is a very informing interview with an Iranian historian, the info being historically precise and very well documented. Rest assure that this article gives a very precise overview of the history of a critical period in that era. I repasted the relevant passages of the interview and left out the stuff you would call "persuasive work".</p>

<p>Actually, the region of Arran is Armenian. Historically speaking, all lands east of the Kura river are Armenian. This is evident not only by Armenian culture present here, and famous historians, but also numismatic evidence. Abbasid coinage bear the title Arminia Barda, inticating province of Arab Armenia, and mint of the city of Barda in the region of Arran, indicating this region was within Armenia, even in Arab times. Furthermore, there are coins struck here in the name of the Arab governor/emir of the province of Armenia. Finally the region of arran extended to the shores of Lake Sevan, within the borders of modern Armenia, making this a historic part of Armenia.</p>

Quite preposterous unbacked statement. Nevertheless, we are discussing it under History of Azerbaijan. <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdulnr_9dac.html" title="User:Abdulnr">Abdulnr</a> 01:01, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Can I have quotes of the paragraphs from the sources you are referring to? And also, how about using neutral sources? I mean A. Mousheghian, 'Monetary Circulation in Armenia' and R. Bedrosian, History of Armenia. You know, I have Azeri sources that say quite the opposite. And there’s absolutely no need to mention all the names that the cities were ever known by in the history.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Cf. from chronicle in Minorsky's book p. 17:</p>
<p><i>in 383 he {Fadl} took possesions of Barda'a and Baylaqan.</i></p>
<p>Minorsky himself under the connotations states from other contemporary sources p. 40:</p>
<p><i>"Patlun (Fadl)invited Gagik, son of Hamam lord of Tandzik, killed him and seized his dominions, and so becoming powerful, he ruled Khachen, Goroz and Sevordik."</i></p>
<p>He explains: These Hamam lords, appearently ruled in Alvank (i.e. Partav/ Bara'a).</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, the existance of the Armenian Kingdom of Gardman - Parisos in Arran , east of Lake Sevan supports this. Abbasid Region of Arran (At times part of Arminyya province) also included territories into the modern ROA: Cf.</p>

this is an ok map. Also,

<p>Likewise, at times, even Derbent was part of the Arminiyya province of the caliphate, but I am not claiming this city as Armenian. : ))) Only into Arran : )))</p>
<hr />
<p>as for Mousheghian, I simply cited him because he lists an abbasid coin minted in the province of Arminyya and city of Barda'a. It is simply a mint reading. Azerbaijani numismatist are respectable too. : )))</p>
<p>I can show a picture of this type of coin, but I am not sure you can read the arabic on the piece, can you?</p>
<hr />
<p>As for Bedrosian, I suppose you will dispute him, just as I may Azeri sources, but please do discuss them. I placed dispute tags on this topic before I added my info because I realize you might dispute them, but I am ok with all sides being heard in this issue.

<dd>Hi. Your source states: <i>These Hamam lords, appearently ruled in Alvank (i.e. Partav/ Bara'a).</i> Apparently does not mean definitely, right? It is supposition that they probably were ruling that area. If you want that included, it should be mentioned as one of the versions. Also the fact that a certain area was a part of Arabic province called Arminyya does not mean that that area had anything to do with Armenians. So I think for the moment I’ll remove most of your changes and leave only the reference that Arran was part of the Abbasid province called Arminyya. Any serious additions to the article must be based on a good citation from a reputable source, according to the rules of Wikipedia.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You seem quite eager to revert changes. Perhas you should be a little more patient and wait until I respond. I was paraphrazing from text. If you are going to be a sticler, here is EXACTLY what it says:</p>
<p><i>"Patlun (Fadl)invited Gagik, son of Hamam lord of Tandzik, killed him and seized his dominions, and so becoming powerful, he ruled Khachen, Goroz and Sevordik. KHachen, Goroz, and possibly Tandzik correspond in our source to Fadl's aquisitions(373/993) of the territories of Barda'a and Baylakan, between the rivers Kur and Araxes."</i> and here is his connotation:</p>
<p><i>I have not succeeded in identifying Gagik, son of Hamam, but this name occurs in the history of the princes of Alvank(i.e. Barda'a/Baylakan)</i></p>
<p><br />
Furthermore, we know of the existance of the kindom of Gardaman-Parisos, exactly north of Artsakh/Karabakh circa 1000. this was a non-Bagratuni Armenian kingdom that was devided between the Bagratuni's and Shaddadids. It was in Arran.</p>
<p><br />
And you said: <i>If you want that included, it should be mentioned as one of the versions. Also the fact that a certain area was a part of Arabic province called Arminyya does not mean that that area had anything to do with Armenians.</i></p>
<p>No, it does not, for that matter, that is why I mentioned derbent, and not to mention Tiflis was part of Arminyya as well. What I mean is the circuit of Arran incorporated part of modern teritories of Armenia. Should we go on to ancient Urartian and Artaxiad history?</p>
<p>Regards, (207.69.139.148 22:44, 12 March 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I don’t find this to be compelling. It is an assumption that this guy could be the one mentioned in the chronicles of Barda. To include something in the text you should come up with a better citation. And also, you keep adding the phrase “<i>and Mardigah and Eshekabad in general</i>”, this is nothing but a plain vandalism, you know perfectly well that no such city ever existed and that eshek means a donkey in Turkic languages. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 06:52, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Hi I do not want to get into a detailed description here, but your sources appar to contradict. Site on Arran does not refer to any of the facts you have outlined. 1. Agree with Grandmaster that arabic province Arminiyya does not indicate modern Armenia, it is very foolish to pre-suppose that. 2. It is true that during early -VII centuries, part of the region was under dominance of various armenian prinicpalities, (Sisakan, Sunik etc). I have my doubts about Barda and Beylagan.</p>
<p>You say:</p>
<p><i>Furthermore, we know of the existance of the kindom of Gardaman-Parisos, exactly north of Artsakh/Karabakh circa 1000. this was a non-Bagratuni Armenian kingdom that was devided between the Bagratuni's and Shaddadids. It was in Arran.</i></p>
<p>I am not aware of Hamam-Girdiman Armenian lords ruling over principality of Partav (Barda). Barda was an arabic city and centre of islamic Ar-ran, later to become the capital of Salarid state. So we need more organized sources here.</p>
<p>Proposal here is get leave disputed tag and discuss controversy.</p>
<p>Also what is the purpose of the article. History of Arran is described in the History of Azerbaijan section in much detail. This appears to me an article about toponym of Arran and evolution through time. I quite understand the political context, but we have to avoid it here.</p>
<p>3. Could you please list sources in order. They are scattered, and we all lost track of your citations</p>
<p>I have deleted what i think is irrelevant to the article. <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdulnr_9dac.html" title="User:Abdulnr">Abdulnr</a> 00:59, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did add pictures for sources.</p>
<p>I never said Gardaman Parisos ruled Barda or Partav, I said it was north of Karabakh, while Barda is east.</p>
<p>Thanks but I have to delete the picture saying 980-1240 Syunik, for the following reasons - as we have stated Barda was never a part of Armenian kingdom (orange color) especially post IX century - Right bank of Kura was ruled by Salarids, and Shaddadids as you know. No armenian state existed after Arab conquest/We need independent sources and not armenica.com, otherwise i can supply you with similar nonsense from our side.</p>
<p>As for the Gardaman (Qirdiman) in Azeri - i do not have an opinion at the moment. All "kingdoms" you indicated are no more than dependent principalities. <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdulnr_9dac.html" title="User:Abdulnr">Abdulnr</a> 13:18, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No armenian state existed after Arab conquest - Yes they did ... I think this map shows this ...</p>
<p>i do not have an opinion at the moment. All "kingdoms" you indicated are no more than dependent principalities. - Gardaman was not dependent on anyone, not Armenian BagrAtunis or moslem lords of the region, that is why their territories were destroyed and rulers slain. they were not assimilated.</p>
<p>For greater armenia it is to show this region was once part of the greater Armenia under artaxiads.</p>
<p>and srry, I reverted edit before reading here.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not clear who drawn those maps and where they were taken from. Could you please explain their source? And also, there are too many Armenian maps anyway, the history of the region continued well after 10th century, so some of the maps should be replaced anyway with the maps of the later period. We should have the maps shoving Arran as part of Caucasian Albania, Seljuk empire, Safavid empire, the period of independent khanates, etc. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 18:14, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

well, I think we can remove the syunik map and tigranes era map. I just wanted to show emphasis on these two issues, but I will accede to removal of those two maps. I am however, strong on keeping a map of Gardaman Parisos. Is that fine?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Well you do not need to prove anything here, we are all grown up. I have no idea on your Gardaman map, please provide sources behind the map. <a href="../../../a/b/d/User%7EAbdulnr_9dac.html" title="User:Abdulnr">Abdulnr</a> 21:29, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Point is taken on the neutrality. However, as I said Gardaman - Parisos, and its existance is discussed by Minorsky, it is not made up that Armenian lords ruled over this territory, until they were destroyed by Bagratids of Lori and Shaddadids of Janza. I posted Armenian map because I know of no other that shows the principality. If you can find a decent map, even if Azeri, showing this minor principality, I welcome to listen. But probably, Gardaman Parisos deserves a seperate page. If you give me some time, I will start a seperate topic for Gardaman - Parisos, so, you think this map should be deleted as well??? Maybe I should start a new topic on this, and just give a brief mention of htis kingdom in the Arran article?</p>

<dd>Just a Question. I do not know it exactly. But can be the Gardaman, Qirdiman be related to the town of gardabani in Southern Georgia. Both the name is close to to Gardaman and it is also located to the north of Qarabagh/ Artsakh. So I wonder if it is related to it. If yes the area is Georgian. Even the adjacent areas to it in nowadays republic of Azerbaijan, were Georgian once. the Georgian kingdom of Hereti was in this area. Also the town of Zegam, once a capital of Eastern Georgia was there, Although It is possible that Armenians and Caucasian Albanians lived in this area too. --Babakexorramdin 14:20, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Arran, a region of eastern Transcaucasia. It lay essentially within the great triangle of land, lowland in the east but rising to mountains in the west, formed by the junction of the Rivers Kur or Kura and Araxes or Aras. It was thus bounded on the north by Shervan; on the north west by Shakki and Kaxeti in eastern Georgia; on the south by Armenia and Azerbaijan province; and on the southeast by the Caspian coastal province of Muqan or Mugan. Arran's situation between these two great rivers explains the name Bayn al-nahrayn given to it by Islamic geographers</i>.</dd>

<dd>As you can see from the above, Arran is only one part of the Republic of Azerbaijan. In addition to Arran, Republic of Azerbaijan includes Shirvan, Mugan and Nakhichevan regions. So saying that Arran should be the real name of the republic of Azerbaijan shows ignorance of those “scholars” who say so. Why Arran and not Shirvan or Mugan? The information about the name of the republic of Azerbaijan has no relevance to this article, and your sources are nationalistic motivated and unreliable. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 19:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As you can see Grandmaster, Azerbaijan was never used to refer to any other region other than Iranian Azarbaijan! Also, it doesnt matter if today Arran cconstitutes some parts of the R. of Azerbaijan, what matters is the historical context of it, and Arran was alway the land north of Iranian Azarbaijan.

<dd>On top of all of that, Armenian, Parthian, Arabic, and Sassanian sources all mark the region north of Iranian Azarbaijan as being Arran. Grandmaster, I dont see how much further you want to go with this debate, but clearly it is evident that Azerbaijan was NEVER used in reference to Arran, and that the name change from Arran to Azerbaijan was politically motivated by Pan Turkists, and was protests BY BOTH RUSSIAN AND IRANIAN SCHOLARS OF THE TIME. This should clearly show that the region was never called Azerbaijan, but rather Arran.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 20:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You don’t understand. The name of Azerbaijan was used by some historical sources to the territories north of Araks, but in general it was used to refer to Iranian Azerbaijan. I don't dispute that. At the same time, Arran is only one part of the territory of current Republic of Azerbaijan. So you cannot say that Azerbaijan should be called Arran. Why Arran and not Shirvan, for instance? The information in the article is wrong, and your sources are dilettantes. Iranica and Bosworth are more trustworthy. So the name dispute by some Iranian authors should be dealt with in the article about the country, but not here. Claims that Azerbaijan should be called Arran or whatever else are clearly not serious. By the same token you can say that it should be called Shirvan or Mugan. But the fact is that it is called what it's called and it's not gonna change. So the claims by people like Farrokh or the other guy can be briefly mentioned in the article about the country, but there's no need to include them in every single article about Azerbaijan and its regions. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 20:57, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not proposing that Azerbaijan be changed to Arran now, where did you get that idea? I simply added information about how the Republic of Azerbaijan got its name. You are very paranoied it seems, dont worry, im not trying to change the name of Azerbaijna because as you said, it is what it is today. but my information on how the republic of azerbaijan got its name is correct and it will remain.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 21:12, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Iranian azerbaijan was never called arran, but the present day R. of Azerbaijan was called arran. do not confuse the two. and this information is relevant in every way shape and form. Please dont tell me you have an agenda, because if you dont, there is no reason why you should be rejecting this. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 21:56, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have already shown you that the present day Republic of Azerbaijan was not called Arran. Arran is only one part of it. If your concern is the accuracy of information, why you keep on including false information in this article? That is clearly against the rules, and I will have to draw the attention to your behavior. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 08:01, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The region was called Arran, however, just like you pointed out before, it was seperated into different little kingdoms. However, it was NEVER called azerbaijan, and its inhabitants were NEVER called azeri's. all of this started with the pan turk movement. whether you want to believe it or not, this is the truth, i dont know what they teach you in north azerbaijan, but this is it.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 15:37, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Did you read the article about Arran from Iranica? It clearly states the boundaries of Arran. I suggest you read it before arguing. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmaster_30ce.html" title="User:Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a> 05:21, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Either way, whether the region was called arran or something else (we can change it to what ever you think is right, provided you have the right sources), it was never called azerbaijan, so what do you want to call it then if not arran, which is the common term given to the region, regardless of its actual boundaries.<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 05:25, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
