<ul>
<li>Hi, I'm glad you joined Wikipedia, however I think you need to learn the basics of how to edit. I have been to a bunch of MLGs myself if you need help PM me on Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>First: Be sure you write from a Neutral Point of View (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>). Don't promote anything. You almost got the MLG article deleted. I had to fix everything.</p>
<p>Second: Be sure all your article are cited by multiple independent sources. (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Orge are all them are apart of Final Boss which is a notable team itself therefore they should just be included in the Final Boss article, but unlike Ben Jackson and Tsquared I am not sure the members of Final Boss have achieve anything notable enough to deem their own articles. I think they should be combined.</p>
<p>Third: How to cite sources, add</p>
<p>&lt;ref&gt;[www.whateverwebpage.com The name of the source is]&lt;/ref&gt; Then above the External links add ==References== &lt;references/&gt;</p>
<p>Fourth: Sign your posts by adding ~~~~ add the end of any post you make on a talk page (discussion page included).</p>
<p>Thats basically it!</p>
<p>On a side note: Please don't just removed categories from people. You can put people in more categories but dont just remove them. With that can you please add back [[Category:American electronic sports player]] to anyone you removed that from. Thanks. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 02:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>No problem!, one more thing you are going to need is adding photo licensing to all photos you upload otherwise <b>they will be deleted</b>. Assuming you work for MLG, and only if you work for them, you can added {{promophoto}} in the licensing section, then add the <b>source</b> of the license and add fair use rational (why this image is needed).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't ask them on the forum, im sure they will allow it. Who are you on MLG forums btw?</p>
<p>To get to the licensing section click on the image, then next to License click edit and added the tag. If there is no licensing section just click on edit at the top of the page and add:</p>
<p>==License== {{promophoto}} or what ever license applies. Here is a list of all possible tags, <a href="../../../i/c/t/WP%7EICT_6197.html" title="WP:ICT">WP:ICT</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yea don't forget to sign your posts by adding ~~~~ after you are done talking on a talk page. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 04:23, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please don't move other articles into that: Category:Electronic sports competitors.</p>
<p>Why did you even create this category? Not only is Category:American electronic sports players and Category:Electronic sports teams better because it has been around longer hence more people are aware of it, but also it is much more informative. It determines what country the player is from, and whether or not it is a team. Your category Electronic sports competitors is probably going to be deleted so please don't move anything else into, you would be hurting your cause.</p>
<p>Secondly, when creating an article don't use <b>Ben "Karma" Jackson</b> etc., you are suppose to just use his proper name. This is the precedence as far as I am concerned so don't change it back. Also I "moved" your article not just clear edited it and covered it up with a redirect. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 05:36, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not trying to PO people here, and this is a serious question from a non-sports person (the only sports I do are downhill skiing and figure skating (and a bit of college hockey years ago))... What criteria is being used for these people? My reading of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is along these lines...</p>
<p>From <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> Where do e-gamers fall into the standard categories? They are not:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Political figures</dd>
<dd>local political figures</dd>
<dd>entertainment or opinion makers</dd>
<dd>actors or TV Personalities</dd>
<dd>Published authors, editors and photographers</dd>
<dd>Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals</dd>
<dd>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events, such as by being assassinated</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can they be considered under the following:?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States.</dd>
</dl>
<p>They aren't sportspeople or athletes - but they may be <i>competitors</i>; is this the category where their notability is being justified? I didn't think that this was the intent of this category; I read this as those that are actually physically competing. If e-athletes are to be judged under this criteria, I would urge a notation being made as such to prevent further confusion on the issue.</p>
<p>As I couldn't put them in any of the above categories, I fell back to the basic:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field. - All of these criteria are in fact simply special cases of the general primary criterion of multiple non-trivial published works from independent sources. A person who is "part of the enduring historical record" will have been written about, in depth, independently in multiple history books on that field, by historians.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There may be articles written about these people, to whom I have no animosity, but can it be said that they are making a <i>widely recognized contribution that is part of the <b>enduring historical record</b> in their specific field</i>?</p>
<p>I do agree that several of the persons on the AFD list do have independent notability, and have noted so on their pages. However when looking at the field, I still say that these don't qualify as I don't see how they are part of the enduring historical record... (article - began playing):</p>

<p>Hi, you have done a lot of edits that are all tied to MLG-related articles. Edits are of course appreciated, but as a probable MLG employee, fan or affiliate please be cautious of producing advertisements, POV-articles and/or fancruft. Wikipedia is not the place for this. MLG comprises only a minor part of e-Sports world-wide, so putting a lot of emphasis on MLG in e-Sports articles is obviously the wrong way to go and will only result in repetitive deletion. Instead, please consider contributing to broader aspects of e-Sports. There are numerous teams and players listed on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_e-Sports_World_Champions_c248.html" title="2006 e-Sports World Champions">2006 e-Sports World Champions</a> that would require an article in order to present a balanced world view in the e-Sports category. Any help in creating and editing these is appreciated. Thanks -- <a href="../../../d/j/i/User%7EDjith_4679.html" title="User:Djith">DJiTH</a> 18:17, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article Community fellowship sda church has been speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This was done because the article seemed to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it did not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. If you can indicate why the subject is really notable, you are free to re-create the article, making sure to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">cite</a> any <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable sources</a>.</p>
<p>Please <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable</a>, and for specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">for biographies</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">for web sites</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">for bands</a>, or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">for companies</a>.
