<p>Bizarre over-emphasis on one religion corrected.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The opening sentence contains a strange error. Maybe it's merely semantics:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Arranged marriage is a form of marriage in which one or both the consorts are not sentimentally engaged with the respective spouse but consent to the union for other non spiritual reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In Unification Church, from 1960 to 2000 virtually all our marriages were, <b>for spiritual reasons,</b> arranged marriages. By "spiritual reasons" I mean a religious purpose.</p>
<p>Taking a literal reading of the article's opening sentence would seem to define the well-known mass marriages of the Unification Church as somehow as either (a) not being "arranged marriages" or (b) not having a "spiritual purpose".</p>
<p>I doubt if that was the writer's intent.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The language in the entire article generally needs help. Arranged marriages may have spiritual or religious underpinnings of some sort, and I don't see the two terms as being identical. My guess is that the author of the article simply used the wrong word. Perhaps as an alternative could be</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>An <b>arranged marriage</b> is a marriage where the marital partners are chosen by others based on considerations other than the pre-existing mutual attraction of the partners.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it was a wrong word, I would have expressed what Eclecticology correctly defines. On a perhaps too romantic point of view, marriage should be the union between two partners essentially based on a sentiment they reciprocally share. The word "spiritual", in my attempt of definition, should have therefore expressed some ideal evolutions of "attraction", like love or other sentimental reasons. But for a general definition of the topic, it is effectively more correct to limit on attraction, the reality being made of many other aspects than ideality.</dd>

It should be noted that arranged marriages are also still found in Japan, although much less common than in india. I cannot confirm the source, but I heared that in Japan, about 10 per cent of all weddings is arranged in some way. Aslo, it might be interesting to note the fact that even in the west, agencies that help people find a husband or wife are not uncommon. are these also arranged marriages?</p>
<p>You're missing a few sentences. Marriages can also be arranged between the two partners, by the two partners. So, in a way, all marriages are arranged. Please consider moving the article. 210.55.81.34 22:10, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

Actually I though "arranged marriage" actually means marriage arranged by people other then the two getting married. Maybe not.... --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrowiz_a6da.html" title="User:Macrowiz">Macrowiz</a> 03:43, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My mother told me about what "arranged marriages" were like in her culture when she was young. Usually the boy and girl were bethrothed to each other before they were even born, and the bride usually entered her future groom's home for the first time when she was no more than three years old. The boy and girl were raised together, usually by the boy's parents. The wedding ceremony itself usually took place whenever they were physically capable of fulfilling their roles. If either of them refused the marriage, they would be frowned upon, but not really disowned, and not punished.</p>
<p>So, as my conclusion, "arranged marriage" means a marriage that is planned out by close family members, usually when the future bride and groom are very young.<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilentWind_34dc.html" title="User:SilentWind">SilentWind</a> 20:44, 3 October 2006 (UTC)SilentWind</p>

<p>I think it needs to be explained that many people getting an arranged marriage DO NOT have a problem with it, and this is due to the nature of the culture itself. There are reasons for it, many of which I understand, but I still don't agree with the practice as a whole.

<dd>Other than just another opinion, what is your basis for believing this? It seems to me that your name and therefore your background has more to do with your impressions than anything else. If arranged marriages are truly a cancer then I think all of us would like to hear your thoughts on &gt;50% divorce rates that exist on the side of the debate you are coming from. I guess the saddest thing of all is that people like you hold these views but can offer no examples or if you can then you provide extraordinary cases to substantiate your claims. These outlandish examples exist on both sides so lets keep the article free of non-sense rhetoric. 24.7.141.159 09:36, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't speak for New Zealand, but in India things are changing pretty fast. Every Indian I know has the final decision on who they marry. They can enlist the help of their parents if they like to keep at least some feel of tradition. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrowiz_a6da.html" title="User:Macrowiz">Macrowiz</a> 03:43, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not with you. In my experience with arranged marriages (all my family and most of my friends have had arranged marriages), things have worked out quite well. Certainly by no means could one apply the adjective "cancerous" to it.</p>
<p>Not with you either. I respect the process as a long-standing tradition that allows the parents, who are more experienced, and not "in love," to have a more decisive input on their children's future. Plus, when you consider the crazy divorce statistics we have here in America, it seems like a refreshing alternative. (Also added sub-heading, this section definitely had nothing to do with love-shyness) --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 00:16, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with you Scott. This is infact 2006 now and it's still going on. People like to come up with the 'wonderful' 50% divorce ratio in the west. Let me tell you something. You should be proud you live in a part of the country that is willing to admit that marrages end. In India, divorce is considered a sin of the lowest possible kind. Have you heard of wife-beatings and abuse in the India? take a look at those stats sometime, it may open your eyes a bit.</p>

<p>In retrospect I do realise what I wrote sounds quite fanatical "let me tell you something"! I am indian. No, I don't represent all Indians, and I am not racist in anyway, shape or form. I am talking about a way of thinking, race doesnt even come into this argument. Do some research, find out more about this issue and think for yourself. Arranged marriage is a violation of democracy - the freedom to choose your spouse. I can't see any substantial arguments to the contrary so far, apart from "the ones i know of worked out well"</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reason why I got so pissed off at the defamatory tirade above was because I have seen way to many instances of topics like this used to justify hate crimes against Hindus in Europe. I mean, let's look at classical Jewish society (just as another example from a different culture). In ancient Israel, as well as in medeival Europe, arranged marriages were not uncommon among Jewish families. Even today, some Ashkenazy families arrange their marriages with Ashkenazy families (one of my professors, and Ashkenazi, just married another Ashkenazi on the wishes of his dying mother). Now granted, this was largely due to prejudice against Jews in old days and all that. But it did work out well. This has led to selective breeding over the couse of many millenia. That's worked out okay, right? The fact is, most of the really brainy types in the west tend to be Ashkenazy Jews (the greatest scientists, doctors, humanitarians, artists and philosophers in the west in the last 100 years or so have been Ashkenazim, you have to admire that). Look at this article for support</dd>
</dl>
<p>(<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/7/29/20293/9910" class="external free" title="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/7/29/20293/9910" rel="nofollow">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/7/29/20293/9910</a>). How can you deny us Hindus the right to plan our own gene pool in this manner? Don't we have a fundamental right to determine our genetic future, instead of it being dictated by this occidental bestiality called "love"? This fiction, invented by the French during the middle ages to justify having incestuous sex with their sisters? Please. Arranged marriages without consent are un-democratic, true. I am opposed to those. However, most arranged marriages in India today are done with the consent of both the bride and groom. It is an informed decision made by families where the bride and groom respect their heritage and the decision of their families and choose to follow them. It is understood, however, that the bride and groom have the last word in this issue. If either one does not like the match, then the marriage cannot be allowed. What you're talking about are "FORCED" marriages, which is an entirely different thing altogether, and is a serious felony in Indian law. People who equate arranged marriages (as an idea) with forced marriages are trying to pursue an agenda of libel and defamation of Indian society. That is typically the domain of white-trash rednecks who lot their jobs to outsourcing, and commie leftists with a racialist agenda against Hindus. Even the damn terrorists don't go this far! Forced marriages do happen, and it's regrettable when they do. There is a separate wikipedia article on that.

<dd>OK, great, whatever you say. I support arranged marriages, though obviously not forced marriages, but you really aren't helping the view by going off on little mini-rants in which you use blatent stereotypes. If you are angry about the stereotype from the imperialist era literature of Hindus as a bunch of "<a href="../../../s/a/t/Sati_%28practice%29.html" title="Sati (practice)">wifeburning</a> heathens" and do not wish to be viewed as such, then you should show the same courtesy in your reference to those of other nationalities. As is, you have called the French incestuous, Americans rednecks, (among other things) and claimed that the liberals hate Hindus. All this without anyone making a single comment about India anywhere in this page, except for one inhabitant of India who said that the people he knew all wed people of their own choosing. If you wish to keep acting this way, I suppose you have that right since this is the internet, but you are merely going to promote negative views of both arranged marriage and Indian people as a whole. That will be all.--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 07:14, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, why would one user's behavior promote negative views on "arranged marriages" or on Indian people as a whole? You seem to be opposed to generalizing, and I agree with you on that, so aren't you doing the same by saying that Subhash's views and attitude represents more than a billion people? Even the prime minister of India cannot adequately represent the whole country's views.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Where did I refer to ALL Americans as rednecks????? Only the inbred deep-south trailer-trash morons, and it's these people who typically troll the internet searching for ways to defame minorities. Also, if you read newspapers and WIKIPEDIA articles, you will know that the American Academia is predominantly Liberal, and has intensely anti-Hindu, as well as anti-semetic segments. Read the wikipedia articles on Wendy Doniger and Michael "Nazi" Witzel, if you don't believe me, or the virulently racist publications of Mearsheimer and Walt (<a href="http://www.adl.org/Israel/mearsheimer_walt.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.adl.org/Israel/mearsheimer_walt.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.adl.org/Israel/mearsheimer_walt.asp</a>). These people are intolerant of all cultures but their own warped reality, and will resort to any low-life tactic to defame all of us of the old world. This is a real problem, people, and you are not helping matters any in this talk page.--[User:Subhash bose]]

<dd>Nein. I was being defensively nationalist, as is my right. Racism is a western ideology. As for the large scale tirades on arranged marriages, they are entirely without merit and are touted by REAL racists who are frightful of the increasing successes of Indian Hindu minoroities in the west and are resorting to increasingly desperate tactics of ritual defamation. The fact is, any evidence that lends support to the "undemocratic" nature of arranged marriages is anecdotal at best, and usually traced to urban or rural legends. These racists are clouding the REAL problem of FORCED marriages as part of a sociopolitical agenda of hate. A properly and discerningly arranged marriage lasts a lifetime. The (western) alternative ie a "love marriage" is a pile of bunk. There is no scientific or anthropological evidence to support that an emotion like "romantic love" even exists. The very notion was invented in Medeival Europe. Ask any historical anthropologist worth his salt and (s)he'll tell you that the idea originated during feudal times. Don't get pissed because a brown "mud-blood" like me can refute the lies of "pure blooded white Aryans (so-called)" like our New-Zealander or whoever.--<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_Bose_5de5.html" title="User:Subhash Bose">User:Subhash Bose</a></dd>

<p>It is a great illusion to believe in this concept of "arranged marriage" and "forced marriage", as two separate concepts. The reality is that there is a definite grey area between the two. By growing up in a culture where pre marital relationships are frowned upon, the "choice" of having an arranged marriage is an illusion. It is simply a by-product of a culture imposing its thought pattern on a younger generation, and wiping out any interpersonal independence. I really can't take any of Subash's point seriously, since they sound quite fanatical...cue inteligent debate please!!!</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can say the exact same thing about "Western marriages", that they are the product of a culture imposing it's thought pattern on successive generations. Arranged marriages were quite common in the west (Royalty and Nobility in England, France, Holy Roman Empire etc., even common folk got married not because of any "love" but because there were practical and familial reasons to do so). I can't take any of your points seriously, since they are racialist and biased towards the "white miracle" myth. How's THAT for an intelligent debate, or does "intelligence" not apply to non-whites in your mind? --<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_Bose_5de5.html" title="User:Subhash Bose">User:Subhash Bose</a>

<dd>For an illustration of how arranged and forced marriage are different, consider the following situation: You wish to acquire a new car, but, because of your own inexperience with cars, and because you do not wish to be suckered into a bad deal due to a persuasive salesman or nonessential features of the car, you tell one of your friends who has a greater amount of experience with cars to find and recommend one for you, maybe even allowing him to purchase the car in your name. This would be the car equivalent of an arranged marriage, and offers the same advantages. Arranged marriage is a deputization of the marriage decision of your own will. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 19:29, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What about never being allowed to buy/drive a car as a young adult? surely this affects your decision. Besides, who is this friend with greater experience? Parents have only their own experiences - they haven't married and searched for spouses in their son/daughters generation before or have much experience with it. I agree forced marriage is an entity, but when you start to look at "coaxed" marriages, this fine dividing line dissapears.</p>

<dd>Actually I've read through the article a few times and it describes "the practice" quite well. Also, since this tends to be a cultural phenomenon, I doubt you'll find or even need a scientific study to substantiate any of the practices in here.

<dd>I've rarely ventured (and have never made edits) outside of English Wikipedia, so I know this area quite well. According to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html#Why_sources_should_be_cited" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources#Why sources should be cited</a>, even articles written from memory or your own knowledge you should be able to track down sources, meaning that since this is a wide-spread practice, there should be a lot written on it (and there is). Furthermore, statistics such as "some cite a divorce rate of only 1 in 25 (in arranged marriages) as opposed to 1 in 2 for the average "love marriage" in western culture" DO need a reference, because without it that's just a random number. If that statistic is true, back it up.</dd>
<dd>As far as neutrality is concerned, just gleaming several sites online points to a wide derision of the practice at least in the West: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A32226-2003Feb19&amp;notFound=true" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A32226-2003Feb19&amp;notFound=true" rel="nofollow">Marriage at First Sight (Washington Post)</a>, <a href="http://www.zackvision.com/weblog/2003/06/arranged-marriage.html" class="external text" title="http://www.zackvision.com/weblog/2003/06/arranged-marriage.html" rel="nofollow">Procrastination: Arranged Marrages (Blog)</a>, <a href="http://www.chowk.com/show_article.cgi?aid=00001446&amp;channel=gulberg" class="external text" title="http://www.chowk.com/show_article.cgi?aid=00001446&amp;channel=gulberg" rel="nofollow">The Sad Reality Of Arranged Marriages (Chowk.com)</a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1807885.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1807885.stm" rel="nofollow">Blunkett Defends Marriage Comments- this last one contains a few references to Western derision even if the article's not necessarily a critique of the practice</a>. Only the Post's article and (possibly) the Chowk.com article are authoritative, but the fact remains that this isn't something that's universally accepted, especially in the West, and this issue needs to be addressed. There's no reason to have a "Proponents' Views" section without an "Opponents' Views" section, as a "Proponents' Views" section indicates that there *are* opponents. In fact, just reading the articles (especially the Chowk article), a refutation of the divorce argument surfaces- that the reason why divorce rates are so low is because women in South Asian societies either do not enjoy those rights politically or are so discouraged from enjoying those rights culturally that they essentially don't have those rights. You may not agree, which is understandable, but since Wikipedia is supposed to entail *all* sides of an arguement- even if it's not something you agree with- criticism of the practice needs to be included. -<a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomeW_fba2.html" title="User:RomeW">RomeW</a> 21:55, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm a born/raised American with Indian acestory which doesn't give me any more authority than anyone else here but it does provide me with unique insight into both worlds. I don't think any cultural phenomenon can ever be honestly termed as "universally accepted." I agree that there should be a presentation of both views. However, that moves this article from just describing the practice to passing judgement on it. Maybe the "view" section should be renamed into just a "debate" or "western perspective" or whatever you deem appropriate. The link to Zack Ajmal's blog entry is great because he can provide the Pakistani/Muslim perspective on arranged marriage. As far as the sources, there is a *LOT* written on it and I agree with you. However, most of the best works on this are not in English but in Urdu, Arabic, Chinese, etc. Once I find more time, I'd like to work with you and possibly involve Zack Ajmal is trying to get as much information as we can into the article and then we can clean it up.

<p>I extended the definition to Muslims. Here (and especially among Muslims living in the UK &amp; USA) an arranged marriage usually means that husband and wife got to known during meetings initially arranged by their parents. These have the open intention of finding a spouse. If there is mutual attraction then there are further meetings in the presence of members of both family. These marriages only happen if there is considerable mutual attraction. <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajab_046f.html" title="User:Rajab">Rajab</a> 14:30, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've heard that in many cases where communities that encourage and/or require arranged marriages form immigrant communities in countries that don't culturally encourage it, what often happens is that a young man and a young woman from within the culture will meet and fall in love without their parents input, but then later tell their parents about it. The parents will then contact each other and go through the motions of making it look like an arranged marriage for the sake of tradition. This is different from the types of arragned marriage already described in the article because the parents don't have input in the initial choice of partner. It's not really arranged marriage, but I've heard that this happens a lot in cultures that prefer arranged marriages. Has anyone else heard of this? Should it go in the article?

<dd>Well I can't speak for all cultures where arranged marriages take place. I can speak for India, where what you described happens a lot. Indians have combined traditional values with modern democratic principles by reconciling with the fact that observance is more important than actual belief. Though you shouldn't talk about any of the "love" stuff. That's not very NPOV. What should be said that a couple interacts, they choose to get married, and have their parents discuss the details. Most arranged marriages are consentual like that. Perhaps this should go in the article, though some background info should be linked or something.[[[User:Subhash bose|Netaji]] 08:45, 31 May 2006 (UTC)]</dd>

<p>I find the definitions of "traditional arranged marriage", "modern arranged marriage" extremely non-NPOV. "Traditional"... in which culture or ethnic group? According to whom? "Modern"? There are A LOT of ethnic groups who sometimes practice at least one form of arranged marriages (sometimes jews and gypsies, arabs, persians, also some indigenous peoples like mixtecs come to my mind). I propose deleting this "traditional/modern/m. with courtship" non-sense and substitute it with a list of ethnic groups that practice it (at least partially) and how it is done in their culture. And yes, I've heard also that some people who've been engaged since childhood find it not that bad, and also claim that it's more succesful than marriage by love, but I feel the article needs more links to both disenting pages and blogs/homepages/articles by people who got into these marriages and found them OK.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see the definitions accurately convey the reality of arranged marriage: the different degrees vary greatly even within a culture. This is especially true for some eastern cultures that have been westernized. In dealing with westernization, different groups have gotten rid of arranged marriage to a different extent. It isn't an all-or-none thing, which is something people definately need to understand.--<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrowiz_a6da.html" title="User:Macrowiz">Macrowiz</a> 02:05, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It was having a strong POV, with illusory correlation. What does arranged marriage have to do with divorce rate is not established.

<p>The English language is seriously deficient in having only the one word in normal speech for two concepts. The definitions of arranged marriage at the beginning of the article go on and on about "children", and this sounds worrying to me. I am sure that in most cases it means progeny, ie sons and daughters, but it can also be read as minors, ie little kids. (Which, as we know, was historically, and may still be, the case in some places.) Can anyone think of an elegant way of rewording this?</p>
<p>BTW I came to this article from one on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_078f.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">George V of the United Kingdom</a>, where I changed a sentence that said that DESPITE his arranged marriage, he managed to be happy. I could have changed it to BECAUSE of this, but thought that would be just poking fun at people who have never really thought about the issue, so I rewrote the sentence as NPOV and added the link here. I suspect there are LOTS of other articles with this sort of casual thoughtlessness (not malice). Editors with more time than me may care to look for them and remove the POV re arranged marriages.

<p>What about the fact that in arranged marriages people have little time to know each other up front and they may have conflicting personalities. What about the fact that many people get deceived in arranged marriages where a significant shortcoming is hidden, such as the guy (or girl) is HIV Positive or has another health defect, or some things are hidden which are significant to some, such as that the person smokes. Even proponents of arranged marriage (such as myself) have to admit that there are shortcomings.</p>

<p>This article has several instances of gender bias. I am going to use the section on "International Marriage" to highlight a few:</p>
<p>"The parents of the man may be happier/feel secure knowing that their son is to marry a person of their own country and culture rather than one "corrupted" by Western influences" - It is incorrect to assume that it is always a man in the "wealthy" country who marries a woman from a "poorer" (I recommend using the word developing) country. There are several instances of the reverse happening. The sentence also implies that it is the woman who is more likely to get "corrupted" by Western influence.</p>
<p>"The parents of the girl hope that their daughter enjoys a higher standard of living" - I don't think this sentence deserves place under this section. It doesn't make a difference to the parent whether this is an "international" marriage or not - most parents want their children to enjoy a higher standard of living. Again, this sentence assumes that it is the woman who migrates.</p>
<p>"Limited choice — The man is constrained in not being able to choose a person of his liking outside his home country" - What about the choice of the woman? Isn't is constrained similarly?</p>
<p>The section consistently implies that only a man is capable of giving a woman a higher living standard and that it is always the woman who migrates. Also, if you're going to use the word "girl," might as well use the word "boy" and not man. Otherwise, please replace "girl" with woman. Titania 06 03:01, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
