<p>"their" vs. "his or her" has nothing to do with political correctness. It's the way the language is moving, at least in parts of the US. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<p>That was a speculation as to why it hapened. Regardless, it can cause confusion on occasion - and here, where it's rather important to distinguish between individuals and collectivities, it makes a large difference. It would be all too easy to read "they" as referring to the collectivity. (I came across this important distinction in game theoretic stuff like the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tragedy_of_the_Commons_f7dc.html" title="Tragedy of the Commons">Tragedy of the Commons</a>, where it actually drives what is going on.)) I think I missed some of the ambiguous usages, so I'll go back and tidy up further. PML.</p>
<hr />
<p>Where there are only two choices, Arrow's theorem doesn't appear to hold. You can simply apply <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_past_the_post.html" title="First past the post">first past the post</a>, which meets all the criteria mentioned when there are only two choices (meet universality by letting the first voter decide where there is a tie). Do we need to change "among several different options" to "among at least three options"? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></p>

<p>Ahh, missed that bit, thanks. But "and the society has at least 2 members" - huh? If the society has only one member, Arrow's theorem holds by non-dictatorship and citizen sovereignty alone, surely? <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 19:42 2 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right that the theorem is true without the at-least-2-members restriction. (But you do need monotonicity to prove this.) The no-dictatorship property can hardly be considered "desirable" in the 1-member case, though, which is probably why the restriction to two or more members was included. You can remove it if you think it's confusing. --<a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZundark_7566.html" title="User:Zundark">Zundark</a> 21:18 2 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Politicians-and-Polytopes The pseudo-theorem is not there if it can't be translated into statements of quantifier logic over inequalities. The weights of the votes are unconstrained. The voting power of an individual may be much greater than the voting power of the surrounding society. It seems almost that the IIA above 'deletes' candidates and/or papers since saying "subset of options", and the word "compatible" might mean that the same winners result. Arrow is completely in error to say that that is desirable. A fairer far superior axiom than Arrow's dumb and useless 1951 IIA check for no/little change, is a rule that prohibits all checking of changes of the win-lose state of all candidates not named on the ballot papers involved in the change. In the IIA above, if there are delicate back scratching coalitions, and a single individual holding over 95% of the voting power was removed, then that IIA is clearly a rule that no one actually wants. The rule named "non-dictatorship" looks like it is supposed to stop individuals from being too powerful and it is so lacking in a good definition that no one would believe that the non-dictatorship rule was actually able to keep the power of a single individual small enough. The "95%" could be replaced with a sequence of percentages that get smaller and smaller. We start with a certainty that IIA is undesirable since any removing of a super-powerful voter can change the victories of all the other winning candidates. At some point, while the percentage is dropping, the non-dictatorship rules changes from saying something to saying nothing. A conclusion is that the pseudo-theorem is very unimportant since it is finding incompatibilities between statements, some of which we definitely want to reject. The non-dictatorship rule is totally inconsistent with the aim of proportionality which says things like "1+1+1+1 &gt; 1".</p>

<p>I was sure you were nearby Rob since one of those seemingly corrupt decisions to delete far superior definition of monotonicity had been made. I wrote to debian-vote in the 1st third of the year. You said I was at your mailing list. Like everyone else I was being lied at you never hawving a word privately except to defend unlimited lying in preferential voting to the extent possible of a man who never actually appears to ever read received e-mail.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Should something be added about the theorem's applicability to elections?</p>
<p>Strictly, the theorem says you can't always find a "preference order among several different options" given certain criteria. But this isn't the problem that an election poses. In an election the aim is to select one candidate out of a set of candidates, rather than rank the candidates in a preference order.</p>
<dl>
<dd>How about a real answer? An election could instead of asking for only your top choice could instead ask for your whole preference. It could then use this to try and come up with a social preference, which it would take the most perfered (the first place candidate) and elect them. That's how it could apply.</dd>
</dl>
<p>---</p>
<p>"This statement is stronger, because assuming both monotonicity and independence of irrelevant alternatives implies Pareto efficiency."</p>
<p>I found this confusing. Does this refer to the theory as a whole with that replacement criterion or ...? Where does "assuming" come into play?</p>
<p>I agree. It sounds to me that this adjustment is implied by the other criteria already. --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarlord_0508.html" title="User:Starlord">Starlord</a> 4:37, 29 April 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>After seeing people misuse Arrow's theorem, would anyone have a good way of wording the limitations of Arrow's theorem? Some misuses use arrow to say all voting schemes are equal or there is always a dictator. These are simply false, the first is obvious because there are voting schemes that use more of the information in a preference than others. The second is because of the way the proofs are carried out. All the proofs <b>construct</b> a set of individual votes that have a dictator. In quantifiers: for all social preference functions there exists a set of individual votes where there exists a dictator. A simpler way of getting at this is that in Condorcet voting the Smith set is the criteria for a dictator to exist: only when the Smith set contains more than one candidate must a dictator exist (which is where the different versions of Condorcet diverge).</p>

<p>I clarified the condition of "universal domain" to say that no randomness is allowed in the result. You could say, I suppose, that the wording of all the conditions assumes that the result is deterministic, but I think it needs to be specified. Otherwise, there is a method that meets all of the conditions. Call it "Randomly-completed Condorcet" or "Smith//Random":</p>
<p>Choose a voter at random, before the vote, and don't disclose who this voter is. Then hold the vote. Elect the Condorcet winner if there is one; otherwise, find the Smith Set, and ask the random voter to choose one member of the Smith Set as the winner.</p>
<p>It's not dictatorial, even when it's up to this random voter, because everyone's votes are taken into consideration to determine who is in the Smith Set.</p>

<p>First this seems to say that if there is a set of preference oderings which conflict with the irrelevant alternatives requirement then they should not be treated as irrelevant - that seems like cheating. Second, Condorcet methods are designed to choose a single winner, not a societal preference order; generalising the method to the whole order means changing the definition of a Smith set and other elements.

<p>It was probably justified to remove the remark about range voting. Indeed, range voting does not satisfy the criteria; the one it misses is universality, which is not one of the "big three" conditions people usually quote. But the reason it fails universality is pretty well hidden, based on the definitions given. Range voting is a cardinal ranking system, so that the voter specifies <i>more</i> than the preference order, and this fails universality because the same preference order does not always give the same result.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure how to clarify this in the article. A sentence or two could be added saying that Arrow's theorem only applies to voting methods based on preference order. But then a plausible response by the reader would be "oh, okay, let's just stick with plurality then". Arrow's theorem hits plurality as well, as long as you assume that each voter has a preference order that plurality is not letting them express. Which, I suppose, has some philosophical implications to it. So this is difficult to clarify. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 22:50, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Range voting doesn't violate universality, because universality doesn't apply. Universality (as it is defined here) only applies to ordinal rankings. In fact, it's precisely <i>because</i> universality is discarding the cardinal rankings information that range voting appears to violate universality in the first place, so the restriction to ordinal rankings is clearly relevant. --<a href="../../../w/c/l/User%7EWclark_3ce6.html" title="User:Wclark">Wclark</a> 20:33, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anon added the opinion that Arrow's theorem is "flawed" to the page, couched in weasel words ("criticized by many voting theorists" to mean "I don't like it").</p>
<p>This is an opinion that I have encountered before. It does not belong in Wikipedia, because not only is it expressing a point of view that favors certain voting methods over others, the statement is not even about Arrow's theorem.</p>
<p>Arrow's theorem is a <i>theorem</i>, a mathematical statement that has been proven. Since the proof has undergone peer review, it is almost certainly not a flawed proof. So the <i>theorem</i>, which states that no voting method satisfies a certain five or so criteria, is not flawed.</p>
<p>There is a certain popular, non-mathematical rephrasing of Arrow's theorem, which you will not find on Wikipedia: <i>"Every voting method is flawed."</i> This is what the anon was attacking, apparently, but it is not the subject of this article.</p>

<dd>I'm the anon, sorry for the lack of account. My objection is that Arrow's theorem is routinely used to justify the thought that it is "impossible to design a set of rules for social decision making that would obey every ‘reasonable’ criterion required by society." (which is in the article). Elsewhere, you said that this could be minorly edited to "seemingly reasonable", but this isn't sufficient. All Arrow's theorem does is arbitrarily take a set of criteria and demonstrate it is impossible to meet all those criteria at once. It does not prove that each of those criteria are required for a reasonable voting system, however. Isn't a discussion of the flawed usage of a theorem fair game for a page on the theorem? (It's true that I personally favor Condorcet methods but I'm not being a zealot about it or anything.) I don't think anyone contests that Arrow proves the set of criteria are contradictory, but contesting its "conclusion" that it is impossible to design a voting system that obeys societal requirements is fair game for this page. Perhaps it could be added instead to a section that discusses how the theorem is used?</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is reasonable. There could be a section for "Interpretations of Arrow's theorem" pointing out that these interpretations are not mathematically rigorous, with criticisms of them. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 04:03, May 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

For example, one could : (1) add one or two sentences from section "Interpretations ..." in the opening paragraph, (2) make the section "statement of the theorem" shorter and less formal (there is a formal section later anyway), illustrating the requirements by real-life example like "<i>favorite of most people</i> does not satisfy monotonicity". In general, an article for the general educated public does not need that much mathematical language. <a href="../../../p/h/s/User%7EPhS_8126.html" title="User:PhS">PhS</a> 10:48, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Does not "favorite of most people" satisify monotonicity? How it can hurt a candidate if you rank her higher? I would think that it is IIA that is not satisfied. If a new candidate conmes along that I rank first and everybody else last this may cause old winner to lose since he might have needed my vote. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.235.35.193 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.235.35.193_5f62.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.235.35.193">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>Could someone clarify what non-dictatorship is?</p>
<p>If it just means that no voter's preference order cannot equal the social choice function's order, then I don't see why this would make things "unfair." -<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrick_595e.html" title="User:Grick">Grick</a>(<a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGrick_ad14.html" title="User talk:Grick"><sup>talk to me!</sup></a>) 02:09, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed, that would be fairly silly. Non-dictatorship can be expressed like this, I believe: a group of all but one voter should always have a way to change the result away from that voter's preference. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer">RSpeer</a> 04:38, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. That's right. But just to be formal: the voting system is a <b>dictatorship by individual n</b> if for every pair <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, society strictly prefers <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> whenever <i>n</i> strictly prefers <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>. Perhaps the article could be improved if the Theorem is rewritten in mathematical form (along with an intuitive explanation about what every criteria means, of course). Or better(?): two sections, one is math, the other is natural language. <a href="../../../s/d/a/User%7ESdalva_070b.html" title="User:Sdalva">Sdalva</a> 20:42, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd put it like this: there is no individual whose choice will <i>always</i> (we might almost say, <i>by definition</i>) be the same as the group's choice. This does not mean that the group won't occasionally produce a result which one or more individuals also chose, but simply that the group's "lining-up" with those individuals is an accident of everyone's choices rather than a decision that the system will follow, say, Joe Bloggs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Does this mean that the mathematical definition of non-dictatorship is missing something? When I read it first time, I thought it might be saying what <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGrick_595e.html" title="User:Grick">Grick</a> evidently thought it was, but on reflection, I concluded it was missing a clause to the effect that there is no <i>i</i> <i>etc.</i> *for all possible <span class="texhtml"><i>R</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span>*.

<dd>That's a strange question. Dictatorships are always Pareto efficient (if everyone agrees, then so does the dictator), independant of irrelevant alternatives (because only the top of the dictator's list matters), "citizen sovereign" (everyone can win, all it takes is for the dictator to top-rank them). Dictatrorships are also monotonic, if your version requires that. <a href="../../../c/r/g/User%7ECRGreathouse_d93e.html" title="User:CRGreathouse">CRGreathouse</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/g/User_talk%7ECRGreathouse_a2c7.html" title="User talk:CRGreathouse">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CRGreathouse_ecde.html" title="Special:Contributions/CRGreathouse">c</a>)</small> 22:24, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You misunderstand. A dictatorship is a <i>voting system</i>. Given your three individuals and your three choices, there are 3!<sup>3</sup> (216) possible ways for the individuals to rank the choices. A <i>voting system</i>, then, is a function that maps from each of these possibilities to a unique social preference order; there are 6<sup>216</sup> (2.8 trillion) possible voting systems. A <i>dictatorship</i> is a voting system wherein there exists some individual (1, 2, or 3) such that the social preference order is always equal to that individual's ranking of the choices. (There are three possible dictatorships.) So in your example, you've ruled out all but 6<sup>215</sup> (470 billion) of the possible voting systems, but you've still not given us <i>nearly</i> enough information to know whether the voting system is a dictatorship.

<dd>That article indicates only that there is debate about whether independence of irrelevant alternatives should be considered a criterion for fairness. This has no bearing on whether it can be satisfied at the same time as other criteria. People who believe that independence of irrelevant alternatives is not necessar for fairness do not believe that Arrow's theorem is false, just that it is not fatal to fairness. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 12:02, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not proved. I have a contradiction in hand if the special constraint is used that each voter has a complete, ordered preference for each possible choice (no ties allowed!). If any choice is irrelevant, it can be dropped from the list. In many of the nasty cases there is no obvious winner, but there is always an obvoius looser. That looser can be found by SUM(position on list for each individual, where 1 is best). The loser is irrelevant to the eventual winner. Recurse until one choice is left. -- (unsigned)</p>

I thought of adding an entry about it myself, soon. Sen proved that Pareto is incompatible with any ideological restriction of the range of the social choice rule. You can't just impose some rule on the way preferences are aggregated, and then expect people to be happy with it whatever their preferences are. He gave a nice example: Suppose individual liberty, which means that at least two people are allowed to veto some results. You want to read a bad book. I don't want you to read it, I would rather read it myself (and suffer). You would really enjoy seeing me suffer from reading it. If we're both given the right to prevent interference with our private affairs, then it will be impossible to force that I read the book and suffer. We would get the "rational" result that you read the book, though both of us would rather I suffer from reading it. The problem isn't with liberalism. Liberalism is exactly intended on preventing things like that from happening: a liberal would be against killing a person even if that person is suicidal and everybody else hates him. It's an incompatibility that you have to deal with, like with Arrow's theorem. You can't expect Pareto efficiency (the way it is defined above) to yield "reasonable" results without limiting the domain of your function to "reasonable" preference profiles. <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMousomer_c113.html" title="User:Mousomer">mousomer</a> 19:16, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Starlord already remarked above that the sentence "This statement is stronger, because assuming both monotonicity and independence of irrelevant alternatives implies Pareto efficiency" was confusing. It was also wrong, since this is true only assuming non-imposition. Any constant social welfare function (i.e. one that is independent of the individual preferences) is monotonic and independent of irrelevant alternatives, but neither non-imposing nor Pareto-efficient.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I find the statement confusing. It first speaks of replacing non-imposition and monotonicity with Pareto-effeciency. Then it claims that the second version of the theorem is weaker since Pareto and non-imposition togther does not imply monotonicity. This is confusing since according to what came before we have dropped the assumption of non-impostition and it does is irrelevent what it implies. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.235.35.193 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.235.35.193_5f62.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.235.35.193">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>That monotonicity, independence of irrelevant alternatives and non-imposition together imply Pareto efficiency can be seen as follows: Assume a social welfare function is monotonic, independent of irrelevant alternatives and non-imposing, but not Pareto-efficient. Then there is a preference profile in which alternative <b>a</b> is preferred to alternative <b>b</b> by all individuals but not socially. Due to monotonicity, swapping <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> in any subset of the individual preferences cannot cause <b>a</b> to be socially preferred to <b>b</b>, and due to independence of alternatives, moving <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> without swapping them cannot do this, either. Thus, no matter how we move <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> around, <b>a</b> will never be socially preferred to <b>b</b>, contradicting non-imposition. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJoriki_8fdd.html" title="User:Joriki">Joriki</a> 14:43, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"May (1952) provided the first axiomatic characterization of majority rule as a social welfare function. May’s characterization is based on Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, Neutrality, Anonymity, and a strong positive responsiveness axiom. Maskin (1995) substituted the Pareto criterion for the last of these. He proved that any social welfare function satisfying the four axioms will fail to be transitive-valued at any individual preference profile at which majority rule violates transitivity, and, unless it is majority rule itself, will fail to be transitive-valued at some individual preference profile at which majority rule is transitive-valued. This was also established by Campbell and Kelly (2000) with a less demanding set of axioms."</dd>

<li>I agree that that statement is nonsense, so I removed it. Your additional section was written as an opinion, however, and I reverted it. The widely-held criticisms of Arrow's theorem already appear under "Interpretations of the theorem". It's better Wikipedia style to ensure that the whole article is neutral - separate "advocacy" and "criticisms" sections are a last resort for particularly contentious topics. <a href="../../../r/s/p/User%7ERspeer_418c.html" title="User:Rspeer"><b><span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span></b></a> / <a href="../../../r/s/p/User_talk%7ERspeer_a656.html" title="User talk:Rspeer"><span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ</span></a> 03:38, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, the text that I entered is not an <i>opinion</i> but a reasoned statement. It is not an <i>interpretation</i> but a reasoned statement. It may be that you are right that there should not be a separate criticism section, but, given the first part of the article, this reasoned statement can be put here. My suggestion is that more people think through what the article would look like but including the reasoned statement in the main body of the article. It is useful to have the text available in the article before the whole is re-editted, to prevent innocent readers to get a wrong impression. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColignatus_9a9a.html" title="User:Colignatus">Colignatus</a> 22:32, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I noticed that Rob now added a notification on original research or verification. This is better than simply removing the text, but there remains a confusion. You all must distinguish me (1) as a scientist who for you is a third party and who provides sources, e.g. see me as the writer of VTFD in 2001, (b) as a scientist who helps you, just now, to get this article straight. You should note that the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a> condition concerns <b>facts</b> that need be checked by various sources. But the text that I provided (in the disputed criticism section) contains a <b>reasoned argument</b> that you can check by the logical faculties of your minds. Thus the condition does not apply in that sense. Also the reference to original research doesn't apply, since I didn't enter original research. The research originated in 1990 and was published in 2001. The only thing I do now is correct the misleading element in the article, and provide the reader (and you as editors) with a condensed reasoned statement, that you again can check by using the logical faculties of your minds. Also, the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">verifiability</a> page mentions that the sources should be reliable. Well, again this is a non-issue for this paragraph. For, the point is that a reasoned argument is provided, so that it doesn't matter where it is from, and you have to use the faculties of your minds. If the washing lady says 1+1=2 then this has the same value as when the bishop says so, even when the bishop doesn't know what he talks about. Which is exactly why I added the suggestion, above, that when the reasoned argument is understood, the criticism might perhaps best be included in the main text, revising the main article. I didn't do that myself, since all of you would be completely shocked, not having digested that reasoned statement. Some other comments: PM 1: I doubt whether you will find many other sources on criticism other then I already included in the list of literature in the links that I provided. If someone feels like unpacking those links and transferring those references into the main body, feel free to do so. PM 2: Now that Rob has eliminated that one sentence, that he agreed was nonsense, perhaps the header Criticism is too strong, and it may be perhaps Evaluation or something like that. PM 3: If the consensus is that this group of editors cannot take responsibility for using their logical faculties of minds on the reasoned argument, then you may also attribute it to me, see <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Colignatus" class="external text" title="http://www.wikinfo.org/wiki.php?title=Colignatus" rel="nofollow">Colignatus at wikinfo</a>, and perhaps research a bit how reliable I am. Simply a Google scolar is not enough, though. PM 4: If all this fails, I would like a comment from someone who follows the logic of the reasoned argument and have suggestions how it can remain available for readers, then in another format or place. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColignatus_9a9a.html" title="User:Colignatus">Colignatus</a> 20:22, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Colignatus, did you bother to read the rest of the article? If I understand you correctly, you claim that the "paradox" is just demonstrating the incompatibility of Arrow's criteria. This claim is not new, and is explicit in the text we wrote. Is it not explicit enough? Look at:
<ul>
<li>"So, what Arrow's theorem really shows is that voting is a non-trivial game, and that game theory should be used to predict the outcome of most voting mechanisms.

<p>Am I right in that there is a slight error in one of the formulae? The one that says that no individual voter's preference should always prevail. The formula begins: (I don't write latex) there exists no i belonging to N such that...</p>
<p>Should it not rather be: there exists no i belonging to [1,N] such that... since N is a number?</p>
<p>Is this just informal notation or have I misunderstood? But it seems like an error to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The theorem works for any set of voters - be it infinite or finite (as long as there are at least 2 of them). So, when N is a 'set of voters' - rather than a number, we need that no voter 'in' N will be a dictator. <a href="../../../m/o/u/User%7EMousomer_c113.html" title="User:Mousomer">mousomer</a> 08:02, 9 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think there's actually an inconsistency in the article with respect to this. Some parts work with N a natural number or a set, e.g. <span class="texhtml">L(A)<sup><i>N</i></sup></span>. But some work only with N a natural number, e.g. "The <i>n-tuple</i> <span class="texhtml">(<i>R</i><sub>1</sub>,...<i>R</i><sub><i>N</i></sub>)</span>" (which should actually say "N-tuple"). That's why at some point I changed "N a set of voters" into "N a number of voters". But the part that 65.94.43.126 objected to only works for N a set. Even if we consider a natural number to be equivalent to a set, this abstraction would be unnecessary unless we also wanted N to stand for other, possibly infinite sets, and then the tuple notation wouldn't make any sense. So I agree that something needs to be changed. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJoriki_8fdd.html" title="User:Joriki">Joriki</a> 21:00, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would love more detail but I understand that it is hard work and others might think it would become to long. It think the most important result you mention is the one about single-winner function (social-choice functions). This is the most commonly encounterd situation in real life and it is good to point out that there is a version of Arrows theorem for that situation as well.

<p>This paragraph doesn't seem sensible. Gibbard-Satterthwaite + Duggan-Schwartz shows that of universal ordinal systems, only dictatorships are non-manipulatable. Universal ordinal systems that are non-manipulatable thus all have IIA, but only trivially (because they're all the same system, a dictatorship).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Relaxing the IIA criterion, though popular, has a distinct disadvantage: it can result in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_voting.html" title="Strategic voting">strategic voting</a>, making the voting mechanism 'manipulable'. That is, any voting mechanism which is not IIA can yield a setup where some of the voters get a better result by mis-reporting their preferences (e.g. I prefer <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, but I claim I prefer <i>b</i> to <i>c</i> to <i>a</i>). Clearly, any non-monotonic social welfare function is manipulable as well. If one uses a manipulable voting scheme in real life, one should expect some "dishonest" voting. What this means is that the real-life implementation of most voting mechanisms results in a complicated game of skill. The <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibbard-Satterthwaite_theorem_385a.html" title="Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem">Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</a>, an attempt at weakening the conditions of Arrow's paradox, replaces the IIA criterion with a criterion of non-manipulability, only to reveal the same impossibility.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've removed this for two reasons. First, it seems clearly untrue or trivial as discussed above. Second, were it nontrivial and true (or at least widely believed) it would belong in the IIA article (or perhaps strategic nomination etc.). <a href="../../../c/r/g/User%7ECRGreathouse_d93e.html" title="User:CRGreathouse">CRGreathouse</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/g/User_talk%7ECRGreathouse_a2c7.html" title="User talk:CRGreathouse">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CRGreathouse_ecde.html" title="Special:Contributions/CRGreathouse">c</a>)</small> 00:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. I consider myself a pretty bright guy and I am sure that I could understand this if I took the time to study it but it would be nice to have a simplified abstract of the problem in the intro.

<dd>You write: <i>Agree, if you add "or non-deterministic or with restricted domain"</i>. Actually, the only nondeterministic and non-imposed method that is not manipulatable is a random weighted dictatorship (Pattanaik and Peleg 1986). Murakami (1961) shows that a version of Arrow's theorem holds under domain restrictions (using monotonicity and weaker dictators).</dd>
<dd>I still don't agree that there's a strong connection between IIA and manipulability, given these strong impossibility results. Further, if a connection could be shown and sourced properly, it would belong in the IIA article (or possibly in the G-S article), not here.</dd>

<dd>For simplicity let us assume that only the winner does matter. Let consider a voter with such preferences: A &gt; B &gt; C (A is preffered candidate for this voter). A situation may arise when their sincere voting will result in victory of B, but misrepresenting his preferences as A &gt; C &gt; B will result in victory of A. (For example see <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tactical_voting.html#Types_of_tactical_voting" title="Tactical voting">push-over</a>). IIA obviously forbids such situations (alternatives A and B have the same order in these two preference profiles).</dd>

<dd>K.J. Arrow proved that an social welfare function must be dictatorial if it satisfies the Pareto criterion and IIA condition. We show that there is very little to be gained by relaxing the Pareto-efficency criterion: every social welfare function satisfying IIA either gives some individual too much dictatorial power or else there are to many pairs of alternatives that are socially ranked without consulting anyone's preferences.</dd>

<p>(Resetting indentation) In response to #1: If you're saying that IIA prevents some forms of manipulability, state those and give a reference. That would actually be useful. For #2, do I read you right in that you're supporting IIA because dictatorial and fixed functions are non-manipulatable? In that case we should probably skip the confusing IIA and state that dictatorial and fixed functions aren't manipulatable. For #3, I don't see any reason to restore the paragraph: this is the wrong place, and the wording does not display <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. As for the references, feel free to add whatever you see fit to add. <a href="../../../c/r/g/User%7ECRGreathouse_d93e.html" title="User:CRGreathouse">CRGreathouse</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/g/User_talk%7ECRGreathouse_a2c7.html" title="User talk:CRGreathouse">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CRGreathouse_ecde.html" title="Special:Contributions/CRGreathouse">c</a>)</small> 23:56, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>#1. Well, I'll think how to reword.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>#2. No. 1) I do not "support IIA". I think that we should clarify why such not very evident condition may be desirable. (Se above: 5 March). 2) "Dictatorial and fixed" does not belong to the conditions of Arrow's theorem, but IIA does belong. So we should speak about IIA.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>#3. I do non see POV. I have seen no reference really denying connection between IIA and manipulability. You have mentioned: <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0012-9682(199311)61:6%3C1355:TO1-TT%3E2.0.CO;2-0" class="external text" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0012-9682(199311)61:6%3C1355:TO1-TT%3E2.0.CO;2-0" rel="nofollow">Campbell and Kelly 1993</a>, <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0012-9682(198607)54%3A4%3C909%3ADOPUSS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-G" class="external text" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0012-9682(198607)54%3A4%3C909%3ADOPUSS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-G" rel="nofollow">Pattanaik and Peleg 1986</a>, <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0012-9682(196104)29:2%3C244:ANOTGP%3E2.0.CO;2-5" class="external text" title="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0012-9682(196104)29:2%3C244:ANOTGP%3E2.0.CO;2-5" rel="nofollow">Murakami (1961)</a>. But as I see none is about manipulability. (And the first really in some degree indirectly supports my point of view, see above). As for <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibbard-Satterthwaite_theorem_385a.html" title="Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem">Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</a>. 1) See above: 5 March. 2) G-S postulates non-imposition. But IIA decreases manipulability even without non-imposition (see my previous message).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But I'll think how to reword for make the statement more clear. Thank for help.</dd>
