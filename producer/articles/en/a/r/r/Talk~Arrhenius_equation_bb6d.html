<p>The universal gas constant R has indeed the same units as the Boltzmann's constant (normally also written as "k", not to confuse with the "k" in Arrhenius equation!).</p>
<p>Let me explain:</p>
<p>[R] = E K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup><br />
[k] = E K<sup>-1</sup></p>
<p>and the potential confusion comes from the facty that a mol is indeed dimensionless (it is as if you say "a dozen", though a "mol" is much bigger (Avogadro's number)). So, RT has also dimensions of energy, and E/RT is indeed dimensionless as expected. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordi_Burguet_Castell_5ff0.html" title="User:Jordi Burguet Castell">jbc</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh yes, that's right. But I guess the energy in the exponential would have to be per unit mole as well, as opposed to the energy of all molecules. Isn't that right? But is mol really dimensionless? I think I disagree about that part. If you have a molar mass, like 20 grams/mole. Actually scratch that, you are right it is "dimensionless", but not "unitless". And I think RT has dimensions of energy/mole, not energy as you say. Maybe we are saying the same thing though, I see what you mean. <a href="../../../d/g/r/User%7EDgrant_02cc.html" title="User:Dgrant">dave</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, we can't have energy per unit mole on top, it's just the activation energy... But I still think there should be <span class="texhtml"><i>n</i></span> multiplied by R. Actually, I think the best form of the equation is exp(E/kT), then it is more general, and not specific only to chemistry where they deal with moles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are talking about different things in your comments. One thing is which is Arrhenius equation (as Arrhenius wrote it and it is used today), and another is whether it is right or not. For the first one, Arrhenius equation is <b>without</b> that <span class="texhtml"><i>n</i></span>, as you can see in <a href="http://www.shodor.org/unchem/advanced/kin/arrhenius.html" class="external free" title="http://www.shodor.org/unchem/advanced/kin/arrhenius.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shodor.org/unchem/advanced/kin/arrhenius.html</a> or any chemistry book you like. As for the second, I haven't worked the equation myself, but I would tend to thing it is right (wouldn't anyone have noticed by now?). If it turned out to be wrong, it would be worth to mention it in the article, but it would take some research before making such a statement, don't you think?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In particular, for what concerned you initially, the equation is dimensionally correct. A mol is indeed dimensionless, and you cannot disagree with it more than with a distance having dimensions of length, because it comes by its definition. You said "I think RT has dimensions of energy/mole, not energy as you say", which is contradictory, because the dimensions of energy/mol are the same as that for energy, mol being dimensionless. Of course it doesn't mean that "mol" is as if it didn't appear, the same way that "4 dozen" is not the same as "4".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't quite understand your second paragraph. Anyway, you mentioned earlier "molar mass", which is indeed a good example, because when you say "the mass of CO<sub>2</sub> is 44.01 g/mol", you are saying, "if you take 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> molecules of CO<sub>2</sub>, they weight 44.1 g". See, you could play the same game with "dozens", or "pairs", or "hundreds", the numbers will of course vary, but the only dimension appearing is mass. <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordi_Burguet_Castell_5ff0.html" title="User:Jordi Burguet Castell">jbc</a> May 26 03:45 UTC 2003</dd>

<p>I have a request - I know (or believe I know&#160;:) that there are reactions that don't follow the Arrhenius equation. Could someone knowledgeable update the page with the categories of reactions that don't obey the equation? I understand that the equation won't be accurate when, for example, the output energy of the equation drives other reactions that consume the reactants for the reaction you're interested in. I'm wondering if there are other examples.</p>
<p>--Could you give a more specific example of your output energy driving other reactions example?</p>

<p>Any fundamental reaction, which is any reaction where one or more reactants combine and turn into one or more products with no intermediate steps, will follow this equation. This is because the Arrhenius equation is identical to a Boltzmann distribution, which is derived from statistical mechanics. So the Arrhenius equation is not just a handy mathematical approximation. Physics dictates this must be true.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Is this really true? Doesn't the Boltzmann distribution just apply to gases? <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOlin_d492.html" title="User:Olin">Olin</a>
<dl>
<dd>The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities is not restricted to gases - it applies to nearly all liquids (except at very low temperature) and, to a limited extent, even to solids. It is a rigorous result of classical statistical mechanics and, as such, applies whenever classical mechanics is valid. Nevertheless, you are right to be suspicious about the preceding poster's highly exaggerated claims about the Arrhenius equation. The Arrhenius equation is by no means "identical to a Boltzmann distribution". In order to get from the Boltzmann distribution to a formula for a chemical reaction rate, one must introduce a number of additional assumptions. These assumptions are reasonably well satified for a great many chemical reactions, so the Arrhenius equation is very useful. But it is nevertheless an approximation.--Rparson 02:30, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is when a reaction we're looking at is not fundamental. Then there are actually a bunch of sub-reactions going on. There might be steps that are not reactions at all - for example, if it's a catalytic reaction, some chemical needs to stick to a solid surface before it reacts. Adsorption (the chemical sticking of a molecule to a solid) goes *down* with temperature. The rate constant of the fundamental reaction steps increase with temperature, but at different, er, rates. There could also be reverse reactions, and if they increase with temperature, the overall rate for a reaction (forward minus backward) will go down.</p>
<p>The rate for a complicated reaction will (hopefully) consist of an algebraic expression of the reactants and the rate constants for many of the fundamental reactions that comprise the overall reaction. Each one of these fundamental rate constants will follow an Arrhenius law, but the overall reaction cannot follow an Arrhenius model because there is more than one rate constant. ---Alchemy3083 26 April 2005</p>

<p>Really, there should be a different article for the Eyring equation than the Arrhenius equation, as they are derived from different theories.</p>

<dd>The Arrhenius equation is not really "derived" at all - as far as I know there is no microscopic model that leads exactly to the Arrhenius equation. It's a quasi-empirical result. I think it is reasonable to keep some discussion of how microscopic models such as "collision theory" and transition state theory lead to Arrhenius-like expressions, but perhaps the present discussion is too long. What we really need is a much better, much more thorough article on transition state theory. --Rparson 02:30, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
