<p>Prior to the eighteenth century African's arrived in London through travel with different prominent people and where given many different jobs and titles. AD 50 Roman London: Many of the first London residents came from Africa and all over Europe. Many Africans came to London after fighting for the Roman Army. Proof of these early African Londoners can be found in wooden spoon carvings found at the South bark bridge. These carved wooden spoons were often referred to as "Negro Heads". 16th Century: Early in the sixteenth century African's arrived in London by the means of Catherine of Aragon. She traveled to London and brought a group of her African attendants with her. Around the same time African's named trumpeters, who served Henry the VII and Henry the VIII came to London. When trade lines began to open between London and West Africa, Africans slowly began to become part of the London population. The first record of an African in London was in 1593. His name was Cornelius. London’s residents started to become fearful of the increased black population. At this time Queen Elizabeth declared that all black “Negroes and black mores” to be arrested and expel led from her kingdom. Mid 17th Century: During this era there was a rise of black settlements in London. Britain was involved with the tri-continental slave trade. Black slaves were attendents to sea captains and ex colonial officials as well as traders, plantation owners and military personnel. This marked growing evidence of the black presence in the northern, eastern and southern areas of London. There were also small numbers of free slaves and seaman from West Africa and South Asia. Many of these people were forced into beggary due to the lack of jobs and racial discrimination.</p>

<p>Around the 1750’s London became the home of many of Blacks, Jews, Irish, Germans, and Huguenots. The number of Blacks in London reached between 10,000 to 15,000 during the 1760’s. Evidence of the number of Black residents in London was found through registered burials. The status of Blacks in London is now public debate. The whites of London had widespread views the Black people in London were less than human these views were expressed in slave sale advertisements. The Blacks of London resisted through escape. Well known Black activists of this era include Oluadah Equiano, Ignatis Sancho and Ottobah Cugoano. With the support of other Britons these activists demanded that Blacks be freed from slavery. Supporters involved in this movements included workers and other nationalities of the urban poor who themselves suffered under the rule of the upper class. London Blacks vocally contested slavery and the slave trade that was widespread throughout Britain. At this time the slavery of whites was forbidden, but the legal statuses of these practices were not clearly defined. Free black slaves could not be enslaved, but blacks who were bought as slaves in Britain were considered property of their owners. During this era Lord Mansfield declared that a slave who fled from his master could not be taken by force or sold abroad. This verdict fueled the numbers of Blacks that escaped slavery. This led to the decline of slavery in England and called for the elimination of the slave trade. During this same period many slave soldiers who fought on the side of the British during the American Revolution arrived in London. These soldiers were deprived of pension any many of them became poverty-stricken and were reduced to beggers on the streets. The Blacks in London lived among the whites in areas of Mile End, Stepney, Paddington and St. Giles. The majority of these people did not live as slaves, but as servants to the wealthy whites. Many became labeled as the “Black Poor” defined as ex low wage soldiers, seafarers and plantation workers. Collicott, Sylvia L. (1986), Connections. Haringey. Local-National-World Links.
