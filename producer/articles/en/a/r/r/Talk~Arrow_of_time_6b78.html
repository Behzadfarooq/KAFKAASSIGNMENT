<p>Most possible worlds have higher entropy. Although each decoherence event is reversible, most possible events increase entropy. Isn't that the basis of the seond law? <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairandbalanced_3a34.html" title="User:Fairandbalanced">Fairandbalanced</a> 04:16, 10 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are websites that indicate that entropy and disorder are the same (ie. as described on this wiki page); and there are websites that indicate that they are not the same; and there are websites that say disorder in the entropy sense is not the same as disorder in the widely used sense. Please clarify.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Talking about entropy as if it were disorder is a rough way of understanding the concept, just like you can get a rough understanding of temperature by thinking of it as "hotness". However, it's just a rough analogy that gives you an intuitive feel for the concept, and as with all analogies, you get into trouble if you take it too literally. Essentially both temperature and entropy have very precise mathematical and physical definitions. You can get some intuition for which the definitions are, but that intuition can lead you astray.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can easily think of things that are intuitively "hotter" but have less or the same temperature (hot iron at 350 F versus dry air at 350 F). Similiarly, if you give me a few hours I can probably come up with things that seem less disorganized but have higher entropy.</dd>

<p>Sorry if the question is silly, but while it is true that I never saw a broken plate come together spontaneously, I have also never seen a stone going up spontaneously. Does it mean that the law of gravity is also irreversible, just as the law of entropy&#160;? Can we use the fall of objects to infer the arrow of time&#160;? Or is there something more to it&#160;? Would it be useful to clarify this in the article&#160;? <a href="../../../p/c/a/User%7EPcarbonn_cbe1.html" title="User:Pcarbonn">Pcarbonn</a> 11:25, 20 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, it should be reversible (<a href="../../../s/y/m/Symmetry.html" title="Symmetry">symmetrical</a>). <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Feynman_1f56.html" title="Richard Feynman">Feynman</a> used the example of a planet orbiting a star, in an ellipse. If you reverse the motion of the planet, giving it the same speed in the opposite direction then it still gives the same ellipse, it just goes the other way. In the case of your stone, the reason the stone doesn't go up is that it has lost all its energy to the ground when it landed – it's unlikely that the ground would impart the energy back into the stone afterwards. If, however, the stone was falling with a particular speed at a particular height, then you might reverse its velocity and (all things being equal) it would move away from the Earth. This is just my bad explanation – a better one is required.

<p>Thanks&#160;! I think I've got it. The fall, i.e. the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy, is indeed reversible. What is not reversible is the stop of the fall, i.e. the conversion of mechanic energy to heat. This is what the second law of thermodynamics says, and that's why I have never seen a stone go up...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gravity is itself symmetrical, but the analogy with orbiting of the planets is flawed, in that the planets are slowing down due to friction (and possibly due to gravity aswell) <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 23:05, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess I still don't get it. Gravity is always attractive in the forward direction of time, and always repulsive is the reverse direction. I guess electric charge can be either attractive or repulsive in both directions, but what about the other forces? Why isn't the irreversibility of attractive force as important to the arrow of time as entropy? --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackdavinci_842c.html" title="User:Jackdavinci">Jackdavinci</a> 18:23, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gravity is not repulsive in the reverse direction. It is still attractive. The phenomenon of objects "falling" up is the result of vibrations in the ground below the object manifesting out of heat and giving the object an upward impulse. It is the reverse of what happens when the object hits the ground sending a compression wave into it which is soon lost to heat. <a href="../../../v/y/r/User%7EVyroglyph_6f7f.html" title="User:Vyroglyph">Vyroglyph</a> 20:11, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>It has been argued that the arrow of time as we perceive it – giving a distinct past and future – results from the influence of the second law of thermodynamics on the evolution of the brain. To remember something, our memory goes from a disordered state to a more ordered one, or from one ordered state to another. To ensure that the new state is the correct one, energy must be used to perform the work and this increases the disorder in the rest of the Universe. There is always a greater increase in disorder than the amount of order gained in our memory, thus the arrow of time in which we remember things is in the same direction as that in which the disorder of the Universe increases.</i></dd>

<p>This looks like something that the editor read somewhere, but didnt quite understand, and somehow avoided actually describing the basis for this analogy between the workings of the brain and the workings of universe being somehow related in physics. In describing a theory (perhaps valid, but why unattributed?) as to how our perception of time may be related to time via the analogy of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Work.html" title="Work">work</a>, the meaning of "work" here is far too general. In the end the idea seems to rests upon a notion that the expense of brain energy is somehow equivalent or related to an "expense" of temporal inertia, which in and of itself doesnt seem to hold water, regardless of the problems with the second part. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">S</a><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">V</a> 23:06, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of the article as it stands (following the introduction) is my attempt to summarise my understanding of the publications and books that I have read that cover the arrow of time. Previously there was no attempt to explain <b>why</b> there is an arrow of time. However, I am not a physicist and you're right that there should be some references to back up the assertions. The text concerning the brain is indicated as being a hypothesis and anyone is free to replace it with something better. I'm sorry if my contribution isn't good enough, but I'd hope that there were some useful attempt to actually explain the arrow of time here, rather than just having examples of it. — <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_J_Haywood_515e.html" title="User:Lee J Haywood">Lee J Haywood</a> 19:39, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a layman's idea here... Time itself is the propagation of events and states into the future (which we measure by watching for predictably repeating cues, like clocks, daylight, the seasons, and so on). Our thoughts can confuse aspects of what the future is with the past as we learn to predict the outcomes of our actions; we can even imagine some parts of our future easier than remembering parts of our past. The arrow of time is any physical property that is different going foward in time than backward (breaking, burning, decomposing, exploding) which aids in reminding us that the two are quite different. So, while our brain function is limited by many things which are arrows of time (most importantly the foward-only flow of information), the term seems to apply mostly as a reminder to physicists that past and future aren't always interchangable. -- tussock 17 Jan 2005</dd>

<dd>It is both possible and impossible, but there's no contradiction. It is possible that they would separate out if given an infinite amount of time.

<dd>It is not entirely true that given infinite time all states will occur.

However, in that case we can be sure that given enough time we can go arbitrarily <i>close</i> to any state we imagine, and so the particles will seperate out. --<a href="../../../h/i/r/User%7EHirak_99_3454.html" title="User:Hirak 99">Hirak 99</a> 17:22, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's definitly true in a purely clasical system. In the above example of molecules seperating, the motions of those molecules might result in a closed loop that eventually results in an exact repetition of the positions and vectors of the starting state and thus a repitition of the loop. However the probabilistic (aka "random") nature of quantum effects -- for example the uncertain timing of proton evaporation -- would, given enough time, perturb the system out of it's closed loop. But then again, the proton evaporation (or what have you) may or may not be reversible in a closed loop of it's own. With our present understanding of quantum mechanics it seems the timing of the evaporation of the proton (again, just as an example of a probabilistic proccess) would be unlikely to reverse and recur at the same point in each iteration of the classical loop.</dd>
<dd>It seems that some quantum mechanical proccesses are either -- for lack of a better word-- "random", or that there are "hidden variables" that govern the proccesses in a more classical manner. If they are "random" then an infinitely recuring closed loop would be impossible, if there are "hidden variables" then it is quite probable that all such systems (purely hypothetical though they may be) would end up repeating themselves again. Either way we will certainly not live, nor the universe likely last, long enough to carry out our little hypothetical experiment. Churchofmau 08:18, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where does the excessive energy of biological evolution comes from&#160;? doesn't the oredered state of things now ,as opposed to less orederly in the past contradicts the second law of thermodynamics? where does the system draw it's "order" from&#160;? what is it that becomes less ordered as biological system evolve? <a href="../../../d/i/z/User%7EDiza_c901.html" title="User:Diza">Diza</a> 09:26, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is mentioned briefly by the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermodynamics.html" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a> article, though without explanation, and is missing entirely from the <a href="../../../l/a/w/Laws_of_thermodynamics.html" title="Laws of thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a> article. Life doesn't have any "excessive" energy, it is simply very good at hoarding energy available extracted from its environment. In reality life performs work, and that work increases the total rate at which energy is used – so entropy still increases when the surroundings are taken into account. &#160; — <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_J_Haywood_515e.html" title="User:Lee J Haywood">Lee J Haywood</a> 21:33, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually biological system can introduce even more disorder. E.g. cow by eating grass destroys more order (enclosed in the grass) then creates new order (in a form of own tissues and giving birth to new cows). It is not true of the grass so. If there no grass whole solar energy will be absorbed by the soil and dissipated into the heat. The grass uses part of it build itself and create the order.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/i/z/User%7EDiza_c901.html" title="User:Diza">Diza</a> 18:25, 16 December 2005 (UTC) Narutally all the excessive energy for the functions of life comes from the sun's rays,This cpudl be the answer. So all of the order that has been built in the whole history the biological evolution could be explained the the sum of all dicipated heat from the planet&#160;? this still bugs me. becasue there are other plantes. maybe one could say the biological system CONCENTRATE their order in one location ,so that they have a higher order density.</p>

<p>I am removing the following statement</p>
<p>" Like gravity most physical laws can be described by relatively simple mathematical equations (momentum can be described as F=ma for example), and most mathematical operations are reversible (if you multiply a value by a number you can take the result and divide it by the same number to obtain the original value). So it is no suprise that most physical processes are also reversible and that most laws are symmetrical. The fact that there are exceptions the symmetry is one of the greater mysteries that science is currently exploring. "</p>
<p>as it seems to be a mostly meaningless, somewhat misleading collection of words (I started out by correcting misspeled word "mathematical", but then realized that the whole thing is beyond repair). Indeed: "most physical laws can be described by relatively simple mathematical equations" - is this even a statement? Simple relative to what? Is <span class="texhtml"><i>F</i> = <i>m</i><i>a</i></span> an example of simple? How about equations of motion in <a href="../../../e/u/l/Euler-Lagrange_equation_b2ac.html" title="Euler-Lagrange equation">Lagrange form</a>, are they simple? Is <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamiltonian_mechanics.html" title="Hamiltonian mechanics">Hamiltonian</a> approach simple? Are forces, or fields simple, are classical <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamical_systems.html" title="Dynamical systems">dynamical systems</a> simple? The adjective <i>most</i>, this indeterminate quantifier, that we'll soon see again and again, effectively nullifies the argument. For, you see, until 1956 or so, not most, but <b>all</b> known laws of physics appeared to be T-invariant. The violations are pretty damn rare. Much more so, than "relatively complicated" physical laws...</p>
<p>Next, saying "momentum can be described as F=ma" is an awkward way to express an idea at best, for momentum (as well as coordinates, for example) is indeed contained in the equation, but indirectly, and what the equation is normally describing is, depending on what's given, is either <b>force</b> or <b>acceleration</b>. Of course.</p>
<p>Then there is a claim that <b>most</b> (again!) mathematical operations are <b>reversible</b>. Now what does this mean? Most by what measure? Finally, an extraordinary assertion is made that since "most" functions are bijections (right?), "it is no suprise that most (Ah!) physical processes are also reversible". Now, the claim that it is no surprise indicates, to me, an unsubstantiated POV, at best, a completely misleading analogy at worst.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's pure <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealism.html" title="Idealism">idealism</a>. Fact of the matter is, that the laws of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_mechanics.html" title="Classical mechanics">classical mechanics</a> (and also <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell_equations.html" title="Maxwell equations">Electromagentism</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Relativity_1cb0.html" title="Special Relativity">Special</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Relativity_700f.html" title="General Relativity">General Relativity</a>, and <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_Electrodynamics_64c0.html" title="Quantum Electrodynamics">Quantum Electrodynamics</a>) -- in any form, simple or not, for form is irrelevant here, we are talking substance -- appear, as a result of an observation, <i>a posteriori</i>, to possess certain symmetry, which is expressed mathematically not by reference to arbitrary invertible transformation, but very precisely: as a symmetry of all of the laws above w.r.t time reversal. This invariance, and again, <i>a posteriori</i>, appears not to be a universal law of nature, which is most spectacularly seen in <a href="../../../c/p/-/CP-violation_015a.html" title="CP-violation">CP-violation</a> (that, due to <a href="../../../c/p/t/CPT_invariance_ca68.html" title="CPT invariance">CPT invariance</a>, implies T-violation). It's fine to apply mathematics to look for an underlying reason for T-symmetry being so pervasive, being violated so ever slightly and (as far as I know) only in the weak interactions. But "reversibility" of "most mathematical operations" has nothing to do with the issue. It's fruitless pseudomathematical mysticism (formally, a POV). A claim that the time symmetry of (most of) the physical laws could be known <i>a priori</i> is simply factually false. Isn't it?</p>
<p>But, if you disagree, by all means, just put the piece back to the article. I just wanted to explain that I have no intention to vandalize it. To the contrary, I think it has already suffered enough...Feodor 22:38, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem with the thermodynamic argument is that the second law is <b>based off of all the other laws of physics</b>, which are fully <b>time symetric</b>, meaning that the second law, if <b>totally applied</b> to a system should predict that entropy should increase in the future and in the past.</dd>

<p>The past is memory, the future is anticipation, now alone is real Saint Augustine.</p>
<p>Awareness is a present moment function which compares what seems to be experienced externally to what is being experienced internally. The difference attributed to an experience identified as memory is called the past. The psychological future, like a projection in a mirror, makes what is behind such as expeirences, anticipations, desires, dreams, hopes, and goals, seem ahead of the observer. The ability compare novel experienced events and imagined events to countable repeating events and chart them is called time. The consistant increase in memorable novel experiences creates the psychological illusion of an arrow of time since no current experience seems totally indentical, to any prior one and no retracing or reversing of even a single moment of the universe in total is ever noticed. Since the universe seems to be expanding it seems impossible for any current experience to be anything like a prior one since all prior experiences have an apparently smaller universe in total. <a href="../../../j/i/o/User%7EJiohdi_eac5.html" title="User:Jiohdi">Jiohdi</a> 15:27, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, er, thanks for that. I removed it because it reads like the confused musings of someone who doesn't really know what they're talking about. I see you've reinstated it. The matter of human perception of the arrow of time is very interesting indeed, but this addition contains no reference to published sources. I'd like to hear what psychologists and philosophers of consciousness have to say about this, not what you think. Doesn't anyone with a brain keep an eye on Wikipedia's articles?

<p>It is said in the article that such motions are reversible. There are 2 or more problems here. One is that chaos may be present, so that over a sufficiently long time, the orbits will have a divergence from each other that is so sensitive to initial conditions it is impossible to predict which set it the right one. (see Lyapunov Exponent). Another is that there are many small bodies present, from asteroids down to meteorites and even dust, that make it impossible to work backwards, and even make forward predictions diverge initially by meters a year, and eventually in a Lyapunov manner (exponentiallyI.

<dd>I don't see what your problem is. The direction of time makes no difference – the chaos is present in either case. And even though we might not be able to predict the outcome of a chaotic system with any accuracy, that doesn't mean that the motion isn't reversible – only that we cannot model it. The article only says that a movie of planetary motions looks realistic in both directions, which would be true no matter how long the movie ran for. &#160; — <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_J_Haywood_515e.html" title="User:Lee J Haywood">Lee J Haywood</a> 09:43, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
