<dd>I found that too and dropped it in right at the end of the "Future" section.

<p>Hey, check out the page for the in production, future movie supposedly coming out in 2006, called Arrested Development. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475934" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475934" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475934</a> It says that it stars <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_McConaughey_b834.html" title="Matthew McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a>. The plot outline is: When an over the hill high school narcotics agent is forced into retirement, he goes rogue to prove that he's still a viable commodity. Why is this film important? Because, it also lists <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Riggle_e400.html" title="Rob Riggle">Rob Riggle</a> as Rep. Jon Van Huessen, and Hector Atreyu Ruiz as a prison guard. Riggle played the same role in <a href="../../../f/a/k/Fakin%27_It_afe1.html" title="Fakin' It">Fakin' It</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Ties_%28Arrested_Development_episode%29_e7cd.html" title="Family Ties (Arrested Development episode)">Family Ties</a>. Ruiz played a prison guard in the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison_Break-In_2b48.html" title="Prison Break-In">Prison Break-In</a> episode. Does anybody know what any of this means?</p>

<dd>Sounds to me like some coincidences. As much as I'd love to see an Arrested Development movie, I don't think that it's going to happen. However, an amazon search reveals that there's a book in the works. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiTruth_f23a.html" title="User:WikiTruth">WikiTruth</a> 01:28, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the main box at the top of the page it lists the production style as a single camera setup. Later in the article it says "The show is shot with several free moving camera operators which follow the actors around in a documentary style." Which is it? Nambio 08:28, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It is an interesting idea (though I'm somewhat skeptical, I mean, would <i>Michael</i> really fit with this theory?

<li>1.) I am not the user who originally wrote that material, i just thought i would go ahead and mention that i had read it elsewhere, with the possibility of citing it.</li>
<li>2.) Very rarely are connections like theses a 1:1 connection (i.e. saying "you compared gob to jeb, then GWB, which is it doesn't make sense; they don't necessarily have to <i>represent</i> one character exclusively...it's just a collection of parallels, really.)</li>
<li>3.) I searched online, and the only <i>Sources</i> i could find were postings on blogs and the like. Did, though, come across a few more parallels i thought were fairly funny, all from the immaculate election: Michael loses and election and then wants his son to win (michael = bush 41, GM = bush 43), michael loses an election but it's implied that with gob's help, he could've been able to play dirty and win (michael = GWB, gob=jeb, play dirty = recounts). There were some more, but i can't remember them.</li>
<li>4.) Yea, its all unsourced. So i dont support putting it back in unless a source is found. I just wanted to start a conversation in hopes that someone else knows where a source may be found. 82.83.53.5 10:37, 27 March 2006 (UTC) (same guy as above, dynamic ip address)</li>

<p>Hi. I'm the person that first included the Bush comments on this page. I've been wanting to do this for a while, but only recently did so, seeing that no one else was making this comparison. The comparisons I made were of my opinion, as well as some agreements of several friends and other internet sites, as mentioned previously by another user. I have included these as I have noticed that others who enjoy this show have also noticed these subtle similarities and political inferences. I felt that it is very important to mention that there are obvious parallels between the Bluths and the Bushes. Perhaps these parallels were not as obvious to some, but for me, as a political junkie, one of the appeals of this show were these subtle connections. As for the person, who said that this source needs to be sited, that is both very difficult and unreasonable. If I was stating this comparison as a fact (e.g., The Bluths are a parody of the Bushes), then I need some kind of a statement from the creators and/or writers of the show directly stating such. That is why I have phrased it in the form I did. (something like, "Some have compared the Bluths to the Bushes."). As another user suggested, the only sources of such comparisons are from blogs, forums, etc. And, while I could have gone down and compiled a dossier of "facts" as evidence for such implication, I decided that this would not be the smartest idea. I will wait to hear some other opinions regarding this issue before reverting to the version I submitted. I'm not a very active user of Wikipedia, and I have no interest being involved in any type of "reversion war," that I have sometimes read about in these discussion pages. I hope there forms some general consensus regarding the inclusion of these parallels. If any other user wants to include more facts or even expand the comparisons into a full section, by all means, go ahead. But, please do not just delete my small, but I think important, contribution without any explanation. P.S., I'm comparing GOB to JEB. It's very unusual for a person to be referred to by a literal pronunciation of his/her initials, and more unlikely for that person to adopt it as his new first name, as in the case of Gob Bluth and Jeb Bush. Also, I don't think there has to be a distinct 1-to-1 connection of an AD character to the Bushes to justify the similarities.</p>

<li>What would you consider a "reliable source"? I know the wikipedia people say an opinion needs to be "verified," but even this definition is poor at best. For example, if it's a biography and I say "some have attributed his recent decline in popularity to his personal lifestyle", then you would cite a news article stating such. For this, the parallelism or symbolism are personal opinions, and it is hard to have a verifiable source, since it's most likely that neither you nor I would consider some post on some forum a good source. If I can make an example with a literary work, in George Orwell's Animal Farm, the pigs are considered parallels of Lenin and Trotsky, and this is a widely accepted fact. But, never has Orwell himself declared that this was his intent; and thus, if one were to argue to death that the pigs do not mirror the aforementioned individuals, then it's hard to continue any discussion. This is the essence of symbolism. The writers of this show are not going to, at least not for the next couple of years, admit to any type of parallelism. As I see it, the only way is to reference the program itself, but I'm not sure if you consider that sufficient. Let us consider the four sentences I had written (since I actually found it now):
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Some have noted that some details of the Bluths are based on the Bush family. The most prominent is the character of GOB, whose legal name is George Oscar Bluth, Jr. The name GOB comes from the initials of his name, similar to Jeb Bush, whose legal name is John Ellis Bush. Other similarities include the frequency of the name "George" among family members and that Bluth is very similar to Bush.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Granted, that last sentence is pretty poor. But as for the GOB to JEB comparison, what more would you think is needed for it to be "reliable." Should I also say that phonetically, GOB and JEB are nearly identical? And even, Bluth to Bush comparison. It is almost impossible to come up with an Anglo last name that is so close in both the spelling and the pronunciation to Bush (both monosyllabic with an -ooo- sound as the vowel). As for the "George" frequency, I didn't want to expend too much time when I first added these sentences, and in retrospect should have been more careful. I think I wanted to highlight George Michael Bluth, the apparent eventual successor, to George P. Bush, the son of Jeb Bush, who is the second son of George H. W. Bush. Like George P., George Michael has a father w/ name other than George but is considered the successor, as the eldest in a quasi-primogeniture of the Bush/Bluth families. And, yes, I know that in this instance I'm comparing GOB to GWB, but I repeat myself once again, there need not be 1-to-1 connection for parallelism to exist. I mean if you think all these are pure coincidences, I don't think I can convince you, but it seems to me, and some others, that these parallelisms are not meant to be coincidences.</li>
<li>Anyway, please clarify what is "acceptable" to you, since you seem to be some type of super-user for this page.</li>

<dd>Except that a large chunk of this article uses "Arrested Development. Created by Mitchell Hurwitz. 2003–present. Broadcast and DVD." as a reference - including the section in which this paragraph would be featured, "Themes and other characteristics#Topicality". So yea, no, I'm not really sure that argument holds up. The question is whether or not it's worth a mention, not whether or not it's sourced; a real quick re-phrase of the paragraph (see above, <a href="../../../a/r/r/Talk%7EArrested_Development_37e5.html#Bush_Comparison" title="Talk:Arrested Development">Talk:Arrested Development#Bush Comparison</a>) would easily be backed up by the show itself. I'm personally also not all that sure it warrants a mention, but i think it can be left up to consensus rather than unilateral action. 82.82.184.157 11:39, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As I already said, we'll get to the other problems with the article after we're done with this problem. One problem at a time. The other problems don't excuse this problem. As for your rewording claim, the show makes hundreds of comedic references, and leaves room for us to imagine thousands more. Unless you can find this comparison to be cited among reliable sources, I'm not comfortable making a connection that the show either didn't intend to make, or that the public doesn't seem to notice. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2006-06-12 16:41</small>

<dd>I don't consider using a caveat in accepted policy as a "problem," so the use of the show as a reference doesn't fall into that camp at all. In fact, it's really the only source we <i>can</i> use to point out a whole lot of important parts of the show (topicality, in-jokes, call-backs and -fowards, etc). And I'm not 100% for it's inclusion either; I suggested leaving it to consensus. And it doesn't seem like a whole lot of people seem to have a problem with it, so I'm fine with it being left in there. But remember - though you may be the "maintainer," or what have you - it is, like all of the other million and change articles, not your article. So "I'm not comfortable making a connection" is not a valid reason. Now, I figure it's cool to close this issue now - I'm pretty much the only one who voiced an opinion on the materials removal, and it was more of an opinion on the <i>reason</i> for it's removal, so shall we move on to the other problems you see with the article? 82.82.183.41 21:50, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's a big difference between referencing the obvious (someone repeating the same phrase in multiple episodes) and making a tangential connection that there is no evidence was ever intended or is considered a connection among reliable sources. Without sources, it should not be added. As for your "consensus", consensus comes out of discussion, not lack of discussion; saying that "nobody else is replying" implies "nobody thinks its a problem" is not evidence, or discussion, and definitely not consensus. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2006-06-13 21:59</small>

<dd>I'm not quite sure why Brian0918 objects so strenuously to the notion that the Bush/Bluth comparison is <i>one interpretation</i>. First, the nature of joking allusions is such that there can be no "reliable source" to be cited: the joke becomes unfunny if Mitch Hurwitz or someone says in an interview, oh yes, we intended this joke, that joke, that joke, and this other joke - here's exactly what you're supposed to be laughing at. As a comparison, imagine a hypothetical TV show with a character who (1) sported a single glove, (2) had a pet chimp, (3) spoke in a high-pitched voice, (4) seemed to have an unhealthy attraction to children, and (5) dangled his child over a balcony. What sort of "source" would be required to accept the obvious conclusion that this hypothetical character is being compared to ____ (fill in the blank: is there anyone here who doesn't get the comparison?). With the Bush/Bluth thing: numerous contributors have cited many <i>plausible</i> parallels between the Bluth family and the Bush family (before reading this article and discussion, I'd thought of many of them myself - too bad I'm not a journalist so you all can cite me). At this point, the fact that many commenters on this very page have cited or agreed with the comparison might be considered verification (though not "external," I suppose). 2fs 04:57, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added a very important sentence to this article, one which I think fans of the show might have purposely avoided? The hip hop group whom used the <i>Arrested Development</i> name, made it famous in the early 1990s via massive top ten hit singles such as <i>People Everyday</i>, <i>Mr Wendal</i> and <i>Tennesee</i>. Fox were sued over the use of the name as the group and its lawyers held that it diluted the name. Fox lawyers settled out of court.

<p><s>*<b>Weak Oppose</b></s><b>Support</b> (apparently I didn't read the text of the survey closely enough, nor did the person below me) - I'm fairly aware of the hip-hop group, and even now, I think of the group before I think of the tv show.

<li><b>Oppose</b> - Many years from now, when both the TV show and hip-hop group are ancient history, they will have more of an equal of a significance in pop culture. The idea that the TV show is more significant than the music group is more of a product of the show being fresher in our memory. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 01:50, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If there is going to be a move, it should probably be to <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrested_Development_%28TV_series%29_237c.html" title="Arrested Development (TV series)">Arrested Development (TV series)</a> to conform with established WP naming conventions. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TM</a> 01:15, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In response to the "opposes" above, my issue is that the only difference in title between the disambig page <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrested_development.html" title="Arrested development">Arrested development</a> and the tv show page <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrested_Development_85fa.html" title="Arrested Development">Arrested Development</a> is a capitalization. I think that the disambig page should be kept, and that the title of the tv show page should be made more specific. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkiasaurus_6e1a.html" title="User:Skiasaurus">Skiasaurus</a> 17:11, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The disambig page should be the fully capitalized <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrested_Development_85fa.html" title="Arrested Development">Arrested Development</a>, as that's the correct spelling of both the TV show and music group. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilchama_b61a.html" title="User:Milchama">Milchama</a> 17:41, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem with that is that <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrested_development.html" title="Arrested development">Arrested development</a> also refers to, according to the disambig page, "a state where development has stopped prematurely," and not just to pop culture. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkiasaurus_6e1a.html" title="User:Skiasaurus">Skiasaurus</a> 02:53, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That shouldn't matter. The only topics that exist are both spelled with a capital D, so that's what the dab page should use.</dd>
<dd>I'm a bit confused on how to vote. People are voting oppose while providing reasoning that seemingly supports the move. In any event, it should be <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrested_Development_%28TV_series%29_237c.html" title="Arrested Development (TV series)">Arrested Development (TV series)</a> as TM pointed out.

<p>Does there really need to be a full section on the music of the show? It's really not important to the show itself, and there's not much to talk about. The fact that a handfull of songs are used occasionally doesn't seem to warrant an entire section.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 22:09, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>A good deal of comedic and dramatic effect is tied to the show's music. A lot of time, effort and planing go into the music, and many of the same songs show up in multiple episodes. The "Mr. F" hook, the "Big Yellow Joint" song, the sad guitar melody whenever something serious happens, "All You Need is Smiles," etc., are an important part of the storytelling and as such deserve a spot to be explained. Contrary to "... a handfull of songs are used occasionally doesn't seem to warrant an entire section," most of music becomes a joke or punchline of itself, a very rarely used technique in comedy. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicalgit_87a7.html" title="User:Classicalgit">Classicalgit</a> 08:59, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Does anyone happen to know what religion the Bluths are supposed to be (aside from George Sr's Jewish and Christian whims)? I thought maybe the whole family is Jewish, since Maeby didn't know what a Cross was and a member of the family is named Tobias. But then they also did celebrate Christmas, not just in the Christmas party at the Bluth company but also that they had Christmas decorations in Lucille's apartment. I know, this is sort of a stupid question, but I kept wondering it when I watched this show.</p>
<p>I had a discussion about this with a Jewish friend of mine who lives in the area who argued that the family is arguably obviously Jewish. There are certainly several good points: many of the actors are convincingly Jewish-looking or actually Jewish, and Lindsay fits the JAP stereotype to a tee. The best article I could find on it when I looked a while ago is this: <a href="http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/print.html?id=58" class="external free" title="http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/print.html?id=58" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/print.html?id=58</a>, which you can take what you will from. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkibum8713_4acc.html" title="User:Skibum8713">Skibum8713</a> 20:13, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Posting this here because there doesn't seem to be any discussion at the episode pages. On the episode page for <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altar_Egos_1025.html" title="Altar Egos">Altar Egos</a> there's a goof that says "Lucille proclaims she could not breastfeed any of her children because of George Sr.'s tweaking, but later in Spring Breakout, the narrator states "it was Buster's first taste of alcohol since he was nursing." One of these statements must be false, unless the narrator is implying that Lucille used alcoholic formula." However, I'm sure that there's an episode that mentioned that buster was breastfed by somebody else (Lucille's housekeeper?). His taste of alcohol could have been a small amount of alcohol to help him sleep, as some people do with their infants. I agree that the narrator's joke itself may imply that he tasted alcohol in the breastmilk, but I disagree that it's truly a goof, because as far as I can tell what he said is entirely possible without contradicting known facts about characters.129.128.214.87 16:35, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Arrested Development always had references to the actual actors real lives occasionally and so on, but did the show ever break the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_wall.html" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> on an eye level?

<dd>I can't think of an actual "to the camera" way, but the narrator was always the first one to break the fourth wall - especially after Michael Bluth happened to say "arrested development" as part of normal conversation and the narrator followed with "Hey! That's the name of this show!"ClassicBri 13:01, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beef_Consomme_5730.html" title="Beef Consomme">Beef Consomme</a>, the judge says that no cameras are allowed in the courtroom and part of the rest of the scene is seen from behind the door of the courtroom.

<p>How many people reading the English article for <i>Arrested Development</i> really need to know that what it aired on in Thailand or any of those other countries? It seems like it violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a>, so I've removed it.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 11:24, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>WP:NOT#DIRECTORY is intended to indicate what <b>articles</b> are not - not about <b>sections</b> of articles. The international broadcasters represent facts which support the notability and verifiability of a programme. Also remember Wikipedia's audience is global - Wikipedia is not American, either (otherwise we have a fundamental NPOV problem here). There are undoubtedly people in Thailand who read the English WP and would find the international reach of a programme relevant. The section has a compact 2-column format that was not particularly intrusive in the first place. Nor would <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> be grounds for deleting information. The broadcasters section was therefore restored. <a href="../../../d/l/2/User%7EDl2000_b92d.html" title="User:Dl2000">Dl2000</a> 14:55, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Uh, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> can be applied for articles <i>or</i> sections. The "no list of quotations" example in 1 for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a> could clearly be applied to a "Quotes" section in <i>any</i> article. If you want to demonstrate the program's global reach, you can put it in a sentence "<i>Arrested Development</i> has been brocasted on <i>x</i> channels in <i>y</i> countries", you don't have to list every single one. This also violates the <a href="../../../e/m/b/Wikipedia%7EEmbedded_list_d7c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Embedded list">Wikipedia:Embedded list</a> guideline as well. And <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> isn't grounds for keeping information either; not that I ever even said that I didn't like it, I just think it's bad practice. Once you hit a certain point of this article it's just lists all the way down. "Celebrity guests" also should probably be taken care of; it is somewhat important but taking up a full page of text isn't good. Wiki articles aren't IMDB after all, and we generally don't have exhaustive cast lists. I'm not going to revert you here, but this <b>is</b> a Featured Article and we do need to be strict to making sure it sets a good example. Both of those sections were less than half of what it's crawled up to now since it's been promoted. What was moderately ok then is now looking very cluttered in my eyes.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 15:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
