<p>"Arrival" begins with a fast-paced sequence showing a stern-faced man driving a <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lotus_Seven_026d.html" title="Lotus Seven">Lotus Seven</a> through the streets of <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. After leaving his vehicle in an underground parking garage, the man strides down a dimly lit corridor and throws open the doors to an office. Seated at a desk, a bald man (played by <i>Prisoner</i> co-creator, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Markstein_e995.html" title="George Markstein">George Markstein</a>) watches as the man paces back and forth, clearly raising his voice (<a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder.html" title="Thunder">thunder</a> is heard in place of dialogue) before throwing an envelope on the desk and slamming his fist down (a nearby teacup shatters from the impact).</p>
<p>The man — whose real name is never revealed — drives away from the parkade, unaware that a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearse.html" title="Hearse">hearse</a> is following behind. Meanwhile, the camera shows the man's face on his ID card being stamped with a row of XXX. This card is sent away on a conveyor belt to a records room and is dropped into a file cabinet drawer marked "RESIGNED".</p>
<p>The man arrives home and enters his flat. He starts quickly packing a suitcase. He tosses a few travel brochures on top and slams the case shut. Outside, a tall individual exits the hearse and approaches the man's front door.</p>
<p>The man does not notice the gas entering through the keyhole into his apartment until it is too late. His vision begins to swirl and he collapses onto a chesterfield.</p>
<p>He awakens sometime later, apparently still in his apartment. Groggily, he gets up and goes to the window. But instead of seeing office towers in London, he sees an <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italian</a>-style courtyard surrounded by <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_architecture.html" title="Roman architecture">Roman</a>-style columns and ancient looking buildings. He is now a prisoner of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Village_%28The_Prisoner%29_70eb.html" title="The Village (The Prisoner)">The Village</a>.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, each episode of <i>The Prisoner</i> begins with this opening sequence.</p>
<p><a name="Main_storyline" id="Main_storyline"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrival_%28The_Prisoner%29_1e80.html" title="Edit section: Main storyline">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Main storyline</span></h3>
<p>The man — dazed and confused — explores his new prison. He begins meeting inhabitants of The Village and learns its standard greeting — "Be seeing you" (delivered with an odd-looking salute). He takes his first ride in a Village taxi and learns that the inhabitants of The Village are international. He learns that the layout of The Village makes it difficult to leave — surrounded on three sides by mountains, and the fourth by "The Sea". Maps offer no clue as to where The Village is, and no one will answer the question for him.</p>
<p>Returning to the place where he awoke — inside it is a near-perfect replica of his London flat — he sees that the numeral 6 has now been attached to a sign outside. The phone rings when he enters and the newly christened No. 6 is invited to the Green Dome to visit with No. 2.</p>
<p>No. 2 turns out to be a kindly man, a bureaucrat who is apparently only interested in doing a double check as to No. 6's motives for resigning from an unidentified (but undeniably British) organization (presumably of the spying variety). "Co-operate and this can be a very nice place," he says. No. 6 learns that The Village has been spying on him for some time and has a complete dossier on him already — but No. 2 will not say which side runs The Village. During his visit with No. 2, No. 6 first meets the Butler (<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelo_Muscat_85be.html" title="Angelo Muscat">Angelo Muscat</a>), who represents "the little man". He is a short servant who never speaks and who, as the series progresses, turns out to be just about the only constant in The Village besides No. 6 himself.</p>
<p>No. 2 takes No. 6 on a tour, and describes The Village as a place where former agents come to either retire or be debriefed. There is no escape, and to illustrate this, No. 2 activates <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rover_%28The_Prisoner%29_6e2e.html" title="Rover (The Prisoner)">Rover</a>, a roaring, balloon-like "creature", or machine, that envelopes a rebellious Villager, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>After this unsettling tour, No. 6 makes his first escape attempt on foot, but is soon captured by Rover who, fortunately, does not kill No. 6 this time.</p>
<p>No. 6 awakes in The Hospital where he finds Cobb, a former colleague, who has also been incarcerated. Cobb is not very useful as a source of information and, moments before No. 6 returns from a brief interrogation, jumps out the window to his death.</p>
<p>No. 6 leaves the hospital and is forced to wear a Villager's costume as his old clothes have supposedly been burnt. The first thing he removes is the identity badge (with an image of a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny-farthing.html" title="Penny-farthing">Penny-farthing</a> bicycle — the Village's insignia) identifying him as No. 6. Except on rare occasions, No. 6 will never wear such a badge again.</p>
<p>No. 6 storms up to the Green Dome to confront No. 2, only to discover that it is now a different man. No. 2 can be and is replaced from time to time, for reasons not explained. This No. 2 is a colder individual, less friendly towards No. 6.</p>
<p>Later, No. 6 observes the funeral service for Cobb and sees a beautiful young woman following behind the funeral procession. He confronts her and learns that she was Cobb's lover. At a later rendezvous she reveals that she and Cobb were working on an escape plan and she promises to help No. 6 escape. The Prisoner is suspicious when he sees her visiting with No. 2. But she claims her intentions are honourable and she gives No. 6 an electropass, a modified wristwatch designed to stave off Rover and allow access to the Village's helicopter. The girl refuses to accompany No. 6.</p>
<p>The Prisoner makes his way to the helicopter pad and uses the electropass to keep Rover at bay as he boards the vehicle. He takes off, but unknown to him he is being observed by No. 2. A technician takes control of the helicopter via remote control and soon No. 6 is back in the Village.</p>
<p>The girl's true motives are left a mystery (she is never seen again), but before No. 2 can deal with No. 6, he first has to dismiss his latest successful "conversion" — Cobb. As Cobb leaves, he tells No. 2 he "mustn't keep my new masters waiting" and warns that No. 6 "will be a tough nut to crack". The last words No. 2 and Cobb exchange are "Au revoir" and "Auf wiedersehen", <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idioms</a> of farewell in <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> which literally refer to vision, as "Be seeing you" does. It is also left ambiguous if Cobb's use of German indicates his (new?) loyalties.</p>
<p>The episode ends with a defeated No. 6 leaving the helicopter pad, as the Butler passes a sign that says "Residents Only."</p>

<ul>
<li>Two versions exist of "Arrival". A slightly longer version, with different theme music and several different scenes (including a different conclusion in which Rover attacks No. 6 after he leaves the helicopter), was released on <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> in the UK in 2003. Rumours of a two-hour version have also persisted, however no such edit has yet been located.</li>
<li>Rover was not identified by this name until the later episode <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Schizoid_Man_%28The_Prisoner%29_2588.html" title="The Schizoid Man (The Prisoner)">The Schizoid Man</a></i>.</li>
<li>This episode introduces a very subtle subplot which would only be addressed in one future episode, "<a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance_of_the_Dead_%28The_Prisoner%29_de7b.html" title="Dance of the Dead (The Prisoner)">Dance of the Dead</a>". Both feature female characters who are assigned to observe Village inmates and end up falling in love with them. In this episode, "The Woman", while not explicitly described as an Observer, nonetheless wears the same outfit as the Observer in "Dance of the Dead" and appears to have similar duties. "Dance of the Dead" indicates that becoming emotionally attached to a subject is an occupational hazard for Observers, which appears to be the case in "Arrival" with "The Woman" and Cobb, and in "Dance of the Dead" when Number 6's Observer also develops an apparent attachment.</li>
