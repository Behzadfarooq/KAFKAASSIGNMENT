<p>I was under the impression that the Syrian government had stated that the dispute over Iskandarun province was settled? <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 16:52, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, all the maps I've seen in Syria marks it as fully Syrian territory, sometimes with the internationally accepted border shown as a dotted line marked "temporary border". I know the Syrian gov. won't push the issue now, and yes, they probably will drop it completely one day... but I haven't heard or seen anything about a formal recognition. Have you? - ARRE.</p>

<p>I guess you’re right about the Turkish thing. If we’re going to put Adyghe in, we might as well put Turkish. You’re wrong about the Golan Heights issue though. Read this <i>When Prime Minister Menachem Begin was asked in the Knesset why he was risking international criticism for this annexation, he replied "You use the word annexation, but I am not using it." [6] The quasigovernmental Jewish Agency for Israel states that "Although reported as a annexation, it is not: the Golan Heights are not declared to be Israeli territory."</i></p>
<pre>
Feel free to put Turkish back in if you want. <a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 21:39, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Of course Israel is not going to use the word "occupied". But this article isn't being written from an Israeli perspective, now is it? The international community considers the Golan Heights occupied regardless of Israel's control or lack of control over them. If Israel itself hasn't even officially used the word annexed then we should not say "Israel has claimed to have annexed the Golan Heights". Besides, is there something wrong with using the word occupied? <a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 21:48, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He may have been paying lip service, but then again in negotations a few years back Israel offered to give back most of the Golan Heights, so it doesn't seem like that permanent of an "annexation". Assad refused the offer, of course, because he wanted the border to go all the way to Lake Tiberias.<a href="../../../y/u/b/User%7EYuber_3068.html" title="User:Yuber">Yuber</a><sup><small><a href="../../../y/u/b/User_talk%7EYuber_629b.html" title="User talk:Yuber"><font color="#FF8C00">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:05, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I see that you didn't respond to third party proposals in the WS talk. If you don't mind I'll restore the no flags infobox. Feel free to revert if you want and respond to the proposals. This conflict upon this flag dured so long let's finnish it and use our time to learn from wikipedia as you said before.

<p><b>==&gt;Excuse me !!!</b> Please desist and stop accusing people. I've showed many times my goodfaith. And you come now accusing me for doing some thing that I didn't. Check the Templates [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Politics_of_Western_Sahara&amp;curid=1246098&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Politics_of_Western_Sahara&amp;curid=1246098&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>] and compare the different versions. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfried_Derksen_4ed6.html" title="User:Wilfried Derksen">Wilfried Derksen</a> (he's an administrator) did what you are talking about and you are accusing him of <i>"sabotage"</i>. I see that you don't have any respect for other users edits and accuse people of lying, vandalizm and sabotage when they don't agree with you. Koavf accused me of lying when he was refusing the discussion in WS talk from 14 to 20 October saying that he was in the UN basement, but he said after that he was in the UN in the only day of 6th October. I wonder who is lying and who doesn't show some Wikilove in this affair. I have neutral users support in this dispute but I see that you aren't willing to reach a concenssus. I proposed many times many <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Dispute Resolutions</a> procecesses, <b>I requested</b> Mediation, RfC, Survey to show my goodfaith but I see that you don't trust any of my proposals just because I'm Moroccan. You should visit the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">Racism</a> page. Now if you don't feel concerned by Wikilove principles that's your business.

<p>That's needed an article for ages, and I'd been sort of thinking about it myself but not getting around to it partly because I don't have any relevant books. Good stuff.</p>

<dd>Not the university, Ifead. I'm just back in Damascus after spending a while working in Beirut, getting back here gave me a considerable feeling of elation! walking through Midhat Pasha, playing backgammon in the Rauda cafe... it's sort of worn off by now though as I struggle with the search for liveable accommodation that won't leave me freezing my whatevers off in the winter, not to mention the frustration of dealing with Damascus estate agents and their diffiault relationship with reality. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 23:03, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>===&gt;<b>As I understand, you're Swedish?</b> Do you know a man named Jan who works in Sweden for the Western Sahara independence movement?

<p>===&gt;<b>Jan and the UN</b> Well, it didn't go as well as I had hoped. There were four questions that the IV Committee was considering: <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guam.html" title="Guam">Guam</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Sahara_6e35.html" title="Western Sahara">Western Sahara</a>, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Caledonia_f61a.html" title="New Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>. The speakers from Gibraltar went <b>way</b> over their time, and the translation equipment for the French broke, so it became clear that I would not get to speak (I was eleventh in line). I spoke with the secretary, and offered to cut my seven minutes' time to just a minute or a minute and a half. So, I basically read the last paragraph or so of my speech. It was still a fantastic time and I got to meet all of the biggest people in the movement from around the world, so I was grateful for my opportunity. <a href="../../../k/o/a/User%7EKoavf_1790.html" title="User:Koavf">Justin (koavf)</a> 01:23, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks! It was almost all due to Hanna Batatu's book on Iraq and Patrick Seale, plus one or two other sources. However, I've got Batatu's book on Syria from Amazon and it'll be waiting for me at home when I get back to Ireland for Christmas so hopefully I'll be able to improve that and a lot of other Syrian articles using it. If you take a look at the list of Syrian political parties or the list of Syrian prime ministers, you can see how much work there is to do! Not even an article on Khalid al-Azm, Jamil Mardam Bek, Fakhri al-Baroudi or Faris al-Khouri, and only a miserable stub on Choukri al-Quwatli. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 12:46, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem, glad to be of service. I think the page does need a lot of work -- we can split out some of the sections into new pages possibly?

<li>Hi, I see that you opposed moving the WS politics related pages to SADR related. You say that the pages are talking mainly about the territory of WS. In that case what about complying with WP principles of neutrality? I think that an infobox without flags is the best solution, remember the survey about the WS main page.</li>
<li>Western Sahara is a disputed territory and the question of souvreinty isn't resolved yet, by then Western Sahara isn't for SADR what France is for Republic of France, the situation is completely different.</li>
<li>WS is disputed between SADR and Morocco, Morocco isn't disputed, by then the Polsario's flag doesn't have anything to do in Morocco's related pages. ~</li>

<li>We discussed already the issue, It seems that no flags is the less controversial, 2 flags is more controversial but in any way better than having the only flag of SADR.</li>
<li>So you agree to have the both infoboxs in the WS politics related pages.</li>
<li>I never stated that there is no such thing as "Western Sahara politics". Only <b>some</b> Moroccan politics involves matters of political importance to Western Sahara because even under the Moroccan POV WS is only the southern provinces and not the whole Morocco. But <b>all</b> WS politics involves matters to political importance to Morocco's one because Morocco <b>claims</b> and <b>controls</b> the territory. To comply with your reasoning the flag of France should be in the Algerian page. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDaryou_3fd5.html" title="User:Daryou">Daryou</a> 09:47, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Obscure indeed - I actually don't know much about Jameel Shehadeh, he's just one of those politicians whose name pops up sometimes and who sometimes participates in public forums and such. He's sometimes on page 4 or 5 of the newspapers as having met with (whoever) or having declared (something generic that everybody declares, such as need to reform, need to resist separation wall, etc). Here's a summary translated from Arabic about their campaign:</p>
<ol>
<li>10 Candidates (incl 2 women), 8 from the West Bank, 2 from Gaza,</li>
<li>List is headed by Salim Bardini, former head of the Palestinian Police.</li>
<li>Campaigning on a platform of Palestinian unity and democracy as the only way towards reform</li>
<li>Unsuccessfully attempted to make contacts with other Palestinian groups in order to reinvigorate and expand the <a href="../../../p/l/o/PLO_68c8.html" title="PLO">PLO</a>, so is now running with few members of the APF plus other independents on the list of 10 in order to reach outside votes</li>
<li>Wants to push a national agenda which will help unify the community and present a better image in order to gain support of more countries and governments for the Palestinian cause</li>
<li>Abides by Palestinian 'national positions': Right of return, self determination, independent state within 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital. Also believes in right to resist occupation by any means (not clear if that includes arms inside Israel), and advocates the removal of the racial separation wall.</li>
<li>Also advocates national reform through better public education etc etc etc</li>
</ol>
<p>Pretty much same old generic statements, absolutely nothing unique about them which is why they don't have that much coverage. Let me know if there is anything else you may want more clarification on. regards, <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:15, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Arre. Frankly, I hadn't even heard of Shamir until I saw the Wikipedia article. I'm just trying to go on what the available sources (either about him, or by him) say, and make sure the text is representative and neutral. Do you know much about this guy? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:41, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It would be really helpful if you could add some of this to the Talk: page. There are two Shamir supporters there who keep insisting that sources like Expo are unreliable, and I'm no expert on these magazines. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:01, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your kind remarks! It's a good start, and something I was actually thinking about myself for while. I am currently overwhelmed with work, have started a course in the French cultural centre, and have an exam coming up in February, so... you can see where this is going. If I get a chance, I'll try and contribute, though.</p>
<p>My two main priorities at the moment, by the way, are <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_nationalism.html" title="Arab nationalism">Arab nationalism</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_nationalism.html" title="Palestinian nationalism">Palestinian nationalism</a>, both of which need considerable improvement, and I haven't found the time to work on either.

<dd>Yes, I think they put obstacles in the way of the cultural centre courses for foreigners in Arabic, but otherwise the cultural centres are booming. My course is really for Syrians learning French, so I'm in the clear! <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 10:40, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Funnily enough, now that the cultural centre course have closed down, the fee for levels seven and eight in the university has gone up to $400 for a one month course (compared with $140 for two months in 2001).

<p>Hi Arre, I understand your point of view, however, I feel that it would be right to revert to the version I edited. Your original text was: <i>"In the early seventies, the mounting discontent spread to the army, and King Hassan survived two assassination attempts. The first, in 1971, was organized by army cadets. In 1972, during a second attempted at a coup d'etat, jets from the Royal Moroccan Air Force fired upon the King's plane while he was traveling back to Rabat, but did not bring it down. After this, tensions slowly cooled down, aided by the king's newfound nationalist credentials in claiming Western Sahara in 1975."</i></p>
<p>My last contribution, in which I agree I should have mentioned the sources, was this: <i>The first, in 1971, was organized by high-ranking officers, leading army cadets who believed were going for military exercises. The Edit summary was: According to testimonials by some of the Tazmamart survivors released in the 90s, the army cadets did not know where they were going to, except that it'd be for military excercises using real bullets.</i></p>
<p>The sources are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ahmed Marzouki, "Tazmamart, Cellule 10," <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 2-07-041991-6</a> (former prisonners accounts, this book contains statements and extracts of speeches (kind of short though) made by defense attorneys during the infamous trials where the innocents got 3 years and more of imprisonment. statements that proved their innocence, good faith and ignorance).</li>
<li>Tahar Ben Jelloun, "This blinding absence of light", I do not have the ISBN number nearby (will add it later - book based on former prisonner account)</li>
<li>Christine Daure-Serfaty, "Tazmamart" (She was the first to bring this to the world's attention, I am preparing a bio on her and her husband, if you're interested)</li>
<li>Gilles Perrault "Our Friend, the King" (who was tipped by Christine D-S).</li>
<li>Amnesty International "Middle East/North Africa: Day of the "disappeared" - Time to tell the whole truth" (AI Index MDE 01/006/2001 - News Service Nr. 152).</li>
<li>Amnesty Inernational "Morocco: the "disappeared" reappear", Chapter C-6 on accounts of some former prisoners who managed to flee the country and speak abou their experience. (AI Index: MDE 29/005/1993).</li>
</ul>
<p>I should have added that if tensions calmed down, it wasn't really because of the Western Sahara claiming, but rather because people were disappearing, those left were scared, others were arrested, tortured and some were killed. Even today, people are still missing and those who may know their whereabouts are still scared to speak up, even though, officially, the <b>"years of lead"</b> are a thing of the past. For reference and additional information on moroccan prison conditions, torture, death, disappearances etc can be found in Amnesty International's website. I don't want to list all the books, reports, studies as the list is huge.</p>
<p>(Just one question though that I always had in the back of my mind that I'd like to share with you: How could cadets who mostly came from poor families, were happy as they not only had a roof, food, job, but also could provide for their families, cadets who didn't read Marx or anything of that sort, cadets whose lives were to follow order and discipline, could plan such a coup d'etat, and make their superior officers obey their orders in order to rule the country? For students who were still in their first years of school, be such masterminds who could outsmart national security offices, police and the army information service?... weren't they just victims used as examples of <i>justice</i>? food for thought, I think.) So I strongly believe that they deserve to have their honor and dignity back. At least with one sentence. If you believe this is bias, then disregard the whole thing, if you understand my point of view and accept the sources cited above as reliable, then please revert to my version.</p>

<dd>Hi Arre, thanks for your reply. I understand, but since no one unfortunately can get access to the court documents without "consequences", it would be hard to support their claims. I thought that the references like amnesty's..., would be credible enough for you but for an unknown reason you just dismissed them. Thanks anyways for taking the time to read my comment and to reply. I must say that, in one way, not giving them the benefit of the doubt is just like perpetuating the injustice and giving more credit to the system that crushed them for at least 18 years, if not killed them. Well, now it's my turn: I do believe that you cannot also claim that they were the ones who organized it. Do you have any substantial proof other than the "Government's" (and we all know who was the Government at that time...) claim that they did organize the whole thing? What are your sources? If you don't have any that can support your statement, then don't add my comment and don't add yours as well. Because if it's accuracy that you're looking for, then you should say that they carried out the project but you cannot be 100% sure that they were the organizers. This would be fair, as you will be reporting facts and not play the role of a judge, in my humble opinion. I hope you don't mind my asking and my comments.

<dd>Hi there, yes I do feel strongly about it for many different reasons. I could be very opiniated sometimes, but then I think it's something genetic somehow, people from the mountains can be sometimes very stubborn and opiniated... :-) But we do know when to admit others could be right as well! So I will re-write that part, to make it sound more of another possibility rather than the revealed truth. That made me laugh for more than 5 minutes and I'm still holding a laughter right now. My intention was never to show it that way, but I read again what I wrote and yes, it does sound like revelation came upon me and we all know what happened next, don't we? :-) My sincere apologies for that!!! And as you said we are not really disagreeing it's just that even if some may have known what was going on, it doesn't make all of them accomplices of the fact and some of them actually never shot a bullet that day.So the way it is now, it makes them the masterminds and the bloodthirsty evils who wanted to overthrow the "white sheep" and that was what I consider as unfair to them. Anyway, thanks for the discussion. Will rephrase the comment and send it to you so we both agree before and then replace the contentious part in the article! How about that?

<p>Well done. That's an excellent start, indeed, it's already a pretty good article. I'll have a look at one or two details shortly (i.e., hopefully before next March). Well done, also, on expanding the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Nationalism_7f8d.html" title="Palestinian Nationalism">Palestinian Nationalism</a> page; I still have that in mind for a complete rewrite and I'm rereading Khalidi's book with that in mind, but I also want to lay may hands on Yehoshua Porath's work on the subject, which I have yet to read.</p>
<p>Regarding Syrian nationalism, can it be said to exist as a political tendency any more outside the SSNP? Are there any other representatives of it (e.g. prominent writers or intellectuals)? I'm not aware of any, myself.</p>

<dd>Fair enough. I don't know if I'll still be in Syria then, but if I am that'd be cool. I think I may be tempering down my involvement in Wikipedia for a while, anyway, after various annoyances.

<p>Hi Arre, you have been blindly reverting the edits made by many editors in the obvious aim to create an edit-war on the Morocco-WS articles. In the process of reverting, you are reverting things you added yourself. If you think that in doing so try to give the impression that Koavf's block did not change to the situation on Morocco/WS articles you are wrong on two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>There have been tens of editors adding and removing edits without the single trouble. You are the only one creating the trouble.</li>
<li>Edit-warring instead of discussing is something that you should be avoiding. The community will not tolerate it and your case should sooner or later be taken to the ANI. --<a href="../../../a/_/j/User%7EA_Jalil_1957.html" title="User:A Jalil">A Jalil</a> 13:37, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Oh stop it. I have not been "blindly" reverting anything, I have been reverting some rather stark POV edits, a few by you and a few by Wikima -- you should equally well consider why it is only Wikipedia's most committed Moroccan-nationalist editors that tend to have problems on these articles... Most of my WP-time has been spent working on Algerian and Mauritanian subjects, not on Morocco-Western Sahara, and thus outside of your scope of interest. Interestingly, I haven't had any conflicts there. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 16:03, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You will have trouble on Algeria articles with who??. If you were not rewarded during your stay in Algeria for what you do for Algeria and against Morocco, the Algerian authorities would not have been nice to you. You are blindly reverting, yes that's true.
<ul>
<li>Allal El-fassi is a poet and a writter, and the article states that he has published poems, but you revert it in contradiction to what is in the article. Is not that blindly reverting?.</li>
<li>You admit that France has annexed territories from Morocco to Algeria (the Algerians admit it and don't deny it, but they hide behind "the intangibility of the frontiers inherited from Colonializm"), but you refuse the correct terminolgy in the article and insist on "that he viewed as ...". No we all, even the algerians view it like that. Is not that blindly reverting and contradiction?.--<a href="../../../a/_/j/User%7EA_Jalil_1957.html" title="User:A Jalil">A Jalil</a> 13:38, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>(1) Feel free to put the poetry back into <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allal_al-Fassi_ab84.html" title="Allal al-Fassi">Allal al-Fassi</a>, for, as I think you know: that was not what I objected to in your edit. It had something to do with borders and whitewashing dictatorship: look and you shall find.</li>
<li>(2) As for Algerian borders, there are certainly differences of opinion as to exactly which areas and demarcation lines this would imply. Again, hardly the big issue.</li>
<li>(3) Algeria articles: There <i>could</i> be problems with nationalist conspiracy nutcases on Algeria articles too, but there aren't. Or, actually, there was once, with some rabidly aggressive anti-Berber guy. I'm sure you two would've gotten along fine -- you have the same, <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, style, perhaps, of editing.</li>
<li>(4) As for me being the Algerian government's paid agent on Wikipedia, it's actually the <a href="../../../e/l/d/Elders_of_Zion_f526.html" title="Elders of Zion">Elders of Zion</a> who pay me, but good guess.</li>

<dd>I am impressed!!. You write in Swedish, and that should be the proof you are a Swede. Actually an Algerian living in Sweden fits well in your shoes. Speaks Arabic, French, and of course swedish. By the way, there in nothing wrong in being Algerian, there are so many similarities with the Moroccans. The dialect spoken in the two countries for ex. is almost identical.
<ul>
<li>In the point number 1, you confirm that you were blindly reverting. That's right?</li>
<li>Point number 2 shows that you want to introduce empty arguing about things quite obvious and recognized by all parties.</li>
<li>Point number 3 shows that you are also a guard to the algerian articles from Vandalism and any other extreme opinions. Berber related extremiste edits are more often on Morocco articles than in any other place.</li>
<li>Point 4 shows in you something I have seen before in your edits: throwing on oponents the accusation of "The theory of conspiracy". I did not say you are hired or paid by the algerian gov., but that you deserve to be rewarded for what you do for Algeria and against Morocco.</li>

<p>hi, i was just wondering - there's a never-ending battle going on over at greater morocco (i think you can guess the outlines of it), and it would be good if you wanted to take a look at it. you're moroccan, know the subject and i've always found you to be a very fair editor.</p>
<p>there's <a href="../../../g/r/e/Talk%7EGreater_Morocco_9c66.html#Request_for_Comments" title="Talk:Greater Morocco">a longer presentation</a> of this on the talk page, but in short, the dispute concerns two competing versions of the page, one of which is a drastically shortened version of the other. i want the original back, since it's frankly so much better, and i'm perfectly willing to have it edited further afterwards to make everyone happy. but i'm reverted every time i try to restore it. i've already tried a RfC, but to no use.</p>
<p>any input is welcome, whether you agree with my position or not, to help move this forward. i'll also ask <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Tyers_a973.html" title="User:Francis Tyers">Francis Tyers</a> to have a look at it, since he's been involved in these issues too. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArre_fee4.html" title="User:Arre">Arre</a> 02:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Arre. I've been watching the edit warring going on at a couple of Morocco/WS related articles. I really think i am fed up w/ all the fuss especially that that led to an indef block of Justin.</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless, i think that both versions are everything but contextual. No context is offered. I do, however, see the <i>Pre-colonial situation</i> and <i>Allal El Fassi and Istiqlal</i> sections as a good background but relating all of this background to every political or military conflict in the region is erroneous. This doesn't mean that the version defended by Wikima and Jalil is the best one.</dd>
<dd>Another problem w/ both versions is that they employ one source per version. Both versions are clearly missing this important point.</dd>
<dd>In brief, the main focusal point should be Allal El-Fassi and the ideolgy of the Istiqlal party just after Morocco's independence. As a Moroccan, let me assure you Arre that only few Moroccans know about <i>greater Morocco</i>. I suggest a total rewrite and that should come out from the discussion page. I have no problems at all in participating in the discussion if you, wikima and Jalil would agree w/ a fresh new version. The participation of Francis and collounsbury would be a good thing as well. Cheers mate. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">FayssalF</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: gold"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 15:00, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
