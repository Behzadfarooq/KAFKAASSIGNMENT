<p>Does anyone think Arseus has some sort of relation to <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mew.html" title="Mew">Mew</a>? -- Lord Crayak</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, no more than is needed by the fact that Arseus created the world, and presumably Mew.

<p>I'm sorry but that is only a legend according to "Pokemon Legends". The strength of Arseus is great in the game, but its background story is just exaggerated like most Pokemon. Hence, it doesn't necessarily mean that Arseus created the world or is the most powerful Pokemon since Mew and Mewtwo are widely excepted as the most powerful Pokemon. In addition, clearer information will be provided about Arseues in the 10th movie. It will distinctly provides facts and clear any myths about it. Furthermore, Mew has no connection to Arseus, but since it contains the DNA of all Pokemon, it may have its abilities.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.12.0.140 (<a href="../../../7/4/2E/User_talk%7E74.12.0.140.html" title="User talk:74.12.0.140">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.12.0.140_c4b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.12.0.140">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I don't beleive you should doupt Arseus for a second! I beleive that Arseus is the Ultimate God of all PKM, but what I dont Understand is y would they make Arseus availible in the first two games and not the game that completes the first two games. If Mew contains the DNA of all the pokemon and Arseus is said to have given some of his power to Mew then isn't it possible that some of Arseus DNA might have been in that power? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Arguntom (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Arguntom_4755.html" title="Special:Contributions/Arguntom">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Maybe Arseus created Mew right after it was born and then it created 3 more Mew's which became those three mew like pokemon from Shinnouh of hope, dream and wisdom that embody the essence of life and then 2 more Mew's were created and they became the pokemon of time and space, and maybe after they created time and space Celebi was born and then Ho-oh, and Lugia, and then, Rayquaza, Kyogre and Groudon, and then Deoxis, and finally Ditto which led to basic evolution; BUT! where does that leave the <a href="../../../u/n/o/Unown.html" title="Unown">Unown</a>?????</dd>

<p>I just wanted to suggest the possibility that the name Arseus could be a portmanteau of the latin words Ars (art / technique), and Deus (God). I realize this is original research which is why I did not want to edit into the page just yet, but the possibility seems strong considering Arseus' role as the creator pokemon.

<dd>Cool! Very smart! I think it may be a good idea to add it into the article. I don't think Zues is a part of the name, but a word that means "god"? I think that is much more likely.

<dd>"Zeus" is actually very possible; in Japanese, Zeus is written "Zeusu" (not something like "Zuusu"...the Japanese are weird with ancient Greek), and "seusu" IS in Arseus's name (see <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rendaku.html" title="Rendaku">rendaku</a> for why "z" and "s" are somewhat interchangeable).

<p>I have my own idea as to the origin of the name of arseus. Perhaps its comes from the word arch and deus. arch means high,and deus means god. It could refer to the fact that there are other gods in pokemon(such the psychic trio)and is the highest god of them all. Also, it could be a reference to the christian god, since being the highest god, it could be called the god of gods, and the christian god is often given titles such as the king of kings or lord of lords.

<p>This could be the last gen. for pokemon. Areus is the god pokemon and made time and space. It is also the most powerful pokemon. Think about it. This is the last pokemon in the Shinou Region and is the strongst. It could have created pokemon. It is possible that this is the last one.</p>

<p>Satoshi might have had plans for about 1,000 pokemon but he may quit. When did he say that? If it was when Pokemon Red and Blue were out then he might think that that was to much. Yes of course he will continue but there is a possibility for the end. If he was going to make 1,000 pokemon then why would he make one that created space and time??? Even pokemon!!! Satoshi should have created it either at the beggining of pokemon or at the last game.</p>

<dd>For one, Aruseus is among the Ubers. But it's nowhere near being <i>the</i> Uber pokemon. Consider it a slightly weaker Alakazam with higher defenses, or a slightly less-sturdy <a href="../../../y/o/n/Yonoir.html" title="Yonoir">Yonoir</a> with higher offenses, or possibly even a slower Ninjask with better all-around stats. The straight 120s make it extremely flexible, but it also inhibits it from being as potentially useful as, say, a sweeping Groudon, or a tanking Lugia.

<dd>i don't think that DanPMK should be so sure of himself, my first reaction would be that someone merely recolored a sprite, indeed it would be easy to do for Arseus because the rest of it is white and when you apply hue changes to an image, white and black are unaffected. I could make a GIF that has Arseus go through all it's colors and then upload it saying it's a RAINBOW-type Arseus. 9/10 times when it's seems weird it's a hoax -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 17:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. You guys appear to be partly right. The sprite is, indeed, ripped from the game, and is not actually Arseus with the Larva Plate attached. Furthermore, it's not a recoloring, as I had suspected, but not voiced. On the other hand, I highly doubt that this sprite is of a&#160;???-type Arseus. The reasons? There is a shiny form of it, making this Arseus the only Pokémon with an alternate form aside from a shiny form (and apparently this form of Arseus also has a shiny form). My second reason for doubting a&#160;???-type Arseus, is because the&#160;??? type has never been used for attacks (aside from a status inducing/set damage inflicting one), and as a result, has no type matchups, meaning that we have no idea what type the&#160;??? type is super effective against, not very effective against, or weak to.

<dd>... This just occurred to me. Seeing as Arseus is a legendary Pokémon, this possibility didn't cross my mind earlier. Could this be the male/female sprite of Arseus (because, of course, we didn't consider that the sprite we usually associate with the normal Arseus could be the male/female sprite), and, perhaps, the sprites are the same for the plate forms? I'm aware that none of the true legendaries have ever had genders, but maybe this time... -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_M.P._57d5.html" title="User:The M.P.">The M.P.</a> 20:00, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>erm... I don't believe <i>anyone</i> ever said "shiny&#160;???-type makes no sense". At least I didn't.

<dd>It would make sense that even though you can't GET a&#160;??? type Arseus, they'd still have to make a sprite for it as the&#160;??? type is still coded into the game, it isn't obtainable without a Gameshark I presume, and then it would probably not have weaknesses OR resistances... yeah, I'm through.

<p>According to Serebii. net, Arceus actually is a normal type, but when given a plate such as the Larva plate mentioned earlier, it changes its type, (for example, when Arceus is given a Larva plate, it changes into a bug-type, and so on.)although whether this is true is debatable.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Earth205 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Earth205_ca03.html" title="Special:Contributions/Earth205">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Ahem... I did some research. It appears that in Pokémon G/S/C, the first game that the&#160;??? type appeared in, of course, the&#160;??? type was, in fact, programmed as a possible <i>attack</i> type (obviously). Now to my point -- the developers neglected to program the&#160;??? type as a <i>Pokémon</i> type. I would assume that this would be the same for Pokémon D/P. If there does happen to be a&#160;??? type Pokémon type in D/P, though, we'd be seeing either no type matchups whatsoever, or a glitch. I, for one, am still not convinced that there is a&#160;??? type Arceus (yes, people. Please call it Arceus, the U.S. name). If the&#160;??? type was intentionally included in the games, it would defeat the purpose of Judgement Pebble because the&#160;??? type has no type matchups. If it wasn't intentionally put in the game, well, we wouldn't have this sprite of the alleged&#160;???-type Arceus. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_M.P._57d5.html" title="User:The M.P.">The M.P.</a> 23:32, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sweetie, sorry to burst your bubble, but "Arceus" has yet to be confirmed. Until someone is able to prove that it is the official English name, it will be the new users who look ignorant, not the person or people who locked the page.

<dl>
<dd>Please don't write in a provocative manner. I've not the patience for it. Anyhow, the name "Arseus" was an early name misunderstanding, and it is now understood (by <i>some</i>, at least) that "Arceus" is the official U.S. name. Furthermore, would you care to cite a reliable source that directly or indirectly states that the name of our Pokémon here is "Arseus", or are you accepting Wikipedia as a reliable source, which obviously is not? To continue, how can rules that you make up apply to Wikipedia? serebii.net and other fansites (depending on the reliability of these sites, of course) can and do "count as an actual source." If several fansites known to be reliable in the past support consistent material, they simply must be trusted. Building on that, I'm sure you'd be happy to know that I've found several reliable sites supporting my "claim", if you will. See the following: <a href="http://www.psypokes.com/dex/psydex/493" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.psypokes.com/dex/psydex/493" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://www.veekun.com/dex/pokemon/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.veekun.com/dex/pokemon/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.pokecharms.com/webdex/?No=493" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pokecharms.com/webdex/?No=493" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and <a href="http://serebii.net/pokedex-dp/493.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://serebii.net/pokedex-dp/493.shtml" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Not to mention bulbapedia.net also acknowledges arceus' name as "arceus", although even I wouldn't count bulbapedia.net as a particularly reliable source. Now that you've seen the evidence, you can't just blow it off because they're fansites and continue to be ignorant, can you? I'd like to see your answer. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_M.P._57d5.html" title="User:The M.P.">The M.P.</a> 23:04, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Yes, Jeske Couriano brings up a good point. They are only fansites created by fans and are not in collaboration with Nintendo. Unless Pokemon.com states that "Arceus" is the actual, official English name, it cannot and should not be placed in the article. There simply is no proof. If its announced as official, fine. Then you were right. But at the very least, you should acknowledge the fact that we Wikipedians that are part of the Pokémon Collaborative Project are following the rules that apply to editing articles. Is that truly being ignorant? I don't believe it is; we all know that the name was leaked to several fansites and no one denies that, but the fact of the matter is, sweetie, that there's no solid evidence besides those rumors that the names are real for any of the 4th Generation Pokémon. So calm down and be kinder and more respectful to others. We are only trying to make this and several other articles as accurate as possible. So don't you go around calling anyone but yourself ignorant. And also: "Please don't write in a provocative manner"? What in the world are you referring to? "Sweetie" and "Honey"? That's simply how I speak and it just so happens that is how I type and write to others as well.
