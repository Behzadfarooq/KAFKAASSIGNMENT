<p><b>Ars Magica</b> is a <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing game</a> set in <i><a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythic_Europe_967b.html" title="Mythic Europe">Mythic Europe</a></i>, an idealized (or quasi-historical) version of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> around <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">AD 1200</a>. The game revolves around <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28paranormal%29.html" title="Magic (paranormal)">magic</a>-using <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magician_%28fantasy%29.html" title="Magician (fantasy)">wizards</a> and their allies. The game was originally developed by <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Tweet_75b5.html" title="Jonathan Tweet">Jonathan Tweet</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Rein%C2%B7Hagen_f024.html" title="Mark Rein路Hagen">Mark Rein路Hagen</a> in the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>.</p>
<p>Ars Magica was one of the first examples of a <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troupe_system.html" title="Troupe system">Troupe system</a>: early editions recommended that the players collaborate to create the campaign world and story. Each player would have an opportunity to be the <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_master.html" title="Game master">Story Guide</a>, and each player would have more than one character, so that if they felt their main character would not go on an adventure (for example, if they were busy with their research) a secondary character may be used. Troupe play has been de-emphasised in recent editions, however, and in the latest (5th) edition of the game is relegated to an optional play style described at the back of the book. Many "troupes" opt for a more traditional system with a single story guide, or have one player be the "Alpha" story guide with responsibility for the overall plot, and a few "Beta" story guides who run side-adventures.</p>
<p>In order to get an "authentic" feel from having such a historical setting, the game uses <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval_Latin_5ed0.html" title="Medieval Latin">medieval Latin</a> for a number of key terms.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars_Magica_becc.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The first two editions were published by Lion Rampant games. In the early 1990s, rights to Ars Magica were acquired by <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Wolf%2C_Inc._c6d4.html" title="White Wolf, Inc.">White Wolf Game Studio</a>, a company that Rein-Hagen had founded. White Wolf published the 3rd edition, which greatly expanded the settings and peripheral rules while leaving the core system intact. White Wolf also published many supplements, detailing specific regions of Europe, or outlining stories that could be played in the original setting. Ars Magica was later sold to <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizards_of_the_Coast_1d36.html" title="Wizards of the Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a>, who produced several supplements, but just before publishing a 4th edition sold the rights to <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas_Games_%28company%29_51d6.html" title="Atlas Games (company)">Atlas Games</a>. Atlas published the fourth edition and has published new source-books since.</p>
<p>The 5th edition was released by Atlas in 2004, including extensive changes to the system, especially the combat system and character creation. Many players feel that the alterations to the combat system were long overdue, especially the rules for armour (which in previous editions simply made wearers much more likely to die in combat). Ars Magica 5th edition won the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origins_Award_daaf.html" title="Origins Award">Origins Award</a> for <i>Best Role Playing Game of 2004</i>.</p>
<p>Many characteristics of the later <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storyteller_system.html" title="Storyteller system">Storyteller system</a> developed by White Wolf can be traced to Ars Magica (and the fact that both Ars Magica and the Storyteller system were both developed by the same person); White Wolf's <a href="../../../t/h/e/Mage%7E_The_Ascension_a328.html" title="Mage: The Ascension">Mage: The Ascension</a> was envisioned as "Ars Magica in the Modern World," and many of the changes in Ars Magica's 3rd edition were introduced in order to make the game-worlds more compatible.<sup id="_ref-reason_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reason" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a name="Setting" id="Setting"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars_Magica_becc.html" title="Edit section: Setting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Setting</span></h2>
<p>The setting, <b>Mythic Europe</b>, is based on Europe of the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th century</a>; the geography is the same, and the mundane (non-magical) politics are practically identical. However, the "Medieval <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paradigm.html" title="Paradigm">paradigm</a>"<sup id="_ref-paradigm_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-paradigm" title="">[2]</a></sup> - the collection of folk beliefs and superstitions - is correct; children are abducted by Faeries, and the mountains are home to dragons. In 3rd edition, to tie the game into the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Darkness_c98c.html" title="World of Darkness">World of Darkness</a> line, this was the case <i>because</i> those were the beliefs; other editions distance themselves from this interpretation, simply taking place in a world where those beliefs happen to be true<sup id="_ref-reason_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reason" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/l/a/Player_character.html" title="Player character">Player characters</a> take on the role of both a <b><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magus.html" title="Magus">Magus</a></b> (or if female, <b>Maga</b>), and of a <b>Companion</b>, otherwise called "Consors". Companions are select skilled non-magi (warriors, foresters, castellan, and so forth) who help wizards conducting their affairs, as Magi tend to be distanced from "mundanes" due to their study of magic. Additionally, there are a number of <b>Grogs</b> (skilled peasants) who can be controlled by any player. The wizards live clustered in specific citadels (called Covenants), which are often built in places of power. Covenants are the home base for the <i>Magi</i> (plural for Magus), but the magi tend to roam the Magical Europe for their adventures. Some sources for the game consider the <i>covenant</i> to be the central character of the game<sup id="_ref-cov_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cov" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p><a name="The_Order_of_Hermes" id="The_Order_of_Hermes"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars_Magica_becc.html" title="Edit section: The Order of Hermes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Order of Hermes</span></h3>
<dl>
<dd>
<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Hermes_%28Ars_Magica%29_6eba.html" title="Order of Hermes (Ars Magica)">Order of Hermes (Ars Magica)</a></i></div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Magi belong to one of the houses of the <b>Order of Hermes</b>, a society founded by the wizard Bonisagus (who created a consistent way to describe magic), allows Magi to share information, and the <i>Parma Magica</i>, a magical shield which allows Magi to trust one another (somewhat). Magi from outside the order must join or die, though the Order doesn't insist that magi present both options.</p>
<p>The Order is divided into <i>Tribunals</i>, which each administer a large country-sized region of Mythic Europe. Once every seven years, the magi within a Tribunal stage a meeting, also called a Tribunal, where new magi are presented to the order and the Qu忙itores judge disputes which cannot be resolved within or between covenants. Once every 33 years, each Tribunal sends a representative to a <i>Grand Tribunal</i>.</p>
<p>Each of the thirteen <i>Tribunals</i> corresponds to a set of modern countries. Each tribunal has a distinct cultural and historical flavor which affects play. For example the Roman tribunal is a densely populated area with a shortage of magical resources but offers high political plots while Novgorod is a hostile environment where barbarian invaders and magical beasts can be a recurrent problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater Alpes - Alpes, mostly modern Switzerland and Austria</li>
<li>Iberian - Iberian peninsula, Spain and Portugal</li>
<li>Normandy - North of France</li>
<li>Proven莽al - South of France</li>
<li>Roman - Italy</li>
<li>Theban - Greece, Bulgaria, and Western Turkey</li>
<li>Transylvania - South-Eastern Europe</li>
<li>Rhine - Rhine river, Most of central Germany</li>
<li>Novgorod - East Europe, Poland and Russia</li>
<li>Stonehenge - England and Wales</li>
<li>Loch Leglean - Scotland</li>
<li>Hibernian - Ireland</li>
<li>Levantine - Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and South-Eastern Turkey</li>
</ul>
<p>Like any Middle Ages border the Tribunals area are not definitive.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars_Magica_becc.html" title="Edit section: Realms of Power">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Realms of Power</span></h3>
<p>Four "realms of power" influence Mythic Europe:</p>
<dl>
<dt>The <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divinity.html" title="Divinity">Divine</a> realm</dt>
<dd>The <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> of the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abrahamic_religion.html" title="Abrahamic religion">Abrahamic religions</a> and His agents in the world. The Divine realm is opposed to magic (see <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_on_witchcraft.html" title="Christian views on witchcraft">Christian views on witchcraft</a>), and magic is weaker in areas where the Divine is stronger (in cities and around churches); yet, the Gift is part of a Mage's soul, and therefore a gift from the Divine.</dd>
<dt>The <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">Infernal</a> realm</dt>
<dd><a href="../../../s/a/t/Satan.html" title="Satan">Satan</a> and his minions. In the medieval context, this includes everything from Satan himself to illnesses and bad smells. Demons tempt the faithful to sin, and while the Order of Hermes refuses to explicitly name the Infernal as their enemies (which could provoke their anger) their laws state that they can "never be allies". Magic is weak where the Infernal is strong, though infernally-tainted magics do exist, and are usually of great power, in order to tempt magi. Any Magus found guilty of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diabolism.html" title="Diabolism">diabolism</a> is expelled from the order and hunted down.</dd>
<dt>The <a href="../../../f/a/e/Faerie.html" title="Faerie">Faerie</a> realm</dt>
<dd>Creatures of traditional <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairy_tales.html" title="Fairy tales">fairy tales</a>; the <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seelie.html" title="Seelie">Seelie</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/s/Unseelie.html" title="Unseelie">Unseelie</a> courts. These creatures are capricious and often malicious; however, their study can be rewarding, since magic is strengthened somewhat in faerie areas. Magi are allowed to ally with the Faeries, as long as they do not incur their wrath and thereby bring their fellows into danger.</dd>
<dt>The realm of Magic</dt>
<dd>A mysterious and largely unexplained force in the world, which the Magi manipulate to create their spells.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Additionally, a "Realm of Reason" appeared in the 3rd edition, Reason was associated with scepticism and scholarship, and its "rational" aura alleviated the effects of the other four realms. Many fans of the game consider this to be paradoxical and inconsistent, since applying "reason" and rationality to the world of <i>Ars Magica</i> should really lead to the conclusion that magic exists and fairies are real, and yet the "True Reason" promoted by the realm of Reason claimed the opposite, and thus resembled a delusional state of mind rather than a rational one.<sup id="_ref-reason2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-reason2" title="">[4]</a></sup> The realm of Reason had additional counter-intuitive effects - for example, imposing penalties on wizard's magic use in libraries, despite the consistent portrayal of wizardry in <i>Ars Magica</i> as a scholarly pursuit.</p>
<p>Reason proved a highly controversial addition to the game, and was perceived as part of an attempt by White Wolf to make Ars Magica the backstory for their <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Darkness_c98c.html" title="World of Darkness">World of Darkness</a> roleplaying games; neither the 4th nor the 5th edition of the games has included the realm of Reason, and all references to it have been stricken from the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canonical</a> setting.</p>
<p><a name="System" id="System"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/s/Ars_Magica_becc.html" title="Edit section: System">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">System</span></h2>
<p>The game system based on the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten-sided_die.html" title="Ten-sided die">d10</a>. When an action is performed, one of the character's eight <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attribute_%28role-playing_games%29.html" title="Attribute (role-playing games)">attibutes</a> is added to the relevant <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skill_%28role-playing_games%29.html" title="Skill (role-playing games)">skill</a>, and a d10 is rolled. If the action can only result in a simple success or failure, the die roll is added to the total; if there is opportunity for exceptional success, a roll of one is rerolled, and the result doubled; multiple ones lead to multiple doublings. If the action is performed under stressful situations, a zero is treated as a zero (rather than a ten), and one or more <b>botch dice</b> are rolled. If any of the botch dice show a zero, the character has <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_failure.html" title="Critical failure">botched</a> - failed in some disastrous way. Otherwise, the total is compared to the difficulty rating for the action, and the action succeeds if the total is equal to it or greater.</p>
<p>The focus of the game is the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28game%29.html" title="Magic (game)">magic system</a>. There are 15 <b>Arts</b> divided into 5 <b>Techniques</b> and 10 <b>Forms</b>. The Techniques are what one does and the Forms are the objects one does it to or with. This is sometimes called a "Verb/Noun" magic-system. The Arts are named in Latin.</p>
<p>The Techniques are named after the corresponding first-person singular present tense <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_mood.html" title="Grammatical mood">indicative</a> mood Latin verb.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Creo</i> is the technique that lets the Magus create from nothingness, or make something a better example of its kind.</li>
<li><i>Intellego</i> lets the Magus understand.</li>
<li><i>Muto</i> lets the Magus change the basic characteristics of something (give something capabilities not normally associated with its kind).</li>
<li><i>Perdo</i> lets the Magus destroy, deteriorate, make something age and other similar effects (essentially, making something a worse example of its kind).</li>
<li><i>Rego</i> lets the Magus control or manipulate something without affecting its basic characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Forms are named after the corresponding singular <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accusative_case.html" title="Accusative case">accusative</a> Latin noun.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Animal</i> is used for (multicellular) animals. Since bacteria were unknown in medieval times, illnesses are evil spirits, which come under <i>Vim</i>.</li>
<li><i>Auram</i> is used for anything that has to do with the air, including lightning.</li>
<li><i>Aquam</i> is used for water, or any other liquid. Strictly, this excludes ice (which is solid and therefore <i>Terram</i>) but most players ignore this.</li>
<li><i>Corpus</i> (the incorrect declension <i>Corporem</i> was used in older editions) is used for the human body.</li>
<li><i>Herbam</i> is used for plants and fungi.</li>
<li><i>Ignem</i> is used for fire, and fire's basic effects of light and heat.</li>
<li><i>Imaginem</i> deals with senses and perceptions.</li>
<li><i>Mentem</i> deals with intelligence and the mind, either human or ghosts. Angels are not affected by magic, and demons and faeries react unpredictably. The minds of animals are not affected by <i>Mentem</i> but by <i>Animal</i>.</li>
<li><i>Terram</i> stands for earth and minerals, or any other non-living solid.</li>
<li><i>Vim</i> has to do with pure magic, but many spells to ban or control demons also belong to this realm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, <i>Creo Ignem</i> spells create fire (and the normal effects of fire, such as heat or light);. a <i>Perdo Ignem</i> spell may drop the temperature in a room. A typical <i>Perdo Imaginem</i> spell is granting invisibility to the caster by making one's image disappear. <i>Rego Aquam</i> could turn water into an unusual, but natural form (e.g. creating a pillar of water), while <i>Muto Aquam</i> could turn change the nature of water into, for example, oil or wine. An <i>Intellego Mentem</i> spell may permit the caster to understand any language; and so on... A mage's skill when casting a spell is the sum of their scores in the appropriate technique and form.</p>
<p>If a spell involves more than one technique, or more than one form, this is known as a <b>requisite</b>; The lowest technique and form are used. For example, turning a person to stone would involve <i>Muto</i>, <i>Corpus</i> and <i>Terram</i>; The player would add the character's Muto score to the lower of their Corpus and Terram scores.</p>
<p>By combining these techniques and forms, the magi may achieve any effect and spontaneously cast a spell with that desired effect. However, there are often severe limits to the level of power a magi can generate by casting spontaneously, and so he may also choose to learn a spell with that desired effect.</p>
<p>Magic is treated in this game-system as a serious object of study: Magi are supposed to spend a long time in their laboratories, preparing new spells and potions, and increasing their knowledge of the Arts. The game system provides rules for magical research on a timescale of 3-month <b><a href="../../../s/e/a/Season.html" title="Season">seasons</a></b>.</p>
