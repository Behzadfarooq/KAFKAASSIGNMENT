<p>Hi! What a lovely way to jack up the edit counter! And me barely in Zzzzland!<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>There are a few of these FDR chats that are so important that we need the coverage here, IMHO.</dd>
<dd>If you disagree, I submit then the proper place to debate is on the talk with subsequent Vfd, etc. as the article matures.<br /></dd>
<dd>I have far too much other work hereon to care much one way or the other, but <b>I was shocked and amazed</b> when searching our whole data base a few nights back failed to turn up this famous phrase.</dd>
<dd>Besides, my interest is in adding material, not exporting historic events because there is another wiki inadequately cross-searchable giving some coverage. Thus the detailed beginnings of the historical climate before and behind... something many readers browsing might find interesting and continue on from <b>educationally</b>, our focus, N'est pas?<br />
In my opinion, this kind of tying article is one of our greatest advantages over printed encyclopedias and certainly follows in the spirit of <a href="../../../b/t/w/WP%7EBtw_b993.html" title="WP:Btw">WP:Btw</a>.</dd>
<dd>IMHO, such are doubly important as it's exactly the kind of presentation that gets one to read more, or so I hope to nefariously plot to educate millions. LOL!<br /></dd>
<dd>No matter, the search failure alone is a <b>rather serious shortcoming</b> considering how many hits it gets with the coresponding google search for same, and wikipedia was missing it's normal prominence therein. (Xposting to <strong class="selflink">Talk:Arsenal of Democracy</strong>)<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm a tad surprised you're unhappy with an article like this on our shared history. If we hadn't had this event, You in the UK would have lost before we got involved.<br />

<li>What is your problem, man? As you can see I have now removed any "improvement" tags I applied to the article. As long as you are happy to separate your article <b>about</b> the speech from the actual text <b>of</b> the speech, then I have no objection to the article as I left it. It seems a very good article. Note that you have mentioned others of his speeches which probably need links to Wikisource.</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't really have a problem, 'man', save perhaps needing to write something in the first place, as my WikiPlate is very full—but with the underconstruction template, and the very recent generation, think you might have waited a bit, or made comments to the talk before taking over and deleting the speech proper. The other edits are fine (e.g. I was aware of the date issue-and once I verified, would have cleaned that up), but you make it hard for the search engine to find the key phrase within the speech by not at least excerpting parts of it.</li>
<li>For the moment, I've put the corpus back as it stimulates cross thinking toward building the rest, especially the intro. I'm not a historian, but an reader of history with short <a href="../../../a/d/d/ADD_9eeb.html" title="ADD">ADD</a> driven memory, that needs a refresh now and then.</li>
<li>I tend to agree the full text is uneeded once the article gets <b>beyond draft stage</b>, which this clearly hasn't yet. I'd have been delighted to find you'd filled in the years blow by blow with appropo materials. My scope on wikiP ranges far and wide, <b>and I've no 'ownership' tendancies whatever</b> as many can attest, but do expect <i>a little leeway and basic courtesy</i> when <i>building something new</i>.</li>

<p>Arsenal of Democracy is <b>Not</b> prominent in this one: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2Barsenal+%2Bof+%2BDemocracy&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%2Barsenal+%2Bof+%2BDemocracy&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Admittedly, yours is the better search criteria</a>, but I'm an old fart that's still coming up to speed on Google. The equivilent "+arsenal +of +Democracy" on our search engine is where I was amazed and triggered. Don't you think it would be a good idea to anticipate the more unsophisticated searcher's needs? As one, I certainly do!</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's get some work done. Enough talk for now.</li>
<li>I lost 6-7 quality edits the other night in a browser lock-up, and this was but one redlink in that matter. I need to finish this up so I can continue the backtracking and reedits needed as part of that cleaning up that fiasco. I think I need to download another browser before loosing the history trail!</li>
<li>So, later, OK? Obviously we have somewhat different styles, and I know you've been out there somewhere as I've seen a lot of your edits before this and visited your user page. I'm still a relative newbie learning all the tricks of the trade. If we were all the same, the world would be a less interesting place, No?</li>

<p>0.&#160; &#160;(semi-trivial) I was unable to get span/div formatting (italics) to cover the whole text, if someone can fix my fumbling, that would be great!</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the guidelines regarding wikisource vs editorial lattitude. This new article and I would appreciate and answer on that, and a general comment or three on it's general - well, generalities on <strong class="selflink">Talk: Arsenal_of_Democracy</strong> . Content, style, usefullness, et. al. from all and sundry, curious and curiouser, etc. I figure to finish the bottom before <b>next weekend</b> (the 21st) and perhaps put it up for additional peer review at that time in the broader forum.</li>
<li>The key issues I've got in mind:
<ol>
<li>) What more should be covered in the intro section. (Add if you like!)</li>
<li>) Did the prelude sections read too long, or was the presentation interesting enough to keep (kids esp.) reading.</li>
<li>) What to do about the speech text itself;</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>a) Keep all vs.</dd>
<dd>b) what to excerpt and retain as attention getting hooks to enviegle the unwary reader into the full text, and</dd>
<dd>c) how will what is left balance against the remaining article.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I am assuming the 1941 section will be similar to the sections preceding the speech, and the last issue</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>&#160;&#160;4) is cites. In this case, it shouldn't need a lot, IMHO, as most of the presentation is WikiLinks to 'presumably well cited' articles. At the least it checks out against my <i>Crystalized Knowledge</i> as a lifelong reader of history! &lt;G&gt;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3. There is also the little niggle of what 'extraneous content' listed in the chronological sections should or shouldn't be kept. For example, what was going on in and about concentration camps was not widely known until after the war, yet the presentation here includes them as if they were major news stories. There are other similar matters, individual ship sinkings, etc., again which were probably not well known. So if anything is obviously in error philosophically (if I can mangle the meaning of that with your concurrence) that strikes anyone as a bad or unfair thing to list, please (ahem) speak up.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Miscellany:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm not terribly good at searching things out on the web, if someone could locate an audio clip on this, I think it would be a wonderful addition. It could be playing while <i>the free world tale of woes</i> is being purused.</li>
<li>There are a couple of other fireside chats mentioned in the chronologys, and advice on handling those (Yes, be assured, I'll evaluate them for a similar article if this concept proves advisable and desirable. I'm not sure all 30 deserve such treatment, but those were troubled times and many of them will.)</li>
<li>The question of Wikiquotes cross links comes to mind, depending what is kept here. There are a handful of other culturally dynamic phrases widely quoted from this speech that come to mind— at least when I read it each time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Later adds to requests from prior comments and edits...</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><font color="red">I put an inuse template on the article pending the suggestions here, and assuming a week for comments and suggestions.</font> <font color="blue">The invitation was to help me figure out what to do, not do it for me! &lt;G&gt; So 'Thanks Mel'! You are a class guy! (Mel well knows how bad I am at the little details)</font></li>
<li><font color="blue">As of the moment, I've reintroduced the speech in the article at the appropriate time, via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arsenal_of_Democracy&amp;diff=48645691&amp;oldid=48645572" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arsenal_of_Democracy&amp;diff=48645691&amp;oldid=48645572" rel="nofollow">link</a> so a reaction to these forms is now desired.</font></li>
<li><font color="blue">and due to the many copyedits by my good friend Mel Etitis, I would like to add a request now for feedback on the chronological presentation. One year is compressed vertically — and one is not. The original was not. &lt;G&gt;</font></li>
<li><font color="blue">I think the spaced out looks and reads much better, and I've now seen it in two different skins. So please advise, and advise where or how the chronology should be treated.</font></li>
<li><font color="blue">The 'suggestions consensus' so far seems to be evolve this into a text treatment overall, which raises the point-- <b>Chronology sections go where? subpage(s), discard totally, or what</b>? If I do that, it should certainly be outside article space as it will require a massive involvement and research. If so, what should I so with this? <b>Leave in place, or take it off line entirely?</b></font></li>

<p><font color="blue">I'm going to be honest. Roosevelt's speech itself is very interesting and article-worthy, but there isn't really much encyclopedic content <i>about the speech</i> in this article. I'm going to enumerate my suggestions below. (My numbers don't necessarily correspond to the numbers in the previous section.)</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font color="blue">The full timelines aren't really necessary in this article. It would probably be better to <b>summarize in paragraph format the events closely related to Roosevelt's speech</b> in a section titled "Historical background" or "Important events". Perhaps links to each year's article could be provided for those who want to see full timelines of key events. Example: <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">Full timeline of key events in 1939</a>.</font></li>
<li style="list-style: none"></li>
<li><font color="blue">The full text of the speech isn't necessary. That's what Wikisource is for. However, <b>important excerpts from the speech should be quoted, and their significance should be explained.</b></font></li>
<li><font color="blue"><b>Citing reliable sources is always helpful.</b> It greatly improves the reliability of our articles. I would suggest trying to find some reliable analyses of the effects of the speech. That could make the article more interesting and more reliable. Some biographies of Roosevelt might also have some useful information about the events leading up to the speech as well as the speech's results.</font></li>

<p><font color="blue">Don't mind, but currently the article is in awful shape.</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font color="blue">There's a temporary section title to lead which should never be there. If you are concerned about editing the whole article, you can pick any of the smallest section to edit. Then in the address bar, you can replace "action=edit&amp;section=n" with "...section=0". This will get you to display and edit only the lead. An article should not have a lead title in my opinion.</font></li>

<li><font color="blue">Have you realized how long the first sentence is. Break it into 3 sentences, if not 4. Its completely unreadable.</font></li>
<li><font color="blue">Choice of yellow is poor. Its very difficult for people to read text against such a bright background. Change it to something lighter, preferably a shade of gray.</font></li>
<li><font color="blue">Move all sister project links (wikisource, etc.) to the external links section.</font></li>
<li><font color="blue">Such a long timeline in list format without any mention how any of these events are related to the topic in concern is boring enough for me (In this, others may disagree). Can you make it in paragraph format and not a loose collection of events.</font></li>

<p><font color="blue">Hi there - thanks for the invitation for some feedback. Here’s some of my suggestions:</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">I have to echo some of the sentiments expressed above. It is not very clear what this article aims to convey, and I suspect what would be necessary is to narrow the scope a little bit. Some of the historical events should be relegated to other articles, and subsequently referenced from this page. In my mind, the article should focus solely on the speech that Roosevelt’s speech – its political, social, and economic impact, as well as the linguistic and aesthetic elements which were used to convey the president’s sentiments.</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">The article should contain some information and preliminaries about the speech – the speech writer, its duration, where it was broadcast, how much of the public knew about the speech. The reaction from the general public and the international community should be noted. The opening of the speech mentions “national security” – in what sense is this speech relevant to the world today? The article needs to establish its notability from a historical and context.</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">There are an exceptional number of literary devices and allusions used in the speech. Some of the imagery and personifications that Roosevelt invokes are particularly poignant. The article should mention why these themes were important at the time, and whether these have had any lasting impact on the American perception and understanding of concepts such as freedom, liberty, and democracy. The article should explain why the general public resonated with these themes.</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">Some comparisons between similar speeches made by other Roosevelt and other presidents should be made, or minimally referenced in the article. For example, part of the speech mentions</font></p>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue">’’… if the United States of America interfered with or blocked the expansion program of these three nations- a program aimed at world control—they would unite in ultimate action against the United States.”</font></dd>
</dl>
<p><font color="blue">In what sense was “world control” interpreted? Why was the terminology introduced, and how is this historically relevant? At which point did the United States perceive itself as being threatened, and how did this impact its international policies? Note that the speech also mentions mass enslavement in the subsequent paragraph. Why was this intensifier used?</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">The relevance of the Monroe Doctrine needs to be addressed – this is something which Roosevelt mentions as a partial justification for his reasoning. The article should also analyze the structure of the speech itself – for example, is it argumentative or persuasive? Which historians have taken which perspective? What are the current established commentaries regarding this speech?</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">It is particularly interesting that the speech mentions Ireland, Hawaii and the Azores. Perhaps a map of the world with these places indicated would be beneficial for the reader to see why these were mentioned. Under what context would mentioning Ireland help Roosevelt’s cause? Also, what American values are outlined the speech? These should be summarized – for example, one line mentions liberty, religion, and hope. The article should also mention what the perceived role of a democratic nation is – was this speech a turning point in American history?</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">Anyway, this should contain plenty of ideas for article improvement. Much of it can be written very neutrally if supported by various citations and references. I hope this helps! --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 20:34, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</font></p>

<p><font color="blue">Genrally I'm in agreement with much of the above; in fact I've already done some work on the article, removing the text of the talk, tidying the summary, etc. I've begun tidying the timeline, but here again I agree that it shouldn't really be here — a paragraph explaining the context of the talk should be enough.</font></p>

<p><font color="blue">The comments above show many good points, and I'm pretty much in line with TantalumTelluride. My main concerns are these:</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">- I'm afraid the list dominates too much space. It a good list, and very relevant elsewhere, but in this particular case, a few blocks of text highlighting the main points of the historical background would be enough. If a page exists listing the main events leading up to World War II (it must be around somewhere), a link should be added to it.</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">- The actual full text of the speech belongs in Wikisource, but important extracts of it should be quoted and commented. The commentary and analysis is the essential element in this article. Try finding information to highlight the key issues raised here. What is FDR's message? Why is he saying it? What is of interest for his audiences (the American people, Britain, Germany etc.)? Who is he actually addressing - the American people or Europe? How is the material presented? What does he expect will be the result - for the United States, for the world, and for himself? Does the speech benefit anybody, if so, who, how and why? Is he trying to save the world, guarantee a reelection or something different? Is he already thinking about the situation when the war will be over? E.g. the lend-lease agreement meant the U.S. replacing Britain as the leading naval power in the Western Hemisphere when Britain was pretty much forced into handing over a number of bases to the U.S. Well, I don't know. I'm also a bit curious if he wrote the text himself, or if a member of his staff did it.</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">- A link to the actual recording should be added. So far, I've found this page: <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~1930s2/Time/Marcy/fdrsenal.html" class="external free" title="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~1930s2/Time/Marcy/fdrsenal.html" rel="nofollow">http://xroads.virginia.edu/~1930s2/Time/Marcy/fdrsenal.html</a> (Real Player in a decent recording). The article should also link to Wikisource, but this has already been taken care of.</font></p>
<p><font color="blue">To sound a bit like one of my professors: Never lose sight of the "WH-words" (who, what, when, why etc.) Or the boiled-down version: "ask a question and answer it." I'm not trying to scare you, but trying to present a number of issues you should keep in mind when reading about the material.</font></p>

The whole is a very preliminary draft, and the best stab I could make when you started editing it. We've discussed some of that on your talk, so please don't ascribe motivations to me. I can do that myself, and am quite open about such.</font></li>
<li><font color="blue">Keep in mind that <b>I aknowledge that this should have been created off line</b>, and the intro (even newly changed) is <b>still just a stub</b>, IMHO. This <b>whole thing was a knee-jerk reaction</b> to <font color="red"><b>ugly redlinks,</b></font> then consequently pushed forward by <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a>'s jumping in objecting on behalf of WikiSource, etc.; and so I abandoned most of my PLANNED EDITS for the end of the week (where I have multiarticle projects coming out of the nose and ears), to get it into <i>somekind of shape</i>. This was just a start, needing further inspiration.</font></li>
<li><font color="blue">I'm inclined to pull it into user space given the scope of changes needed per the above, <b>so comments</b> as to whether that is <b>necessary</b> would be welcome, given the criticisms we all share, which I endorsed if not directly, <i>then by asking all of you here for input</i>. I HAD MY RESERVATONS, and share most of the above, even if I can't ennunciate them quite so well. OTOH, the ideas put forth are very good, and these have made this ad hoc appeal for input very gratifying.</font></li>

The 30s/early 40s isolationist stance of America, the lend-lease program, etc., would all be better addressed in separate articles about American policy related to WWII and perhaps linked to this article in a "See Also" section. The paragraph you have here:</font></font></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">In terms of leadership, the speech is frequently seen as the "next step" in a several stage process in awakening a somnolent, inward-looking country that had been isolationist and self-absorbed culturally for the preceding two decades. While the United States Navy seemed strong and was widely percieved to guarantee the Western Hemisphere safe from Axis agressions– the United States Army numbered barely two hundred and fifty thousand officers and enlisted men as the 1930s came to a close – the foreign wars off in Europe, Africa, and Manchuria (China) seemed of little importance to the average American still reeling from the horrors of the depression.</font></font></dd>

Two of the main commentators above have given me a whole new slant on it, as it were looking at it from the technical standpoint as a speech, as a work, as a finely crafted artifact of the mind, and or the persons behind it. I was quite surprised by that 'outside my box' thinking, but someone's education is certainly shining through— perhaps even brilliantly! I'm impressed, and humbled. I find myself thinking that way working with Mel at times, and the feeling is both thrilling and somewhat dismaying.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">My technical track and general language skills including an extremely high SAT score in English, and those allowed me to 'Advance Place' out of what are many normal liberal arts common experiences in language arts, including especially most course work where I had to write any 'term papers', or take courses where such analysis is taught— so some of that sort of analytical thinking is something I can follow if someone leads the way, but not necessarily come up with on my own—I simply lack the training focused instead on Moles, and Avagadro's number, and Fourier Transforms, integro-differential equations, and the odd bit of economics, which is where I ended up spending my 'AP' credits in the liberal arts— I still had to take X number of LA courses, but most of mine ended up as electives. I'd almost be embarrased to relate how few 'term type' papers I had to write in undergraduate college, as most all writing I did have to do involved Laboratory reports and the standard and format is to a far lower threshold than my friends plowing through the liberal arts courses one after the other.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Math, Engineering analysis just don't require anything like the papers routinely required of English, History, Economics, Communications, Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology, Philosophy, or such majors. After reading HappyCamper's suggestions in particular, and a couple of others following, I'm frankly not sure I should be one to write this article. I don't have the training! Yeah, I can sling words together and make adequate phrases, usually remember not to dangle my participles (whatever those are), and mostly avoid spelling errors, but while my passion and avocation is history, it is not my training. So I wonder whether this is really something I should take on at all.</font></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I mentioned several times above, that this thing just came at me out of the blue— the timeline is in essence, material we know through hindsight to be historically pertinent, or was then prominent in the news as headlines, and presumably on the minds of some segments of the population. As I copied it over from the pertinient wikiyears, I thought of it more as an outline of what might have been impacting people, and which should be background for the 'story behind the speech' from the historical events standpoint, as such, it as much a rough outline as much as anything else, though I did expand and elaborate and tie various things within it, it was also a great refresher in the sins of the aggressors as many such details are easy to forget in the hurly-burly of life. But I didn't like it either, it was just a way I started to organize what is obviously going to be a large effort.</font></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">As both versions of the quick and dirty introduction indicate, the real importance of the speech was the farsighted leadership evinced by FDR in that he managed to lever a self-focused people into one that would in the next 24-36 months totally shatter all records in production and training, so that by mid-1943 we could field new ships for the one's lost, were sending fleets of planes abroad in both directions, and starting counter-attacks in no less than three locals - McArthur's campaigns in New Guinea, Guadalcanal, and North Africa. At the same time we were barely holding on in the awful clash known as the Battle of the Atlatic, and industry somehow kept pace with all the sinkings. That's a remarkable turn around for a country that didn't even have a tank regiment in 1939! But to me, the brooding mood that should be the proper background theme is the din of the bad news from abroad going into the collective subconscious that was about to elect this man for his third time. The US citizens put their faith in him, and a few short weeks later, he turns around and delivers this wake-up call to the country.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">So that's the long version of where the timeline fits in. Don't focus on it, as much as the history within it. Except for a couple of culture highlights (e.g. Orson Wells, panicing the country), I merely took the snippets, gave them a source check in the linked article, examined them with some basic cross checking, and made sure I understood the significance and the context of each. Well, you don't have to be much smarter than a stump to realize that will take some time, and it did, and then I wasn't sure what might be done next. The answers are extremly interesing. <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 11:30, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

As such, I think this ought to be moved into a user subpage of the same title, preferably Sunday if you're working wiki, sooner or later if you aren't. That should give any late arrivals time, and based on the comments, it's going to take a lot of work and development going forward.

<dl>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I'd say the <b>resounding voice of the RFC</b> is that the article is in general not encyclopedic enough as written, and to evolve it in line with the suggestions will take a whole lot more time than I'm going to have anytime in the near future. My wikiTime is going to be a lot more constrained going forward. Among other things spring has arrived in New England, and the yard work and construction plans around here are going to take me out of the office as much as possible for the next several months.</font></font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Moving it also follows from the acknowledgement that I should have created it in a sandbox <i>in the first place</i> had I thought it through and planned it from the initial thought rather than having been acting in late night 'fatigued edit' mode spurred by my ADHD.</font></font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">To evolve it <b>in any one of the directions indicated</b> is going to require a whole series of major changes, performed incrementally over time as I nail down research elements (which also will entail at least skimming several FDR biographies—no small task there!), et. al. and having the Talk available with it seems the best course as the clear consensus seems to be that it is not ready for <b>prime time</b>.</font></font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I even indicated said thoughts (about moving it) when I annoted the <i>RFC (sic— this is</i> literally <i>the above talk page preceding this post; fab 060424) questions and concerns</i> list early last week, and specifically asked whether it should be kept as is, or moved, and not a single party has posted a note either way. Shrug.</font></font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Is there some policy or guideline I am missing about 'withdrawing it' for such an major overhaul? I have no desire to leave it hacked up and in pieces available to the world as I work through it, as it will certainly be a back-burner trial and error process and probably almost certainly entail false starts and reworks of entire sections if the major prelimary evolution is as I percieve it, my responsibility.</font></font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">As I annoted in my last bottom note therein, this will involve blowing off a lot of rust and a large learning curve for me, and the suggested evolutions 'thought-wise' are all outside my general training, which means an additional learning curve and more false starts, I imagine.</font></font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">In light of that litany, what do you advise? A formal <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfd_743f.html" title="WP:Afd">WP:Afd</a>? I'd have thought that <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> guideline under section <i>'Articles' criteria #3'</i>, as do perhaps also <i>'General Criteria' #2 and #7</i> — taken together would suggest this is permissible, and the best and allowable course in the <i>necessary iterim</i> all things considered. Agreed, the fact that some others yourself included have made some edits muddies the waters of the 'General Criteria #7', and I guess a strict interpretation of #2 doesn't strictly apply as this was a deliberate first attempt, but I don't see this as violating the spirit of such give the huge volume of work it needs.</font></font></dd>
