<p>I've just noticed that someone has previously removed the squad numbers of various minor players whose numbers I added earlier.

I'm not sure why the Arsenal website doesn't have these numbers listed, the players definitely have them as they have all played first team football this season, or at least been on the bench. Players have to have the same unique number for a whole season. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERje_9381.html" title="User:Rje">Rje</a> 00:11, Jan 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why did You remove the latest update of Arsenal F.C won The FA Cup?</span></h2>
<p>Why? Why? Are you Manchester United Fan? I demand that info about the latest glory development in history of Arsenal be put back and restored.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this was aimed at me- I removed the paragraph from the <i>introduction</i> to the article as it was unnecessary. The introduction is saved for basic information, not recent achievements. I hope you would notice that it was ME that added the achievement to the later sections of the article, AND when a bitter Utd fan removed it and claimed that Arsenal lost, I not only reverted it but I put a warning on his/her talk page. To answer your question, I find your suggestion that I am a Utd fan an insult, I support Liverpool- but this is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Your demand that the latest glory be put back into the introduction will be unmet, I am afraid. If you have any further questions please contact me on my talk page. - <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESars_71a4.html" title="User:Sars">sars</a> 17:49, May 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>I would like to apologise</b> to you if my comment about Man U Fan offend you. But I do believe that my comment was not directed at you, the section I mentioned is as follows: "Arsenal were crowned 2005 F.A. Cup Winners after beating Manchester United 5-4 on penalties when goalkeeper Jens Lehmann sprang to his right to push away Scholes' effort and Vieira's nerve of steel under pressure to put the ball in the top corner of the goal. Manchester United dominated the whole game and the Arsenal victory seemed to have robbed Manchester United of glory." Before somebody removed it. the section does provide very objective observation about the match though ("Manchester United dominated the whole game" part.) Regards,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the other pages have crests in the infoboxes because we don't have many better images that represent the club. Having written the football club infoboxes, I can tell you that the image parameter was added as an optional very recently. Images should be used to illustrate the article and to aid the text. The crest best illustrates the section which discusses its design. Images should not be included twice on a page, especially non-free ones. In general club crests have little encylopædic value (not to mention the fact that they are heavily protected by copyright, <a href="http://www.hqfl.dk/" class="external text" title="http://www.hqfl.dk/" rel="nofollow">HQFL</a> was asked by the Premier League to remove all its English club logos), and it is alarming that they have been used as the infobox image for all of these clubs. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> 9 July 2005 18:00 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The difficulty I have is that it singles out the Arsenal pages - if your main concern is an image appearing twice, then remove the second bigger one from the crest section below. If your concern is that it's a copyrighted logo, then remove <i>all</i> the logos from the infoboxes from other clubs. Be consistent. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> July 9, 2005 18:13 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would make absolutely no sense to move the crest out of the section about the crest, the "it may be stupid, but at least it's consistent" reasoning is worrying.

<dd>It's hardly stupid - the original crest is still in the crest section. When people read about the later crest it's displayed in the info box. All the information is there, and the information is equally there in the info box if people are only looking there. Your way, the crest vanishes from the info box for no good reason leaving people to puzzle why it's not there when it's there on every other FC article. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> July 9, 2005 18:22 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I've already explained, because Arsenal has a body of text relating to the crest. If these logos were free and Wikipedia were to be considered a source of them, then perhaps they should all be in the same place, but they really are minor details in relation to the club, which get top billing for being pretty graphics and make the page look "nice". It'd be much better to have a nice shot of the stadium in the image box. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> 23:16, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know it's a minor detail, but it just looks odd. If you're talking about a double use of the crest, my proposal is simply to get it the new crest out of the crest section, leave the old one there, and put the new crest in the infobox. The reader isn't stupid. He can see what it is. That way, it preserves information <i>and</i> it looks consistent. If it's such a minor detail, why insist on changing it against all the other club articles? --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 23:19, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't say it was a minor detail, it is a choice between presentation and functionality. Reading the section about the new crest design, one expects to have both crests to hand as the discussion is essentially about the differences between two images. The claim for fair use there is very strong. On arriving at the page, the crest at the top provides no use other than cosmetic. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> 23:32, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I'm saying it doesn't necessarily have to be a choice between one and the other. Fair dealing is equally as strong if it's up in the infobox or it's down there. You expect the old crest in the Crest section, but you also would expect the club symbol to be in the infobox as well, as it is presented in all the clubs. It's not merely cosmetic; you shouldn't have the reader have to scroll down all the way just to see the club crest - otherwise, what's the point of the image field in the infobox to begin with? --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 00:59, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The decision to include the image line was made by one person, and I agreed with the concesson that it should be optional. Judging by the quality of the crest images uploaded, I wouldn't trust the opinion of this "majority" which is in favour of having the club crest on each page. By all means this discussion should take place on the Arsenal talk page, but I should remind you that votes are one of the last resorts in <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a>.</dd>

<p>I am more inclined to agree with the opinions of <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> mainly that there is redundance in including the image of the 'modern' crest twice. I personally like the look of the page without the crest heading the info box as the kit image provides certain color to the page. I agree with Ed g2s that if people were so inclined as to include an image something like the image of the stadium, full stands, or perhaps a player during live action would be a good option. I know of other websites that the FA has come down on for using club logo images and I've actually been suprised that so far there hasn't been any appeal about the ones on wikipedia (knock on wood). -<a href="../../../a/f/c/User%7EAfC_d9ad.html" title="User:AfC">ÅfÇ++</a> 06:12, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My proposal, just for clarification, wasn't to have the modern logo be displayed twice, but to simply shift it into the infobox. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> 07:47, July 12, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>And for those who can't be bothered to read the lengthy previous discussion, my point is that the logo is better suited in the section about the crest, half way down the page, than in the infobox at the top. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_g2s_b24e.html" title="User:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">ed g2s</font></a> • <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_g2s_9b37.html" title="User talk:Ed g2s"><font face="verdana">talk</font></a> 19:35, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I prefer a single inclusion in the infobox rather than in the article, for reasons of consistency with other pages. But I think it's a highly trivial thing to argue over and it's been going on for so long I think agreement is unlikely - can I suggest we have a vote or something to sort this out once and for all? <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 14:34, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd put the modern crest in the infobox, since that seems standard. The crest section isn't in any case long enough to hold three images, and people don't need the images side-by-side to understand the changes, since there's an excellent verbal description. (That said, I'm no fan of Arsenal, so do what you like folks. ;) <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 12:22, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe the present crest should be put in the infobox for consistency. There are three crests under the crest section right now and the layout looks a bit strange to me. PUT CREST IN INFOBOX. --<a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVariance_1093.html" title="User:Variance">Variance</a> 21:09, 2005 August 4 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also think the infobox should have the crest in. I don't care whether the crest appears twice or if the article has something like (see above) to refer to it, but the infobox looks odd without it. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantthinkofagoodname_4422.html" title="User:Cantthinkofagoodname">CTOAGN</a> 21:22, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have got a question. Why are some reserve/youth team players (i.e. Arturo Lupoli and those below him) listed on the first team? Should they be kept there or taken off the list? Or perhaps moved into a different section like Reserves. <a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsenal_a59c.html" title="User:Arsenal">Arsenal</a> 18:35, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some of them figured last season in the first team (Lupoli definitely did in the Cup against Sheffield United), some have only just been signed but played in pre-season. Since they're likely to figure in the Carling Cup this autumn, and one or two maybe in the League if injuries etc. occur. I see no harm in keeping them in; they're not taking up too much space, especially as the squad is split into two columns. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 22:34, August 14, 2005 (UTC)
