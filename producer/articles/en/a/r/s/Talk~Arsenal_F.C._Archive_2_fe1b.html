<h2><span class="mw-headline">Squad templates</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmmmmmmmm_676d.html" title="User:Jimmmmmmmmm">User:Jimmmmmmmmm</a> recently replaced the simple squad representation with a much larger table. I have reverted this edit, and believe it should stay the way it is, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The table takes up more than twice the space on the screen and adds unnecessary visual clutter, with table borders and backgrounds etc.</li>
<li>The simple squad representation uses the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Template%7EFootball_squad_player_c368.html" title="Template:Football squad player">Template:Football squad player</a> template, which several Wikipedians have put a lot of effort into propagating. It has been well discussed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Football_9335.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football</a> and achieves a means a standardising squad representation across all pages. This change of format departs from this standard, was entirely arbitrary and done without warning.</li>
<li>The extra information (date joined, previous club) in the new format is not necessary. This is a page about Arsenal, after all. Individual players have their own pages - if a user wants to find out the previous club(s) e.g. Dennis Bergkamp has played for, they will go to the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Bergkamp_4a17.html" title="Dennis Bergkamp">Dennis Bergkamp</a> page, not this one.</li>
<li>The format did not cater for players out on loan.</li>
<li>The date given for "joining the club" was inconistent - players who had joined the club as a youth were given the date of their debut, while players who had signed from elsewhere were given the date of their contract signing.</li>
<li>In the recent <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Arsenal_F.C._c4de.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Arsenal F.C.">peer review</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Arsenal_F.C._dde1.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Arsenal F.C.">featured article candidate</a> votes for this page, no demand to change to the alternative format was made.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of the singular/plural</span></h2>
<p>This article, being about a British football club, is written in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a> (following the recommendation by the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a> on the relevant variety of English to use in an article). As a result, it uses the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_plural.html#Discretionary_plurals" title="English plural">discretionary plural</a>, namely that collective nouns such as club and team can be used in either the singular or the plural. Generally, in British English media, sporting teams are referred to in the plural (as a comparison, see how the BBC website usually uses the phrase <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Anews.bbc.co.uk+intitle%3Afootball+%22arsenal+are%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Anews.bbc.co.uk+intitle%3Afootball+%22arsenal+are%22" rel="nofollow">"Arsenal are"</a> rather than <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Anews.bbc.co.uk+intitle%3Afootball+%22arsenal+is%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Anews.bbc.co.uk+intitle%3Afootball+%22arsenal+is%22" rel="nofollow">"Arsenal is"</a> when directly referring to the club). Consequently, this article refers to the club in the plural throughout, for consistency's sake.</p>
<p>This is notably <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html#Grammar" title="American and British English differences">different from American English</a>, where sporting teams are always referred to in the singular. However, in British English it is perfectly grammatically correct to use the plural and this should be borne in mind before jumping to conclusions about inappropriate subject/verb agreement. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 02:52, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you can choose between using singular or plural in British English, and you only can use singular in American English, why don't use singular so it would be correct in both American and British English? Besides, to me, who is not British but have learnt British English in school, it looks very strange and wrong when the article says "Arsenal F.C. ARE a (not two) football club". If the article used the singular form it would cause less confusion, and it would be correct in both forms of English. Anyone agree? <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnemann_cfa6.html" title="User:Arnemann">Arnemann</a> 23:02, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Because in British English football teams use the plural far more than the singular. Read any British newspaper, or the BBC website, or clubs' own websites and you'll see it is nearly always preferred for sporting teams. Therefore for consistency with common usage, the plural is preferred here as well. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 23:35, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ambiguous seasonal reference</span></h2>
<p>"In the summer of 2006, the club will move to the new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium in nearby Ashburton Grove."</p>
<p>This sentence is ambiguous. Are they moving in January, February, June, July, August or December? This sentence cannot stand on its own as an encyclopedia article, because one must do extra research to discover that (1) Arsenal is a club in Britain, (2) Britain is in the Northern Hemisphere, and (3) the Northern Hemisphere has summer in the middle of the year. It would be better to rephrase this to remove the ambiguity.</p>
<p>Possible rewordings:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Beginning in the 2006/7 season, Arsenal will play their home games at the new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium in nearby Ashburton Grove."</li>
<li>"In (month) 2006, the club ... "</li>

<dd>Generally, pictures taken by spectators from the stands at any sporting event are of a much lesser quality than professionally taken ones, thanks to the inferiority of equipment and the lesser view afforded to ordinary spectators. I used to take a camera to Arsenal matches but no longer do for this reason. I did scour Flickr for any photos of the right quality and licensing conditions when preparing this article for FA status, but did not find any. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 00:06, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">It's not real football</span></h2>
<p>Don't you think it's misleading and irresponsible not to mention the fact that this organization does not involve real football, but instead soccer? I know what you foreigners are going to say, but Wikipedia is an American site, hosted in America, and viewed mostly by Americans, and it's unfair of you not to consider this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Don't you think it's irresponsible to live with such a narrow view of the world, without trying to find out what is beyond the horizon?

<dd>I agree with Scott here that the first comment in this thread is implicitly <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophobic.html" title="Xenophobic">xenophobic</a> ("you foreigners" is not the sort of language appropriate for this space) and that the writer's sense of what is "real" is emblematic of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_exceptionalism.html" title="American exceptionalism">American exceptionalism</a>.</dd>
<dd>But there is a more pertinent question to be addressed that the original author rightly raises: There's no reason why articles that pertain to Britons should be written just for them at the expense of clarity for an American audience. What matters is that the article is <i><b>accessible</b></i>. Perhaps this means, to steal from the <a href="../../../u/t/i/Utilitarian.html" title="Utilitarian">utilitarians</a>, <i>the most accessibility for the most people</i>?</dd>
<dd>If so, in my opinion, the term <i><b><a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_football.html" title="Association football">association football</a></b></i> meets this priority. It neither confuses the Americans (as <i>football</i> would), nor permits American dominance of an international language (as <i>soccer</i> would).</dd>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../o/m/p/User%7EOmphaloscope_e6a5.html" title="User:Omphaloscope">Omphaloscope</a>'s second comment (about trolls). Rereading my own first comment it was more terse than it should have been, and I should have at least wikilinked <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> to distingush from <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_people.html" title="English people">English people</a>. However as someone for whom "Football" usually means <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Rules_01c2.html" title="Australian Rules">Australian Rules</a>, <i>Association football</i> is even more strange. I know what League and Union are, but what's Association? I clicked on the link to discover it linked to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">Football (soccer)</a>. In the context where it would be confused, the word here is "Soccer" (although the word football is gradually gaining a foothold with the <a href="../../../a/-/l/A-League_1f29.html" title="A-League">A-League</a>), but the fact I am reading Wikipedia provides enough context to know that Football means Soccer. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 06:39, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed; association football is too technical a term. I'm reverting my change, but I'm still wondering if the target of the wikilink is enough to define the word (i.e. "<a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a>"). Shouldn't a word be able to stand on its own, particularly when the word is so important to the meaning of the whole article? Too much reliance on wikilinks will no doubt confuse people who read the article in hard copy, to give one reason. It also makes the reader click more. This is again a question of accessibility, which I'm proposing is more important than authenticity.</dd>
<dd>Why not a footnote? (<sup>1</sup><small>"Football" here refers to the sport also known as soccer or association football. See <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29_names.html" title="Football (soccer) names">Football (soccer) names</a>.</small> ) --<a href="../../../o/m/p/User%7EOmphaloscope_e6a5.html" title="User:Omphaloscope">Omphaloscope</a> 08:06, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The footnote idea looks fine, most people reading online won't follow them, but it works best for print. Also, using <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> gives a tooltip of "Football (soccer)" which your first suggestion did not. <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> is a different article. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 09:25, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>These arguments have all been made (and settled) a long time before, as a trawl through the archives of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Talk%7EFootball_%28soccer%29_c1f8.html" title="Talk:Football (soccer)">Talk:Football (soccer)</a> will show. The current form of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> ([[football (soccer)|football]]) is correct according to the Manual of Style (which recommends articles primarily to do with Britain to use British English), consistent with other football club pages in WP and provides the correct wikilink.

<p>Who removed the word biggest from the sentence "one of the most successful clubs in England"?</p>
<p>Most would say the size of the fanbase denotes a big club. Arsenal traditionally are one of the best supported teams in England. That notion is distinct from how many trophies a team has won. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapafrax_cac1.html" title="User:Lapafrax">Lapafrax</a> (<a href="../../../l/a/p/User_talk%7ELapafrax_0b78.html" title="User talk:Lapafrax">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lapafrax_321f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lapafrax">contribs</a>) 18:39, December 30, 2005.</small></p>

<dd>I did, since there is no universal agreement on what it means to be big - Money? Supporters? Trophies? History? Especially since what constitutes a fanbase is subjective - should it be attending fans or casual supporters? What about the problem of Highbury's capacity being quite limited? WP articles should avoid using <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">peacock terms</a> and stick to more objective wording, which is why "successful" is a more suitable adjective - it's more specific, and can be demonstrably measured in terms of trophies. "Bigness" is woolly and subjective in comparison. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 19:54, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion, of course they are one of the biggest clubs. But that's just my opinion. Using subjective and ambiguous terms like that is the kind of thing people from peer review/featured article candidate discussions get annoyed with, which is why concrete factual terms are preferred (especially given this is a featured article). Avoiding words like "biggest" and "greatest" is strongly recommended in the Manual of Style - the New York Yankees example in <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_terms_687f.html#Improving_weasel_words" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms">Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_terms</a> is a useful guideline for what language to use.</dd>
<dd>Besides, the club's history, fans and financial prowess are all discussed in the main article itself, and the facts pretty much speak for themselves, without the need for additional subjective embellishment on top. Well, I hope.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 23:28, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This list has been in the page for several months while flagged as "incomplete" and no-one has been able to complete it. I've looked everywhere through my books and I've tried to find an authoritative list of Arsenal captains with relevant dates, and I've failed. In addition, I've found some conflicting accounts (one book for example says that both <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Neill_b878.html" title="Terry Neill">Terry Neill</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Eastham_29d4.html" title="George Eastham">George Eastham</a> were captain for the same period in the 60s). It appears the role of "captain" used to be less institutionalised, less of a formal post, and more depending on whoever happened to be fit and on the pitch at the time. As I don't think this list is completable, nor is it that useful compared to other lists in the article, would anyone object if I removed it? <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 19:35, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't have any objections. Maybe it should be by number instead of alphabetical order, though? <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 16:20, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why does the beginning of the article claim that Arsenal are also known as "The Arsenal"...

<dd>As a footnote, the club did used to be known as "The Arsenal", after they left Woolwich in 1913, but <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Chapman_ca45.html" title="Herbert Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a> stamped out the practice when he became manager 12 years later. Some sources say he did it so the club would always be first in alphabetical order, but I'm not sure how true that is. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 21:15, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As Qwghlm says, it was stamped out decades ago - but even after they had been renamed "Arsenal" (at least, in preference to "The Arsenal") fans would probably still refer to them casually as The Arsenal, (e.g. "Are you going to see The Arsenal tomorrow?") at least until after the Second World War. 82.39.49.236 20:50, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Highbury squirrel</span></h2>
<p>Hello! I've written a stubbish "article" on the Highbury squirrel incident during the game with <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villarreal_CF_38d5.html" title="Villarreal CF">Villarreal CF</a>. It can be found in my userspace, more precisely here: <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_Highbury_squirrel_017e.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov/Highbury squirrel">User:TodorBozhinov/Highbury squirrel</a>. I'd like to ask if you think this is notable enough to deserve a mainspace article or whether it should remain where it is. I myself believe it's more notable than <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_meme.html" title="Internet meme">Internet memes</a> like <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Norris_Facts_d641.html" title="Chuck Norris Facts">Chuck Norris Facts</a> but it's very important to hear other opinions because I believe this one could become a quick <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a> candidate if I move it to mainspace. Also, don't hesitate to make any corrections and additions to the page. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg/20px-Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="12" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Bulgaria.svg_b927.html" /></a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodorBozhinov_f2f8.html" title="User:TodorBozhinov">→ Тодор Божинов / Todor Bozhinov</a> <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodorBozhinov_c2c4.html" title="User talk:TodorBozhinov">→</a> 11:01, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absolutely not. The squirrel is unlikely to be remembered within a few weeks, let alone a substantial period of time as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> demands. It should not be let anywhere near the main namespace. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 10:55, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agree with Qwghlm. Is the squirrel incident a significant one?
