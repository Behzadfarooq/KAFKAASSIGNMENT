<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Parade cancelled " photos</span></h2>
<p>These add nothing to the quality of the article whatsoever. Every club plans a victory parade long before a cup final (e.g. <a href="http://www.kumb.com/0506_story.php?id=11724" class="external text" title="http://www.kumb.com/0506_story.php?id=11724" rel="nofollow">West Ham</a> and <a href="http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1776_1222114,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1776_1222114,00.html" rel="nofollow">Liverpool</a> for the FA Cup) in order for the roads to be closed, notices to be published and safety measures arranged. Of course if the team then loses the final, it has to be cancelled. Pointing it out with not just one, but two photos is little more than obnoxious gloating. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 14:27, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>article is highly pov towards pro-arsenal bias. removal of images shows editors cannot be neutral. i suggest to not remove them, to show the article can be balanced. censorship of these (relevant) images is not acceptable, as per precedent set at <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_cartoons.html" title="Muhammad cartoons">muhammad cartoons</a> article. <a href="../../../z/z/z/User%7EZzzzz_e5d0.html" title="User:Zzzzz">Zzzzz</a> 15:54, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

In any case, it's not a question of censorship, it's a question of relevance; a picture of a temporary roadsign (the erection of which is a legal obligation) and a website screenshot have very little relevance, compared to what happens on the pitch. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 16:32, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If you spot anything in the article which shows a pro-Arsenal bias, point it out, or edit it to make it NPOV. Putting on irrelevant pictures to "balance" the article is not the way to address POVs elsewhere in the article. And removal of irrelevant pictures can't be said to be "censorship"; you have to first assert the pictures' own merits first. --<a href="../../../p/k/c/User%7EPkchan_0b01.html" title="User:Pkchan">Pkchan</a> 16:35, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>and as expected no editors were able to give a decent reason for the censorship but just anonymously reverted the images. as such, its clear the page is just a rabid arsenal fanpage with little or no neutrality. i will nominate it as <a href="../../../f/a/r/WP%7EFARC_beb0.html" title="WP:FARC">WP:FARC</a> unless some npov is introduced into the article. how is a picture of arsenal's 2006 celebrations and an image of the arsenal website irrelevant? article is about arsenal is it not?</dd>

<p>here are the relevant, interesting and valid images that were censored from the page, in direct violation of precedent set at <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_cartoons.html" title="Muhammad cartoons">muhammad cartoons</a>. <i>(Images removed as this is a talk page, and we can see in the history what you're trying to insert)</i></p>

<dd>The images are not relevent to an article on Arsenal Football Club. They in no way symbolise the club or its achievements, unlike the other images. Feel free to start an Arsenal Football Club Parade Planning And Associated Traffic Management article, if you wish. You'll note this article was awared featured status with the old images and not with yours.

<dd>It's not about being bias towards Arsenal, but it's plain to see that these images say nothing about Arsenal the football club which is what the article should be about. Yes a victory parade was cancelled; but it had to be planned in advance as Arsenal had reached the final. Putting up two images regarding a cancelled victory parade just isn't relevant enough to warrant a place on the page. The picture of the sign is put up by Islington council because they have to give advance warning in case it did take place. The Muhammad cartoons have nothing to do with this, as it's just a simple case of these images just not deserving a place in the article. The article is no-more pro-Arsenal than any other article on any other football team on Wikipedia. Anyway, why do you care so much, what have you got against Arsenal I am wondering? ichiuk 17:53, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The photos do nothing to make the article more neutral. They say so little about the club that why should they be there? Where exactly do you think the article is bias towards Arsenal? The point is to give a concise and objective overview of Arsenal F.C. and those images simply show one point of one night in the clubs history. If Arsenal had won the European Cup it would only be worth a mention in the article, let alone two photos. Also as the screen-grab infringes copyright, where did you take the photo? If you didn't take it then the copyright to use it doesn't belong to you, so it can't be used on Wikipedia. That photo was emailed around yesterday with the same file name, so it's not yours to use is it? You really do seem to care far too much that these images are shown on the page. --ichiuk 13:45, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Arsenal Staff &amp; The reverting of my transfers subheading</span></h2>
<p>Would it be possible to add coaching staff etc like on the Man Utd and Chelsea FC pages? Pat Rice etc I tuhink should be mentioned for their invaluable contribution towards the club.</p>
<p>and how comes the chelsea FC page can have a transfers list mine is reverted? i never said it was to be a news page, i ust want people to know recent ins and outs!Toge1988 19:18, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Depends on what you mean by "staff". <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Rice_f963.html" title="Pat Rice">Pat Rice</a> is OK for inclusion, but it gets ridiculous when obscure people like the U14 reserves coach and the club masseur are included as well, as other club articles have included.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for recent transfers, sorry for deleting it but I'll repeat again - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a> a news service, nor a page for the latest "ins and outs" - there are plenty of other places to find transfer news and gossip. This is meant to be a page about the club as a whole, not what just happened in the last week. Players who have joined the club are already included in "Current squad"; to mention them again "recent transfers" straight afterwards is a total waste of space and clutters up the article. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 23:04, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>so how comes the chavski page can have a transfers bit and we can't? Toge 12:15, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Chelsea page shouldn't have it either for the same reasons. But I don't care about the Chelsea page, so I don't edit it. Plus, I don't see any reason why this page should mimic the Chelsea page - after all, it is this page that is a <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured article</a>, not Chelsea.</dd>
<dd>If you really want to keep Wikipedia up-to-date about transfer information, then edit <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_in_English_football_071b.html" title="2006-07 in English football">2006-07 in English football</a>, which is the page about this specific point in time. The Arsenal article is about the club in general, not just what happened in the last week. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 12:27, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about making a * next to recently joined players or something of the sort and then further explaining at the bottom of the page? 84.109.54.126 23:22, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Better to only contribute static text to the article. 'Recently' is not static. It would be more appropriate to list each players joining date if you really must know who's moved in in this article rather than in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006-07_in_English_football_071b.html" title="2006-07 in English football">2006-07 in English football</a>, then this would seem the least-dynamic way of doing it.--<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadWolf42_1ccc.html" title="User:BadWolf42">BadWolf42</a> 10:58, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">External links</span></h2>
<p>I have removed all the external links to blogs since <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html#Links_to_normally_avoid" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> states that "Blogs, social networking sites (such as MySpace) and forums should generally not be linked to." I've retained other links to establish news sources, and fansites like Arseweb &amp; Arsenal-World since they contain detailed info on fixtures, statistics and historical information about the club and are thus useful resources. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 11:57, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I must disagree with you on that one since WP:EL states that "Blogs . . . should <b>generally</b> not be linked to." I believe that a website such as <a href="http://www.arseblog.com" class="external text" title="http://www.arseblog.com" rel="nofollow">Arseblog</a> is notable enough to make the exception to this rule. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatanh</a> 22:23, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You don't give any reasons saying why Arseblog is any more notable than any other blog. The rule on blogs makes clear when a blog should be included:
<dl>
<dd><i>"...there are exceptions, such as when the article is about, or closely related to, the website itself, or if the website is of particularly high standard."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But Arseblog doesn't satisfy any of those exceptions. All it is some bloke offering his opinions on the day's news. It would be different if he was an insider or had some unique perspective on the club, but he doesn't even go to matches (he lives in Spain). It's just some guy with a blog, it's no more special than every other of the hundreds of Arsenal blogs out there. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 15:10, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>You obviously don't like the blog too much but I don't see how you can say it isn't of high standard. Seeing how it's the most popular Arsenal blog, it must be "good", right? I don't see how not going to games has anything to do with it but if ANR is in the article, I don't see why Arseblog shouldn't be (Myles Palmer telling you how he went with his friend to the pub doesn't have much to do with Arsenal and makes his website a sort of blog as well). <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatanh</a> 01:24, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I do read Arseblog on a daily basis; in my (subjective) opinion it's a good blog, but it's still only a blog, and it does not have any novel perspective on the club. As for ANR, you're right, it is a blog, which is a good reason for removing it from the list (which I have done). <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 09:06, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite being a Spurs fan I'm surprised and pleased at the generally good quality of this article. Much better than the Tottenham one. However, all too frequently the grammatically incorrect or ambiguous clichÃ©s of sports journalism continue to crop up, as they do in most football articles, especially towards the end. I wonder if anyone else feels that this will be a never-ending problem as long as the sort of people who are enthusiastic about writing on football are typically the sort of people whose exposure to academic writing rarely goes deeper than the back page of The Sun or who regard Ian Wright as an eloquent public speaker. And the writer of that section about the Harry Enfield sketch needs a bit of severe thumping on the head with a manual of style or two. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTheNumberless_fbad.html" title="User:JamesTheNumberless">JamesTheNumberless</a> 19:59, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed, the latter stages of the article tend to wander. I've trimmed the "popular culture" section down and fixed some style issues (active voice rather than passive). Simple pop-culture references to the team should be kept down, in favour of ones where the team proved integral to the work (e.g. <i>Fever Pitch</i>) or it helps shed light on popular opinion of the club (e.g. Eric Morecambe/<i>Full Monty</i>). And I got rid of the John Lydon para in its entirety - the article doesn't need a whole paragraph that says little more than Lydon is an Arsenal fan (so what? Plenty of other people are too). <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 23:13, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's well-known that Arsenal will play in a red and white kit next season. I don't have a quote but I'm quite sure when it was announced we will change to the redcurrant kit it was said to be for one year. Also, I have seen a picture of the new kit (which was removed by the threat of a lawsuit of Nike) and it is red and white. Either way, for the majority of seasons that arsenal have existed the kit was red and white and therefore a page describing the club as a whole should have a red and white kit. I'll try looking for that photo of the Nike kit. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatanh</a> 22:32, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

While I agree the article should not be a running news commentary on the team, I would rather have a short paragraph - in the appropriate section - mentioning it, stating the established facts neutrally, with verifiable references.

<p>I see so from now on every time someone makes a baseless accusation it's worth a mention? The Newsnight editor is apparently a Tottenham Hotspur fan and a fellow journalist who was interviewed for the "investigation" criticised newsnight quite a bit in the newspaper. Besides, even if Arsenal did own Beveren it still wouldn't be a breach of any FA or FIFA rules as the two clubs wouldn't be competing in the same competitions (Arsenal is in the premier league, FA cup, carling cup and champions league while Beveren is in the Belgian league, belgian cup and maybe another belgian cup if there is one, no european competition and no english league). <a href="../../../8/4/2E/User%7E84.109.55.5.html" title="User:84.109.55.5">84.109.55.5</a> 00:26, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess the reason why it has to stay is not whether the accusation is true or not (after all, we are not here to hold inquisition on every fact in the world) but whether it has made an impact to the club's reputation and history. As of this moment this case still does, despite the recent clearance, so it's here to stay. As and when time proves that this is but an insignificant event over the course of the club's long history, this can be safely removed at that time. --<a href="../../../p/k/c/User%7EPkchan_0b01.html" title="User:Pkchan">Pkchan</a> 01:54, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Case closed.</b></p>
<p>Arsenal have been vindicated for their financial dealings with Belgian side Beveren, by The Football Association.</p>
<p>The Gunners were made the subject of an inquiry after revelations that they made an anonymous Â£1 million payment to the feeder club.</p>
<p>The world's governing body Fifa then handed responsibility for investigations to the domestic FAs of both teams, and the regulators of the English game have found no evidence of a breach of the Premiership's rules.</p>
<p>"As a result of those inquiries, we can confirm that we have not identified any evidence to suggest Arsenal have breached any rules of The FA or The FA Premier League in relation to their dealings with Beveren and specifically any breaches of the FA and FAPL rules concerning dual interests or associations between clubs," an FA statement read.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast defender Emmanuel Eboue is the highest profile current Arsenal player to have had a successful spell in Belgium and the North Londoners have always denied any accusations of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>They insist the relationship is purely football-based and that they loaned the money to Beveren on a short-term basis.</p>
<p>"In order to protect the integrity of matches and competitions, these rules prohibit clubs in the same competition from being owned, influenced or controlled by the same person or entity," the FA statement continued.</p>
<p>"In this case, the relevant competitions are the FA Cup and the FA Premier League. The rules also prevent a Premier League club from owning or controlling another Premier League or Football League club.</p>
<p>"The FA has provided all the material obtained during its inquiry to Fifa for its consideration."</p>

<p>It has been for a few days and I posted this earlier but some still it as notable enough to be included in the history, which I disagree with. The media conduct their own "investigation" and then FIFA has to ask the FA to investigate to satisfy the media otherwise it'll get crucified and then it becomes notable because FIFA requested for an investigation to be started so it must have been for something. Still not notable IMHO and an unncessary addition to the history article. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonatanh_cbfb.html" title="User:Yonatanh">Yonatanh</a> 04:04, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Au contraire, I actually think it's notable whether cleared or otherwise.

<p>Okay, I'll object, with this defense: Some of the other references mentioned -- particularly the ones which mention <i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i> and <i>Ocean's Twelve</i> -- amount to nothing more than passing background noise in otherwise completely unrelated-to-football subjects. Furthermore, in <i>The Full Monty</i>, few if anyone outside of the UK (and then it would still likely require that the viewer have at least some understanding of the football reference); it is brief instance. Regardless of what informs <i>your</i> particular interests in pop-culture, <i>The Pogues</i> are quite well known musically. Regardless of whether a single was made of the song, it appears on what is arguably their top album -- and Pogues fans know that the reference is there. Besides the fact, it is an <b>Arsenal in popular culture</b> reference; my contribution -- whether or not it is of interest to you -- fits appropriately under that heading.</p>
<p>Look, Wikipedia is for everyone -- the Arsenal F.C. article included. Pardon me if this sounds like a personal attack, but judging by the history of your own edits as they appear in the article, it often appears as though you feel as though you are free to have appropriated it as your own personal property. I am willing to concede you efforts in maintaining the article in <i>British English;</i> but in the name of the democractic priniciple of Wikipedia, I am not giving up an inch of turf.</p>
<p>Inasmuch, I have replaced the reference to which I am referring. <a href="../../../r/y/e/User%7ERyecatcher773_a0c8.html" title="User:Ryecatcher773">Ryecatcher773</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the Full Monty reference is quite relevant, as it illustrates some of the popular attitudes to Arsenal's performances on the pitch. On the other hand, I'm not particularly keen on either the Ocean's Twelve or the Hitchhiker's Guide references, as neither relates to how the club are depicted, but I'm willing to concede as both were highly successful in their own right. On the other hand, "Billy's Bones" is quite a minor song - it was never released as a single in its own right, and the mention is only one line. If Arsenal had been referenced in, say, "Fairytale of New York", then I'd be more sympathetic to its inclusion. But as you say, Wikipedia relies on consensus (though it is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a democracy</a>), not just my opinion; so I'll wait for wider consensus from any other editors who have an opinion before any further action.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, I will be removing the Lydon reference as it isn't a pop culture reference. All that sentence basically says "John Lydon is an Arsenal fan", and consensus previously reached here and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Football_Archive2_e203.html#Fans" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Football/Archive2">here</a> is that such mentions are too trivial for inclusion.

THIS is the annonymous user who has been switching the llist of famous players by nationality. The Reason Why I have switched is because to match every single OTHER G-14 Soccer country out there... Ive completed almost every list the same way, and to have Arsenal by the Time they played RATHER then have people show what nationality they are is just ridiculous... you can look up in their profiles for when they played <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.141.180.28 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.141.180.28.html" title="User talk:24.141.180.28">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.141.180.28_cf9e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.141.180.28">contribs</a>) 19:24, July 24, 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>You can also look up a player's nationality by looking at the article about them, so why does it have to be shown here? And the only reason why all the G-14 clubs' pages look that way is because you have been single-handedly making them look that way. You still haven't given any reason why grouping players by nationality is as informative as, or more informative than, classifying by the era they played in. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 20:57, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is Baptista a loan or a permanent move because according to Arsenal.com, he has signed on an undisclosed fee. <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=News&amp;article=413328&amp;lid=NewsHeadline&amp;Title=Baptista+moves+to+Arsenal+as+Reyes+joins+Real+Madrid" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=News&amp;article=413328&amp;lid=NewsHeadline&amp;Title=Baptista+moves+to+Arsenal+as+Reyes+joins+Real+Madrid" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> <a href="../../../a/r/s/User%7EArsenalwwerulz_4709.html" title="User:Arsenalwwerulz">arsenalwwerulz</a> 11:30, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's another Arsenal.com article, saying "season-long loan" - <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=news&amp;article=413321&amp;lid=NewsHeadline&amp;Title=Know+more+about...+new+signing+Julio+Baptista" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=news&amp;article=413321&amp;lid=NewsHeadline&amp;Title=Know+more+about...+new+signing+Julio+Baptista" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> <a href="../../../p/o/u/User%7EPoulsen_e5d4.html" title="User:Poulsen">Poulsen</a> 11:34, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, that article doesn't even mention the word "loan". The website repeatedly mentions "signing" and Baptista having "signed", but never tells us that he's on loan. It is possible that Arsenal immediately activated an agreed purchase clause, but the matter is still up in the air. <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyril_Washbrook_10cf.html" title="User:Cyril Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> 05:45, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Looking at it now, it has been updated. Where it now says Undisclosed was the term "season-long loan" when I posted the link. Well, that source is useless now, then. <a href="../../../p/o/u/User%7EPoulsen_e5d4.html" title="User:Poulsen">Poulsen</a> 08:40, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As is the linked to in the actual Wikipedia Arsenal F.C. page (i.e. <a href="http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=413463&amp;CPID=8&amp;clid=3&amp;lid=4161&amp;title=Reyes+and+Baptista+to+swap" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=413463&amp;CPID=8&amp;clid=3&amp;lid=4161&amp;title=Reyes+and+Baptista+to+swap" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>) - it's obsolete because it came before either of them actually moved officially. We should be using the most current sources available if they are reliable. Given that both Arsenal.com and RealMadrid.com clearly state the words "signed" and "transfer" and does not ever use the word "loan", I think we should remove the loan references. <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyril_Washbrook_10cf.html" title="User:Cyril Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> 02:02, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the end, if we find <b>clear</b> evidence that Baptista is on loan, then we can add it on. As far as I can see, it's only brief grabs and passing mentions that suggest the nature of the deal, and these conflict - the BBC gossip pages for example suggest a loan to be followed by a four-year loan deal, but other sources clearly mark it out as a signing. Those gossip pages come from the tabloids mostly anyway, so it's not completely reliable. As it stands, I think we're working fine on the evidence that we have. <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyril_Washbrook_10cf.html" title="User:Cyril Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> 11:45, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's some substance to back up the alleged loan: According to this article from the Premiership official website it states Reyes is on a season long loan... here's the link:<a href="http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&amp;nextPage=enNewsLatest&amp;id=1382555&amp;type=com.fapl.website.news.NewsItem&amp;categoryCode=NewsLatestFAPremierLeagueNews" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&amp;nextPage=enNewsLatest&amp;id=1382555&amp;type=com.fapl.website.news.NewsItem&amp;categoryCode=NewsLatestFAPremierLeagueNews" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
<p>...and here is another I found on the Yahoo! UK sport page, this one is talking about Baptista's desire to stay longer... <a href="http://uk.sports.yahoo.com/04092006/4/baptista-keen-extend-stay.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://uk.sports.yahoo.com/04092006/4/baptista-keen-extend-stay.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></p>
<p>...here is one that talks about Reyes being on loan, or his 'dream Madrid move'... <a href="http://uk.sports.yahoo.com/01092006/1/reyes-completes-dream-madrid-move.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://uk.sports.yahoo.com/01092006/1/reyes-completes-dream-madrid-move.html" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></p>
<p>I haven't seen a single article on the Arsenal Official Club site that really even mentions Reyes... Odd. <a href="../../../r/y/e/User%7ERyecatcher773_a0c8.html" title="User:Ryecatcher773">Ryecatcher773</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>And here's the case against: As mentioned above, the club originally claimed a one-season loan but then altered their account. The news article from Arsenal.com announcing the swap deal says <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=News&amp;article=413328&amp;lid=NewsHeadline&amp;Title=Baptista+moves+to+Arsenal+as+Reyes+joins+Real+Madrid" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=News&amp;article=413328&amp;lid=NewsHeadline&amp;Title=Baptista+moves+to+Arsenal+as+Reyes+joins+Real+Madrid" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>:
<dl>
<dd>"Brazilian international Julio Baptista has joined Arsenal from La Liga side Real Madrid for an undisclosed fee, with Gunners forward Jose Antonio Reyes joining the Spanish side in a reverse move."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Generally, loan deals do not involve fees, and there is no mention of the word "loan" or similar in the entire article.</dd>
<dd>Also, in the First Team Squad section <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/squad.asp?thisNav=First+Team" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arsenal.com/squad.asp?thisNav=First+Team" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, there is no mention of Reyes, while other players out on loan such as Larsson, Bendtner, Gilbert, Muamba and Stokes are all listed as still being Arsenal players. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 07:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, having read the articles I do see your point and I actually had already thought it was odd for there to be fees involved. However, in light of all that we've been hearing from the club for a while now with -- most of which was in regards to Reyes not moving -- I am unsure of what to believe the actual case is, mainly for two reasons: first, there is the ongoing saga of Reyes wanting to go back to Spain, which has gone on for a long time now. There have been a lot of quotes from this media source and that media source over the past year confirming that a transfer is forthcoming, and then all these so-called facts seem to end up being denied by both Wenger and Reyes when the Englis media asks for confirmation. The second reason is that I am not sure why there hasn't been a definite statement made about it on the Arsenal website. The report on the Premiership site says it, as are other reputable news sources, yet Arsenal's own press room hasn't come out to either confirm that these reports are accurate or to set the record straight if they aren't. That leads me to wonder if the club is trying to keep the details low key for some particular reason -- perhaps they aren't sure what will happen just yet. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. Whatever actually has happened, I think we all look forward to seeing the move fruitful and a good start would be a positive result on the pitch tomorrow. <a href="../../../r/y/e/User%7ERyecatcher773_a0c8.html" title="User:Ryecatcher773">Ryecatcher773</a></p>

<dd>Ah - there's a new interview on the <a href="http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma33499.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma33499.htm" rel="nofollow">official Real Madrid site</a>, which says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>You are one of the few players who has been loaned to Real Madrid.</b></dd>
<dd>"I spoke to the President and he told me there wasn't enough time for me to come as a signed transfer. But, I'm here, and that's what matters. I am going to work hard this year so that all Madridistas believe in me. On the pitch, I'll prove why this team needs me. That is all I am thinking about. We have to take each day at a time. We'll see what happens in one year's time when the loan period is over, but the final decision isn't in my hands."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've changed my mind, since that settles it as far as I'm concerned, he is definitely a loaned-out player. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 11:30, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The mysterious fee must be what they paid for keeping Baptista... I reckon that would explain it. <a href="../../../r/y/e/User%7ERyecatcher773_a0c8.html" title="User:Ryecatcher773">Ryecatcher773</a></p>

<dd>We can probably for the moment put Reyes on loan and Baptista on transfer, because we haven't really found solid evidence for the latter. <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyril_Washbrook_10cf.html" title="User:Cyril Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> 23:59, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just because Football Manager doesn't allow fees to be attached to loans doesn't mean it can't happen. Does the Arsenal site actually state that it is a <b>permanent</b> transfer? If not I call <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> as all media outlets say that it's a one year loan. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and all that... Just reading over <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=news&amp;article=413328&amp;cpid=703&amp;title=Baptista+moves+to+Arsenal+as+Reyes+joins+Real+Madrid" class="external text" title="http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=news&amp;article=413328&amp;cpid=703&amp;title=Baptista+moves+to+Arsenal+as+Reyes+joins+Real+Madrid" rel="nofollow">the Arsenal.com coverage of the transfer</a> and it would <i>appear</i> to describe a permanent move, but when I read <i>"Arsenal and Spain forward Jose Antonio Reyes ... <b>to date has won</b> championship and FA Cup honours with Arsenal."</i> It screams "loan" to me. I think the move should be described as a season-long loan, with a footnote to describe the oddities of the transfer - that is unless someone can actually find some good sources that say it's a permanent transfer. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 08:52, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most press reports were hurriedly made in the aftermath of an evening's deals, while not all the facts of the deal were known. Don't beat me with the OR stick - name a single occurrence of a loan deal where a fee has been paid; as it's a natural inference to make that as fee has been pad, it is not a loan. Also, explain why the Arsenal website originally described it as a loan deal before changing it to an 'undisclosed fee'. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 09:08, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I completely disagree. You cannot provide any good evidence to refute that it is a loan. The generally accepted view is that it is a loan. Arsenal.com doesn't say that it isn't a loan. It should be reported as it has been reported in the media. Wikipedia is not a place for coming to our own conclusions on these matters. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 09:59, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have it totally backwards: I don't have to refute anything. You have to prove it <i>is</i> a loan. Read the above discussion and you'll see that consensus amongst myself and other editors here was that it was a permanent move (and the article's current state reflects this), until you came along. The burden of proof is on you: find me a direct quote from the player or his club that it's a loan, and I'll believe you. Otherwise, it stays as it is. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 10:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, your recent edit to the article seems a reasonable compromise to make in the circumstances. I separated the Reyes and Baptista citations out though - Reyes has personally confirmed he is on a year's loan so there is no dispute over the nature of his transfer. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 11:01, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fair enough. Your edit is a bit tidier, but I think it was fair to tie the two transfers together due to the nature of the situation. Reyes being on-loan implies, along with all the media evidence, that Baptista is also on loan. It's not super-important though. My personal view is this: both players are on-loan because of the last-ditch nature of the swap. A fee may well have now been settled, but it was probably after the deadline day. I have also heard reports that Baptista staying a Madrid player until January will qualify him for a Spanish passport, whether or not he's actually playing in Spain. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlii_h_fb96.html" title="User:Alii h">aLii</a> 11:21, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've created an article for <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Anderson_%28footballer%29_4172.html" title="Terry Anderson (footballer)">Terry Anderson (footballer)</a>.
