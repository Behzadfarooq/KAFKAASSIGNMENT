<p>The plaintiff's three-year old daughter Suhani, was shown to the defendant with the complaint of dragging of feet. The defendant examined the child and observed involunatry movements based on which she made a diagnosis of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheumatic_Chorea_d7b1.html" title="Rheumatic Chorea">Rheumatic Chorea</a> and admitted the child. As there was no improvement in the child's condition after several days, the plaintiff discharged his daughter from the care of the defendant and entrusted her to Professor Sanath Lamabadusuriya, Professor of Paediatrics of the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Faculty_of_Medicine%2C_University_of_Colombo_621f.html" title="Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo">Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo</a>.</p>
<p>Prof. Lamabadusuriya initially concurred with the diagnosis of Rheumatic Chorea, making an entry in the Bed Head Ticket- <i>"All features of Rheumatic Chorea Seen"</i>. He however noted that, unlike in Rheumatic Chorea, the tendon reflexes were brisk. Two days later after re-examining the child, Prof. Lamabadusuriya ordered a <a href="../../../c/t/_/CT_112c.html" title="CT">CT</a> Scan of the Brain, since he could not exclude the possibility of a Space Occupying Lesion in the Brain.</p>
<p>The CT Scan revealed a Brain Stem <a href="../../../g/l/i/Glioma.html" title="Glioma">Glioma</a> (BSG), which is a malignant growth of the nervous cells of the brainstem which houses most of the vital structures necessary for life and hence associated with a very poor prognosis <a href="http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic40.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic40.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> , which the local neurosurgeons said were inoperable. The distressed parents thereafter took the child to the United Kingdom for review by Neurosurgeon Dr. Srilal Dias, who also stated that no surgery was possible in the present state.</p>
<p>The child died a few days after returning to Sri Lanka.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/s/Arseculeratne_Vs_Priyani_Soysa_63b3.html" title="Edit section: Legal Issues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legal Issues</span></h2>
<p>The plaintiff's case was that the defendant was negligent in not diagnosing Brain Stem Glioma and in the misdiagnosis of Rheumatic Chorea. Had a timely diagnosis been made, it was argued by the plaintiff, survival or prolongation of life would have been possible.</p>
<p>Although the plaintiff listed several Specialist Doctors including Prof. Lamabadusuriya as witnesses, only Dr. Srilal Dias was called to give evidence. It was alleged by his counsel that Doctors in the country were reluctant to testify against the defendant in view of her esteemed standing in the medical profession.</p>
<p>Dr. Dias claimed that had the BSG been diagnosed earlier radiotherapy or even surgery would have been possible. His claim was disputed by all expert witnesses who testified for the defendant including the eminent neurosurgeon Dr. Shelton Cabraal. Since the tumour was found in the brain stem region it is extremely unlikely that any form of treatment would have had any benefit.</p>
<p>The defendant argued that since Prof. Lamabadusuriya too made an initial diagnosis of Rheumatic Chorea and ordered a CT scan only two days later, she was not negligent in her care. This argument was controversially rejected by all courts including the Supreme Court, holding that the defendant was negligent in not ordering a CT Scan.</p>
<p>Since Brain Stem Glioma was a terminal condition with no prospect of effective treatment, it was also argued for the defendant that even if her negligence was established, causation had not been proved and as such the plaintiff's action should fail. It was on this ground that the Supreme Court allowed her appeal.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/s/Arseculeratne_Vs_Priyani_Soysa_63b3.html" title="Edit section: The Trial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Trial</span></h2>
<p>The case lasted almost a decade traversing the full extent of litigation in the country - from the District Court of Colombo to the Court of Appeal to finally the Supreme Court. The District Court upheld the Plaintiff's case and awarded him Rs. 5,000,000 (around US$ 12,500 at the time) and costs.</p>
<p>Prof. Soysa's appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed, however the quantum of damages was reduced as under the Common Law of Sri Lanka which is Roman Dutch law, damages could only be awarded for patrimonial loss. The Supreme Court allowed Prof. Soysa's appeal setting aside judgments of both lower courts. In a landmark judgment heavily critical of the decisions of the lower courts, the Supreme Court held that causation was not established on a balance of probabilities by the plaintiff. The defendant was also allowed costs of action, which she declined to accept. The legal process however did irreparable damage to Prof Soysa's high esteem and medical career.</p>
