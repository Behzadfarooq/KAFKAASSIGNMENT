	    <p>-Actually, as a Brit I a can say that to many (most?) brits - certainly here in the midlands - "arse" is considered to be quite rude and certainly you would get a few disapproving looks if loudly vocalised in public. Also, we may not pronounce the "r" in "arse" but we lengthen the "a" to compensate - it makes sense to us, since we also tend to do this in many of our words. Recently on, tv especially, there has been a tendency to use "ass" instead of "arse" as this is not considered to be as offensive by the general public. Seems a bit of a silly distinction to make, really.--81.151.218.59 22:46, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>-Wierd thing in America is that "ass" is the taboo way of saying it and "arse" is considered more appro.</p>
<p>Don't forget that Americans call their "asses" their "fannies" if they are being polite&#160;:-) SmUX 19:49, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed - although it's become more acceptable in polite speech, there's no way you'd use it in a formal situation or in front of your kids or grandmother. We'd almost always use "bum" instead. I'll amend appropriately.</p>
<p>-As an american I can say: "Arse" is almost never used in the United States. In fact, Most americans (until they here it spelled) simply think that Brits say the word 'Ass' with extended vowels. Arse is neither appropriate, nor inapropriate....most americans would simply think you made it up (except internet-junkies, and tourists).</p>

There was a young girl from Madras
Who had quite a wonderful ass.

it was grey, had long ears, and ate grass!

<p>Not too sure about this. I think anyone I would speak to would consider "ass" = "donkey" = "fool" over here (unless there was context to indicate otherwise), certainly in any expression "Stop being an ass"/"Stop acting like an ass". I would be quite happy to use the expression in polite society (but I'd say it with a smile). Even <a href="../../../e/n/i/Enid_Blyton_434f.html" title="Enid Blyton">Enid Blyton</a> (to 1960s) uses it (<a href="../../../f/a/m/Famous_Five_1d01.html" title="Famous Five">Famous Five</a> - cant recall where, but I'm certain its in there - Susan to Julian, perhaps?), so if there is any coarse "ass" = "anus" association in such a phrase, it certainly didn't first occur in that context during the Victorian period in the UK, otherwise she would not have used it for her children's books a century later; I expect its a US usage imported via film? <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobermory_d938.html" title="User:Tobermory">Tobermory</a> 09:41, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not sure what the third bullet point – a) idiot, b) asshole, etc. – is doing in an article about the word 'arse'. In British English, the word 'ass' would not be used to mean buttocks except as a euphemism, i.e. a less offensive word standing for the <i>real</i> word, 'arse'. Generally, a cod American accent would be employed in this case. I would be very interested to see any example where "people in Britain have adopted the American version in writing" (as alleged in the previous bullet point) other than in a purely (pseudo-)American context. An Englishman who was too polite to say 'arse' would say 'bum' or 'bottom'.</p>
<p>The second bullet point claims (contrary to all sources I have seen) that 'ass' for 'arse' was a British innovation. If so, it must have died out very quickly; as mentioned elsewhere, in Britain it was perfectly acceptable to call someone a 'silly ass' in polite society (and books for young children) without the slightest concern that it might be misconstrued as a reference to a body part – right up to the 1960s (or even 1970s).</p>
<p>Back to the third bullet point: Either 'ass' for 'arse' came about independently of 'ass' meaning 'donkey' (in which case, why refer to the donkey-derived senses at all in an article about 'arse'?) or it is itself derived from it (in which case, it is ultimately a euphemism even in the US – so why revert 'euphemistic' to 'literal'?).</p>
<p>I'm minded to revise these two bullet points. Any thoughts on the matter? Grant 23:25, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. I agree there is a problem, but disagree with the proposed solution. The most common name used to reference the subject of the article is <a href="../../../a/s/s/Ass.html" title="Ass">ass</a>, but that is (rightfully) a disambiguation page. So I would support <b>Arse</b> -&gt; <b>Ass (arse)</b>, which specifies the most common name (ass), and disambiguates with the British term (arse). --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 08:19, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. The analogy to <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shall_and_will.html" title="Shall and will">shall and will</a> doesn't work because they are different words with subtly different meanings and the article discusses these differences. Ass and arse are just regional variants of each other - the article discusses their shared etymology and usage. I'm also not sure what benefit moving it to ass (arse) would have. It's a more complex title and it breaks the disambiguation convention of using term (description) to use term (synonym), both of which make it more difficult to guess at the title of the article. On top of that, it is basically moving from one form of English to another, which is not done. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7ECherry_blossom_tree_d84a.html" title="User talk:Cherry blossom tree">Cherry blossom tree</a> 10:05, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
