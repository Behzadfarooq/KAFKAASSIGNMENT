<dd>It's not policy, but I think it still stands as a good guideline when discussing criticism. Doesn't keeping it separate also raise POV issues? If anything, I'd think a separate ==Criticism== section would probably provide undue weight to minority criticism, which is undesirable per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a>. In fact, I'd argue that it's a means of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">POV forking</a> without actually creating a separate article, and provides a magnet for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABLE_07ce.html" title="WP:NOTABLE">non-notable</a>, biased viewpoints. And I have a hard time understanding how almost the exact same verbage within the text of the article proper raises any POV issue that is avoided by shunting it elsewhere. An entire subsection devoted to what essentially amounts to a handful of user gripes seems a bit much. - <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 17:18, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just wanted to add, these are all attributable criticisms, too. Hannibal acknowledges the political content and moves to justify it against criticism, Caesar says himself that the Ars search performs badly, Cynthia Brumfield calls into question the editorial process at Ars, which is all in line with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Attributing_and_substantiating_biased_statements" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Attributing and substantiating biased statements</a>. Better attribution to Hannibal and Caesar would help, and they could probably all be rephrased to better avoid POV, particularly "...the dissatisfaction of some readers," but that issue exists regardless of where the criticism is housed and won't change by moving it back to ==Criticism==. I hope that what I'm saying makes sense. - <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 17:31, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>A separate criticism section does draw more attention to the criticisms, but that’s fine if the criticisms are accurate! The POV problems relate to the weight they are given when they are worked into the text. The first paragraph about the Ars Front Page has four sentences, three of them criticism. <a href="../../../t/s/e/User%7ETsetna_d99e.html" title="User:Tsetna">Tsetna</a> 18:39, 8 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Once again, I just don't agree. It makes sense to me that criticism of the News section of Ars belongs in the context of a discussion of the News section. It just makes sense to me. AFAIK, Wiki has never endorsed any kind of ratio WRT criticism to non-criticism per paragraph, and the labeling of individual sentences as entirely criticism is misleading (in fact, I'd say that the defense of political coverage on Ars doesn't read like criticism at all anymore, and works quite well in the Front Page section). I still fail to see why giving specific "criticisms" even 2 out of 3 sentences in a paragraph concerning news on Ars Technica gives said criticism anymore undue weight when compared to giving it an entire subsection on the page. You can't pick and choose the content of the article like that. It all must be considered as a whole, or it's meaningless. But anyway, the answer to me seems to be to <i>rework</i> the article. To add and edit content until a favorable balance is met. Not to strip out "negative" statements altogether and shunt them to the bottom of the page so we can all pretend as if that changes anything. Obviously, if the consensus is against me on this, I'll yield, but I'm definitely interested to hear what others have to say. - <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 22:09, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I am confused. First you suggest that having a separate section is undue weight, but now you are suggesting that a criticism section is just the opposite, a way to bury criticism? Maybe I am missing the point. Looking at <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digg.html" title="Digg">Digg</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engadget.html" title="Engadget">Engadget</a>, and many others, they all have criticism sections. Read the Talk page on the Criticism article, this is an unsettled and controversial issue. To clarify, I did not say that the criticism does not belong. What I object to is its position ino that section which gives it IMHO undue weight. Tomorrow I will try to integrate it a different way and you and others can perhaps tell me if it works or not. <a href="../../../t/s/e/User%7ETsetna_d99e.html" title="User:Tsetna">Tsetna</a> 00:31, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I suppose the issue is now moot, since El jefe04 has now forced the point by removing all content cited by forum postings (regardless of the poster or if the post is a poll), and if it follows if the letter of policy is to be followed to that extreme, the IP Democracy blog citation also has to go. - <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 20:24, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All of those articles have criticism sections, yes, but there is more widespread, published criticism of Digg, Slashdot, and Microsoft than there is of Ars Technica (or Engadget; the Criticism section in that article is miniscule and barely worth keeping as a separate section). Let's consider what is said in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a>, especially what is said about "tiny-minority" views; is criticism of Ars Technica really that significant in scope? The answer to that is what should be informing the decision to have a separate criticism section or not.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm taking a position of neutrality on the integration issue, though I will continue to revert attempts to inject tiny-minority views or factual errors by single-purpose accounts like El Jefe04 if there is no consensus to do so. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 00:51, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see how adding information with an uncited tag is acceptable. i see that everyone seems to agree that information that references the ars forum should not be included (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). Now, this strips out a lot of the back and forth about moderation and this and that which is fine with me, but you guys need to understand that it also applies to the rest of the article, not the criticism section. removing only criticism that is cited in the forum (even if the forum post is by a site administrator), but then leaving other information in that relies on citations on the forum is not a consistent approach. either remove both, or leave both, there is no room in the middle. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_jefe04_8cd1.html" title="User:El jefe04">El jefe04</a> 21:09, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's fine. And I added back nothing that referenced a forum post. Citing forum guidelines, Terms of Service agreements, FAQs, etc. isn't a violation of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> since the prohibition is on posts to the forum, specifically: "posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as primary or secondary sources." A lot of what you removed weren't references to forum posts. Also, while it is not okay to add content without a source, since you or I didn't add it originally, it is generally considered polite to add {{uncited}} tags to content per <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html#How_to_ask_for_citations" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources#How to ask for citations</a> to draw attention to the error and give editors time to fix them. Also, it is not okay to remove verifiable information or information that has been added back with proper citation under the guise of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, which you just did. For instance, the writing staff is easily verifiable from Ars, all moderators are listed on the forum front page, since all the forum names and titles are references to Latin, the list of them in the Posting Guidelines verifies that. If you had clicked on the link to the Columns and the Articles, you would have seen that they do contain overlapping articles.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>if you look at the history, i did not remove FAQs or guidelines, I removed unverified information, uncited information, or information that relies on forum postings as a reference. just like has been done by others on the article. you can't just add whatever you want with an {{uncited}} tag, and expect someone else to source it for you. if any of the criticism were added with an {{uncited}} tag, it would be immediately deleted. NPOV would mean that the same standard applies to all information in the article. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_jefe04_8cd1.html" title="User:El jefe04">El jefe04</a> 21:45, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Making continual extlinks to the same domain in one article in the body of the text looks like advertising. I don't see why every section needs to be directly linked from the article body. We're talking about over ten links here.</p>
<p>The article isn't currently very good as regards sourcing. Adding a real references section encourages people to add real references. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 00:10, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The alternative is to have them clogging up the External links section. That's where they were originally moved from.
<dl>
<dd>The better alternative is to not link them in the first place. Reference links should be for actual references; the old layout looked like a site map more than an encyclopedia article. Had I assumed this was in any way controversail I'd have gone that route. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 19:14, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Linking to something being discussed isn't in itself advertising. The solution to sourcing issues would be to add uncites, I'd think, so that areas you feel are problematic can be identified and discussed.A "real" references section is no better than in-text references, and it shouldn't be classified as "wiking." That's preposterous. See <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html#Citation_styles" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE#Citation styles</a>. The first line in the list for acceptable citation styles is "embedded HTML links." If you're not going to make an effort to provide FULL citations (author, publication date, etc.), there's no point in having a references section. - <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 15:01, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Full citations can be added later. It seems like a bit of a waste of electrons to convert a bunch of links which probably aren't of any real value to the article into proper cites. The next time I pass through I'll have a look at expanding the most useful refs into full cites. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 19:14, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I would appreciate a valid reason for the persistent removal of this information, other than the ambiguous "it's not notable".

<dd>The terms of use of a web site is not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia. How Ars Technica makes money is not that interesting. The fact that Ars Technica outsources their subscriber billing is also not that interesting. Wikipedia doesn't exist to replicate all the information on the Internet. If someone wants to see what the terms of use or how subscriptions work on Ars Technica, they can read it on the web site. A single external link will suffice for explaining that level of detail. A good example of what en encyclopedic article about a web site should look like is <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a>; notice the lack of emphasis given to minute details about billing systems.</dd>

<dd>People reading the article really, honestly don't care that the web site is owned by a company with the same name as the web site. We also don't need to describe minute details of subscriptions or renewals; again, terms of use do not hold much in the way of encyclopedic value. Always bear this in mind: WIKIPEDIA IS NOT THE INTERNET -- we don't need to collate every possible little piece of information, if it's readily available on the public web site the article talks about. This saves us the rather onerous responsibility of updating the article when some of these minute details change.</dd>

<dd>It does discuss affiliate sales, that entire "news" post is an advertisement for Dell computer equipment, linked to Dell product pages, and those links include what is commonly referred to on the INTERNET as an AFFILIATE ID. When someone clicks on that LINK with the AFFILIATE ID and BUYS SOMETHING, Ars Technica makes money. Is that clear? It's pretty crystal to me.

<p>As I've stated in my edit summaries, this Seragenn user continues to have a fascination with degrading the quality of the article by adding information that doesn't belong here. My reasons for continuing to remove this material are as follows:</p>
<p>One: Usually when I see someone come to Wikipedia and jump right into arguments over what should be included in an article, and get extremely insistent that their specific details are important -- especially if those details don't cast the subject in a good light -- they're usually doing so to promote an agenda or to vent frustration. This isn't a useful or productive way to improve an encyclopedia, and almost never results in things going the way the new user wants. Wikipedia's policy on <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a> is required reading here. More specifically, the section on "undue weight", which states: <i>"An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject, but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements."</i> In our particular case here, all of Seragenn's edits revolve around very specific monetary aspects of Ars Technica's subscriber model; subscriptions are otherwise completely unmentioned in the article, so if any coverage of this subject is going to be added, it <i>must</i> be done in a neutral and even fashion -- and that means, at minimum, saying that they... you know... exist?</p>
<p>Two: We are not the Internet. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" rel="nofollow">This is part of the "Wiki is not paper" guidelines</a> we're expected to follow in the process of creating better encyclopedia articles. Minor implementation details about Ars Technica's subscription model is not encyclopedia-worthy material, unless it's somehow especially notable or has generated controversy. I mean, come on, "Ars Technica reserves the right to restrict subscriber access from the site for any reason, without notice"? So? Why does Seragenn feel this is vitally important information to repeatedly ram into the article, <b>when the article doesn't even mention that Ars Technica offers subscriptions</b>? I've written a lot of Wikipedia articles in my time here, and I've seen text I've written appear on Wikipedia's front page as the blurb for an article of the day, so I'm pretty sure I'm a reasonably good judge of what's encyclopedia-worthy, and what's not. Again, if we're going to include information about Ars Technica offering subscriptions, then let's at least start by saying that they offer them?</p>
<p>Three: Regarding the lead sentence. We are -not- going to beat our readers into a bloody pulp with "LLC" and its expansion a total of three times in the space of one sentence. That's horrible English. Stating the words "Ars Technica" more than once in any short sentence should also be avoided for the same reason. We can formulate sentences better than this. A simple rule of thumb: Read a sentence aloud, with full expansions -- if it sounds bad, it's bad. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 12:29, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So how is removing those facts (and they are facts) a neutral edit to the article? I don't understand why you seem to think that is negative information.

<dd>I've taken a look at slashdot and it appears to me to be a good example of what NOT to follow. While there are some good things and it's probably in a better state then this article, it seems to be especially bad at establishing it's noteability. For example, there are very few inline citations or citations of any sort to sources outside of slashdot. While sections like the 'slashdot effect' does establish it's noteability, as does the notable contributors and the number of comments etc to some extent it really needs to go further then that. A fair amount of stuff which helps estabish it's noteability is not in the article. For example it's won multiple? webby awards but the only way you will know is from the external links. Similarly slashdot has obviously been referred to a lot by external reliable sources. There doesn't appear to be any real mention of this, apart from a link to a paper which mentions slashdot in the citations (but there is no use or mention of this reference in the article from what I can tell) and several external links with external sources which mention slashdot, like CNN. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 14:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
