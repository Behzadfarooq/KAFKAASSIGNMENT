<dd>Please tab and group your comments. It gets confusing otherwise. And the link was never correct, as can be seen here.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ars_Technica&amp;oldid=53138527" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ars_Technica&amp;oldid=53138527" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> So it wasn't defended at all before now.</dd>
<dd>Now, that said, we have something to actually go on. And my question is, is it fair and accurate to say that subscriptions can take up to four weeks to process based on two posts from 2002? Where one took 16 days and the other took _seven_? And you can't draw conclusions about how Subscriptions are handled now by that last post, obviously. That was in 2001 just months after the Subscriptor program was rolled out (September... it came out in July) It would fail to meet Wiki standards of accuracy. They are now automatic according to the FAQ (except for Snail Mail payments).<a href="http://arstechnica.com/site/subscriber-faq.ars" class="external autonumber" title="http://arstechnica.com/site/subscriber-faq.ars" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>
<dd>Lastly, we can't call those problems typical (as it is one four year old post), and someone 'outside of Wikipedia' would actually have to prove a trend with forum data before you ever could because of prohibition against original research on Wikipedia. At the very least, you would need a forum post from a forum user saying it was typical, but then you're faced with having a biased source. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 01:47, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is what I am referring to regarding rules-mongering, undue weight, etc. below. You first write that there was only one instance (7 days). Then you edit to reflect that you apparently found another instance (16 days). The first time you say "It only happened once, that is what you base it on", and then change it to "It only happened twice, that is what you base it on? You have to show a trend! No original research!". You ignore the fact that this entire article is "original research", unless you can point me to a book on ArsTechnica. Almost the entire article is gathered from "citations" which are really just links to ArsTechnica or Ars OpenForum. You have an answer for everything someone has or even <i>might</i> say. You are intimately familiar with the history of Ars, seem dedicated to removing most criticism, try to invalidate all citations as "not enough examples" or "don't apply" and yet I assume you would state that you have no bias. That you are only interested in the absolute accuracy of the article. We shouldn't have to provide 20 citations. One, or maybe two, should really be sufficient. Looking at other articles, there are usually only one or two citations for any one statement. Meanwhile, you seem to expect that we should have to compile statistics for you to justify every item. Also, Dave-G states that he is not sure how the link got mangled. He didn't say it was someone here mangling it. It could have been a copy-paste error. I thought we were supposed to assume good faith?--216.227.83.118 04:46, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't find any of those links I discussed. Dave-G posted them all. The reason my first edits were mangled so badly is that originally Dave-G's edit looked like [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ars_Technica&amp;oldid=61468293|this" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ars_Technica&amp;oldid=61468293|this" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>]. I couldn't figure out what was supposed to be apart of the original edit from Tsetna and what he had added to the Talk page. And the article is not original research. Most of the article makes claims about what Ars Technica is based on what Ars Technica <i>says</i> it is. If you have a problem with this, read <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> then add {{fact}} in all places where you feel like citations are necessary.</dd>
<dd>And it has nothing to do with Dave-G saying the link got mangled. He said the four week claim _was_ defended. Well, has it been? Can you show me an edit of the article where the correct link was listed? Otherwise, he was incorrect and it has nothing with assuming good faith. Also, can you tell me with a straight face that you feel that the four week time frame verbage is accurate based on the two citations Dave-G added? Would you think it accurate to say Subscriptions can take four weeks based on a collection of posts from 4-5 years ago when it was a manual process, even though they are now handled automatically and have been for several years? How about stop the person attacks and respond to what I'm saying? <i>And that</i> is the reason why you're violating Wiki guidelines on assuming good faith. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 16:12, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And just to be clear, you can look at my edit history or my Talk page history here to see that I don't think all of the criticism should go. Your claim that I'm "removing most criticism" is false, and I've never tried to hide my association with Ars as a reader and forum member. I don't believe I've actually removed <i>any</i> criticism from the article, though I have changed wording. Of the criticism that is listed, I do think half should go. The two about Ars proper should stay and the last one about search performance should stay. They are now well worded, well documented, and the claims are coming <i>from the citations,</i> not using the citations as data to prop up a view expressed here. The problems with the other three are listed and documented at the bottom of this page in "Cliques &amp; Punitive Action." <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebuskjt_3ae6.html" title="User:Debuskjt">Debuskjt</a> 16:26, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since there is still significant disagreement on this, instead of having a revert war, I will change the statement to 16 days for now (since that is something that can be cited at this point). However, I will say that it seems to me that you are trying to "win the argument" by demanding citations for things of which the Ars Community is well aware.--216.227.83.118 14:15, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How is something that the Ars Community is well aware of? It wasn't something I even knew was <i>supposed</i> to be an issue until I started editing this article. If it were still an ongoing issue, shouldn't we be able to find someone somewhere complaining that most subscriptions take a long time to process? I can only find individual data points (insufficient for Wiki, as it poses as original research) that Dave-G provided, and all of them are from <i>at least four years ago</i>. I just went through six months of posts in <i>Subscription Support and Services</i> and could only find one reference to a significantly delayed subscription request (though the period is unspecified and the user seems unconcerned), and that was because the check was sent <i>via snail mail</i>.<a href="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/6490940022/m/940003277731" class="external autonumber" title="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/6490940022/m/940003277731" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> The Subscriber FAQ clearly states that snail mail requests are held and processed as a batch, so can take several weeks even if the check clears quickly.<a href="http://arstechnica.com/site/subscriber-faq.ars" class="external autonumber" title="http://arstechnica.com/site/subscriber-faq.ars" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></dd>

<dd>Another note: I changed the "volunteers" part, which keeps getting changed back and forth between staff and volunteers, to "staff and selected volunteers". This is more accurate, as both staff and volunteers do moderate. Although in defense of El Jefe's edit, volunteers that contribute for long periods of time and have authority within an organization are usually referred to as staff. It is also recommended by wikipedia that instead of removing someone's edits wholesale (i.e. subscriptions), one should try to change them to be more accurate/compliant. As the delay has been documented, please stop removing the reference to it.--216.227.83.118 14:22, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Debuskjt’s points on this. The data is old, still isn’t accurate, and does not demonstrate a trend. As well, the link on the Criticism page <a href="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/6490940022/m/3830947404?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;m=3830947404&amp;f=6490940022" class="external autonumber" title="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee/forums/a/tpc/f/6490940022/m/3830947404?a=tpc&amp;s=50009562&amp;m=3830947404&amp;f=6490940022" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> doesn’t make sense. It’s a payment for $5, which is not a subscription payment. The problem from the post is that PayPal hasn’t cleared his check. How is that Ars fault? As well you can tell from the second user’s comments that the first user’s subscription is currently active: “just post here if your rights are mistakenly taken away.” I’m removing it. <a href="../../../t/s/e/User%7ETsetna_d99e.html" title="User:Tsetna">Tsetna</a> 14:46, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I also removed the part that did not seem to be criticism (or I didn't understand it as such.) Maybe you want to merge it into the main section? The FAQ section originally read that the "how to unsubscribe" portion was blank. ArsTechnica then apparently fixed this, and it was edited to reflect that the entry was no longer blank.--216.227.82.35 17:07, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quoting from the Citation article on Wikipedia <i>If none of those strategies succeed, do not remove the inactive reference, but rather record the date that the original link was found to be inactive — even inactive, it still records the sources that were used, and it is possible hard copies of such references may exist, or alternatively that the page will turn up in the near future in the Internet Archive, which deliberately lags by six months or more. Note also that whilst many printed sources become outdated, scholars still routinely cite those works when referenced.</i> If the links are not there (haven't checked them yet, then the above applies, since as far as I know this item was not disputed. Wikipedia being instantly editable does not mean that when a piece of information becomes "old news" that it gets removed from the article. I'm putting it back for now, unless there is more cause against it than the fact that it may no longer be happening, or that the FAQ is now more complete.--205.231.151.88 03:57, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The link was never “active,” it has never linked to evidence. The Wikipedia guideline is there for when good evidence goes offline. There was never good evidence. The link was added on 5/14/06 by Dave-G, exactly as this: <a href="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee/forums/a/frm/f/6490940022" class="external free" title="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee/forums/a/frm/f/6490940022" rel="nofollow">http://episteme.arstechnica.com/groupee/forums/a/frm/f/6490940022</a>. That link has never changed. What it links to is a forum listing, an index of posts. This is not evidence. I have noted this before, it is contested. I am removing it again. As well, the FAQ is not “now more complete,” it has always been that way, but the NPOV entry never acknowledged it. <a href="../../../t/s/e/User%7ETsetna_d99e.html" title="User:Tsetna">Tsetna</a> 20:19, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dave-G may not have provided the best link (in that the content of the subscriber forum probably changes on a daily basis). However, are you saying that there was never a delay in activating subscriptions? Are you questioning the validity of the statement that subscriptions sometimes took up to 4 weeks to be activated? I don't understand your purpose in this. Also, the FAQ section on how to cancel your subscription was blank until recently. Are you disputing that? Whether the specific subscription FAQ had it all along or not, if the main FAQ has a section called How to cancel your sub., and it was until recently blank, then there is nothing wrong with that statement. And for the record, almost anything in the criticism section was at one time or another non-NPOV to you.--205.231.151.88 03:30, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would also like to take issue with your archival of the old comments in this section. I have never performed an archive, so if it is automatically date based, then I can see how it is formatted the way it is now. But to me, it looks as if the page is hand-picking portions of Talk that to a quick glance seem to imply that I am the only one defending some of these sections. It leaves out the warning posted by Kristi_ski regarding autobiographical editing, and many others. I understand the desire to trim the page: it needs it. But I think the trimming should be done with an effort to either preserve both sides of the conversation, or the entire talk page should be archived in one go. Again, I am ignorant of archival protocol, so feel free to disagree.--205.231.151.88 03:30, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here we have a problem. Amazon reviews are apparently a "no-go", because they are online sources, and anyone can spoof them. How are forum conversations unable to be spoofed? Register for a few usernames, pick on one guy, voila! So basically, you are saying that forum postings can be evidence, but Amazon reviews are different? Both require the same act - registering as a user (free in both cases, I might add. According to the sections above, anything not on the printed page by a third-party publisher is not recommended for use.

Are you a shareholder?" would refer to the fact that someone has a vested interest in McDonald's success and therefore is personally ensuring they have sufficient revenue.

<dd>The fact that your behavior suggests an either emotional or personal stake in the content of this article is enough motive for me. It appears to me that according to you, everyone who has edited this article to add or restore criticisms is apparently taking a non-NPOV approach to this article. But you get upset when someone speaks up about it. You use a preemptive strike method of accusing me of name-calling to try to deflate the criticism. You report me for 3 reverts in a day (a rule I was ignorant of) and have probably been scouring the rule books to see if you can match any other "violation" with editors you disagree with. Speaking of the 3RR problem, you will notice that nothing ever seem to come from that. I wonder why... Perhaps it is because your focus was not on maintaining a good article, but instead on fighting a fruitless battle to try to keep all criticism out of the article.--205.231.151.88 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have improved criticism that was there. Regarding the 3R rule, you violated it, ignorance or not. If you want to interpret the lack of action (at most you would have a warning from an admin anyway) as a sign of your greatness, by all means!

At the time, I was not only extremely busy, but also having to revert against 2 separate editors who had a little "consensus" going. I do feel that I was baited into a 3RR violation by the repeated reverts, not knowing of that particular rule. Before contributing to the ArsTechnica article, I never had rules quoted at me left and right. Then again, I feel I was dealing with people who were not trying to fight additions/corrections. In this case, you use rules like an arsenal, and I am a more casual donor of time and effort. I have tried to go through some of the different Wikipedia editing articles, especially those that are mentioned. This is not a job for me, though. I don't have time to read through all of the various policy pages.
