<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Are_We_Changing_Planet_Earth__1bb0.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>Attenborough had confessed to previously being sceptical about the belief that <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate_change.html" title="Climate change">climate change</a> is predominantly caused by <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">humans</a>. But now, he argued, the evidence of it was too overwhelming to ignore. He became sure of it when he saw graphs provided by climatologists that demonstrated the link between increasing temperatures and the levels of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere, with the growth in population and industrialisation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was absolutely convinced this was no part of a normal climatic oscillation which the Earth has been going through and that it was something else."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout his television career, Attenborough had, by and large, purposely avoided specific references to the effect of humans on the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecology.html" title="Ecology">ecology</a> of the planet. He saw his role simply as a presenter of programmes on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_history.html" title="Natural history">natural history</a>. However, the final episode of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Living_Planet_234e.html" title="The Living Planet">The Living Planet</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>) had been devoted to man's own habitat and his destruction of others, and in later years, Attenborough started to become more outspoken about the subject. The three-part <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_the_Planet_351a.html" title="State of the Planet">State of the Planet</a></i> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, and the last instalment of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Life_of_Mammals_5da7.html" title="The Life of Mammals">The Life of Mammals</a></i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>), which dealt with the evolution of <i>Homo sapiens</i> and subsequent <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overpopulation.html" title="Overpopulation">overpopulation</a>, were explicit in this regard.</p>
<p>Attenborough acknowledged that the tone of the "Climate Chaos" programmes was more forthright than most of those in which he had previously appeared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's true to say these programmes about climate change are different, in that previously I have made programmes about natural history, and now you could say I have an engaged stance. The first is about the fact that there is climate change and that it is human-induced. I'm well aware that people say it's all a fuss about nothing, and even if it is getting warmer, it's nothing to do with us. So I'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the two programmes represent Attenborough's personal take on global warming and the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">surrounding controversy</a>, he backs up his arguments with findings from leading scientists and climatologists. The first instalment investigates the effects and probable causes of the phenomenon, and the likely outcome if things remain unchecked. The second looks at the future in more detail and discusses <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitigation_of_global_warming.html" title="Mitigation of global warming">mitigating actions</a> that can be taken. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_graphics.html" title="Computer graphics">Computer graphics</a> are used to demonstrate how the atmosphere is polluted by day-to-day activities that human beings take for granted.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Are_We_Changing_Planet_Earth__1bb0.html" title="Edit section: Effects">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Effects</span></h3>
<p>Attenborough begins by returning to his 1979 series, <i><a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_on_Earth_%28TV_series%29_177a.html" title="Life on Earth (TV series)">Life on Earth</a></i>, and specifically his closing words: "â€¦Man has an unprecedented control over the world and everything in it. And so, whether he likes it or not, what happens next is very largely up to him." He notes that when he spoke those words he could have had no idea that man might have unleashed forces that are now altering the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s climate. The naturalist highlights several meteorological and climatological catastrophes: <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, the collapse of <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glacier.html" title="Glacier">glaciers</a> in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenland.html" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drought.html" title="Drought">drought</a> in the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon_River_052f.html" title="Amazon River">Amazon River</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wildfire.html" title="Wildfire">forest fires</a> in Australia, and one of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>'s hottest <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer.html" title="Summer">summers</a> (that caused 27,000 deaths). He wonders if, somehow, there is a connection between these events. Scientists all over the world are linking the changes in the Earth's <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weather.html" title="Weather">weather</a> to a global rise in temperatures. The actual figure is just 0.6Â°C since 1900, but this is only an average. For example, the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic.html" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> has warmed by up to 3Â°C, and this threatens its whole <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecosystem.html" title="Ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. A team has been surveying <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polar_Bear_e77a.html" title="Polar Bear">polar bears</a> in the region for the last 25 years, and over that time, the animals have declined in number by a quarter. Each year the Arctic ice is also now melting three weeks earlier. The overall rate of glacier melt is accelerating: in southern Greenland, the amount of ice flowing into the sea has doubled in a decade, resulting in a rise of sea levels. This is exacerbated by the increase in temperatures, which causes <a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean.html" title="Ocean">oceans</a> to expand. When Hurricane Katrina struck <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans_615c.html" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>, the sea temperatures of the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_of_Mexico_73a1.html" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> were the highest ever recorded. In addition, the 2005 <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane.html" title="Hurricane">hurricane</a> season was the worst ever. Scientists who have studied such severe weather warn that from now on hurricanes in the area will be more intense, more destructive and possibly more frequent. Also in 2005, the Amazon region suffered its worse drought in 60 years, decimating local fish populations. Six months later, trees have still not recovered. The abnormally warm seas in the Atlantic had disrupted the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precipitation_%28meteorology%29.html" title="Precipitation (meteorology)">rainfall</a> in the forest and for similar reasons, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coral_reef.html" title="Coral reef">coral reefs</a> are also at risk, leading to the phenomenon of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coral_bleaching.html" title="Coral bleaching">coral bleaching</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Are_We_Changing_Planet_Earth__1bb0.html" title="Edit section: Causes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Causes</span></h3>
<p>Attenborough points out that because of natural forces, the Earth's temperature has been fluctuating for millions of years, long before humans arrived. However, it is the additional carbon dioxide, leading to an increase in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenhouse_effect.html" title="Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a>, which must also be taken into account. When <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil_fuel.html" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a> are burnt, such as <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coal.html" title="Coal">coal</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/e/Fuel_oil.html" title="Fuel oil">fuel oil</a> or <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_gas.html" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>, the carbon emissions combine with <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxygen.html" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> to further thicken the Earth's atmospheric 'blanket' and thus warm the planet. An analysis of <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_core.html" title="Ice core">ice cores</a> can provide information from thousands of years ago. Comparisons of carbon dioxide levels show that those of today are far beyond anything seen in the past. The scientists interviewed are convinced that humans are responsible.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Are_We_Changing_Planet_Earth__1bb0.html" title="Edit section: The future">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The future</span></h3>
<p>Scientists cannot predict changes to the climate with any certainty â€” but they can anticipate the likelihood that they will occur. Attenborough visits the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Met_Office_4737.html" title="Met Office">Met Office</a> in <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exeter.html" title="Exeter">Exeter</a> to learn their conclusions. Their findings include several factors, and allow for natural climate change as well as man-made carbon dioxide emissions. A graph shows that up until around 1970, the variance in Earth's temperatures was largely due to inherent anomalies, but from then on there is a marked escalation, which can only be explained by human activity. A computer model reveals that, for example, the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_European_heat_wave_39f5.html" title="2003 European heat wave">2003 European heat wave</a> â€” by present reckoning a 1 in 200 years event â€” will be something that occurs every other summer by 2040, and by 2080 would be considered to be cool weather. Attenborough is wholly persuaded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're all involved in this: our whole way of life is structured around the burning of fossil fuels. I find it sobering to think that while I've been travelling the world, trying to record the complexity and beauty of our planet, that I too have been making my own contribution to global warming. As I recognised when I presented <i>Life on Earth</i> all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced."</p>

<p>Attenborough starts the second programme by looking at potential future events, before warning that what happens over the next few years is crucial. A BBC weather forecast for the year 2050 shows that summer temperatures of 38Â°C for the UK are "par for the course". The probable range by which the planet will warm over the next century is between 1.4Â°C and 5.8Â°C. Or, says Attenborough, "to put it another way, the impact of global warming will be somewhere between severe and catastrophic." The naturalist is invited to watch a film that illustrates regional change over the next 100 years. A 2Â°C rise for the south of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, for example, may not seem to be much but that is not all there is to it. Rainfall is also predicted to be more intense and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storm.html" title="Storm">storms</a> could be five times more frequent than they are at the moment. This makes extreme events, such as the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boscastle_flood%2C_2004.html" title="Boscastle flood, 2004">2004 Boscastle flood</a>, much more likely. Current defences for severe wind or rain will shortly become inadequate. Even Hurricane Katrina, with the devastation it caused, is described as "not particularly powerful". In Australia, a new approach is needed to combat brush fires after the hottest year on record. If the Amazon <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests.html" title="Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests">tropical rainforest</a> were to disappear, not only would an entire ecosystem vanish, but a valuable way of cooling the planet would go as well. Meanwhile, the glaciers continue to melt: one scientist reveals that an area the size of <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> has been lost over the last 20 years. Attenborough is told that a warming of 2Â°C is inevitable, as a consequence of our actions over the last 25 years, but whether or not we end up at 6Â°C is still very much within our control.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The Carbon family home and their pollution</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Every year humans add 25 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and over half of it comes from their domestic activity. Attenborough introduces the Carbons, a fictional family occupying an average Western suburban house near a city. Their <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_power.html" title="Electric power">electrical requirements</a> are supplied via fossil fuels. As Attenborough points out, the Carbons are not bad people, but as Westerners, they have one of the most energy-hungry lifestyles on the planet. They are a two-car household, and each vehicle emits 10 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> over the course of a year. The power used to run the Carbons' home and all its comforts translates into a similar amount. Much of the family's plentiful food supply will have crossed continents by the time it reaches their kitchen, and will have added a tenth to their annual emissions. Yet more are produced by their refuse: buried in a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landfill.html" title="Landfill">landfill</a>, it heats up as it decomposes and releases <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenhouse_gas.html" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse gases</a>. Mr Carbon's business trips by air contribute to the fastest growing source of CO<sub>2</sub>. The combined total of the Carbons' yearly <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_pollution.html" title="Air pollution">air pollution</a> is 45 tons.</p>
<p>Also shown are Mr and Mrs Tan, a fictional couple who live in an average <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> suburb. At present, their energy usage is one seventh of that of the Carbons. However, this is set to change. As China becomes more industrialised, its emissions are set to overtake those in the West. As of 2006, the country is planning to build a large, coal-fired power plant every week for the next seven years.</p>

<p>The challenge is to freeze emissions at their current level. Attenborough investigates the measures that can be implemented in order to achieve this, and some are more controversial than others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Household solutions
<ul>

<p>Attenborough notes that the world is waking up to climate change, and that everyone has a part to play in halting it. He paints an apocalyptic picture of the world if we do nothing. If the Greenland ice cap were to melt, the sea would flood much of south-east Britain, including central <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>. It would take just a 5-metre rise to drown most of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> and leave <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami.html" title="Miami">Miami</a> 50 miles off shore. A similar deluge would wipe <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> off the map. Worldwide, 150 million people could be displaced within 50 years.</p>

<p>"In the past, we didn't understand the effect of our actions. Unknowingly, we sowed the wind and now, literally, we are reaping the whirlwind. But we no longer have that excuse: now we do recognise the consequences of our behaviour. Now surely, we must act to reform it: individually and collectively; nationally and internationally â€” or we doom future generations to catastrophe."</p>
