<p>Charles Matthews had some other lists/categorizations, but I can't find these now. I've been staring at bits of AMS for a while, and, while the top-level categories make sense, some of the subcategories seem insane to me. 11B in particular seemed bizarre. For example, where can we classify stuff published in "Journal of Integer Sequences"? Thus, I am lead to look for Charles other lists ... <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 18:22, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There was some non-AMS list that he'd scavenged from somewhere. I didn't much care for such questions when I first saw it. Maybe I should ask directly. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 03:27, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Intereger sequences come under <a href="http://www.ams.org/msc/11Yxx.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ams.org/msc/11Yxx.html" rel="nofollow">11Y55</a>. I agree that the AMS has severe limitations when used in a context like Wikipedia. However, as the article states, the AMS classifcation "has been used as a starting point to ensure all areas are covered, and related areas are close together". I fully expect the headings to be tweaked and moved around within the article. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompw_aa36.html" title="User:Tompw">Tompw</a> 15:11, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I note <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompw_aa36.html" title="User:Tompw">User:Tompw</a> recently deleted, without explaination, some MSC numbers I'd just added. Why? Maybe I misunderstand the purpose of this list, but it seems that it was trying to be a cross-list to the MSC numberigng system, so I'm wondering why these are now being deleted. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 21:39, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I thought I had replied to this, but it seems not. I didn't delete it because it had the extra AMSC numbers, I deleted it because I felt it went into too much detail for the page, although I should've stated this under the edit summary. On reflection, it would be nice to re-include them as easily comprehended areas of Number Theory. I also feel that putting in AMSC numbers below the top level makes the article less readable. (There is something to be said for removing all AMSC numbers - they are a hang over of a copy and paste of the AMSC top levels. - see first few edits). Anyway, hope tha tclears that one up. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompw_aa36.html" title="User:Tompw">Tompw</a> 00:21, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, not too big a deal, otherwise I would ave argued. I think it might be useful to have, somewhere, a cross-reference between MSC numbers and WP categories. However, this is not so urgent that I'll push on this. BTW, you may want to (re-) announce this page on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_baf7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics</a>, as this may get you help filling out some missing sections. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 23:21, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it is misleading to say that analysis is primarily related to rates of change. Many aspects to the theory do not arise in this way. I think it would be better to say that analysis is the study of inequalities, because this is the theme that runs through every branch, at least it seems to me. To quote Krantz (from a book review of 'A Companion to Analysis: A Second First and First Second Course in Analysis') "Analysis is dirty, rotten, hard work. It is estimates and more estimates. And what are those estimates good for? Additional estimates, of course. We do hard estimates of integrals in order to obtain estimates for operators. We obtain estimates for operators in order to say something about estimates for solutions of partial differential equations. And so it goes." Any comments? I tried to change it initially myself, but instantly got reverted.&#160;:) I should have started here I suppose. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThenub314_c8b0.html" title="User:Thenub314">Thenub314</a> 02:51, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Inequalities play an important role in analysis, but this is not what the analysis is about however. I would argue that derivatives and integrals are much more important. Either way, I would suggest you copy your post to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_baf7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics</a> where more people will see it. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 03:15, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just rewrote the introduction to analysis, incorporating most of what was already there. My goal is to add paragraphs for most of the subdivisions of analysis that are already present in skeletal form. I do have a question about content, and style, though.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since the math portal points directly to this page, I think this ought to be a survey article describing things at a fairly high level. And since the non-mathematical reader is likely to look at it, I also think it ought to be lively and entertaining, to the extent that is possible. So I tried to make the lead-in to "analysis" informative, but also fun to read.</dd>

<dd>Well, I'm starting to understand why Thenub314 gave up and wandered away without contributing anything to this article. My new intro to analysis lasted exactly 45 minutes. And it took almost an hour to write it! That's pretty discouraging.</dd>
