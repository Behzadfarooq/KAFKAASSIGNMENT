<p>Ares is a Korean <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhwa.html" title="Manhwa">manhwa</a> drawn and written by Ryu Kum Chel. The story takes place in the era of ancient Rome in a country called Cronos and follows a group known as the Tample Mercenaries. In particular, the manhwa is about Ares and his brothers in arms Baroona and Michael.</p>

<p>Ares, Michael, and Baroona are admitted to the Tample Mercenaries through a simple test of skill against rank B soldiers. After passing the test with ease, they enter the same unit in the Mercenary Corp, and intrigued by each others’ skill, they soon became friends. They also met the fourth member of their group, the cowardly artist Gohue, who hides during battle, but is great at drawing. The three warriors soon prove themselves on their first mission, and rise to Rank B (though all three are far better than the Rank A soldiers). The Tample Mercenaries soon get involved in battles on a national scale, where the main characters meet the great Chronosian general (and later king) Icarus. Impressed by their skills, he hires them on another mission to protect him while he goes to attempt to negotiate his way out of a war with Chronos’ western neighbors, the Radink Alliance. The trio’s help is needed when two generals use Icarus’ absence to overthrow the government of Chronos and use Chronosian soldiers to attempt to kill him. After Ares, Baroona, and Michael see Icarus safely back to his own troops, the Tample Mercenaries are hired to stop the usurpation of the throne by defeating the usurper’s army. Though pure genius, Icarus wins the civil war with minimal losses to either side, and then takes both armies to defend Chronos' western border. The former King’s advisors request that Icarus be the new king, and he accepts their offer. In this battle, Icarus once again uses the Tample Mercenaries and brilliant strategy to provide an advantage to his side. Soon, the black knights were all defeated and the presumed red eyes swordsman escaped. Ares and Michael took chase and was astonished to find out that he was not the red eyes swordsman, but his brother. Red eyes swordsman soon appeared and revealed himself to Ares to make him stronger.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Ares_%28manga%29.html" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characters</span></h2>
<p><b>Ares:</b> The apprentice of the deceased Kiron, famous Master Swordsman of Chronos. Kiron, who had lost his sight, was murdered by the Red-Eyed Swordsman. Kiron’s sword was taken by the Swordsman and Ares lost an eye as well. Ares is devoted to avenging his master’s death by killing the Red Eyed Swordsman and taking back his sword. It is shown that Ares' real name is Sebastian but he lost his memories when he fell off a cliff. He became B-rank after the first mission with his companions, and he is now an A-rank.</p>
<p><b>Kiron:</b> Master Swordsman of Chronos, also known as swordsman of the wind. He went blind a few years after he took Ares in, and was murdered by the red-eyed swordsman due to his disability. He was called swordsman of the wind because of the sound he produced when he swung his sword.</p>
<p><b>Red-eyed swordsman (real name: unknown at this point)&#160;:</b> An infamous swordsman who goes around killing other swordsmen and collecting their swords. He murdered Kiron in an unfair fight and injured Ares' right eye.</p>
<p><b>Michael:</b> The heir to the throne of Isiris. He has come to Chronos to experience war and the life of commoners. He is well educated and intelligent, understanding many strategies used in battles and wars. He is also the most bloodthirsty of the three main characters. He became B-rank after his first mission, and is currently A-rank. He is the murderer of Cygnus.</p>
<p><b>Cygnus:</b> A powerful spearman defeated by Ares. He was spared when Ares knew that he too had a girlfriend waiting for him. However, he was murdered by Michael right after Ares left.</p>
<p><b>Baroona:</b> A former Daraakian Slave. He escaped the Radink Alliance after becoming the champion gladiator. He is the only one of the three who does not use a sword. He fights with two daggers tied to the ends of a metal chain. He also became B-rank after his first mission, and has risen to A-rank at present.</p>
<p><b>Ariadne:</b> The love interest for Ares. She is a rich princess who followed Ares into the battle at Minos, where Ares was stuck trying to protect her time and time again. After Ares was wounded in battle Ariadne treated him. When Minos' knights came and attacked Ares, he saved Ariadne's life, but she called him a savage and left him. However, she then returned and remains as his girlfriend.</p>
<p><b>Helena:</b> Helena is Ariadne's body guard. She dislikes Ares and thinks he is a bad influence on Ariadne. She followed Ariadne into Minos and tried to bring her back home. In the end they left after knights attacked Ariadne and after she realized the horrors of fighting.</p>
