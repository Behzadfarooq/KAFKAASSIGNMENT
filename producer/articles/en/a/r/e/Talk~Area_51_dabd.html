<p>3rd March 07 - I think this article needs a clean up. Personal comments are all through the article, and some of the infomation may be fictional. Also the infomation is all over the place.</p>

<p>We could improve this article by writing something about Area 51 employees. Instead of saying something only about famous emplyees, we could try to find out on internet, more about general things. I´m sure that we can find interesting information!</p>

<p>"Editing of this article by unregistered or newly registered users is currently disabled." Why that? I want to improve the article, but don`t want to become registered. E.g.: I want to insert a picture of the german article into this. But I can´t. That´s a bit stupid!</p>

<p>Someone go on google earth and press the print screen button then paste it into paint and make a picture of area 51. You can see a lot of things like the planes, buildings, cars, and towers very clearly. Just a suggestion.</p>

<p>IIRC, Area 51 gets its name from its status as part of Nellis Air Force Range - in that it's one of the many numbered areas on that range. I recall having a flight sim for the Amiga which included a map of the range, divided into numerically designated areas, and instructions that area 51 was off-limits (the game had a scenario mode which set off from there with an <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Brown_4de3.html" title="Dale Brown">experimental B52</a>; I wasn't aware of the UFO culture significance at the time, as this was pre-internet and pre-X-Files).

<p>In rewriting, I removed the (dead) link to <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_19.html" title="Area 19">Area 19</a>. I did try to write a page for that topic, but I can't find anything that isn't pure tinfoil-hat speculation stuff (unlike 51, for which we have plenty of encyclopedic material).</p>

<p>I think I'm done updating the page. It's difficult to be encyclopedic about something that undoubtedly exists but the details of which are so acutely secret. There's a great shortage of reliable source material. The main, and most reliable source, is Ben Rich's book "Skunkworks", from which most of the material on past operations at Groom is derived. Other details are filled in from the website of the Federation of American Scientists (www.fas.org). Both Rich and FAS make very modest claims, they're consistent with each other, and both have a reliable pedegree. To assert that they're both wrong on a significant matter (particularly, that they're lying) would entail, I think, believing in another (rather elaborate) consipiracy theory. It's for this reason that I've taken the liberty of asserting the historical parts as fact, rather than endlessly repeating "allegedly" and "apparently" and "some assert", etc. If there are errors and ommisions (there surely are) I think they're unlikely to be significant (if, for example, F117 was immediately deployed at Nellis rather than Tonopah, the page is in error, but I think not to a material degree). I've tried to reserve those terms for the supposed projects following F117, and particularly for the tinfoil-hat ufo-deathray-UNconspiracy stuff at the end.</p>
<p>I'd be willing to accept that there's perhaps too much of the consipiracy theory stuff here (it's largely covered quite well on its own page), but given that Groom seems derive its celebrity largely from this stuff, it would be remiss not at least to mention it here. I think I've been as NPOV as I possibly could.</p>
<p>I'd have liked to put in the allegation (which numerous sources carry) that the base only declares a taxable value of $2M to the county (which is prevented from performing an in-person assessment), but I can't find a first-hand source (of what should, after all, be a public record). If someone can find such a record and point to it, I think this should be part of the page.</p>
<p>Information about the location and distances of geographic features is mostly derived from the USGS's topographic server (a link to a commercial vendor of the same maps is attached to the article). I've generally been rather liberal about rounding numbers to nice values.</p>
<p>The location of the base (wrt the lake) and the lengths of the runway(s) are taken from satellite images on FAS. As the photos are old, and reports differ as to whether the runway(s) have been lengthened or shortened, I duck the issue entirely. I've deliberately refrained from alleging the Groom runway to be "the longest in the world" as some sites do, as (from the satelite photos) it looks (to me) to be a long-but-not-exceptional three miles. Your milage, as they say, may vary.</p>
<p>Some may assert that the article could be an aid to terrorists or spies, but I think that is unfounded. The USGS accurately supplies an exceptionally detailed topographic map (showing the lake, but naturally not the base), and even mapquest will plot you a route to Groom (although I urge you not to follow it). The internet abounds with detailed maps, satellite photos, and details of base security.</p>

<p>As they hastily renamed Blackbird to SR-71 (from A-10, A-11, and A-12), the name A-12 was never official used by the airforce, and so it was reused later for Avenger, a fighter-demonstrator (confusing, huh) that had nothing to do with the SENIOR CROWN/OXCART spyplane programme. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 16:27, 31 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>A while ago an anonymous contributor added some See Alsos to this article. I think I'm going to remove them soon, as they're really all unsuitable. Justifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aurora - already mentioned in the body of the article</li>
<li>Project Echelon - there's no evidence at all that Groom has anything to do with Echelon, and indeed it would be a fantastically stupid place to site it - I'm sure the US part is at the <a href="../../../n/s/a/NSA_54af.html" title="NSA">NSA</a>'s facility at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Meade%2C_Maryland_ac35.html" title="Fort Meade, Maryland">Fort Meade, Maryland</a>. The only reference I've ever seen relating Echelon to Groom is the Deus Ex game, to which we already link.</li>
<li>Majestic-12 - we already link to the conspiracy theory page (at which Majestic 12 is adequately covered). Again, there's no evidence (even in the "black" definition of "evidence") to relate Groom and MJ-12, other that Deux Ex (as above).</li>
<li>Purity Control - this is the most vexatious, as the only references I can find about this relate to episodes of the X-Files, and even at that not at Groom (which is why the X-files isn't referenced). Several months have passed and no Purity Control article is forthcoming (which might contradict this), so I can't see a justification for leaving it.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is obvious that every security measure taken around Area 51 is given a lot of attention. What is interestin, however, is whether this level of security and hiding activities is typical. Three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are many large facilities belonging to NASA/Air Force/CIA/White House, etc. with the same level of security protection (including taking out satellite pics from TerraServer or not allowing them in the first place).</li>
<li>All facts included in the article are taken out of context and in reality the security is quite lax, access limitations are tolerable and you can even book a guided tour if you ask nice.</li>
<li>The measures taken at Area 51 are special. In all other places there is much more transparency and openness.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the option 3 is correct, we have a further choice - what is the reason for these measures. One possibility is that they are taken only because all American wackos and tin-foil heads try to infiltrate this facility, preventing boring but useful work on testing toxic paint used on aircraft chassis or something. Another possibility is that the nature of the work warrants the secrecy, i.e. the government is doing something as exciting as studying UFOs and aliens (or something real, but no less "exciting" like bioweapons).</p>
<p>So does anyone know how the security measures compare with other government facilities. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParanoid_098f.html" title="User:Paranoid">Paranoid</a> 11:58, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of the things you mention in point 1 are surprisingly insecure. NASA Ames is beside a freeway, protected by a chainlink fence (no guard towers, dogs, etc.). A few years ago someone managed to sit right outside the CIA gates and shoot a bunch of people with a rifle (dissapointingly, men in black did not immediately spring from the bushes). Edwards AFB doesn't even have a fence for much of its perimeter. Even the whitehouse just has a rather old fence. The actually secure parts of all of these facilities is really very small (the insides of buildings, mostly). And Area 51 really isn't <i>that</i> secure itself. It doesn't have a fence or guard towers, and a few years ago some Greenpeace activists, heading for Yucca flats, walked within a couple of miles and camped overnight at Papoose lake (supposed site of alien stuff at S-1); they didn't get picked up until they got sick of walking on the playa and walked down a road. Compared with other very very large places (and it is very large - you could fit several major cities into the valley) like air bases it is unusually secure. The security measures (as described in the article) overwhelmingly support the hypothesis that Groom is a nice quiet place for the Airforce to test its secret planes without them appearing in the papers. Stuff like bioweapons and death rays really don't need such a huge range, and most sinister plots and schemes can easily be conducted indoors anyway. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 01:20, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've removed the stuff about google containing lower-resolution landsat images - this is true, but it's because google presents lower resolution landsat imagery than the original source in general. Worldwind doesn't do this, and show the same resolution imagery for Groom as for anywhere else. Worldwind users (and google maps users too) shouldn't be confused by the very highly detailed images available for most major metropolises in the US - these aren't satellite photos at all, but montages USGS aerial photography (and are available only for major cities, due to the expense of generating them). So there's no conspiracy to be had in analysing google - they're just saving on bandwidth costs. Worldwind sees the same redacted USGS 1m imagery as MS Terraserver (they share the same datasource) - as the whole Nellis range is blocked out this isn't <i>prima facie</i> evidence of dark doings at Groom. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Fader_67b5.html" title="User:John Fader">John Fader</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Fader_436f.html" title="User talk:John Fader">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_John_Fader_67c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/John Fader"><i>contribs</i></a>) 20:34, 2 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article says: <i>"It is part of the vast (4687 sq. mi. / 12139 km²) Nellis Range Complex (NRC)"</i> - which does not (yet) have its own article.

<dd>You are (as far as one can really tell) correct. The informal term "Nellis Range" does generally mean NAFR+NTS. At some point I plan to produce a map that shows NTS, NAFR, Area 51, and maybe the Desert National Wildlife Reserve and the National Wildhorse Management Area (the latter two overlap the former three in a hard-to-draw way) - that map and a small amount of text would be the "nellis range" article. The reason I say "as far as one an really tell" is that different sources place Area 51 either as part of NAFR or as some weird hybrid NAFR/NTS controlled area. Anyway, in the meantime I'll make the change you suggest. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 15:49, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just thought i should say that is it likely that the USA, the most technologically advanced nation in the world with almost bottomless resources in terms of information suppression, would allow photographs of a top secret facility to be disseminated on the internet without either substantial modification or substitution for more innocent photos? In short: the USA aren't so stupid as to allow photographs of their top-secret base to be released.</p>
<dl>
<dd>For deep-secret stuff like this, we really don't know. Absent evidence that doesn't exist, all of the following are "credible":
<ul>
<li>there's an airbase in the desert; it's full of secrets</li>
<li>the fact that we know about it makes it not terribly secret, so it's all misdirection (and the real secret place is elsewhere)</li>
<li>they're not stupid, so they'd expect we'd think the obvious base was misdirection. So it's the best place for the secret stuff (and they love all the alien mythology stuff surround it - anyone who sees something in the sky gets conveniently painted as a space-kook)</li>
<li>ah, but that's what they'd expect us to think... (etc.)</li>
</ul>

<dd>The photos show an airstrip in the Nevada desert, and that's all that can safely be inferred from them. This article really isn't about the secret airbase in Nevada; it's about the stories people tell about the secret airbase in Nevada.

<p>...at least make it funny, clever or observant. 85.96.126.25 said "Can you see that thing in the pic?(at left top corner is it a UFO????)", referring to the picture of the warning sign at the border. Apart from the fact they mean top right and not top left, it did make me think: what <i>is</i> that small hovering object there? I have a few ideas.</p>
<p>1: It's a security camera. From other pics I've seen the stands they are on are extremely thin (and white) and might not necessarily show up in a photo at range. This is highly unlikely as the stand would have to be ridiculously tall for the camera to appear there.</p>
<p>2: It's a pave-hawk helicopter, in the distance, either coming face on towards the photographer or moving away.</p>
<p>3: It's something else.</p>
<p>4: It is actually an alien spacecraft, sizing us up for mutilation.</p>
<p>Sweet dreams everybody&#160;:D</p>
<dl>
<dd>It looks vaguely like a helicopter. I believe the cammo dudes modus operandi when faced with unexpected visitors is for the trucks to keep tabs on then until the chopper arrives. If the visitors decide to go for a walk the chopper flies down and swamps them with its rotorwake, kicking up such a storm of dust that the visitors can't see and have to sit tight. The cammo dudes call for the sheriff who takes the visitors away. This is rather a smart scheme, because it means that the visitors didn't actually get detained by the cammo dudes at all, and so can't question a cammo dude in any subsequent legal proceedings. In order to get where he is, the photographer has already driven some distance from the highway (and in doing so has marked himself as worthy of cammo dude attention). So you'd expect the chopper to be around by that time. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 10:10, August 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, it probably is a chopper, although according to the excellent dreamland resort site detentions are less regular that you suggest, and are almost exclusively reserved for those who actually cross the (poorly marked!) border into the restricted area. The story about the bloke getting a dust storm courtesy of the helicopter on public land seems to be true, however, despite the fact that its clearly harrassment (sp?). From what I've read, cammos go out of their way to avoid being seen - that one in the jeep on the crest of the hill in the pic may well be about to kick into reverse gear! --<a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemonAndLime_f195.html" title="User:LemonAndLime">LemonAndLime</a> 11:50, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm fairly sure those aren't employee cars (it is a curiously large car park, I'll admit). Most of them are white, and most look (I think) like trucks or vans. The ones that aren't white all look like some muted colour (khaki or grey, perhaps); I can't see any that are red or blue or green (the colours normal people choose for their vehicles). So I think these must be various facilities vehicles, tenders, shuttlebusses, etc. I don't think anyone commutes overland from Vegas (only the JANETs, as it's so far) and there's no mention anywhere I can find of folks commuting from Alamo etc. by car (they seem to park in city lots near the NAFR shuttle and take it). You're right about the detail, there's all kinds of interesting stuff.

<dd>Everything here is derived from pretty good sources. The geography stuff comes from maps and satellite photos. The history is mostly from Ben Rich's book (which is why it mostly stops with F117, which was 1970s stuff), and some from David Darlington's book. The FAS page was a source for some, and a fact check for others. JANET and base security stuff come from Glen Campbell's website and the Dreamland Resort website. Ideally we'd have something more official than Dreamland Resorts and Glen Campbell, but both are long time respected experts in the field (they're as good as we're likely to get), and all these sources tell pretty much the same story. The article really doesn't say much about what happened at Groom since F117 (because none of these reliable sources say anything much on that subject), and resorts to a little "sourced handwaving" (sources being Darlington, Campbell, Tom Mahood, and Dreamland Resort). We don't say how many people work there, or how many commute, but the buildings Dreamland Resorts thinks are barracks would hold a thousand or more, and the JANET flights (confirmed from numerous sources) would take at least that many again. Absolutely none of this comes from Bob Lazar or the UFO talk show conspiracy guys. We do have to mention the UFO and conspiracy stuff, but it's in its own little box (where I'm very glad to day it's stayed). Ditto for the popular culture stuff. Overall I think the article is pretty conservative about what it says (no claims of death rays, alien visitors, secret prisons, transcontinental underground railroads, etc.). Frankly I think the article is featured-article quality (a translation of it in German is featured on the DE wikipedia, btw), but I've never nominated it, mostly because the sources (while good, and checked against one another) aren't of the same caliber as many articles have available to them (there's no "USAF Guide to Groom Lake", for example). If you find anything that isn't addressed by the exlinks and references quoted in the article, let me know and I'll track down where it came from ASAP. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 15:31, August 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article says that there are only two runways. But Google Earth shows a third runway, 30/12, on the southwestern side of the base. But I don't have any measurements. Can somebody help me out here? <a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayerischermann_8eb2.html" title="User:Bayerischermann">Bayerischermann</a> 04:26, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah you are right, runway 30/12 is normally used as a taxiway but is occasionally used by small prop janet planes. Although i dont know the measurments the article is inaccurate saying 32/14 ia area 51's sole operating runway. Gfad1 11:10, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>dont know if its the one you're talking about, but a recent Discovery channel show (well, I'm actually watching it at the moment, its that recent) shows from two photos that a third, large runway was constructed some time between 1988 and 1994.</dd>

<dd>You may be talking about a new taxiway perpendicular to the 14/32 runways that was built just next to the Janet Terminal. On the more recent GoogleEarth images, it's still under construction (you can see the ground has been cleared/levelled), and Dreamlandresort has pictures of it. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlabreque_0c7c.html" title="User:Flabreque">Flabreque</a> 22:24, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Google Earth, Another lake, at the NorthWest of Area 51, the Satelite image showed that the lake has circles in the center of the lake and on the Northward ground . But The image showed that the lake seemed to have water in it. Do you think this is the place where rumous about the UFOs come from? Here is the coordinate of the place: 37°29'16.29"N 116°13'41.38"W.</p>

<dd>If you have ever read wikipedia you will know it is an online <b>encyclopedia</b>. I hardly think it is a place to discuss where aliens (which FYI dont even exist) come from. Also none of the lakes at or near area 51 have any water in them, they are all dry lakes, so i dont know where you are looking. And finally those rings are bombing targets for all the air force training which goes on in the area. Gfad1 15:55, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anon: that lake is Kawich Dry Lake, and the circles on it as, as Gfad1 says, are gunnery targets used by pilots training at the NAFR. Let's face it - if someone was hiding aliens, they'd not be silly enough to leave a big sign on the ground that could be spotted by some teenager on Google Maps, would they? Gfad11: it's not true that the lakes <i>never</i> have any water in them, just not very much, and not for very long. Las Vegas gets around 4 inches of rainfall every year (I was there in January and it poured for three days solid), and Groom gets much the same. In a dry winter it's enough to make the Groom playa squishy, and in a wet one the entire lake will have a few inches of standing water. It can last a week or more like that. This, of course, gives the lie to the nonsense about the "Cheshire Airstrip" (the claimed runway at Papoose Lake which supposedly appears when it's sprayed with water), as it would get nice and wet and visible in the winter rains. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 16:42, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you really must go (there's absolutely nothing whatever for you to see), you'd go to Las Vegas and then follow the map on this page. That'll get you to Rachel (as will a regular Rand McNally roadmap). Beyond that you'd need to travel over dirt roads. Someone in Rachel will gladly sell you a map, but you have to realise that if you actually succeeded in getting far enough onto onto government land to see anything they they absolutely would kill you, or at the very least throw you in a hole so deep you could apply for Australian citizenship. IMO there's absolutely no point whatver in going anywhere near Area 51 (a bleaker, duller, more blasted place you'd never find); I'm sure people are going to discover more about Area 51, but they'll do so in America's courtrooms and archives, not by driving around in the desert. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 21:27, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anon changed the sentence saying the hangar-18 song is about groom to being about wright-patterson AFB. He might well be right; there's not much evidence. The malmsteen song clearly is about area 51 (that's the name of the album its on) and there is a hangar 18 at groom (<a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/overhead/ikonos_040400_overview_04.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fas.org/irp/overhead/ikonos_040400_overview_04.htm" rel="nofollow">FAS</a>). But, bar the usual angelfire weirdies, there's little to say the one in the songs the one at groom.

<dd>I don't think it's worth mentioning at all; it's not our job to refute every crazy unsourced sub-Art Bell fantasy. We mention, in general, the various wack theories people have about Groom, but I think we should leave a point-by-point discussion, and refutation, to detailed websites like Dreamland Resort. I think both the claims and their refutations rely on too much unsourced hearsay.

<p>The Hangar 18 of alien legend is definitely located at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio. This is where the "alien bodies" from the Roswell crash were supposedly taken in 1947, and thenceforth the hangar became a top secret, restricted access area. The story goes that President Truman once asked to see the place, and the Air Force Chief of Staff at the time (I believe it was either Hap Arnold or Curtis LeMay - forgive me) famously said something along the lines of, "hell no, and don't ever ask again!" Nonsense, to be sure. At any rate, in those days Wright-Patterson was home to the Air Force's leading research center, and it would be at least plausible that if something sensitive were recovered (at Roswell or anywhere else), Wright-Pat is probably where it would have been taken in 1947. There is in fact a Hangar 18 there (as there is on most Air Force bases with at least 18 hangars), and it is indeed a restricted-access hangar. However, many bases have such restricted areas, that doesn't necessarily mean classified material or equipment is stored there. There are any number of reasons for a hangar to be restricted.</p>
<p>As for the Area 51 connection/confusion, it's quite simple. There is indeed a Hangar 18 at Groom Lake, and it happens to be the largest hangar on the base. Some who are only superficially familiar with the "Hangar 18" legend notice its presence at Area 51, and then naturally tend to add 2 and 2, coming up with 5. "Of course! Area 51 has aliens, and they're kept in Hangar 18, which I can see right there in the picture!" They're either unaware, or choose to ignore, that the base at Area 51 didn't exist in 1947.</p>
<p>If you insist on believing a myth (captured alien spacecraft), at least place the myth at its proper geographic location! Crazed actor 17:44, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You were quite right to do so: it's bollocks. The problem with Google Earth/maps is that every twelveyearold thinks he's a photoreconnaissance expert, and the whole Nellis/NTS area gives them apoplexy. It's full of weird looking roads, installations, gunnery targets, pipelines, pylons, and the odd airbase. We occasionally have to fight off exlinks to mad sites which claim they can see flying saucer launchers and alien autopsy shacks, where in fact all that's there is some fairly standard airbase type stuff and a huge amount of discarded military junk. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 20:16, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the interview is notable and should be mentioned. If the article is kept we should link there, if it isn't then we should mention it (but one or two paras is enough). Linking to such things is a problem however we do it - it's (almost certainly) a copyvio when its on google vido or youtube or whatever (and we should avoid linking to copyvios) and equally we're not in the advertising business, so a link to a "buy this now" is bad too.

<dd>Good catch, clearly a hoax addition (shame we didn't catch it much sooner). That said, I don't agree that the airphones and upholstery are, by themselves, a giveaway (naturally the other pic you found clearly is). As the 737s are leased, they've probably been in the service of regular airlines before, so you'd expect regular airline fittings like airphones and branded upholstery. There's no reason the USAF or the leasing company would take these out (although I'm sure the airphones won't actually work). <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMiddenface_dcff.html" title="User:Middenface">Middenface</a> 13:48, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&gt; The Ninth Circuit rejected Turley's appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear it, putting an end to the complainants' case. &lt;</p>
<p>This statement is not necessarily true. The U.N. has authority to operate international courts, so the widows could try to obtain remedy there. The worlwide negative publicity would probably force US Gov't to settle for big money and provide the necessary info for medical treatment. 195.70.48.242 09:30, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, the UN can't do that. If a country's supreme court rejects or refuses to hear an appeal, the case ends there. The UN is only involved in prosecuting people accused of things like war crimes or genocide, and even then the United States has an exemption which prevents any of its citizens being prosecuted by the UN. I don't think the rest of the world cares that much about one person's illness when there's literally thousands of people being butchered every day in various civil wars. What happened to Turley is wrong, but the international arena isn't going to be of any help.</dd>
