<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thanks</span></h2>
<p>Hi Blacksun, good work so far on the Hinduism article. I'm glad you took to working on the article — I myself would have liked to continue to contribute, but work has caught up with me. With regards to the reasoning behind one of your recent edits "Support: Their was no such section in original FA", keep in mind that FA candidacy is considerably harder now than it used to be when Hinduism got featured in 2004. Negative aspects and alternate viewpoints on any subject are required and those reviewing FACs come down pretty hard on such articles. While I feel that the current lenght of the Hindu nationalism is appropriate, this may be something to keep in mind as you continue to make edits to the article. Cheers, and one again, good job!

<dd>Thanks, I was actually going to message you but I saw that you are busy and did not. Yep, I realize that it is lot tougher and opposite views should be given. However, I did not think their was any need to talk about BJP etc. More details can be found by clicking on Ayodhya. I am definitely not the kind to do POV. Just trying to balance things out. I really hope that you and some of the others can eventually pitch in with the references. I do not have access to good books and such just some articles.

<p>I see the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Portal_talk%7EIndia_9e0e.html" title="Portal talk:India">consensus</a> is that we nominate it to <a href="../../../f/p/c/WP%7EFPCAN_b4b5.html" title="WP:FPCAN">WP:FPCAN</a>. I think you should nominate it. Per Shreshth91's suggestion, peer review needs to be archived first.

<dd>I agree. I see the whole selected article review process as redundant fork of the <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>. I had already <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotice_board_for_India-related_topics_7a67.html#.7B.7Bindian_selected.7D.7D" title="Wikipedia talk:Notice board for India-related topics">wanted</a> the template removed from the talk pages since it says the article was reviewed but it was not. As you say, we can keep cycling through the India related featured articles until new ones get added. - <font color="navy"><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaneshk_9519.html" title="User:Ganeshk">Ganeshk</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGaneshk_3d44.html" title="User talk:Ganeshk">talk</a>)</font> 23:50, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I was actually frustated earlier because people were not making any comments. But I am also responsible because it was not publicized properly. But I think, it will get good response now.

It does seem good now. You have done some changes to Template:Indian selected which are appericiable.

<p>Hey there, I'll be glad to take a look at the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis_%28band%29.html" title="Genesis (band)">Genesis</a> article and offer some suggestions. However, I'm gonna be busy for much of this week, so I might not get a good look at it until later this week or this weekend. As for critical reviews, Rolling Stone Online has all their music reviews since the magazine was published on their website. That helped me for some of the earlier reviews, both good and bad. I also used All Music Guide, which some contributors to WP pan for some reason, although I've never understood why (There are published books, a decent website, etc.). I also found a somewhat critical review on the Entertainment Weekly website. Of them, I'd recommend Rolling Stone's as a favorite, since just about every album is on there somewhere.</p>
<p>Best of luck with getting that article together. I'll help whenever I can. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 02:12, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey there, I've begun a copy edit of the Genesis article, although I'm only about halfway done. I've also added some suggestions on the peer review. You will notice that I've "tidied" the article a bit, deleting redundant and unneccessary words to make the article more consise, and attempting to eliminate passive voice. Let me know if you like the direction I'm using. Also, I moved <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis_Discography_65ff.html" title="Genesis Discography">Genesis Discography</a> to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genesis_discography.html" title="Genesis discography">Genesis discography</a>, as "discography" should be lowercased (My mistake, as I had it the other way in the peer review). I corrected any link which originally went to the other page. I also added links to <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Collins_discography_bf50.html" title="Phil Collins discography">Phil Collins discography</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Gabriel_discography_7119.html" title="Peter Gabriel discography">Peter Gabriel discography</a> in the "See also" section of the Genesis discography. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 19:54, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey there -- I think nominating it for FAC might be a crapshoot in terms for success, meaning it can go either way. The information is definitely there and it's certainly impressive, but I'm still concerned with some of the writing. I've tidied it as best as I could, but there's still a considerable amount of passive voice in the article (such as "is/was", "had/had", etc.) which I don't know if I corrected. Two other things I noticed missing today -- no explanation as to what happened to Ray Wilson in his section (ie, was he fired from the band, etc.), and the influences on Genesis section gives a sizable section to Tony Banks but little to nothing on the other members.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That having been said, I think it would have a strong chance in the FAC process, and I don't foresee any major problems which can't be fixed. The article is a comprehensive overview of Genesis, and worst case scenario is mild objections, and best case is success as a FA! It certainly has the qualifications.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for voting, I don't know if I should, considering recent objections in the Pokemon (i.e. Bulbasaur) and <a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Belong_Together_d83f.html" title="We Belong Together">We Belong Together</a> nominations obtaining a bunch of support votes by friends of the author and contributors to the article. If anything, I think my vote might actually hurt you since I helped with the copy edit and wrote the Collins article. I would be happy to leave a comment, however, stating that the article appears to hold a good deal of information and an excellent overview of the group.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Either way, be sure to let me know so I can watch over the article's progress. I think it has a good chance, considering the peer review has been quite favorable and helpful. Best of luck! --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 01:50, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, ok. Well, I think the article is just about ready then. Again, you might have some mild objections here and there, but nothing that is major or that couldn't be fixed. As the reviews on the peer review have been positive, and you've worked on the majority of suggestions, this has a good chance at success. Best of luck with the FAC process, and as always, I'll be happy to review the article again should any changes need to be made. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 18:41, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey there -- good work on the FAC so far. Looks like a bunch of comments and a support as of this writing. It was similar for the FAC for Phil Collins, which only had about four supports but no unresolved objections and a TON of comments. Hopefully, the process continues smoothly. Hope all's well. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 16:43, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks much better now, especially the discography (although I'm still not sure that live and compilation albums need to be in the main article, the formatting and double-column style really tightens it up anyway). I noticed that, as you said, there's still some copyediting to be done, but once it's finished you'll have my vote in an FAC. I'm rather busy outside of Wikipedia these days so haven't had time, but you might want to drop <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETuf-Kat_083e.html" title="User:Tuf-Kat">Tuf-Kat</a> a line asking if he or another project member could evaluate the article based on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_Music_Project_3d0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured Music Project">FMP</a> guidelines, which helps a bit more in assuring a successful FAC. - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharm</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">bum</a> 06:51, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I know it will be very demanding job! If you someday get some time, it will be helpful. (I hope I am not sounding greedy and worthless one who just wants from people!)....THANKS A LOT.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 07:50, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not know how to express my gratitude. You have done a WONDERFUL work. Do you happen to create such maps often? Nichalp is also doing some new SVG map of India.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 04:56, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am really feeling ashamed for again calling you for help. There is a minor task foe you. In the inset map of Kolkata, the "star" for locating the city proper falls on the west bank (left side) of the river. Actually it should be on the east bank (right side). The Koklkata Municipal corporation area is on the right side. Please see if you can modify ( hope this won't be a major task for you). Thanks a lot.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re:Jinnah</span></h2>
<p>Hi AreJay - thanks for your compliments. Regarding Jinnah's nationality - "South Asian" is not a nationality or citizenship, and includes (Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan) so it can't be right. I personally feel that describing Jinnah as an Indian while crediting him as founder of Pakistan in the same sentence cannot be wrong or hurtful really. Thanks for taking the time to discuss this issue, becoz I know it could become a problem, and I'm grateful for your advice on the matter. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 16:27, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have added the pronunciation of Bangalore and Bengaluru.

<dd>Aah. How can I forget that Kannada doesn't have a small 'u' but only a big 'u' and a bigger 'u'. Never mind. I uploaded another version that should be fine, although somehow it was very difficult to maintain the intonation. Everytime either the first syllable became quite and the second loud or the 'u' sould would hear like a small 'u'. See if its Ok now. If its not, I will ask one Kannada friend of mine to do it. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 13:02, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding India Selected Article, there are many articles in the list that are not related to India, rather universal. Also, there are some articles that, though related to India, do not meet the critera for India SA. I have nominated 2 such articles as <a href="../../../i/n/d/Portal%7EIndia_Selected_article_removal_candidates_5370.html" title="Portal:India/Selected article removal candidates">SA removal candidates</a>. IMO, their selection as SA in the first place seems to be biased in the sense that the topic, rather than the SA criteria, were given more importance. Please see and comment. This SA list needs urgent attention.

<p>Hi AreJay - I'm very sorry to have disappointed your expectation in me, but it had become impossible for me to compromise my principles. I don't covet adminship at all, so it wasn't a difficult decision - I simply cannot accept misrepresentation and nonsense. However, I cannot tell you how greatly joyous I feel at the enthusiastic, wonderful support you expressed for me. I don't know how hard it will be to understand that your supports means extremely a lot to me. I thank you from my heart, and please let me know if I can ever be assistance or help in anything. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 19:54, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a>, I now have an account on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://test.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">test.wikipedia.org</a></span> with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_suggestions_a7f1.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/suggestions">suggestions</a> for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Past Band Members</span></h2>
<p>Hi there. Just a quick query in the particuar context of the Genesis edit. If you go back to history immediately before my edit you'll find that the past band members were in no clear order at all. I just thought reverse chrono was the most logical in the context. Is alphabetic more commonly accepted in this circumstance? (PS - you can answer here, save bouncing between pages. I have it on watch.) Cheers. <a href="../../../c/a/i/User%7ECain_Mosni_a2a0.html" title="User:Cain Mosni">Cain Mosni</a> 15:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Cain, the reason I changed the list to alphabetical was because of the problems associated with a chronological list. The rearrangement per your edit wasn't 100% accurate since Steve Hackett got hired in after Collins did (his name should have appeared before Collins'). Also, since Genesis was formed from two other school bands (Anon and Garden Wall), the question of "Who's name appears last in the reverse chrono list" is not easy to answer and may therefore lead to misinterpretation. I was hoping to simplify the list by reverting to the alphabetical format. Hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns wrt my edits.
