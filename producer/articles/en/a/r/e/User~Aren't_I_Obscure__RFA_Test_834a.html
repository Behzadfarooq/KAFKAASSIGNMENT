In my time here, I've developed a strong involvement in a number of projects, particularly <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_662f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games">WikiProject CVG</a> (most importantly, maintaining the list of CVG deletions, and contributing to those debates), NewPage Patrolling and, recently, responding to all new requests for Editor Review in the most helpful way that I can.</p>
<p>I've yet to produce an FA-class article, sadly, but I'm working on that. My involvement at articles such as <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computer_game.html" title="Personal computer game">Personal computer game</a> (an ongoing attempt at improvement) and cleanup of <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Rights_Management_7b35.html" title="Digital Rights Management">Digital Rights Management</a> are examples of major contributions I've made, and I believe they demonstrate a level of competence in editing articles, and my two Editor reviews (the most recent of which can be found <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_RandyWang_2_3c38.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/RandyWang 2">here</a>) are the result of my eagerness to improve.</p>
<p>The majority of my activity is in CVG-related projects, and NewPage Patrolling. Because of my specific involvement in these two activities, I would appreciate the ability to clear backlogs at <a href="../../../c/s/d/C%7ECSD_87ad.html" title="C:CSD">C:CSD</a> and close debates at <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>; I'd certainly like to take a bite into those tasks, rather than simply palming the work off to someone else. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandyWang_b828.html" title="User:RandyWang">RandyWang</a> (<span style="font-size: smaller;"><sup><a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandyWang_f768.html" title="User talk:RandyWang"><b>chat</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_RandyWang_2_3c38.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/RandyWang 2"><b>patch</b></a></sub></span>) 12:38, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dt>Questions for the candidate</dt>
</dl>
<p>Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia in this capacity. Please take the time to answer a few generic questions to provide guidance for voters:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> What sysop chores, if any, would you anticipate helping with? Please check out <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_backlog_317c.html" title="Category:Wikipedia backlog">Category:Wikipedia backlog</a>, and read the page about <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrators</a> and the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_reading_list_6f0f.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list">administrators' reading list</a>.
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> As mentioned in my introduction above, I would mainly like to help with clearing deletion backlogs, especially at <a href="../../../c/s/d/C%7ECSD_87ad.html" title="C:CSD">C:CSD</a>. I spend a large amount of my free time adding to other peoples' workloads by tagging new articles for speedy deletion, so I would definitely appreciate the ability to cut into the backlogs that I've helped to create in the past.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, my experience with <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> debates has increased my interest in closing AfDs, since I've developed a good knowledge of Wikipedia policy as it relates to the inclusion of articles. I'd like to involve myself in closing these debates, rather than simply voting on them, especially in cases that appear to approach <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> and the like - that is, where a clear consensus has already been developed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I <i>am</i> a quick and eager learner, so would happily involve myself in any other activites needing particular attention at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_backlog_317c.html" title="Category:Wikipedia backlog">Category:Wikipedia backlog</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>2.</b> Of your articles or contributions to Wikipedia, are there any about which you are particularly pleased, and why?
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> I'm quite happy with a number of my contributions to Wikipedia, especially in my work at articles such as <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computer_game.html" title="Personal computer game">Personal computer game</a> (which is currently ongoing, with a number of major changes pending on the talk page), <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Rights_Management_7b35.html" title="Digital Rights Management">Digital Rights Management</a> through my involvement with the Cleanup Task Force, and "minor" articles such as <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_of_information.html" title="Point of information">Point of information</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_debate.html" title="Comedy debate">Comedy debate</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Aside from those contributions, I'm very happy to help out in giving reviews (and posting editing statistics) for users at <a href="../../../e/r/_/WP%7EER_5c78.html" title="WP:ER">WP:ER</a>, largely because it gives me a chance to promote valuable activities such as <a href="../../../r/c/p/WP%7ERCP_b874.html" title="WP:RCP">recent change patrolling</a> that new and inexperienced users tend to neglect. I'm happy that I've been able to remain civil throughout my dealings with users under review, and always try to present suggestions as a means of improvement, rather than as a criticism, and with an appropriate level of explanation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>3.</b> Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or do you feel other users have caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> Oh, of course I have. Indeed, when I first came to Wikipedia ("for reals," this previous May) I came almost immediately into a conflict with User:Xino, which persisted for a number of weeks. My involvement in the dispute prompted me to check out Wikipedia's various Dispute Resolution processes, leading first to a request for a third opinion (responded to by the sadly-departed admin, <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a>), and eventually to a Request for Arbitration. Xino was blocked shortly thereafter, although I'd have preferred for him to simply continue editing in a moderated way (he <i>did</i> contribute useful content, after all).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This very first conflict taught me a lot about the way we deal with disputes at Wikipedia. Since then, I have <i>always</i> attempted to disassociate myself from conflicts, in the sense that I keep in them perspective - they're disputes on a website, not personal attacks from close friends. With that mindset, I find that it's fairly easy to prevent myself from becoming offended by other users', and always try to walk away from conflicts when I realise that I've acted in error. I have done so in the past, and will continue to do so in the future: with a sense of perspective, I find that editing Wikipedia has remained consistently enjoyable throughout various conflicts during my time here.</dd>

<li><b>switch to Weak support after edit conflict</b> per Kusma. Of course, the times he was right do not show up in his contribs. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 15:17, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<b>Further rationale</b>-- In his talk pages, he seems knowledgeable and articulate. I think the Xino affair shows he can handle conflict constructively. I believe if he takes a little more time to think things through he will make the right decisions. Also, with the delay between the time an article is tagged for speedy deletion and the time he'll get to it, the editor of the article will have been able to improve it out CSD criteria. A lot of new articles look like gibberrish. It is not practical when checking new articles to leave an article and then come back to it. If the creator can fix it before the admin deletes it or intends to, there is always the "hang on" tag. As an admin, he can compare the tagged version with the current one and then decide. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 19:41, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not ready to make a final determination, but this was a speedy deletion nomination on an article that was only 3 minutes old, and he did not try to contact the author who is a newbie.

<dd>Have you ever actually done newpage patrol? There are thousands of new articles every few hours... we can't really keep up with them even under the current practice, if we were required to wait for a reply from the creator (owner?) of the article to do anything, things would be even worse. That said, the article clearly asserts importance (even if arguably dubious) and adding a speedy tag was not good. Newpage patrolling only works if you have a clear grasp of what can and can't be speedied. We're not just sweeping things under the rug. Not sure if the candidate should be opposed over one db-bio though. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 14:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, thanks for pointing that out - I hadn't realised I'd bitten a newbie, and I'll try to keep my wits about me for such transgressions in the future. I was careless with this one, especially in light of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARoriordan&amp;diff=71153689&amp;oldid=71153562" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARoriordan&amp;diff=71153689&amp;oldid=71153562" rel="nofollow">this</a> subsequent edit by <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">User:ERcheck</a>, which I didn't see until now.

<dd>In fact, of the 8 most recent {{db}}'s I can find in your contributions, all of them were tagged 2 minutes or less after their first edit, with no user talk, and many were newbies. (In a couple of cases you talked with the author after s/he contested the speedy).

<li><b>Oppose</b> for a few reasons. First, the diff provided by Crzrussian shows a lack of understanding of very basic notability policies. For those unfamiliar with Gaelic football and it's representation on Wikipedia, playing in the All-Ireland Cup is a very big deal. While the sport and its athletes are undercovered on Wikipedia, there are at least 100 articles on footballers and managers. What's more is that Seán O'Brien was already on Wikipedia as a redlink <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_GAA#Cork_Gaelic_Football_Squad" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_GAA#Cork_Gaelic_Football_Squad" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This is especially concerning if the user wants to use the admin buttons to deal with the CSD backlog and close AfD's. Also, half of the candidate's edits have been made in the past month. This leads me to believe that this RfA is a bit premature and the candidate would do well to have some more experience <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 14:15, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><s><b>Oppose</b></s> I keep running into instances where the speedy tag was misapplied in Randy's edits. <i>I need an admin who understands speedy deletes better than I do.</i> That way when I misapply a tag, they can remove it and tell where I went wrong instead of deleting the article. <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim">:) Dlohcierekim</a> 14:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Neutral</b> leading towards support. Some of the speedy deletion tags are used in articles which have some notable content in them. His lack of basic notablility policies is also a concern.

<li><b>Neutral</b> - Crzrussian has a point, but I really can't blame RandyWang for it. However, it is a self-nom, which although showing guts, requires higher standards.
