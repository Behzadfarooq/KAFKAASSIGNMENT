<p>Annihilation Nation is the Solana Galaxy's favourite deathcourse. Contestants battle to survive arena and gauntlet challenges, with prizes up for grabs for winning participants. Ratchet had to make his way through numerous challenges to acquire new gadgets and more information on Dr. Nefarious.</p>
<p><a name="Aranos" id="Aranos"></a></p>

<p>The mountains on this world are the home of an airborne laboratory belonging to former Megacorp employee Angela Cross, who used it as a refuge after stealing the Protopet, until it was raided by Megacorp's newest commando: Ratchet. Later, the vessel is appropriated by Thugs-4-less, who use it as a prison, incarcerating Ratchet and Clank there.</p>

<p>A dry, almost dead planet. In <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratchet_%26_Clank_062b.html" title="Ratchet &amp; Clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>, Skid McMarxx's ship was attacked in orbit over the planet, and crashed at Outpost X11, a weapons facility under construction. During the war against Dr. Nefarious, Ratchet helps the Galactic Rangers battle against the Tyhrranoids at Outpost X12.</p>
<p><a name="Aquatos" id="Aquatos"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Areas_in_the_Ratchet_%26_Clank_series_1bed.html" title="Edit section: Aquatos">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aquatos</span></h2>
<p>This planet is 99% water. The inhabitants of this planet are either aquatic creatures, or they live in the connected network of tunnels on the sea floor. In this level, Ratchet and Clank must split up to find Dr. Nefarious' hideout. Ratchet can also buy Ratchet &amp; Clank 2 weapons from Slim Cognito and search for Sewer Crystals for the plumber to earn bolts. It is also mentioned as the home planet of Hydro-Girl during <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deadlocked.html" title="Deadlocked">Deadlocked</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Barlow" id="Barlow"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Areas_in_the_Ratchet_%26_Clank_series_1bed.html" title="Edit section: Barlow">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Barlow</span></h2>
<p>A barren wasteland filled with deserts and canyons only known for its hoverbike races. Ratchet &amp; Clank must travel to Barlow to see if they can join the Desert Riders, elite hoverbike racers that might provide information on Thugs-4-Less.</p>
<p><a name="Batalia" id="Batalia"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Areas_in_the_Ratchet_%26_Clank_series_1bed.html" title="Edit section: Batalia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Batalia</span></h2>
<p>This island world was under attack by the Blarg, assaulted with tanks, bombers, and fighter jets. Ratchet and Clank assisted a commando fighting the Blarg here, and shot down the Blargian bombers with the help of their old friend the Plumber.</p>
<p><a name="Boldan" id="Boldan"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Areas_in_the_Ratchet_%26_Clank_series_1bed.html" title="Edit section: Boldan">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Boldan</span></h2>
<p>A planet that provides Silver City, a busy metropolitan area that is populated by millions of people. When Fizzwidget announces that he will sell Protopets for free, Ratchet &amp; Clank rush to the scene in an attempt to stop him, only to be captured by Thugs-4-Less in a devious trap.</p>
<p><a name="Catacrom_Four" id="Catacrom_Four"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Areas_in_the_Ratchet_%26_Clank_series_1bed.html" title="Edit section: Catacrom Four">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Catacrom Four</span></h2>
<p>The Catacrom Graveyard on Catacrom Four is a world in the Shadow Sector once used as a robot burial ground. The undead formerly resting underneath the earth have not taken kindly to DreadZone using the planet as an obstacle course, and are likely to take it out on any contestants who walk over their graves.</p>
<p><a name="Cerebella" id="Cerebella"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Areas_in_the_Ratchet_%26_Clank_series_1bed.html" title="Edit section: Cerebella">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cerebella</span></h2>
<p>Planet Cerebella has not been visited in the Ratchet and Clank games yet, but it is mentioned several times on Galactic Gladiators. Cerebella is the home planet of the B2 Brawler and was where it was created. It is possibly a dangerous planet, since the host of Galactic Gladiators always refers to it in rather disturbing sentences: "From the depths of Cerebella" for example.</p>
<p><a name="Challax" id="Challax"></a></p>

<p>A water planet with numerous island cities. In <a href="../../../g/o/i/Ratchet_%26_Clank%7E_Going_Commando_f86a.html" title="Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</a>, Ratchet travels to Damosel to try and stop the Protopet menace after they nearly destroy Allgon City. Ratchet makes his way through banks, shopping centers and surburban areas to find a mysterious Hypnotist that will make a Hypnomatic if Ratchet can find the parts. Ratchet can also grind on the train rails to acquire one of those parts.</p>

<p>Another Giant Clank fight, this time on the moon of Damosel Orbit. A U.F.O. Mothership was waiting on the world for a challenger, and Ratchet and Clank defeated her and her children to acquire the Map-O-Matic, a gadget that allowed Ratchet to see hidden areas on the map.</p>

<p>An unknown world that Ratchet can travel to in Ratchet &amp; Clank 2. It contains the Insomniac Museum, a building that provides background information to the Ratchet &amp; Clank universe and unused ideas for the first two games. In <a href="../../../u/p/_/Ratchet_%26_Clank%7E_Up_Your_Arsenal_cf61.html" title="Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</a>, the planet is called "Insomniac Museum". In Ratchet &amp; Clank 2 the museum contains a small patch of super realistic water that got taken out because it strained the ps2 to its limits. there was also a jet ski device, a giant tank boss, and an effect creator, to name a few. Ratchet and Clank 3s museum contained a dune buggy race course and an unused qwark vid comic among other things,</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../s/i/z/Ratchet_and_Clank%7E_Size_Matters_2f59.html" title="Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters">Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters</a>, the duo visit the Danyi Moon. It is a farming and agricultural area growing deadly sheep and cows among other animals. This is the level where Ratchet &amp; Clank kill Luna. Another interesting point to make is the day and night system used on this moon.</p>
<p><a name="Daxx" id="Daxx"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Areas_in_the_Ratchet_%26_Clank_series_1bed.html" title="Edit section: Daxx">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Daxx</span></h2>
<p>This research facility is home to the information on the Biobliterator. Ratchet and Clank searched the building to find more intelligence on Dr. Nefarious. They also explored the docks where they discovered that Courtney Gears was in Nefarious' league.</p>
<p><a name="DreadZone_Station" id="DreadZone_Station"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Areas_in_the_Ratchet_%26_Clank_series_1bed.html" title="Edit section: DreadZone Station">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">DreadZone Station</span></h2>
<p>This station is headquarters for the underground combat sport DreadZone. It is divided into three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Containment Suite is a safe area that allows Ratchet to purchase upgrades for weapons and the combat bots, and he can then travel to the Battledome.</li>
