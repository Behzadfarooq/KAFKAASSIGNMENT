<p>This article is so thoroughly riddled with POV issues that I don't know where to begin. I hope others (preferably those smarter than a fifth grader -- a gentle joke there! -- and with more knowledge of the intent and format of Wikipedia articles) have the time to work on it. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 05:12, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to agree, this article is in complete violation of Wikipedia's POV policy. It's littered with opinions that do not belong here at all. But, what else is new? Wikipedia is just another opinionated forum now which lost its unbiased perspective long ago. I especially like that "Educational Perspective" section which is obviously only one "contributor's" opinion, which is loosely "referenced" by some brief, unverified article. The sentence that follows isn't even referenced. To all those who write this way: why can't you stop with your evangelical opinion posting on a website which is intended to be an unbiased encyclopedia? Someone wrote, "All of the kids are staged actors who have set answers given to them...." While I know for a fact that they <i>are</i> actors ("Laura" was on the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Silverman_Program_6865.html" title="Sarah Silverman Program">Sarah Silverman Program</a> on Comedy Central, episode "Not Without My Daughter"), and I, too, think they have the answers given to them (What average 5th grader learns/knows what REM sleep stands for?), there is still no cited proof of this, which means you can't include it here. Until you have a legitimate outside reference that says they have the answers, it's speculation and doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilhelm_Screamer_17e0.html" title="User:Wilhelm Screamer">Wilhelm Screamer</a> 06:07, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

(I learned it out of <i><a href="../../../h/i/g/Highlights_for_Children_a709.html" title="Highlights for Children">Highlights for Children</a></i>.) There's also one more comment that somehow snuck its way back in: The final note under "Trivia" simply states, "The show is scripted." Even if it's true, that isn't trivia, it's unsourced, and it doesn't tell what is scripted. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERon_Stoppable_09a2.html" title="User:Ron Stoppable">Ron Stoppable</a> 22:33, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Considering TV's long-ago history with scripting game shows (see <i>Quiz Show</i>) and the rules that were put in place as a result, it's actually really unlikely (actually, probably impossible and possibly illegal; I just don't know) that the entire show is scripted. I imagine it <i>is</i> possible, and maybe even likely due to none of them missing an answer so far, that the kids are given the answers (since they aren't actually contestants who could win money), but if that's the case, there's got to be at least one reliable source saying so somewhere on the net. And we haven't seen such a link in this article yet. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 00:52, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>LOL at "workbooks". Good catch. Dirty, dirty game shows. And I rather liked that bit about the polar bear answer being incorrect, if it's true that is. I think it's somewhat relevant to the article under trivia, unless we do away with trivia altogether. If it is true, it would be a good pun demonstrating that the show itself isn't smarter than a 5th grader. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilhelm_Screamer_17e0.html" title="User:Wilhelm Screamer">Wilhelm Screamer</a> 11:23, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"and maybe even likely due to none of them missing an answer so far" Actually, they've screwed up a few times. However, the only one that is clearly in my memory is the March 15 episode. I believe it was the question "How many Is are in 'Illiterate'". Two of the kids answered three. 66.222.181.28 04:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>From the type of quesitons they ask on the show, and the answers some contestants give, I really believe that this show is staged. One of the questions was, Which state is farthest west?(California, Nevada, or Alaska) The contestant answered California. I can't believe that a 20 something year-old American answered California. Also, the same contestant was overly dramatic.</p>
<p>I agree, after watching the same episode where he couldn't give the answer for half the area of a 12 by 12 inch square, the contestant said he "was drawing a blank," this seams either completely staged, or they must screen the contestants to find absolute morons.</p>
<p>Wow-same with me. After watching the extact same episode as both of you did. I do not think anybody could be so stupid. If anything, this "game-show" seems to celebrate stupidity whereas other gameshows celebrate knowledge. I hope this show never gets to its second season. Seems like Fox's just doing anything now for ratings. ~ænon</p>
<p>A couple of the categories: --3rd Grade Astronomy ( I don't think 3rd Grader's have Astronomy, in fact, I doubt many students in high-school have astronomy )</p>
<p>--5th Grade Algebra (In most states, Algebra is a 9th grade course, although it is often taken in 8th grade or even 7th grade as well, however, not in 5th grader. Algebra is usually beyond 7th, 6th, or 5th grader's comprehension level.)</p>
<p>All in all, I'm 99% confident this show is staged, 68.202.128.153 00:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>the show might be staged, but, I'm a 5th grader and 75% of the stuff thier I don't know! 130.13.98.191 03:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, 5th graders are introduced to proportions, which is basic algebra, but that's about it. 6th and 7th graders have increasing exposure to Algebra, 8th graders taking actual full basic algebra, then the official Algebra I course is reserved for 9th graders. And most third graders take astronomy in their "science" classes, not as an astronomy class like in high school.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Just a thought (I have never seen this show, I do not live in America), but 3rd graders could learn astronomy without having a class called 'astronomy'. For example, I learnt things about the solar system and stars when I was in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_school.html" title="Primary school">primary school</a>. While we didn't do anything <i>called</i> algebra until we were about 12, we solved problems that were really algebra from an early age, and the teachers probably knew they were protoalgebra (things like&#160;? x 9 = 36). So I would guess those are the sort of things you would find in the quiz. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkittle_f631.html" title="User:Skittle">Skittle</a> 16:41, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no evidence that this show is staged. The claim made by the show is that all material is taken out of 5th grade level textbooks, not that the average 5th grader could answer it. It is known that the children get workbooks, but that does not affect the outcome of the game, as they are not the contestants or competing against the contestants. The only algebra question I have seen on the show was the rather simple (paraphrase) "If y = 3x and 3x = 12, what is y?", which, although besides the point, I believe could be answered by a 5th grader (it was a 5th grade level question, too). The category "astronomy" on the show encompasses anything having to do with outer space, which I definitely learned about in elementary school.</dd>
<dd>In any event, do not add claims that the show is staged to the main article, <b>unless there is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">definitive</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">cited</a> proof from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a></b>. —<a href="../../../d/v/a/User%7EDvandersluis_3730.html" title="User:Dvandersluis">Daniel Vandersluis</a><sup>(<a href="../../../d/v/a/User_talk%7EDvandersluis_5366.html" title="User talk:Dvandersluis">talk</a>)</sup> 16:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Moncrief writes: "Why is "[the children]" in there in brackets? Is that in the final credits? Are there other members of the class besides children? Be CLEAR."</p>
<p>Brackets are commonly used to indicate material that is not in the original. The bracketed words were inserted so that it was clear that the <i>children</i> were the ones to get the advance study guide material from the producers. This is because on the show Jeff Foxworthy, in talking to the contestant, sometimes refers to the children as "your classmates" which would then make the <i>contestant</i> a member of the class.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article's audience may include people who have not seen the show. They may not understand exactly who "the class" is. So, in order to BE CLEAR, I added that in the context of the credits, "the class" refers to the children and not anyone else on the show. (I think it is obvious that in the credits, "the class" refers to only the children getting advance study guide material. If the children's "classmate" the contestant also got the advance study guide material, then he or she would do better at answering the questions.)</p>
<p>Since my additional material is misunderstood, in order to NOT CAUSE TROUBLE I have removed the brackets. The quote is now limited to the exact words which appear on the credits. I should also note that anyone with a videotape or Tivo copy of the show can view and verify that this is the wording (taken from the third show aired, Thursday March 1, 2007). Citation junkies are welcome to add this exact date, just in case the wording varies with the airdate. --Pmurph5 23:53, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
