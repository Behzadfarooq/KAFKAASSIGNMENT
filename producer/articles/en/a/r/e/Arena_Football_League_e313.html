<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_Football_League_e313.html" title="Edit section: The Rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Rules</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Field: An indoor padded surface 85 feet wide and 50 yards long with eight-yard endzones. Goal posts are nine-feet wide with a crossbar height of 15 feet (NFL goalposts are 18 1/2 wide with the crossbar at 10 feet). The goalside rebound nets are 30 feet wide by 32 feet high. The bottom of the nets are eight feet above the ground. Sideline barriers are 48 inches high and made of high density foam rubber.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Equipment: The official football is the same size and weight as the National Football League ball. Each ball is manufactured by <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spalding_%28sports_equipment%29.html" title="Spalding (sports equipment)">Spalding Sporting Goods</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Players and Formations: Eight players on the field; 20-man active roster; four-man inactive roster. Substitution: The league originally allowed only 2 substitutions per quarter, however starting in 2007 the AFL instituted free substitution, which almost completely removes the ironman aspect from the game. Formation: Four (4) offensive players must line up on the line of scrimmage. Three (3) defensive players must be down linemen (in a three of four-point stance). One linebacker may blitz on either side of the center. Alignment is two (2) or more yards off the line of scrimmage. No stunting or twisting. Offensive motion in the backfield: One receiver may go in a forward motion before the snap.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Timing: Four 15 minute quarters with a 15-minute halftime. The clock stops for out-of-bounds plays or incomplete passes only in the last minute of each half or when the referee deems it necessary for penalties, injuries or timeouts. Each team is allowed three (3) time-outs per half.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Movement of the Ball and Scoring: Four (4) downs are allowed to advance the ball ten (10) yards for a first down, or to score. Six (6) points for a touchdown. One (1) point for a conversion by place kick after a touchdown, two (2) points for a conversion by drop kick and two (2) points for successful run or pass after a touchdown. Three (3) points for a field goal by placement or four (4) points for a field goal by drop kick. Two (2) points for a safety.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Kicking: Kickoffs are from the goal line. Kickers may use a one-inch tee. Punting is illegal. On fourth down, a team may go for a first down, touchdown or field goal. The receiving team may field any kickoff or missed field goal that rebounds off the net. Any kickoff untouched which is out of bounds will be placed at the 20-yard line or the place where it went out of bounds, whichever is more advantageous to the receiving team.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Passing: Passing rules in Arena Football are the same as outdoor NCAA Football in which receivers must have one foot inbounds. A unique exception involves the rebound nets. A forward pass that rebounds off of the endzone net is a live ball and is in play until it touches the playing surface.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Overtime Rules: Overtime periods are 15 minutes during the regular season and the playoffs. Each team gets one possession to score. If, after each team has had one possession and one team is ahead, that team wins. If the teams are tied after each has had a possession, the next team to score wins.</li>

<p>From its inception, the AFL operated in a state of semi-obscurity; many Americans had heard the term "arena football" but knew little to nothing about the league itself.</p>
<p>From the 1987 season until the late 1990s, the most exposure the league would receive was on ESPN, which would air tape-delayed games, often well after midnight. The league would receive its first taste of wide exposure in 1998, when <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_Bowl_6d89.html" title="Arena Bowl">Arena Bowl XII</a> was televised nationally as part of ABC's <a href="../../../w/i/d/Wide_World_of_Sports_c5e3.html" title="Wide World of Sports">Wide World of Sports</a>.</p>
<p>One of the league's early success stories was the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Drive_9a03.html" title="Detroit Drive">Detroit Drive</a>. A primary team for some of the AFL's most highly regarded players, including <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_LaFrance_8946.html" title="George LaFrance">George LaFrance</a>, [[Garyand Alvin Rettig, as well as being a second career chance for quarterback <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Schlichter_2d09.html" title="Art Schlichter">Art Schlichter</a>, the Drive regularly played before sold out crowds at <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Louis_Arena_fbca.html" title="Joe Louis Arena">Joe Louis Arena</a>, and went to the ArenaBowl every year of their existence (1988-1993). However, the AFL's first dynasty came to an end when their owner, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Ilitch_1d6b.html" title="Mike Ilitch">Mike Ilitch</a> (who also owned Little Caesar's Pizza) bought the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>, and sold the team.</p>
<p>Although the Drive left the league, the AFL still has a number of teams today which it considers "dynasties", including the <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa_Bay_Storm_5511.html" title="Tampa Bay Storm">Tampa Bay Storm</a> (the only team that has existed in some form for all twenty seasons), the <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando_Predators_5dc4.html" title="Orlando Predators">Orlando Predators</a>, and the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Rattlers_c651.html" title="Arizona Rattlers">Arizona Rattlers</a>. The <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Firebirds_826f.html" title="Indiana Firebirds">Albany/Indiana Firebirds</a>, though they only won one championship, could also be considered a dynasty, based on the fact that they achieved the rare feat of remaining in one city for ten years.</p>
<p>In 1993 the league staged its first, and only to date, All-Star game in Des Moines, Iowa, the future home of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Dragons_8112.html" title="New York Dragons">Iowa Barnstormers</a>, as a fundraiser for flood victims in the area. The National Conference defeated the American Conference 64-40 in front of a crowd of 7,189.</p>
<p>While the aforementioned teams have enjoyed success, many teams in the history of the league have enjoyed little to no success. There are also a number of franchises which existed in the form of a number of unrelated teams under numerous management groups until they folded (an example is the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_CityHawks_6d07.html" title="New York CityHawks">New York CityHawks</a> whose owners transferred the team from New York to Hartford to become the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Sea_Wolves_4e58.html" title="New England Sea Wolves">New England Sea Wolves</a> after two seasons, then after another two seasons were sold and became the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Phantoms_0788.html" title="Toronto Phantoms">Toronto Phantoms</a>, who lasted another two seasons until folding). There are a number of reasons why these teams failed, including lack of financial support from owners, lack of media exposure, to the city's plain disinterest in the team. Today, this isn't seen as much of a problem, as team owners typically own other sports franchises as well, receive adequate media coverage from their home cities, and most teams have a sizeable fan base.</p>

<p>The year 2000 brought a heightened interest in the AFL. Then-<a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Rams_0f39.html" title="St. Louis Rams">St. Louis Rams</a> quarterback <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Warner_47c1.html" title="Kurt Warner">Kurt Warner</a>, who was MVP of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXXIV_88b6.html" title="Super Bowl XXXIV">Super Bowl XXXIV</a>, was first noticed because he played quarterback for the AFL's <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Dragons_8112.html" title="New York Dragons">Iowa Barnstormers</a>. While many sports commentators and fans continued to ridicule the league, Warner's story gave the league positive exposure, and it brought the league a new television deal with <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spike_TV_7cad.html" title="Spike TV">TNN</a>, who, unlike ESPN, would televise regular season games live. While it was not financially lucrative, it helped set the stage for what the league would become in the new millennium. Also, the year 2000 brought a spin-off league, the <a href="../../../a/r/e/Arenafootball2.html" title="Arenafootball2">af2</a>, intended to be a developmental league.</p>

<p>Beginning with the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_in_sports.html" title="2003 in sports">2003</a> season, the AFL made a deal with NBC to televise league games, which was renewed for another two years in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. In conjunction with this, the league moved the beginning of the season from May to February (the week after the NFL's <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a>) and scheduled most of its games on Sunday instead of Friday or Saturday as it had in the past. In 2006, due to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Winter_Olympics_f27d.html" title="2006 Winter Olympics">XX Winter Olympic Games</a>, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanley_Cup_a81d.html" title="Stanley Cup">Stanley Cup</a> playoffs and the <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_500.html" title="Daytona 500">Daytona 500</a>, NBC scaled back from weekly coverage to scattered coverage during the regular season, but committed to a full playoff schedule ending with the 20th <a href="../../../a/r/e/ArenaBowl_73cd.html" title="ArenaBowl">ArenaBowl</a>.

Las Vegas owner Jim Ferraro stated during a radio interview that the reason why a deal failed is because <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> refused to show highlights or even mention a product being broadcast on NBC.</p>
<p>For the 2006 season only, the AFL added a national cable deal with OLN (now <a href="../../../v/e/r/Versus_%28TV_channel%29_70cf.html" title="Versus (TV channel)">Versus</a>) for eleven regular-season games and one playoff game.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_19.html" title="December 19">December 19</a>, 2006, ESPN announced the purchase of a minority stake in the AFL. This deal includes television rights for the ESPN family of stations.
