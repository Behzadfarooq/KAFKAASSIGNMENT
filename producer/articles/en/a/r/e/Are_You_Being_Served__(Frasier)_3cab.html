<p>A work colleague of Frasier's - the on-air chef - is leaving <a href="../../../k/a/c/KACL_%28Frasier%29_4d1d.html" title="KACL (Frasier)">KACL</a>, and after the obligatory on-air farewell laced with cooking <a href="../../../p/u/n/Puns.html" title="Puns">puns</a>, Frasier attempts to make a discreet exit in order to avoid both the farewell party and the need to give his colleague a goodbye hug. He succeeds in neither, thanks mainly to Roz's efforts.</p>
<p>Niles, meanwhile, is in uncommonly good spirits; his separation with <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maris_Crane_5df0.html" title="Maris Crane">Maris</a> could soon be over, as he is in negotiating with her to save their marriage, and one of his conditions is that they enter couples counseling. He's even wearing a tie Maris gave him as a gift (cut, no less, from the material of her fat pants following a one-pound weight scare). Unfortunately, Maris' exact words on the subject were 'I'll think about it', and a courier arrives with ill tidings - he serves Niles with <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorce</a> papers.</p>
<p>Niles appears to be taking this bombshell with remarkable cool - a mere facade, however, and one which takes less than ten seconds to disintegrate as he tries to call Maris to cringingly beg her to take him back. When Frasier snatches his phone away, he merely switches his pathetic groveling to Frasier. Eventually, Niles is reminded of the reason that he demanded this separation in the first place - he was tired of groveling to Maris - and despite protesting that he's rested up now, he accepts this new revelation, and merely asks not to talk about it. Unfortunately, when asked if they need service, Frasier's exact words on the subject are "We've already been served."</p>
<p>Later - as Daphne desperately tries to throw out a box of old rubbish belonging to Martin, despite his pleas - Niles arrives to take dinner with Frasier, and thus take his mind off events. In the box, however, they discover an old journal that is revealed to have belonged to their mother, and which details with remarkable accuracy what appears to be the relationship between and characteristics of Frasier and Niles. Both brothers are hit by startling revelations - Frasier discovers that his mother apparently believed him anti-social and taciturn, which would appear to be borne out by his aversion to social hugging.</p>
<p>Niles, meanwhile, is struck by his mother's assertion that he "constantly allows himself to be cowed and dominated, especially by females". It is a declaration that particularly hits home; Niles has not signed the divorce papers, and has instead sent them back with a groveling letter in which he begs Maris to take him back. Frasier's (somewhat lame) attempts at expressing himself through hugging prove insufficient consolation; however as Maris is out of town until later that day, there is still plenty of time to retrieve them.</p>
<p>The brothers 'break in' to Maris' (formerly Niles') home, Niles in particular thrilling in his efforts at being a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_burglar.html" title="Cat burglar">cat burglar</a> (somewhat helped by the fact that he still has a key that, surprisingly, still works in the door). They locate the papers but are surprised by the vicious guard dogs, whom Niles greets as his 'puppies' until they try and bite him; it turns out that, instead of changing the locks, Maris has changed the dogs. And she'll be back home soon.</p>
<p>Meatballs laced with sleeping medication (of which Maris has plenty) prove to be a simple answer; what is complicated, however, are Niles' laughable attempts to throw them, most of which end up in the <a href="../../../k/o/i/Koi.html" title="Koi">koi</a> pond. Eventually, he merely drops them, and the dogs are soon out cold, enabling the brothers to make their escape. Frasier, meanwhile, has been distracted by a portrait of Maris standing next to a tree, which Niles insists is a portrait of the two of them... until he sees it. Maris has had him painted out - and, to add insult to injury, has had his face painted onto a skunk.</p>
<p>This is the last straw for Niles; humiliated and bitter, he rages at his spinelessness, and the many luxurious items in his home - most of which were purchased as gifts to calm Maris after her many tantrums - that seem to bear witness to this (including the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candelabra.html" title="Candelabra">candelabra</a> peace offering marking his doomed attempt at growing a <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moustache.html" title="Moustache">moustache</a>). Even the rare times he told Frasier he had won were fraudulent. Angry, and determined not to be a whipping boy any more, he determinedly signs the divorce papers and removes the begging note. He even determines to walk proudly past the sleeping dogs - until he and Frasier decide that the dogs might only be <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playing_possum.html" title="Playing possum">playing possum</a>.</p>
<p>Back at Frasier's, Martin and Daphne's bickering about Martin's shaving foam heater is interrupted by Niles' revelation at what he has done. The gravity of the situation hits him, however, and he is suddenly wracked with doubt. Frasier attempts to remind him of his newfound determination by re-reading the passage of his mother's journal that inspired it all - but falters when he reaches the description of Niles licking himself and grooming Frasier. It appears that after all that, the Crane boys were named after their pregnant mother's favourite lab <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rats.html" title="Rats">rats</a>.</p>
<p>Realising he's ended his marriage based on the personality evaluation of a <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodent.html" title="Rodent">rodent</a>, Niles enters into the panic attack to end all panic attacks. Hysterical, he finds himself in the bathroom, unable to calm down, and Frasier's desperate pleas with him are ended by what sounds like a loud gunshot. Fortunately, Niles has not taken the most desperate solution; the pop was Martin's foam heater exploding, and Niles emerges from the bathroom shell-shocked, covered in shaving foam, and a lot calmer than when he entered.</p>
<p>The shock is interrupted by a phone call on Niles' phone. It is Maris; the divorce papers were a bluff on her part, and terrified that she's finally pushed him too far, she begs him to take it back, agreeing to enter couples counseling. Overjoyed, Niles hugs Frasier - ruining his suit in the process.</p>
