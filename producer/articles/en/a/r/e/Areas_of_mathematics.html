<dd>The history of mathematics is inextricably interwined with the subject itself.

<dd>Mathematicians have always worked with logic and symbols, but for centuries the underlying laws of logic were taken for granted, and never expressed symbolically. <b>Mathematical logic</b>, also known as <b>symbolic logic</b>, was developed when people finally realized that the tools of mathematics can be used to study the structure of logic itself. Areas of research in this field have expanded rapidly, and are usually subdivided into several distinct departments.</dd>
