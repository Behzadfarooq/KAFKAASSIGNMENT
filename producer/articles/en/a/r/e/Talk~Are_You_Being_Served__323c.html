<p>I hate to throw a spanner in the works, but I see people have been creating articles for each episode, containing a plot summary. To quote from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, "<b>Plot summaries.</b> Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article". Perhaps it would be better to incorporate the plot summaries into either this article, or articles for each series.

<p>The below discussion has always annoyed me in this article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Inman's <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parody</a> of an effeminate <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">gay</a> man, offensive to some gay men and women. Inman points out that it was never explicitly said that his character was gay, and creators Lloyd and Croft have stated in interviews that the character was not a homosexual. In fact, Mr. Humphries seemed to be more "on the fence" or <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexual</a> when it came to his sexuality as he showed interest in both men and women, and often took on traditional female and male roles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, it is like insisting "Miss Brahms is not really a Cockney". I mean, clearly viewers <i>were</i> meant to assume that Humphries was gay. Its just that, like most workplaces in the 1970s, he could not really be too explicit about it at work. Claims he was bisexual I do not believe are substantiated by the series at all: I do not believe he ever had a female reomantic partner after all. In any event, clearly its funnier that its never explicitly stated by the show, so stories can always keep throwing hints to the audience and they stay funny because nothing was ever explicitly confirmed. So while we can't say that he was gay, we also can't say he was bisexual either.</p>
<p>And I do not care what Lloyd and Croft have stated - because their show itself never actually substantiated those claims. The article is about the actual show, not the never-revealed back-story of its characters that never made it onto the show. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 02:01, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting discussion. There was at least one episode—I don't recall the title but will post it here if I can find it—in which it was strongly implied that a romantic encounter between Humphries and Slocombe was imminent. As I recall, outside events intervened to prevent their being alone together, and Mr. Humphries was a little relieved but also disappointed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, viewers were meant to assume that Humpries was gay, or possibly bi. Since he never explicitly announced his orientation, it's open to some speculation. Sometimes such speculation can be annoying, I'll admit, but the whole topic was such a central part of the show (Is he or isn't he? He is, isn't he? Yeah, I thought so! No, but wait . . . hmm) that it seems appropriate for discussion in the article. As for Lloyd and Croft, whatever their motivations for saying what they said, I think their statements about the characters are also fair game for the article because they may reveal the (good or bad) intentions of the creators. Btw, there's a parallel intrigue re John Inman (not discussed in his article yet, but maybe should be). <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERivertorch_60d5.html" title="User:Rivertorch">Rivertorch</a> 03:10, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Inman_47b5.html" title="John Inman">John Inman</a> married his long-term male partner so that has since been cleared-up. I recall similar (but very heated!) WP talk page speculation about a similar character in US series <a href="../../../r/e/n/Reno_911%21.html" title="Reno 911!">Reno 911!</a> I agree with what Rivertorch says about the specualation being part of the comedy of the series. I felt the WP article was suggesting that the character was positively bisexual; I feel the article should (and should <i>only</i>) state that it was never confirmed. We should make no new speculation in the article (and certainly not reach any conclusion), though I agree we should note that there would presumably have been speculation about the character amongst the viewers of the show. I'll try to fix the wording - but I wanted others feedback before doing that. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 03:22, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure if this part of the article is correct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the workers are noticeably free; each would look solemnly from side to side before saying "Yes I'm free, Captain Peacock."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, the use of the word "solemnly". I've always interpreted the gag as being that Peacock asks as a matter of protocol, regardless of the obvious answer, and the workers look from side to side bemused at Peacock's "by the book" nature. I don't think solemnly correctly describes their response to the request; I would simply remove it. Does anyone else agree?</p>

<dd>I disagree. I've always the thought that the workers too look to check as a matter of proctocol. I don't think its beausment. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerks105_514e.html" title="User:Berks105">Berks105</a> 10:33, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It varied. It probably was a matter of protocol, and they'd look around even if they knew perfectly well they were free, but sometimes they appeared to genuinely check if they were free. (And sometimes they weren't free, as when Mr. Grainger told Capt. Peacock, "I'm sorry, Capt. Peacock.

<p>I didn't want to start making additions to the article, but I feel something should be said here about the open antisemitism of the series in regards to the Mr. Goldberg character. Does anyone know of any references for this? <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildoferna_0177.html" title="User:Childoferna">Matt</a> 04:50, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To be honest I don't think there was any real anti-semitism in <i>Are You Being Served?</i>, all the characters had the mickey taken out of them at some point, and to say that this would have been anti-semitism in Mr. Goldberg's case I think is unfair. Regardless I doubt we could source such a thing, I've certainly never read it anywhere. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerks105_514e.html" title="User:Berks105">Berks105</a> 10:51, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, it was worth a thought, I don't want to add anything to the article without sourcing, but watching the show the antisemitism with regards to Mr. Goldberg is apparent. The other characters are made fun of but the treatment of Goldberg is especially negative, plus, unlike the other characters, he never seems to "get it back" if you get what I mean. If it could be sourced it would be a useful addition, especially for anyone interested in antisemitism in British culture of the 1970's.</dd>
<dd>I don't think that the anti-semitism expressed toward Mr. Goldberg is any more pronounced than any of the other gross ethnic/regional/class/religious stereotypes and parodies presented. There are non-PC portrayals and references throughout the series with the accompanying less-than-tolerant reactions of the staff, including Germans, Japanese, Arabs, Blacks, Greeks, Italians, Muslims, French, Irish, Welsh, Cockneys, Americans, Gays, and even Somerset folk. It is my opinion that all these portrayed stereotypes are meant to be absurd, rather than a reflection of any ingrained prejudices of the authors, actors, and even anticipated audience. jchristopher 01:52, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hilarious as it was, it rather surprised me when I first watched the ancient reruns. Wasn't it somewhat scandalous to dye your hair an unnatural color back then, especially to older folk? I mean she obviously wasn't doing it to be punk, but, ... was it supposed to be a bubbleheaded mistake on her part?</p>
