<p>hi, as someone who has knowledge of subcontinent history and has contributed to a previous Indo Pakistan conflict I'm sending this message out to you. I have nominated <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_Kargil_War_f24e.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Kargil War">Wikipedia:Peer review/Kargil War</a> for a review. Of course this could be a sensitive article but along with other editors I'm trying to present a factual and neutral version of the war backed with sources. Admittedly it is also shorter than what you'd expect of a FA candidate but the war itself was pretty short and limited. I request you help in improving the article from any angle seen fit. I'm requesting others with similar interests in military/history to do the same to guide the editors in improving it to FA status if possible. Tx and cheers. <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 16:06, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Languages Spoken in a City could mean the main languages spoken by a majority of the residents - need not be the mother tongue or native language of the majority of the residents. For cosmo cities like Mumbai and Bangalore, English and Hindi are universally spoken. The state language could be another addition, + languages from neighboring states like gujarati and tamil resp.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, this depends on the exact demographics of the city in question and has nothing to do with the state where the city is located or the native tongue.</p>

<p>re. yr edit reverses in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html#Urban_life" title="Bangalore">Bangalore#Urban_life</a>:</p>
<p>'Bangalore has significant proportions of <b>groups that would otherwise be considered</b> minorities <b>in India,</b> including Muslims, Christians and Anglo-Indians.'</p>
<p>The section in bold should go since it kind of sounds parochial and abrasive. I think it kind of suggests that minorities need to continuously reminded that they are indeed minorities. just mentioning that specific communities also live in BLR should be enough.</p>

<p>well,i deleted the stats dat said 38% kannada............. The reasons being:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of the census(of dat magazine/website)is done in urban areas where there are posh high rise buildings and apartments which house people mostly from out of state. whereas much of the Kannada speaking areas are in the sub-urban areas.</li>
<li>most slum areas have large Tamilian and Telugu immigrants belonging to guild/worker class.</li>
<li>In no area of Bangalore have i ever spoken any other language other than kannada and english.</li>
<li>why are all the advertisements and banners in Kannada,if majority of them dont speak/read Kannada.</li>
<li>the film industry is definetly not a guage of the people linguistic identity.</li>

<p>Hi Dont take it personal and I appreciate you intention, and still I need to see your 39% statistics which i dont see anywhere in the Indian sensus catergories. Else as I told before i would submit the edits that you had gone through to the Administration panel(which is quite enough to show you biased edits). Its not a threat or something, its a matter of truth and one would have to realise that a false information told several times cannot become a truth. I have recorded all your edits as comparison to be submitted to the Administrator panel. Expecting your correction of the phrases on these statistics by yourself, else I will pass over a memorondum to the panel. Gomez</p>
<p>Hi, Thanks for your welcome note, I am surprise that you must be new to this place. AreJay I would assume that you are completely biased about the population of Kanadigas as 39% percentage is completely biased. As a Bangalorean myself, I felt completely embarased by seeing the wrong informations. I would trust BBC than the citation that you had coted. The census that you had coted is just the website which you say the data is furnished but not. I would encourage you to be unbiazed and respect the intergrity of the multicultural atmosphere existing in Bangalore without your racial feelings, which I could see through out your edits had been followed up and taken into consideration to be reported. I would assume you would be unbiased else I would have to report this matter to Administration of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Gomez</p>
<p>Reply to your Message</p>
<p>Hi Rxasgomez,</p>
<p>Thank you for contributing to the Bangalore article. However, some of the statistics quoted by you have been removed because they failed, per WP:V. It is important that statistics have not only sources, but also verifiable sources. The BBC website and the other website do not discuss how they obtained the percentages of Kannada/Tamil speakers in the country. Any statistics quoted could not possibly trump the stats that were previously included in the article, which were issued by the Government of Karnataka during the 2001 census, and therefore they have been deleted. The statistics on the number of Urdu and Malayalam speakers did not have any citations and so were automatically deteted. However, please continue to contribute to the Bangalore article to help improve its overall quality. As you may be aware, the article is currently undergoing a WP:Peer review and upon completion, will be nominated for a Featured Article status. Thanks AreJay 00:11, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, The Statistics that I had coted as 18% and 10% are as before you had started to contributing to this article. Check the history before you had come into the picture. I will see the development for a week and then will submit the history and reference verification querry before the Administration. You can place your opinion and get their verdict(For you information the consequence will be to termination of ones contribution all together).I like your spirit of Bangalore projection as Hi tech hub and as being a Bangalorean Tamil, I think I need to choose a hard option like this. Please go throught your edits once for all and if you still see truth in it we can place the problem to the administrator jurries.</p>
<p>Ok we can see how they decide about this situation.</p>

<p>Hi AreJay - I know you are excited about moving up to FAC, but I recommend you fully incorporate Sundar and Nichalp's points. Now ideally, the PR should lie dormant for around 5 days, but I think the article is more than ready and now susceptible to over-editing. Congratulations on a marvellous effort and best of luck for the upcoming FAC. Be on your toes during it to address any objection/comment which might come through.

<p>Arejay, I am quite convinced what you said but i am unable to understand what would be the problem if these pages remain there. He is going to delete some pages like Portal:India Today's featured article/March 2006. It will create problem for me without a listing what i have already posted. If they are surely going to delete then this is the only solution. I have posted it on wikivillage (proposals). Let's see what people say about this.

<dd>Arejay, I think you might not have noticed that i am going to post the articles on the daily basis. There is no such big deal to rename the article if he wants me to do so. I have contacted <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> but i am not sure that will he respond or not, because i have seen somewhere that somebody criticised this person for not responding then other person replied was he is a busy man. -- <a href="../../../u/r/s/User%7EUrshyam_d8c5.html" title="User:Urshyam"><font color="black"><b>Shyam</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../u/r/s/User_talk%7EUrshyam_3871.html" title="User talk:Urshyam"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Urshyam_5801.html" title="Special:Contributions/Urshyam"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 15:00, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"might I suggest that we stick with our current format of featuring a Selected Article of the Week?" I don't think currently <a href="../../../i/n/d/Portal%7EIndia_13cb.html" title="Portal:India">Portal:India</a> has a weekly selected article. yes, you are saying correct that we don't have enough articles till now as "A-class articles" but i am thinking that we can include some good "B-class articles".

What I am thinking is, first we start <b>Today's selected article</b> on <a href="../../../i/n/d/Portal%7EIndia_13cb.html" title="Portal:India">Portal:India</a>, if we do not have enough articles on the daily basis we can repeat because my created stream is on the basis of daily articles, i have worked deeply in this matter.

<p>Notice board for India-related topics/Version 1.0 assesment has very old examples- Featured articles, like <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, it assumes as starting article.

<p>Dear RJ,Thank you very much for the suggestions.It seems you are suggestiong that a peer review is a must for becoming an FA.I think I've seen FACs without a PR.AndI Don't see why the career section is too long.Anyway,I'll try to deal with it. Don't see what more could be written about a professional diplomat, other than his career and education...and politics. The image problem has been resolved.Also,I personally believe the exhaustive external links the article has got is something that would help those using this encyclopedia.I see the FAC is still going on,so I'll wait some more time before withdrawing.Thank You very much once again.--<a href="../../../s/a/h/User%7ESahodaran_f90e.html" title="User:Sahodaran">Sahodaran</a> 03:21, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Originally, there was no deadline for removing noms, but it was proposed as 2 weeks - I asked for 2 months and we decided on 1 month. See the talkpage of INCOTW for the relevant discussion. I feel that we need to specify that the max. no. of noms at any given time on the page should not be more than 6 - right now, it is 8 and few people would see the ones below. We can add this to the rules with a note on the talkpage - you may want to go for it as I am busy right now; or I will add it sometime later in the week. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 06:10, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I think right now we should wait and allow some more time before it appears on the main page. One of the reasons is that the casualties section needs a few tweaks and that TIME image's fair use rationale needs to be accepted by the community (already veering towards a keep) and other loose ends to be tied. In the meantime, Bangalore is also listed on TFA, so I'd be happy if that appears before Kargil gets on the main page, especially since you've worked for that article's improvement.&#160;:-)</p>

<p>Just so you know, a couple of anons have taken great exception to this entire article ... I've left a disputed-neutrality tag (thinned down from their dozen or so) on there for now but it looks OK to me to be honest. --<a href="../../../b/t/h/User%7EBth_f25f.html" title="User:Bth">Bth</a> 20:07, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi AreJay. The anons have been engaged in disruptive trolling and POV pushing since several days. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.180.28.6_b27b.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.180.28.6">Special:Contributions/209.180.28.6</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.164.5.90_9d14.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.164.5.90">Special:Contributions/67.164.5.90</a>. I've already had a very bad time with the former. I've also gently warned him at <a href="../../../2/0/9/User_talk%7E209.180.28.6.html" title="User talk:209.180.28.6">User talk:209.180.28.6</a>. BostonMA has already given a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest2a-n_c1f6.html" title="Template:Test2a-n">test2a-n</a>}} warning.</dd>
<dd>Regarding <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infrastructural_Concerns_in_Bangalore_5e79.html" title="Infrastructural Concerns in Bangalore">Infrastructural Concerns in Bangalore</a>, I feel that you've done your best in citing sources for a well-known fact. I can empathise with the trouble that you're made to endure. If there is any contrary opinion, let the anons produce <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">sources</a> and it can be added. In the absence of that, <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">do not feed the trolls</a>. If they vandalise articles, just post appropriate warning messages by inserting {{subst:test2b}} or any other appropriate message from <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category%7EUser_warning_templates_29f9.html" title="Category:User warning templates">Category:User warning templates</a>. If higher levels of warning have reached, you can request action from an administrator. I can't initiate action as I'm personally involved in a POV issue with that anon. <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">User:Gurubrahma</a> could be a neutral admin to intervene in this matter. -- <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESundar_8811.html" title="User:Sundar">Sundar</a> <sup>\<a href="../../../s/u/n/User_talk%7ESundar_d2f1.html" title="User talk:Sundar">talk</a> \<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sundar_568f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sundar">contribs</a></sup> 05:01, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In addition to what Sundar says, there is no need to tolerate any radical edits by anon IP users. My concern is, are their other articles like this - examples of the need to discuss such issues separately&#160;? - the issues are adequately noted and cited in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>. Also, I note that <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose%2C_California_e18c.html" title="San Jose, California">San Jose, California</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chennai.html" title="Chennai">Chennai</a> don't have a similar forks. If you find that there is no real need to discuss the issues separately from the main Bangalore article, then the right thing to do is to go for speedy delete. However if you find a solid basis for the article's right to exist, there is obviously no problem. Just judge this question for yourself. Of course I will help and support you, especially as the anon IP is purely disruptive in behavior. Btw, excellent work on portal:India! <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 14:16, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On a personal note - keep your cool at all times, and don't even feel a need to counter any ridiculous attack coated in abusive language - its useless, isn't it? The guy's prolly not gonna change in his nature owing to an altercation on Wikipedia. If he continues to disrupt, obviously an admin should take over. I've asked <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">user:Gurubrahma</a> to check this out. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 14:33, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes I agree, its a good idea to open an article that deals with the subject of infrastructure in its entirety. Check if other Bangalore forks might have similar issues. As long as everything is factually based and cited, there is no concern of POV, and you will be correct in citing that the gravity of problems out-do the positives at this time. The delay with Lothal had something to do with a lot of FACs being "problematic." For his own good reasons, Raul654 was holding up promotions and moves of FACs. I was a bit worried for a while, but obviously I'm delighted now.

<p>AreJay, Thanks for your message. This is not a big job. If you want to change artcles on daily basis use {{CURRENTDAY}}. It changes automatically the date. e.g. Today is 9th March 2006 means {{CURRENTDAY}} is 9, {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} is March, {{CURRENTYEAR}} is 2006. For showing weekly articles use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{CURRENTWEEK}} which is 10 from Monday, 5th to Sunday, 11th. Please let me know other queries if you have.

<p>Thanks for your note, AreJay. I will admit that I sometimes fail at the assume good faith rule of Wiki. I was concerned that the other editor and I would soon be reverting past three times, and I wanted to ensure there was some comment of it on the talk page incase an admin needed to be involved. The editor is currently involved in a similar edit war on another page (For CafePress, oddly enough), and I just didn't want to see the normally quiet Collins page become a revert war.</p>
<p>However, I took your suggestion and left a polite message for the editor on his talk page. Hopefully, after referencing the link you provided me, it will be helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you, as well, for the compliments with getting the Collins page to FA. <i>Duke</i> is a personal favorite album of mine as well. Although I don't always listen to the others as much as I probably should, <i>Duke</i> is a regular in my CD player and truly a classic. I'm happy that the FA status of the Collins page has encouraged other editors to begin creating pages for his other singles and albums.</p>

<dd>Hi Arejay, thanx for adding to CVR. One small point: beginning from 1982, the Jnanpith was awarded for a writer's overall <i>oeuvre</i> and not for one specific work, refer <a href="http://www.indiapicks.com/Literature/Jnanpith/Jnanpith_Awards.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.indiapicks.com/Literature/Jnanpith/Jnanpith_Awards.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>. MVI won the award in 1983. I'm wondering if you can make a suitable amendment?
