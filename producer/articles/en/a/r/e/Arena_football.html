<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: Rules of the game">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rules of the game</span></h2>
<p>Arena football is very similar to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a>, so only the important differences between its rules and those of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> are articulated here. In addition to differences relating to the reduced field size, other rule changes were intended to make the arena game faster-paced and higher-scoring.</p>
<p><a name="The_field" id="The_field"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: The field">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The field</span></h3>
<p>Arena football is played exclusively indoors, in arenas usually designed for either <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a> or <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_hockey.html" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a> teams. The field is the same width (85 feet) as a standard <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_5702.html" title="NHL">NHL</a> hockey rink. The field is 50 <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yard.html" title="Yard">yards</a> long with 8-yard <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_zone.html" title="End zone">end zones</a>. Depending on the stadium in which a game is being played, the end zones may be rectangular (like a basketball court) or curved (like a hockey rink). There is a heavily padded wall on each sideline, with the padding placed on top of the hockey dasher boards. The field goal uprights are 9 feet wide, and the crossbar is 15 feet above the playing surface. Taut rebound nets on either side of the posts bounce any missed field goals back into the field of play. The ball is "live" when rebounding off these nets or their support apparatuses.</p>
<p>A player is not counted as out of bounds on the sidelines unless they are pushed into or fall over the boundary wall.</p>
<p><a name="The_players" id="The_players"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: The players">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The players</span></h3>
<p>Each team fields eight players from a 20-man active roster. Players must play both <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offensive_team.html" title="Offensive team">offense</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defensive_team.html" title="Defensive team">defense</a> except for the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placekicker.html" title="Placekicker">kicker</a>, an offensive specialist (Wide Receiver/Running Back combination) and two defense specialists (Defensive Backs).</p>
<p><a name="Substitution_Rules" id="Substitution_Rules"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: Substitution Rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Substitution Rules</span></h3>
<p><a name="Rules_prior_to_2007_Season" id="Rules_prior_to_2007_Season"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: Rules prior to 2007 Season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rules prior to 2007 Season</span></h4>
<p>Other than specialists and kickers, a player may enter the game once per quarter. For players who start the quarter, they may be substituted for and then re-enter, one time. For a substitute, once he enters and then leaves, he may not return.</p>
<p>If a player enters and leaves, from the moment he leaves the player is considered "dead" and cannot return to play until the designated time is served.</p>
<ul>
<li>For two-way players "dead" time is one quarter</li>
<li>For specialists "dead" time is one half</li>
</ul>
<p>Exception: a "dead" player may participate on kickoffs, or as long snapper or holder. In 2006, the AFL changed its substitution rules such that free substitutions are now allowed on all kickoffs.</p>
<p><a name="New_rules_for_2007_Season" id="New_rules_for_2007_Season"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: New rules for 2007 Season">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New rules for 2007 Season</span></h4>
<p>The most significant change is the introduction of free substitution, the so-called "Elway Rule". Previously, AFL coaches were limited to one substitution per position per quarter. Beginning with the 2007 season, coaches will be permitted to substitute players at will.</p>
<p>The rationale is that free substitution will improve the overall quality of football in the league by giving coaches the freedom to put their best players on the field for every play of the game, and that teams will be able to select from a wider player talent pool when building their rosters. Many fans and players though believe the rule changes are the beginning of the removal of the "Ironman" (two-way offense and defense) style of play of Arena Football that the league has actively promoted for 20 seasons, and that removing the Ironman style of play takes away a key component of what makes Arena Football a distinctive sport over other versions of football (NFL, CFL, other indoor leagues, etc).</p>
<p><a name="Formations" id="Formations"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: Formations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Formations</span></h3>
<p>Four offensive players must be on the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_scrimmage.html" title="Line of scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a> at the <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snap_%28football%29.html" title="Snap (football)">snap</a>. One offensive player may be moving forward at the time of the snap. Three defensive players must be in a three- or four-point stance at the start of the snap. Two defenders serve as <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linebacker.html" title="Linebacker">linebackers</a> called the mac and the jack. The mac may <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitz_%28American_football%29_86d0.html" title="Blitz (American football)">blitz</a> from the side of the line opposite the offensive <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tight_end.html" title="Tight end">tight end</a>. The jack cannot blitz and cannot drop back into coverage until the ball is thrown or the quarterback is no longer in the pocket. The jack must stay within the box designated by the outside shoulders of the offensive line, the line of scrimmage, and 5 yards back from the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p><a name="Ball_movement" id="Ball_movement"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: Ball movement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ball movement</span></h3>
<p>The ball is kicked off from the goal line. The team with the ball is given four <a href="../../../d/o/w/Down_%28football%29.html" title="Down (football)">downs</a> to gain ten yards or score. <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punt_%28football%29.html" title="Punt (football)">Punting</a> is illegal because of the size of the playing field. A <a href="../../../r/e/c/Receiver.html" title="Receiver">receiver</a> jumping to catch a pass needs to get only one foot down in bounds for the catch to be deemed a completed catch. Passes that bounce off the rebound nets remain live. Balls that bounce off the padded walls that surround the field are live; the end zone walls were not live until the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_sports.html" title="2006 in sports">2006</a> season. The defending team may return missed <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_goal_%28football%29.html" title="Field goal (football)">field goal</a> attempts that bounce off the rebound nets.</p>
<p><a name="Scoring" id="Scoring"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: Scoring">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Scoring</span></h3>
<p>The scoring is the same as in the NFL with the addition of a <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drop_kick.html" title="Drop kick">drop kick</a> field goal worth four points during normal play or two points as a post-touchdown conversion. Blocked extra points and turnovers on two-point conversion attempts may be returned by the defensive team for two points.</p>
<p><a name="Timing" id="Timing"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: Timing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Timing</span></h3>
<p><a name="Current_timing_rules" id="Current_timing_rules"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: Current timing rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Current timing rules</span></h4>
<p>The clock stops for out-of-bounds plays, incomplete passes, or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback_sack.html" title="Quarterback sack">sacks</a> only in the last minute of each half (there is only a one-minute warning, as opposed to the two-minute warning in the NFL) or because of penalties, injuries or timeouts. The clock also stops for any change in possession, until the ball is marked ready for play; for example, aside from in a half's final minute, time continues to run down after a <a href="../../../t/o/u/Touchdown.html" title="Touchdown">touchdown</a>, but stops after an extra point or <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-point_conversion.html" title="Two-point conversion">two-point conversion</a> attempt. If a quarter ends as a touchdown is scored, an untimed conversion attempt takes place. Halftime lasts 15 minutes. The play clock is 35 seconds, starting at the end of the previous play.</p>
<p>During the final minute of the fourth quarter, the clock stops if the offensive team has the lead and fails to advance the ball past the line of scrimmage. This prevents the offensive team from merely kneeling down or running other plays that are designed solely to exhaust the remaining time rather than to advance the ball downfield, as often occurs in the outdoor game.</p>
<p>In overtime, each team gets one possession to score. If after each team has had one possession, one team is ahead, that team wins. If the teams are tied after each has had a possession, the next team to score ("<a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudden_death_%28sport%29.html" title="Sudden death (sport)">sudden death</a>") wins. Each overtime period is 15 minutes, and continues from the ending of the previous overtime period until the tie is broken.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: Previous timing rule changes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Previous timing rule changes</span></h4>
<p>Before the 2006 season, there was one 15-minute overtime period, and if it expired with the teams still tied, the game was recorded as a tie. There were two ties in AFL history prior to the 2006 rule change:</p>
<ul>
<li>July 14, 1988: <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bruisers_447a.html" title="Chicago Bruisers">Chicago Bruisers</a> 37, <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Cobras_1126.html" title="Los Angeles Cobras">Los Angeles Cobras</a> 37 (when this game was played, the overtime period was 7½ minutes long)</li>
<li>April 8, 2005: <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville_Kats_813b.html" title="Nashville Kats">Nashville Kats</a> 41, <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Desperados_ff44.html" title="Dallas Desperados">Dallas Desperados</a> 41</li>
</ul>
<p>Before 2006, the play clock was 25 seconds, and it began on signal from the referee.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/Arena_football.html" title="Edit section: Popular culture">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Popular culture</span></h2>
<p>Because of its young age as a sport, few <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_culture.html" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> references to arena football exist. It is, however, established as a <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> sport in the motion picture version of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship_Troopers_%28film%29_41dc.html" title="Starship Troopers (film)"><i>Starship Troopers</i></a>, and most of the lead characters play the sport, with a game taking place as an early scene in the film. In addition, Van Montgomery, a character on the TV sitcom <i><a href="../../../r/e/b/Reba_%28TV_series%29_eba5.html" title="Reba (TV series)">Reba</a></i>, was employed for a time as an arena football player.</p>
<p>A previous movie reference can be found in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Kinjite%7E_Forbidden_Subjects_44e6.html" title="Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects">Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects</a>, directed by J. Lee Thompson and starring Charles Bronson. One scene takes place during an AFL game, with the Chicago Bruisers visiting the Los Angeles Cobras. It was released in early 1989.</p>

Midway Sports did publish an arena football game in 2001 (<i><a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurt_Warner%27s_Arena_Football_Unleashed_09f5.html" title="Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed">Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed</a></i>).

<p>In 2001, Jeff Foley published <i>War on the Floor: an average guy plays in the Arena Football League and lives to write about it.</i> The book details a journalist's two preseasons (1999 and 2000) as an offensive specialist/writer with the now-defunct <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany_Firebirds_68f5.html" title="Albany Firebirds">Albany Firebirds</a>.

Yearwood came out of the game in the 1st quarter after blocking a field goal attempt allegedly claiming that he wasn't well, collapsed, and was later pronounced dead at Via Christi St. Francis Hospital in <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wichita.html" title="Wichita">Wichita</a> after medical personnel worked to resuscitate him.
