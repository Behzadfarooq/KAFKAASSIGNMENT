<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/e/User%7EAreol_Demolvort_f558.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Areol is a pureblood wizard that was born in a very happy average family. He is the only son of his Auror parents. His father named Zechs Eugene Demovlort and his mother named Milliscent "Millie" Peacecraft.</p>
<p>When he is 7 years old he lost his parents. It was night of August 1st, it is raining so hard outside. A couple is still awake at this very night. The man is a wizard and the woman is a witch. And there are group of hooded guys that are with them. The couple is very scared. The woman is going to give birth soon. She can't run fast. They can't run fast, even though it is already a situation between life and death. Then another couple appeared and joined them. The other couple who came is Aurors, they are magical enforcements. The hooded men are followers of the Dark Lord, Voldemort. The couples who are running are named, Milliardo and Eunice. The Aurors saved them; they are able to run away from the Death Eaters.</p>
<p>His parents died while doing their job. And it appeared to the newspapers that they were been killed by He- who- must- not- be- named and his followers. He is a loner. Areol lives with their family servant, now that his parents are gone.</p>
<p>Areol reached his 9th birthday. There is a family who just came to his house and talked to him. They are carrying a baby. The baby is so cute and very innocent. It is sleeping on the arms of his mother. The baby is just two years old. The parents of the baby were friends of his parents. Meaning they are witches and wizards too. The baby was born when his parents died. It happened on the very same date. Areol can't help but to hide his sadness inside him. They named the baby Eumil. He was been named after Areol's parents, Eugene and Millie.</p>
<p>The father and the mother of the baby said that they just passed by because they heard the news and they transferred somewhere near the house. They even told that Areol is a wizard, even though Areol already knew it because his parents and Mr. Damei already told it to him.</p>
<p>As he reached his 11th birthday, a letter came. An owl is carrying the letter. It was from a magical school. He was invited to study at Hogwarts. As he received the letter, he wants to show it to Mr. Damei, the family servant. But as he saw the old man, he is already lying in the ground, no sign of life. He died because of oldness. Areol can't cry... he promised himself that he will be strong and will never show weakness to anyone.</p>
<p>Now that he is alone, he decided to go to Hogwarts. His parents left him a lot of money. As he stepped in the castle, he told himself not to trust anyone, only himself. As the sorting ceremony started, he saw a beautiful girl. They are sorted in the same House, Gryffindor. The girl sat down beside him. Her name is Canary. She is sweet and kind girl. Canary is a halfblood. Her father is a muggle while her mother is a witch. She started to talk to him. Still he just ignores her. As days passed by, they become closer and closer to each other. They are always together, even just attending classes or even just taking lunch. The girl became Areol's girlfriend before their first year ends.</p>
<p>At the summer vacation, Areol was been asked to spend his summer with the Lorizgue Family. Eumil is already one year old at that time, he is always crying out loud. But if he sees Areol, the baby always smiles. Most of the time, they are on resorts and beaches. Areol never had a great time like this, maybe because his parents are away most of the time. The Lorizgue family already got Areolâ€™s trust. Areol started to tell stories to them about his life at Hogwarts. He even told them about Canary, his girlfriend.</p>
<p>When Areol reached his second year, he decided to join the Quidditch Team. Areol tried out for the position of Chaser. They won the Quidditch Cup at that year too. He excelled much in his Defense against the Dark Arts in his second year. His girlfriend is always by his side supporting him.</p>
<p>At their 3rd year at Hogwarts, an accident happened. His girlfriend died. Areol's girlfriend was been killed and raped by some boys from Hogwarts. His girlfriend is lying on the floor. She is very cold and she is covered with her own blood. This incident happened when Areol is in his class. As he heard and saw it, he hunts them and kills them one by one. He killed them by his own hands. One of the guys told him that a student asked them to do it. It was Tom Riddle. Tom Riddle is way older than Areol. The young third year just heard that Tom Riddle is not in Hogwarts anymore. After that, he came back to his old self. He talks to no one besides the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, and the Gryffindor House Head. Albus Dumbledore protected him and did not let the Ministry of Magic to take him to Azkaban Prison.</p>
<p>When Areol reached his Fifth year, he became a prefect. When he is doing his job as a prefect, he can't help to have troubles with other students. He can't help to curse the students, but he only use minimal damage to the students.</p>
<p>Areol was able to finish and graduate at Hogwarts. His OWLs and NEWTs are very amusing. He wants to be an Auror so he trained so hard and became an Auror. As he became an Auror, he is very focus with it that he is promoted so fast. He is serious with this job. But he said to himself that he will try other jobs. So he tried to a Quidditch Team and he was able to enter.</p>
<p>Then an owl was been sent to him. It was from the Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. It says that Albus is requesting him to teach in Hogwarts. Areol wants to try another profession so he accepted it.</p>
<p>At his first year at Hogwarts, he can't help himself but to mess up with students and others. At the very first day of his job, he and his students face a group of dementors at the Forbidden Forest. It was Yule Ball, Areol saw the student who mess up with him on his class. He hexed her and turned her into a squirrel and Areol even started the fight at the same night.</p>

<p>Areol considered that being a professor at Hogwarts is already an Achievement for him. He became the Master Auror too in Gryvenpusly. He became the Professor of Flying Lessons before Kristina Krum.</p>
