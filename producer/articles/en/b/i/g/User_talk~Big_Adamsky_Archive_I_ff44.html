<p>Please, you do not have to change the Anatolia to Asia Minor. It is an international definition. If you like you can put your argument in the discussion page.</p>
<p>Ethic structure of the Anatolia</p>
<p>I was wondering, if you dare to create page, that will collect the migrations in&amp;out of Anatolia through out time. Maybe you can develop a timeline with referances... That would be ver usefull, and we can put a link to your page under demographics of Republic of Turkey.</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. But do not change the definition of the Turkish people <b>on the main page</b> as it was developed along the political usage of "Turkish" that does not depend on ethnicity. Which I guess goes along what you try to develop in your text. That did not come very definite. It is better to left some terms not to be analyzed in-detail on a main page to stop vandalism of other concepts that goes along with it. I guess you might agree with this. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommiks_6ade.html" title="User:Tommiks">tommiks</a> 22:40, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For the "ethnic usage of Turkish", which the word "Turkic people" is used. I tried to follow your changes. If you claim that there is no ethnic Turk or "Turkic" in Turkey, you might need to develop a specific page. By the way, I'm just trying to understand what your are trying to change, that is all.--<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommiks_6ade.html" title="User:Tommiks">tommiks</a> 22:40, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If I miised anything else, please inform me..</p>
<p>I just read your comment after I drop the message, if that message covers your question that is fine, if not please inform me. By the way, Anatolia is center of many civilizations, you did not need to delete that sentence. That concept is a national treasure and income for the Turkish people, Civilizations are the source of Turkey's truism.&#160;:-) Why someone gets that fact out, I have hard time understanding. You could not be that guy, right?</p>
<p>You do not need to tell you will vandalize the page!</p>
<p>No one is stupid, it is not difficult to see what you have changed in the page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=27756496&amp;oldid=27719823" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=27756496&amp;oldid=27719823" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>I tried to show a way to developing your <b>POV</b>, which if you really <b>believe to it and spend time to prove it</b>, we might agree on it. Hope, you will calm down, and develop better communication skills. At the end, how you develop your business is your business. but pissing of people, do not take you anywhere. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETommiks_6ade.html" title="User:Tommiks">tommiks</a> 23:38, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Allright, I get your point. I was simply going on a spree to inter-link actual instances with an extra emphasized link to the page discussing this phenomenon on a more theoretical level.

<dd>Looks like the right club for me, I'll join soon. I am also interested in learning more about how I can submit map images. I feel I have great deal to contribute in the area of maps (particularly thematic maps), but I still lack the means to create and submit my works. Any tips?

The first of these allows me to easily extract images (or essentially anything) from PDFs; the last of these enables me to create PDFs from any usual <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Office_54b3.html" title="Microsoft Office">MS Office</a> (blech!) application. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_vector_graphics_editors.html" title="List of vector graphics editors">There are other programmes, too.</a> I rarely use GIS programmes to create maps, but not out of want: I can usually satisfy my needs by adapting or extracting what I need from maps already made.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/c/l/Eclecticism.html" title="Eclecticism">I'm a marketer/fundraiser by trade, but biologist/political scientist by study.</a> Similarly, I'm dually a jack of all trades and a perfectionist, so I may be subsumed by many projects at once and try to create images of superior quality ... this also sometimes has the effect of me uploading an image mutliple times before I'm satisfied (argh!).</p>
<p>I hope this is helpful. Let me know if you've any questions. Enjoy! E Pluribus Anthony 11:49, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You may be right about that. Perhaps these articles are too removed from each other (in time, space, and content) to be linked. On a side note, I would urge you to try harder to see more than just one perspective/point of view when editing. I base that on a quick review of your edits. Perhaps you should keep a lower profile in subjects that are sensitive to you, and refrain from mass eradication of entire paragraphs and instead expland on any particluar aspect that you find to be underrepresented? Remember that Wikipedia is not the personal blog or diary of any one single editor. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 17:05, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The articles were deliberately separated as they are completely different concepts. It would be like merging pages for Great britain and the United Kingdom, or America and the United States.

<dd>Kelisi, you reverted an edit to the article <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malay_archipelago.html" title="Malay archipelago">Malay archipelago</a> with the edit summary <i><b>"rv -- deletion of pertinent information; insertion of bogus information."</b></i>, and then proceded to write on my talk-page under the header Homosexuality Laws of the World <i><b>"I second that. Cut it out! It is not all right to delete pertinent facts, nor is it all right to insert false information."</b></i> (which I have now removed from my talk page). I think you have made a misjudgment (and a slight fool of yourself). I urge you to consult the edit histories so you know what you are talking about. I also urge you to take a peek at the Wikipedia guidelines and be guided by them. If you wish to contribute to this particular article and if that contribution involves major reverts, please do discuss this at the talk page beforehand. Thanks in advance for your cooperation. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 07:02, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I'm sorry your nose was put out of joint by my opinion of your behaviour here, but the fact is that you <i>did</i> remove pertinent information and insert bogus information. Furthermore, someone else has chidden you for this behaviour. So cut it out already. What your other upbraider told you is right. It is <i><b>vandalism</b></i>. It was no misjudgment on my part. Bluster all you like. Post daft messages like that one above. Don't expect me to take it seriously. Why don't <i>you</i> consult edit histories. You'll find that I am a major contributor to that article that you butchered. Expect no coöperation from me. Your kind of "editing" does not belong here. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelisi_9a88.html" title="User:Kelisi">Kelisi</a> 15:12, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Kelisi, I just saw your comment here, and was unpleasantly surprised. Are you sure you really mean what you wrote up there? It sounds like you are not <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a> on my part (<i>"Your kind of "editing" does not belong here"</i>, <i>"bogus information"</i>, <i>"your behaviour in here"</i>), and that you intend to disrupt my future contributions (<i>"Don't expect me to take it seriously"</i>, <i>"Expect no coöperation from me"</i>). Why not assume a more <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">collegial and civil attitude</a> to how <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">disputes should be settled</a>?</dd>
<dd>Now, I understand that you had put a lot of effort into the Malay Archipelago article. How about you address each objection you have to the particular edit that made you upset or angry, one by one? Which points in particular felt like "vandalism" to you? Whether you explain this in the talk page in question or right here makes no difference to me, but you would be doing third parties a favour by discussing its content in the talk page.</dd>
<dd>I honestly think that you're putting way too much energy into <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">trying to offend me</a> (<i>"sorry your nose was put out of joint"</i>) instead of just attempting to convince me that your insight and input were more valid than mine. I hope you as a veteran will come to assume a less hostile position towards us rookies. So… should I still not expect any cooperation from you? --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 19:40, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS: And as for what you thought was evidence of vandalism up there, <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonySt_3884.html" title="User:TonySt">User:TonySt</a> apologized two minutes later for that when he discovered the constructive edit I had made (which was simply a geographical reordering in the list of Laws on homosexuality in various states).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're right. I should be more specific. The deletion of pertinent information that I meant was the specific parts of Malaysia that are part of the archipelago, namely Sabah, Sarawak, and Labuan. Also, there is the fact that the archipelagoes within the Malay Archipelago are indeed considered archipelagoes (they are, after all, listed <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archipelago.html" title="Archipelago">here</a>, and I notice you've completely rearranged that article, too). The bogus information that you inserted is the point that Singapore is part of the archipelago. It is not, no more than Penang or Langkawi.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for what you've done to the Archipelago article, my cursory scan of it just now reveals that for no reason in particular, you have rearranged the island groups. Also, for reasons that I cannot begin to fathom, you have linked <a href="../../../l/a/c/Laccadives.html" title="Laccadives">Laccadives</a> and put the archipelago's proper name <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lakshadweep.html" title="Lakshadweep">Lakshadweep</a> in parentheses, and unlinked it. Adam, <b>Lakshadweep</b> is what it's called nowadays, and that's the article's title. Check it out. "Laccadives" leads to a redirect — which, of course, leads to "Lakshadweep".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for my opinion that your kind of editing doesn't belong here, I meant deletion of pertinent facts (the idea at Wikipedia is to <i><b>expand</b></i> articles, not shrink them; your "simplifications" aren't wanted; look around; there are articles absolutely crammed with information, sometimes so big that they have to be split into several articles; that's what we like to see here) and the insertion of inaccurate information (I'll admit I've been torn off a strip about that; so be it if someone knows better; we try to be accurate here at Wikipedia, and I accept corrections if they turn out to be right).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for trying to offend you, I was suggesting that that my <i>opinion</i> had already done that. Do you understand the expression "to put someone's nose out of joint"? Anyway, I rather think the pot is calling the kettle black here, with regards to your initial message to me. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelisi_9a88.html" title="User:Kelisi">Kelisi</a> 04:02, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh boy… I think I will respond to your more personal opinions here, and to the factual comments at the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Talk%7EArchipelago_ef68.html#Current_listing:_alphabetical_and_hierarchical" title="Talk:Archipelago">relevant talk pages</a>.</dd>
<dd>Your use of <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">harsh language</a> with many metaphors proves nothing really; that's all just your own <a href="../../../p/o/i/Wikipedia%7EPoint_of_view_25fa.html" title="Wikipedia:Point of view">interpretations</a> - nothing more, nothing less. When what you probably <i>really</i> mean to say is "you made <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_ef6a.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit">an edit</a> that I disagree on" you phrased that "you butchered an article with bogus information". So just <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_pages_8576.html" title="Wikipedia:Talk pages">discuss</a> by providing proof and support for <i>your</i> position, like everyone else.</dd>
<dd>You must be using the word "vandalism" in a broader, more figurative manner than what is meant by <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism here</a>. You will find it difficult to prove that any of my edits were in fact ill-intended expressions of sabotage to Wikipedia's entries. When I confronted you with the fact that another user's vandalism warning was a false alarm and that you ought to check that page's edit history as well as his own comment, you denied any misjudgment and just shouted that I should read edit histories myself.</dd>
<dd>Any edit entails change, and sometimes an editor will remove text if he or she feels that it is best for the article. And so, your continued assertions that such <i>"editing does not belong here"</i> or that my <i>"simplifications aren't wanted"</i>, are simply wrong. Please acknowledge that and let's cooperate instead. See you at the talk pages of "our" articles. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 17:27, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh boy indeed. The fact still remains that you removed pertinent information and inserted bogus information. That rant just above does not address even one of my points, at least not effectively. Adam, the very first sentence at "<a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism here</a>" describes what you did. I think perhaps you are a bit embarrassed because you have discovered, as I claimed, that I am a major contributor to that particular article. I even gave it a major overhaul, wholly changing its subject matter, and no-one saw fit to call me on it (whether that was because everyone agreed with me or nobody cared I don't truly know). Even so, I did not suppress any information. The whole article formerly there was simply transferred to another, new article, where it still remains. And oh yes, I used the talk page, whereas you didn't. As for acknowledging that my assertions are wrong, no way. You do not remove pertinent facts from articles or try to "simplify" them. You are supposed to expand articles by <i><b>adding</b></i> new – and accurate – information.</p>
<p>You seem to have misconstrued my purpose in all this. I don't consider this personal – I after all don't know who or what you are – but rather an attempt to maintain Wikipedia's integrity.

<dd>Hello, I was looking at the Turkic peoples and Turkish people sections and planned to fix them up a bit, but the Turkish people article seems a bit vague. It should perhaps denote more specifically the Turks of Turkey (as I think it does anyway) as opposed to the various people of Turkey. The Turkic people are a more linguistic group whereas the Turks of Turkey, a place I've been myself, are a specific geographic ethno-linguistic group more indigenous to Anatolia then most people realize. The same issue came up when I was editing the Persians and Tajiks articles as many contend that they are identical, whereas I think they vary in ways similar to the Swiss Germans and Germans of Germany. Same language, different history and social conditions and obviously have developed differences over time. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETombseye_7b4d.html" title="User:Tombseye">Tombseye</a> 20:34, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey Tomseye. Good initiative, the text I provisionally pasted in there is just copied from Demography of Turkey, and needs serious attention. Considering the sensitivity of the issue of ethnicity versus citizenship (see for example <a href="../../../a/z/e/Talk%7EAzerbaijanis_d23f.html" title="Talk:Azerbaijanis">Talk:Azerbaijanis</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/j/Talk%7ETajiks_e2b1.html" title="Talk:Tajiks">Talk:Tajiks</a>) I suppose it would be a good idea to be more explicit than usual about the distinction. Come to think of it, prominently placed links to <b><a href="../../../l/a/n/Language_shift.html" title="Language shift">Language shift</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_assimilation.html" title="Cultural assimilation">Cultural assimilation</a></b> seem relevant to all of these articles. I'm confident that the article is in safe hands under your revisions, but make sure you make it comparable to the other articles of the same "series", such as, say, <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovenians.html" title="Slovenians">Slovenians</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/u/Inuit.html" title="Inuit">Inuit</a>.

<p>Hi, I just though I might ask you. Currently there is a debate whether to move <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partitions_of_Poland_7a0c.html" title="Partitions of Poland">Partitions of Poland</a> to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partitions_of_the_Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_0ded.html" title="Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. The first one is shorter and looks like it is more commonly used. The second one is politically &amp; historically correct. Could you voice your opinion on the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Talk%7EPartitions_of_Poland_9995.html" title="Talk:Partitions of Poland">talk page</a>? Because now it's all Lithuanians and Polish who fight each other&#160;:) We need someone "unbiased."

<dd>Hello Renata. I would be delighted to mediate in your naming debate, I just need to brush up on my history a bit first. My spontaneous reaction is that all school books and encyclopedias use the term "<i>Partitions of Poland</i>" as something of a fixed phrase, but of course that doesn't automatically endorse this version as the more correct of the two titles.

<dd>Hey man. I made the article West Frisia simply to refer to the lands of Dutch Frisia, extending (historically) from somewhere in modern North Holland and up to the German border. I admit that the articles are a bit confusing, and I myself don't know the exact difference between the two small southwestern areas, including whether the hyphenated one is a modern administrative unit that is <i>somewhat</i> coterminous with a historical district with a similar un-hyphenated name - or whether it is in fact the other way around. My intent was to create an article that would deal with all of Dutch Frisia under one single header, and not just the modern province, similar to the two other areas. Hm.. now I'm confusing myself too.

<p>Perhaps you'd be interested in helping out here? I see two ways to go; either simply put an alphbetical list of all countries with no regard to their geography; or to order them by some other geographic system that negates the problems of demarcated regions like Turkey.</p>

<dd>Hey Mono! If you browse through <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcontinental_nation.html#Europe_and_Asia" title="Transcontinental nation">Transcontinental country</a> you will discover that there is little divergence of opinion as to which continent Turkey has most of its land and people: <u>Turkey lies mainly in Asia</u> — and the Turks are not really any more or less unfortunate than any other countries, whether mono- or transcontinental. (See also <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balkans.html" title="Balkans">Balkans</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">Continent</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subregion.html" title="Subregion">Subregion</a>). Reorganizing the list alphabetically would of course make it easier to find a single country that one might want to search for in the list, not unlike thumbing through the yellow pages. But if you just want to browse randomly, the geographical ordering by continent seems more logical, and so I don't agree that the strictly alphabetical order is necessarily more user friendly. In any case, only a fraction of all states in the world are listed, and of the transcontinental ones, only Turkey is currently listed twice. So perhaps what this article <i><b>really</b></i> needs is to be expanded instead? <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 03:25, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Heh I was joking that the Turks were "poor" because others were arguing over which continent they lay in.&#160;;) Well okay - seeing that you put a good argument against the alphbetical list perhaps you can help with a more logical geographical framework? Posibly one of the other pages on wikipedia has such a thing already that we can plagiarise? Bear in mind that eventualy the entire section will be converted from the simple list to a slightly more verbose discussion citing law, similar to what I have made for Australia (at least that's the plan if enough reliable information can be sourced). <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonotonehell_775d.html" title="User:Monotonehell">Monotonehell</a> 14:35, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey. I would guess that the Nubians are the remaining modern descendants of the ancient Nubians, and that other groups that also speak langauegs in the Nubian language family may also be just that. Not my core field of interest this... I just felt that since these people still exist as an identifiable group they should have an article in the ethnic group series.</dd>

<p>Hey BA, thanks for the kind words, but I couldn't be a diplomat as that would mean supporting and promoting the Bush administration, although academia is a possibility at this point. You've done pretty well with the mediating yourself and I give you props for your world view which looks to be very similar to my own. Not sure how the Turkish people or French people page is going to go though. Looks like ethnic perception really varies and I can't really criticize the French for wanting to be inclusive and leave behind the notion of ethnic groups altogether either. Wikipedia is an interesting look at how people from all over the world think though.

<p>I have to say that I disagree. Having the ethnic group template there will just confuse people into thinking that they are a distinct ethnic group. Yes, I know that they maintain a separate identity, but they still consider themselves Turks, such as our lovely lady Inanna pointed out.</p>

<p>I don't think that there is a word called <i>Afrikaanses</i>. The language is Afrikaans and is spoken by Afrikaners.

<dd>The word is a fairly recent neologism. Afrikaners might occasionally be used for any speaker of the language regardless of race, but such usage is contentious.

<dd>Yes that article does talk about the language group <i>Afrikaanse</i> but that article is written in afrikaans and I have used it too when speaking in afrikaans about the language group, it is like saying <i>Suid-Afrikaanse</i> in afrikaans as in english <i>South African</i>. As far as I know and read in that article that the word <i>Afrikaanses</i> has not been carried over directly into english as have Afrikaans or Afrikaner has. I don't think english has a word for that means <i>Afrikaanse</i> or <i>Afrikaanses</i> nor has it ever been used around me.--<a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">Jcw69</a> 07:20, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My firm understanding is that <i>Afrikaner</i> does not refer to the language community, but to the ethnic group. I could be mistaken, but this is what I have been taught to be the preferred and more modern and PC usage. The italics in the article is not meant to denote emphasis but the introduction of a non-English name or term, or a quote or a title.</dd>
<dd>So, how else can one refer to the language community in English then? =J <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 07:42, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Yes, I understand where you're coming from, we need a word that refers to the afrikaans language community but as I said I don't think there is such a word in english that refers to the afrikaans language community. I have asked a number of afrikaners and afrikaans teachers and all say that Afrikaanses does not sound correct, they would either use Afrikaners or Afrikaans speaking people to discribe the english word for Afrikaanse --<a href="../../../j/c/w/User%7EJcw69_dff3.html" title="User:Jcw69">Jcw69</a> 08:22, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Big Adamsky! Thank you for the input on the maps I am creating for Norway municipalities. I would definitely be interested in designing similar maps for the traditional districts - as long as there is valid and legibile data to use for compilation (for the Norway municipalities, I mainly used my dataset plus the pictures located on [<a href="http://www.reuber-norwegen.de" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.reuber-norwegen.de" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] to ensure as much accuracy as possible (of course, I am always improving my dataset). Contact me via email directly (wiki option) and we can discuss this more (my time is freely donated for this).</p>
<p>As far as the cartographic conventions - you know as a fellow cartographer that sometimes you make certain decisions based on sacrificing convention for legibility, etc. (makes each map unique). But I promise to go back over these maps and 'tweak' them (adding the numbers in, formatting the page for the best look, etc). I don't really want to abbreviate - I've already chosen to use the localized names (instead of romanizing everything), so I may have to resort to numbers. If I should be following a certain convention for each country, please let me know and I will conform the maps to the convention. Look to see updates in the next week or so.

<p>Back at ya! Thanks for your note. I'll help if I can: I've the ability to proceed as you suggest and long for standards too, but timing may be an issue for me (i.e., sloow turnaround). I'll keep you apprised and will comment s'more soon.</p>
<p>Regarding <a href="../../../r/e/p/Talk%7ERepublic_of_Ireland_c399.html" title="Talk:Republic of Ireland">Éire</a>, I've replied to your prior comments there. In any event, a vote modelled on the Georgia vote is a great idea. I currently see six options:</p>
<ul>
<li>your proposal</li>
<li>my three proposals</li>
<li>status quo</li>
<li>other</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, I think we can resolve the finer points about language (e.g., "British Isles") afterward. Thoughts? If there are no objections, I will devise the vote before week's end and advertise. Merci!

<p>Hello again! Given the above etc. can you take a peak at this, which I propose mounting and advertising in the next few days. I've alphabetised the options and hope the structure makes sense. Please feel free to edit, after which I'll place it on the RoI talk page or similar.</p>

<p>I do not know what you mean by Western Europe, but I can assure that in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Belgium, etc (pretty much all of Western Europe it seems to me) everybody knows there are only 5 continents. Also, nobody calls it Australia, that is a country, the continent is Oceania, and includes Australia and New Zealand (plus other smaller states)</p>
<p>Please, see previous post. Just buy any European geography schoolbook. I do not know what you mean by western Europe, but if in Scandinavia they teach differently, maybe you can add Western Europe except Scandinavian Countries. <i>[unsigned]</i></p>
