<p>(This is adapted from a note I wrote at <a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoreman_c985.html" title="User talk:Coreman">User talk:Coreman</a>.)</p>
<p>Over at the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Doctor_Who_56b3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Doctor Who">Doctor Who WikiProject</a> we've only just noticed this rather impressive <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_Chronology_5a4a.html" title="Doctor Who Chronology">Doctor Who Chronology</a>. As a fellow <i>Doctor Who</i> fan I recognize the appeal and value of a page like this, putting all the Doctor's adventures from sundry media into order. Unfortunately, there may be problems with having this page in its current form <i>on Wikipedia</i>. Specifically, it may be in violation of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a> policy, which excludes "any new analysis or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas", or any content which "introduces a synthesis of established facts in a way that builds a particular case... without attributing the synthesis to a reputable source." Even though Big Finish helpfully provides "production codes" which show how they hope to fit each audio in, the consolidation of all those production codes and "this audio follows..." notes into a single document constitutes original research, I fear. So does the presentation of Big Finish's "seasons".</p>
<p>There's also a concern about the list and the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> policy. In the case of <i>Doctor Who'</i>s chronology, there is no official BBC policy about how to fit the television series, audios and novels together, and (as you probably know) fans differ on exactly what is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html#Doctor_Who" title="Canon (fiction)">canonical</a>. If we present a chronology with the TV series and audios, some fans will ask how we justify keeping out the novels, or the <i>Doctor Who Magazine</i> comic. Others will say, "only the TV series counts" and object to implicitly giving Big Finish the same status as the TV series. Finally, there are some questions about exactly where some stories fit — the BBC novels don't explictly state which TV stories they fit between, and then there's the thorny question of how to rectify the various lives of the Eighth Doctor. (You're probably familiar with the arguments here.)</p>
<p>There are several websites which have attempted, or are attempting, to create what Russell T. Davies has called "the Complete History of the Doctor". These include the <a href="http://www.drwhoguide.com/who.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.drwhoguide.com/who.htm" rel="nofollow">Doctor Who Reference Guide</a>, the <a href="http://www.gallifreyone.com/guides-canon.php" class="external text" title="http://www.gallifreyone.com/guides-canon.php" rel="nofollow">Canon-Keeper's Guide</a> at Outpost Gallifrey, and <a href="http://www.whoniverse.org/biography/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.whoniverse.org/biography/index.php" rel="nofollow">The Doctor's Biography</a> (still in development) at the Whoniverse. If you look closely at these, you'll notice that they don't tally up exactly — that's because the authors have had to make judgment calls about places where the continuity is unclear, and their judgments don't always agree. Since Wikipedia has to be neutral, we can't take sides in disputes like that. However, we <i>could</i> have an article which points readers towards these different efforts, without taking sides between them.</p>
<p>If we can't save the page in its current form, you might be able to move it to <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Tardis" class="extiw" title="wikicities:c:Tardis">TARDIS Index File</a>, a <i>Doctor Who</i> wiki at Wikicities, which isn't restricted by the same policies as Wikipedia proper. It's another option to consider.</p>
<p>I hope that we can come to an amicable solution for this page. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 02:51, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think a synthesis is supposed to mean something which draws a conclusion. Just taking stories which individually have chronological placements and using them to create a list of stories arranged chronologically isn't really a synthesis except in a very trivial sense. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 02:28, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The codes to unreleased McGann serials have been established here and there, such as the Big Finish <a href="http://www.doctorwho.co.uk/drwho_main/bf080_timeworks.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.doctorwho.co.uk/drwho_main/bf080_timeworks.shtml" rel="nofollow">website</a>. You'll also notice they don't use slashes here.</p>
<p>As for the "season" divisions, if you can think of something better or more neutral to call them, then by all means go ahead. I'm just following what I see as standard practice. They do need to be broken up, though. There's no good, for instance, throwing the Frobisher stuff in with the Evelyn Smythe material -- and then tacking that all onto the end of season 23. That wouldn't at all reflect the intent of the audios. Heck, the Sixth-Doctor-and-Mel audios are set long after the Evelyn stories, toward the end of the Sixth Doctor's life.</p>
<p>There are really three kinds of Big Finish stories:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) stories that fill in the cracks, like the random Turlough and Mel and Peri pieces which are set between arbitrary TV episodes;</dd>
<dd>2) stories in a new ongoing "continuity" that BF has forged for each of the Doctors, most of which are set in new, "phantom seasons" between established TV seasons; and</dd>
<dd>3) the stories based on the comics and Virgin novels, which (as you'd expect) aren't really intended to fit into the continuity quite as easily -- though there is space for all of them.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's the second category that's really at issue here, as this is the bulk of the the actual Big Finish "canon" as it were, and each lump of ongoing continuity has its own unique space carved out for it. You can't just ignore this detail, and yet aside from the McGann seasons, Big Finish hasn't -- to my knowledge -- provided any official names for these runs. Again, the only model I have to work with is what I've seen other people using: the "season <strike>6a</strike> 6B" template established decades back. Now, this seems functional to me -- and again, it reflects what I've seen elsewhere. I'm open to alternatives, though.</p>
<p>Just for fun, I wonder about the numbering scheme used for the new series episodes in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials_d22a.html" title="List of Doctor Who serials">List of Doctor Who serials</a>. After some pressure, stories like <i>Aliens of London &amp; World War Three</i> got renumbered 164a and 164b. That's a simple and practical way to organize them. I've not seen it done elsewhere, though. Even numbering the new series episodes using the same system as the old strikes me as rather arbitrary, as it's certainly not how the current production team labels things. It is, however, how I've seen other fansites do it -- so all right; fair enough.</p>
<p>I wonder where the "a" and "b" labels come from in this instance, and what distinguishes that situation from the Big Finish one. They both strike me as issues of practicality, more than anything. --Aderack 06:14, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've added the upcoming releases which have been scheduled and have production codes listed on the Big Finish website. However, I fudged one production code: <i><a href="http://www.doctorwho.co.uk/drwho_main/bf085_red.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.doctorwho.co.uk/drwho_main/bf085_red.shtml" rel="nofollow">Red</a></i> is listed as 7EB, which was already used for <i>Flip-Flop</i>. I've guessed that that was a mistake, and they meant 7ED. But if that guess is too speculative, we can remove it until the website is corrected, or until the audio is released. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 17:19, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Having listened to it, I'm pretty sure it's meant to be FB -- in that it seems like an attempt to somewhat explain why the Doctor became so much darker after season 24. Given that it's either going to be DB or FB, and without absolute clarification either one is an arbitrary choice, I think there's more grounding for the latter. Again, given the way that Big Finish works, I get the impression that's what they were doing here. Changing now, on that basis. --71.139.9.136 02:27, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Khaosworks asked whether we thought the <i>Doctor Who Unbound</i> stories should be included on this page. My instinct is no ��— the whole point of the Unbound series was that they were outside of regular <i>Doctor Who</i> continuity, which is what this page is all about.

<p>What is that season 30b stuff?

<dd>This argument makes sense to me. Although I'm sure the "Season 27/Series 1" debate continues unabated, I don't think that there are many folks who want to say that the 2005 series was Season 31. Given that, I think that if we're going to use conjectural seasons at all we may as well call the last lot of McGann audios (<i>Terror Firma</i> on) "Season 31". Anybody object? —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 06:30, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I assume the thinking behind this is that while the audios prior to <i>Terror Firma</i> were in discrete seasons, the ones after are not anymore, hence there is a difficulty in saying whether they belong to a particular "season" or not. Hence 30a, in the same way that stuff after <i>Survival</i> is called 26a up to the introduction of Hex, whereupon it becomes 26b. Not that I'm saying it shouldn't be Season 31, but at least there's a consistency to it. --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 07:05, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see that reasoning, but I think that it falls down a bit when you consider the difference between the "seasons" created for the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors and the seasons released for the Eighth Doctor. 5/6/7 are all set in-between existing television stories, and so their "seasons" are given letters to fit in accordingly.</dd>

<dd>On the other hand, the anon isn't really quite right when he says "like it is in any other episode guide". There may be a guide somewhere that calls it "season 31", but the Canon-Keeper's Guide at OG calls them "Big Finish Eighth Doctor Adventures: Season 1" through 5. That's the problem with arbitrary naming, I suppose. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 08:15, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have to go with the Big Finish website on this issue. Firstly, that website states the seasons as Seasons 27 to 30. (This information was stated in the messages they put on the website, not on the monthly listings.) So, everything prior to "Terror Firma" should be under whole numbered seasons, while the "Terror Firma" onwards adventures should be under 30b. --<a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoreman_8259.html" title="User:Coreman">Coreman</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoreman_c985.html" title="User talk:Coreman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Coreman_bdd2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Coreman">contribs</a>)

Given that, and at the risk of sounding like Donald Rumsfeld, I'm not sure that the absence of a "Season 31" mention on the Big Finish website automatically means that it should be called "30b". Frankly, I don't see the website as supporting either "31" or "30b" — either way, it's an arbitrary call. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 01:59, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm don't think this story is a Seventh Doctor story (like the article says), so I changed it to 'Other' for now. But it still needs a better classification than that.</p>

<p>When listened to, No place like Home clearly positions itself having taken place <i>after</i> the events of The Church and the Crown as Erimem is vastly more familiar with both the doctor's personality and the TARDIS's workings and interior (the wardrobe) there than in the latter. -Mr.Bob</p>
