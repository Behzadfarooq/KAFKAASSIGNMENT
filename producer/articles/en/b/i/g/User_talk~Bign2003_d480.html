<p>Please do not delete this page. I am not self promoting anything here at all, simply supplying information about a feature film that was recently made in England that I am a fan of.</p>
<p>The film was given a wide-release, respected as THE amature movie of 2006 and is enjoyed by thousands of fans online who dosnt have anywhere to go for information on the film.</p>
<p>I have supplied only one link to an external site, the company site that created the film. This is not self-promotion, it is simply making information about a film available to a larger audiance.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBign2003_ed51.html" title="User:Bign2003">Bign2003</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bign2003_50b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bign2003">contribs</a>) 20:27, 16 July 2006.</small></p>

<p>I wanted to tell you in as friendly a manner possible that it seems to a lot of people that you created 2 additional accounts, JustinChimento and JeffDeHart, to help you in the discussion about Gangsters in Love. These sort of accounts are referred to as "sockpuppets" and they are not permitted per <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">policy</a>. It is also possible that these are friends you recruited to particpate in the debate; in that case, they are still covered under the sockpuppet policy because they do not represent the views of the "wikipedia community" (i.e. regular editors), Your actions were fairly obvious because this happens all the time. But since it is a generally mild infraction, if you want to stick around and build some credibility, this will easily blow over (as long as it doesn't go farther).</p>
<p>Regarding your question about some articles you want to work on, articles that have been deleted once are subject to <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">speedy deletion</a> if recreated in substantially the same way. However, you can work on the articles in your user space, that is, subpages of your user page. Just write a link to a new page, like this [[User:Bign2003/Gore]], which will look like this when you're done User:Bign2003/Gore. Click on the link and start editing, and you will have a user page! There is a lot more (but not unlimited) flexibility about what you can put in your user space, but you should be able to create your articles there. (the user space policy is <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a>)</p>
<p>To move the articles back into main space, you will have to address whatever the reasons were for deletion (not notable, not verifiable, or whatever). If you feel you have addressed any concerns and the article now meets all the applicable policies, you can use the <i>move</i> tab to move it to a proper article title, or you can cut and paste into a new window. (*there are a lot of policies but the most important are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">everything must be verifiable</a>, you must use <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, there should be no <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and the subject should be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough to deserve an encyclopedia article.</p>
<p>If you have other questions about editing you can put {{<a href="../../../h/e/l/Template%7EHelpme_09e4.html" title="Template:Helpme">Helpme</a>}} on this page and someone will stop by to see what you need.Good luck. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:42, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks Thatcher, I will re-create the articals in my user space soon for assesment. One thing however - the two people you talk about who *maybe* me - I have never heard of them before - what lead you to that conclusion if I maybe so bold as to ask? --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBign2003_ed51.html" title="User:Bign2003">Joe</a> 22:26, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I was asked about this by someone who was involved in the discussion over the article Gangsters in Love, which you apparently wrote. (I say apparently because when an article is deleted, it vanishes from your contribution list; but you seem to have uploaded some images relating to the movie claiming authorship, so I'm guess you wrote the article and are connected with the movie somehow.) Two of the participants in the discussion, <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinChimento_c37d.html" title="User:JustinChimento">JustinChimento</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustinChimento_8025.html" title="User talk:JustinChimento">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JustinChimento_4c97.html" title="Special:Contributions/JustinChimento">contribs</a>) and <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffDeHart_3340.html" title="User:JeffDeHart">JeffDeHart</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffDeHart_5395.html" title="User talk:JeffDeHart">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JeffDeHart_8088.html" title="Special:Contributions/JeffDeHart">contribs</a>), were brand new accounts that had never edited anything before. When you've been around for awhile, you'll recognize that as a common indicator that either one person has created multiple identities or has recruited helpers to try and defend the article. I did not see the discussion or the article before it was deleted but I think the suspicion is a fair one since it is a common enough occurrence. On the other hand if you say you had no idea who those new accounts were, then I have no reason to doubt you. Whatever the truth, it's no big deal in the long run. (There have been more serious cases of users abusing multiple accounts, such as using one account to vandalize so that the main account can come along and take credit for cleaning it up. This is a strange place some times&#160;:) ) Good luck with your articles. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThatcher131_b35e.html" title="User talk:Thatcher131">Thatcher131 (talk)</a> 03:25, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks again Thatcher - I'll try out what you have suggested and see how it goes, --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBign2003_ed51.html" title="User:Bign2003">Joe</a> 09:58, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
