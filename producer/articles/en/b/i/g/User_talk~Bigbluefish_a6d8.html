<p>&gt; While trying to clean up Paedobaptism which has a rather messy explanation of its derivation, I looked up Paediatrics and &gt; Paedophilia to see their take on the greek stem, and both of them use different Greek words again as the source! I suspect this may &gt; be not only a consistency problem but also accuracy on at least two articles' part. I've been told you're the best person to ask &gt; about these things, so I was wondering if you were able to shed some light on the issue. Cheers --BigBlueFish 09:58, 8 October 2005 &gt; (UTC)</p>
<p>WHO TOLD YOU THAT!? I'll sue the wiki foundation for making such a remark on my part!&#160;;) Cabal! Cabal! It's a conspiracy, i tell you! (I fixed it, and all those words are really the same word, it's just that in Greek nouns have different ending syllables that give the noun it's gender and case (το παιδ-ί, του παιδ-ιού, το παιδ-ί, ώ παιδ-ί!) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProject2501a_7385.html" title="User:Project2501a">Project2501a</a> 22:04, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>What do pedobaptist denominations do with adults who are born-again Christians? And perhaps more importantly what do they call it if the answer is that they baptise them? Presumably it isn't infant baptism, but is it believer's baptism or is that too exclusive to the anti-pedobaptist stance?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We baptise all ages (both children and adults) in all ways (both sprinkling and dunking). If an adult who has not been baptised before comes to faith and asks for baptism, we will baptise them. We call it "baptism". We don't call it "believer's baptism" for adults because we see all baptism as baptism of believers: part of the point of infant baptism is that the child is already seen as part of God's family until such time as they choose not to be. Does that answer your question? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wednesday_Island_d463.html" title="User:The Wednesday Island">The Wednesday Island</a> 14:04, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it does&#160;:). In particular it makes it clear to me that the terms <i>infant baptism</i> and <i>believers baptism</i> are not directly opposing ideologies, rather specific cases of the general practice of baptism, though with each other they are generally incompatible. The whole coverage of baptism still leaves a lot of structure to be desired. Some day I hope to have a go at sorting it out. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 10:14, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologise for making this change again. However, this case is slightly different to the <a href="../../../n/u/w/Nuwaubianism.html" title="Nuwaubianism">Nuwaubianism</a> issue. I accept that I should notice if my edits have been reverted, however the decision to edit is a misjudgement on my part. I did notice that it was indented; however, while the tone of the paragraph is certainly rather nonsensical, as far as I can see it contains no other spelling mistakes, and also the misspelling was not marked with [sic]. (I have just marked it as such). I This influenced my decision. In future I shall be more cautious with indented or quoted material.</p>
<p>With regard to the question of an "automated process", I am using tools which automate the processes of searching for and retrieving articles, locating errors and recording corrections. However, I make all actual edits myself – there are no automated 'bot' edits being made from this account. The 'system' in this case ultimately comes down to my decision as to whether or not to press the "Save page" button; this decision is never made for me, so such situations are certainly accommodated for. It is my judgement that is at fault – where the situation is unclear, I have tended towards making the correction rather than leaving it uncorrected. This is something I will need to adjust for.

<dd>Thanks for the quick response&#160;:). I had considered putting in [sic]s but the whole quote is actually littered with mistakes. I've put a little note at the end to that effect, rather than littering the quote with [sic]s everywhere. I hope that makes it a bit clearer. I hope I didn't sound too harsh in my original message... I suspected that was the kind of system you used (I use AWB every now and again too) and I don't blame you for the occasional hiccup. I only just saw your correction count, and for that kind of work it's worth it if there's a mistake every so often. Thanks for the revert as well. I'm intrigued now as to who the vandal was. It was made from a college where just a handful of people from my school have moved to... stranger still that they found me on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 12:37, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally I'm persuaded on the issue. Quite frankly Wikipedia doesn't need to and shouldn't write about certain social phenomena. There is a tempation to think, "Wow, Wikipedia is so big. There is an article about almost everything I can name," but that shouldn't be the case. The Game (game) didn't help anyone who might want to learn information about The Game for research, since it is just a summary of what a certain group thinks of it. Its viral nature means that it can change from just one word of mouth to another. People who want an idea of what people on the internet capable of publishing on the internet perceive The Game to be can get one by searching for all the blogs and forums out there. It doesn't need to be collated into a piece of original research for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 21:12, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Very good question. I will be sure to assign the payment as fairly as I can. First off, only people who have been working on it since the offer was made qualify for the reward. Also, people will be rewarded in proportion (or close enough) to their work. A person who has done the most work will get the most pay.

<p>Hi, I really appreicate your advice. I still have the problem - let me clarify - the pages appear normally when I am reading them, with the exception of a few small things hereand there - the "your continued donations" for example. BUT when I open a page to edit, the entire article text appears in a very very small font with lots of serifs and things. Rolling the click wheel does increase it, but also increases everything else so that its around 72 points while the editing window text is still pretty small (though larger). It is also for sure in the same weird font. Any clue? <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaisershatner_51b9.html" title="User:Kaisershatner">Kaisershatner</a> 19:41, 2 May 2006 (UTC) Oh, I'm using Mozilla an Firefox and cleared my cache. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaisershatner_51b9.html" title="User:Kaisershatner">Kaisershatner</a> 19:41, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds thoroughly bizarre. Also check your default font settings at Tools &gt; Options &gt; Content - the Wikipedia styles might be overriding these defaults in all but a handful of contexts. If it is this it ought to be followed up, since browser defaults of this type shouldn't really persist in the monobook skin. If not, I haven't a clue.

<dd>Hi again, and thanks again. The problem seems to have resolved. I removed popups, rebooted my computer, and reinstalled Firefox.

<p>Hello, I see that you have redirected Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff) to Prelude in C-sharp minor, and with the argument that there are no other preludes <b>yet</b>. I think this is a strange action, as there are obviously tens or maybe hundreds of preludes in Csharp minor. Wikipedia is still a bit deficient on classical works, so in the future there will certainly be an article about another prelude, so that the redirect will be a useless operation.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Classical_music_bb18.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Classical music">Wikipedia:WikiProject Classical music</a> the title should contain the composer. Maybe you can discuss this issue there?</p>

<dd>No, you're absolutely right, it's a sensible convention to have. It just resembled to me the wider convention of using brackets to distinguish between articles that would otherwise have the same name, and noted that there weren't any such articles. In moving it back I've secured a redirect to the Rach. article anyway. If it's synonymous enough (which the article suggests it might be) then at least people looking for it under that name will now find it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 20:32, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry the edit seemed so heavy-handed. I acted without hesitation because the anonymous comment on the talk page made a good point about the structure and leaning of the article, and I regard such comments as insightful outside views which are worth acting upon when normally I would let an article slide as it's hard work to gradually work on the integrity of an article's structure. The paragraph on influences, however, I have no qualms about removing. The article is about Muse, not about their fourth album, and while the article on that album discusses influences, I don't feel they are relevant there. For one, they are not <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a>, and claiming an influence without a source is a no-no. Secondly, there is already information about general influences on the band, and the information there didn't attempt to identify what influences were new about this album. For example, I don't think there is any more Rachmaninoff in this album, if not less, than in previous ones. On the other hand, Franz Ferdinand <i>have</i> been mentioned by the band as an influence on the difference in sound of the album, with reference to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermassive_Black_Hole_cdc1.html" title="Supermassive Black Hole">Supermassive Black Hole</a> which states this; maybe the album article ought to pick up more on these, but I still feel that these are deeper aspects of the album sound, rather than significant elements of their history. Particularly, the presence of influences in one album give no indication that the influences are a permanent feature of the band's future sound.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I make no claim to being any more of a Wikipedian than are you, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.215.167.137_9195.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.215.167.137">201.215.167.137</a> and the rest of the editors on here. I've tried to underline this by focusing on editing articles, rather than joining Wikiprojects, binge voting or (heaven forbid) engaging in userbox abuse, and in general, the edits I make could be made by anybody else. Please don't feel unnecessarily alienated from anyone in the community. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 22:05, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, but more or less we have something of a structure. If you read carefully, each album of the article has a brief info about the album's lyrical and musical themes and objects. It's kind of a following. I did it because it was a structure from their previos ones. I wanted to follow the structure. On the other hand yep, I agree that the influences should be implemented more carefully regarding what Bellamy says and what we the listeners listen to. It's kind of part of that structure. And I like it, I have to say. I think that we should have it. More or less, I do not agree with you. I think we should find a middle way to satisfy us and the readers. <i>Do</i> implement, but with carefulness, because structurally it's better I think.

<dd>The past album sections leave a good deal to be desired, but nevertheless, I agree, if there is relevant, verifiable information to add to the article on chronological influences then it is most welcome. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 12:47, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi BigBlueFish. Thanks for your comments on my work. At the present time I am not producing SVG format images because adobe are stopping their support for the format in 2008, and they make the most prominent plugin. I am also peitioning as I feel wikipedia should be natively viewable on all mainstream browsers. At present SVG is only natively viewable via Opera.</p>
<p>Provisionally it has also been stated by Microsoft that vistas version of IE may not support the SVG Format (though I doubt that, they often say these kind of things). You will also notice that much of my work is uploaded at large resolutions (2000 x 2000 pixels plus!). This means that for users who want to see larger versions the provisions are there. Also my diagrams are drawn at 300dpi. When printing them you will find a 2000 x 2000 pixel image still only fills an A4 page, but that the print quality is superbly detailed. More info about my views on the SVG format can be found at the very top of my user page although its mostly repeating this. I hope this better explains my position on the matter. I'm not boo-hooing the SVG format though I should point out. Its a great idea and I wish the native support for it was there, but it would be nice to resolve the current issues before I convert my work to SVG.</p>
<p>I'm requesting that while I research into this and hopefully come to a solution, that no-one update my images with SVG versions. I 100% appreciate that from a copyright perspective I have no right to ask that, as in uploading the images to wikipedia I accepted that they could be shamelessly edited by others and were no longer my property. But I am asking it politely as one wikipedian to other wikipedians, to save us all time in the long run. If SVG is determined to be a good and accpetable format I will update my future and past work accordingly.</p>
<p>In any case, thanks very much for your input and if you want more information about my SVG research, feel free to check my user page which i'll be updating as I go along. Thanks. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianProlific_7186.html" title="User:WikipedianProlific">WikipedianProlific</a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedianProlific_3841.html" title="User talk:WikipedianProlific"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 19:51, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wish individual admins would quit taking abitrary decisions on this issue and seek consensus on a policy for GWA. I have been editing for years now on GWA with the occasional random block. I don't see what's changed and I don't see what blocking GWA is in aid of. Vandals using GWA are identified by their true IP because POST requests aren't proxied so edits are never made by GWA users. Blocking the accelerator just blocks the web form. If this is a permanent policy then I would like to see it written and a proper resource explaining what's going on to the users who come up against the block. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 21:51, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
