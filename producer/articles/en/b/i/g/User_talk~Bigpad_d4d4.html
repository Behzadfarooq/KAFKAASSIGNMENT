<p>Hi there. I think that your change strikes a fair balance. I thought that Bingham's considerataion of Best for 1982 was worth mentioning, although on reflection I agree that I put too great an emphasis on it in my original edit. I think it a terrible shame Best never played in the World Cup; his career coming at the wrong time, particularly when Northern Ireland qualified in 1958 and then back to back in 1982 and 1986. Very sad loss indeed.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking my comments on board, and bringing the right balance to them.</p>
<p>All the best (no pun intended!)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Sdavis.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

<p>Thanks for uploading Image:ReggieJackson HomeRun.jpg. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia_Foundation_83d9.html" title="Wikimedia Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</a> is very careful about the images included in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> because of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright law</a> (see Wikipedia's <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_8c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright">Copyright policy</a>).</p>
<p>The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights.

Find the appropriate template in <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> and place it on the image page like this: <code>{{TemplateName}}</code>.</p>
<p>Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information can be deleted by an administrator.

<p>In reply to your email --</p>
<p>I'm am glad that you are going to the extra effort to determine the copyright status of any images you upload. The source for ReggieJackson HomeRun.jpg (<a href="http://www.africanamericans.com/}" class="external free" title="http://www.africanamericans.com/}" rel="nofollow">http://www.africanamericans.com/}</a> claims copyright and all rights are reserved. If you find an image on a website it's probably best to poke around on the site and check for copyright notices. I hope this answers your question. A note on my talk page will get a quicker reply than an email. -- <a href="../../../n/o/_/User%7ENo_Guru_cc59.html" title="User:No Guru">No Guru</a> 03:49, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Bigpad. There are problems with each of the other images that you have uploaded, including Image:Echarlton.jpg, Image:Gdott.jpg, and Image:39586555 davis203.jpg. Be aware that there are many examples of copyright infringement — including dubious claims of fair use — on Wikipedia that have not net been cleaned-up. It is therefore not safe to simply copy what you see being done with images in other articles. Please read the following pages very carefully before uploading any additional images:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, websites do not need to state that an image is copyrighted in order for it to receive protection under the law. All contemporary works are copyrighted by default; do not lightly claim that images are <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublic_domain_57d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Public domain">public domain</a> without being certain that that is the case. Also note <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Counterexamples" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use counterexamples 4 and 5</a> before claiming fair use of an image. Finally, remember that Wikipedia is a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_content.html" title="Free content">free content</a> encyclopedia, and does not allow copyrighted images of any kind when there are free alternatives available. There is substantial opportunity to procure or produce free images of individuals such as living, active snooker players, and thus little justification for the use a copyrighted photo from a press agency.</p>

Please check the snooker page history, <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigez_6297.html" title="User:Bigez">Bigez</a> was the one adding a load of chimp rubbish - something he has been warned for (by me once with a test4 - the warning you added to his user page was in the wrong place - warnings should go in the talk page, otherwise a user doesn't know they are there) and I removed his vandalism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Snooker&amp;diff=54091111&amp;oldid=54090864" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Snooker&amp;diff=54091111&amp;oldid=54090864" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>That is quite alright - mistakes happen! In general when warning vandals it is easier to use the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#Dealing_with_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">{{test}} templates</a>. They allow a standard warning form and ensure if a vandal doesn't cease then when reporting him to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> they can be quickly dealt with (if a vandal has the full 'suite' of test warnings and hasn't stopped then a block is straight forward). An additional benefit of the templates are that they aren't too personal, sometimes with vandals if an informal warning is too personal then it may act as a form of a challenge to the vandal to defy it rather than cease. Best wishes for your future editing. <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 13:52, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You replaced the content of <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Salaam_ddb1.html" title="Abdul Salaam">Abdul Salaam</a> with a disambiguation page, and created a new page, <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Salaam_%28Guantanamo_detainee%29_ab3b.html" title="Abdul Salaam (Guantanamo detainee)">Abdul Salaam (Guantanamo detainee)</a>, where you cut and pasted the old contents of the original Abdul Salaam article.</p>
<p>That is not the best way to create disambiguation pages. Cutting and pasting, like you did, obscures the edit history. You could have:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>moved</b> the original <b>[[Abdul Salaam]]</b> to <b>[[Abdul Salaam (Guantanamo detainee)]]</b></li>
<li>You could then have edited the new article named <b>[[Abdul Salaam]]</b>, which the move had created, and which started as a simple redirection to <b>[[Abdul Salaam (Guantanamo detainee)]]</b>, and turned it into the disambiguation page.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach leaves the edit history, and the talk page, if it existed, easily accessible to future editors.</p>
<p>You also forgot to add a disambiguation line to <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdul_Salaam_%28football_player%29_94af.html" title="Abdul Salaam (football player)">Abdul Salaam (football player)</a>.</p>

<p>If you really think it is important for the [[Abdul Salaam]] article serve as the disambiguation page, without screwing around with the edit history for the previously existing article, you will have to ask for the help of an administrator.</p>
<p>I have no objection, in principle, to it being the disambiguation page. However, you put this beyond the power of ordinary users.</p>
<p>Normally, as I explained before, if you or I, or any ordinary user, wanted to create an article for a second individual who shared the same name as someone who already had an existing article, one option would be to move the existing article to a qualified name -- thus preserving its edit history, and associated talk page, if any. But you close this option, by creating an article with the appropriate name. So, moving the article won't work now, because the target name already exists.</p>
<p>Please undo the changes you made today. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 20:40, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I found Bobby Charlton's quote pretty hard to place in the article. I felt that the paragraph should have ended with "Maradona good, Pele better, and George Best", rather than being (slightly) interrupted by Charlton.</p>

<p>i only changed the "try and rescue" once, and yes it is necessary, because "try and rescue" is improper english. this is an encylopedia, and should be written like one. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsecboy_26dd.html" title="User:Parsecboy">Parsecboy</a> 20:46, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, What aspect of the above needed revising? I have reverted the last edit (not done by you by done on your prompting!, which only made a tricky enough section even more complicated. My wording was succinct, as opposed to a detailed explanation of every contingency bigpad 08:48, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I just thought a bit more detail could be added since I've always seen Wikipedia as the pursuit of collaborating as much knowledge as possible. I can see why such elaboration might not be too easy on the reader if you're reading it as a non-author or have no knowledge of the game (which of course many wouldn't when perusing the article). If you only meant to revert the last edit then I'm afraid you took out more than that, it's down to a barer format than when I padded it out. Just a question of finding a balance between being laconic and informative I guess. By "editing properly" I was referring more to a tinkering with the grammar/spelling of editors who had added to this section since you did, because some of it was a bit crap if you look at what I changed. Didn't mean to cause any offence. Kris 10:15, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi Kris, no offence taken or suggested! As you say, striking the balance between the casual browser and subject expert can be difficult. Maybe it wouldn't hurt to expand things a little, e.g. "A concession, when one player gives up due to being too far behind to have a realistic chance of winning the frame [without extra points from a large number of snookers]"</dd>
<dd>Something brief along these lines for the various scenarios might be ok. The only concern is that article is a little "dense" already and not that easy to follow. So we want to avoid making it any more like a Civil Service document. I keep an eye on it to try and cut down on unnecessary tinkering but it's always good to have additional feedback. All the best, Patrick</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>No problems Patrick, I think the section says all it really needs to now as per this discussion – I made a couple of tweaks but nothing too pedantic I hope, feel free to change further. Cheers, Kris 12:53, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the wider issue of the article page I was glad to read your comments on the talk page. I think it would be nice to give the whole page a thoroughly good modernisation and clean up. Minor details of the rules such as:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">If a player commits a foul, and his opponent considers that the position left is unattractive, he may request that the offender play again from that position.</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>is not what a reader wanting to find out about the game of snooker wants to read. The rules should be demerged into a separate article (if one doesn't already exist). There are loads of other things that could be tidied up/better explained/made to look better. I have a good few things running on WP at the moment but I will happily chip in a bit of work if you want to get the wheels moving (a full blown WIP page as I am shepherding for <a href="../../../p/h/y/Talk%7EPhysics_wip_d8dd.html" title="Talk:Physics/wip">Physics</a> may not be required, but it would be nice to gather a group of editors who can work together). It would also be good to work on this while there is a bit of extra interest during the season, with everything polished up for the World Championship starting. January sounds like a sensible time to start - the festive season being upon us some good WP time is hard to squeeze in at the moment! <a href="../../../s/f/c/User%7ESFC9394_9d0f.html" title="User:SFC9394">SFC9394</a> 20:22, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, No problem. I have rewritten that page. Some of the information is additional or adds to work I created on Wiki (e.g. the Sailortown link or the name of the streer in which the subject lived). I am also from that district of Belfast and remember that the subject attended my grandfather's funeral in 1979. I was surprised that there was no Wiki page on Rinty, one of our city's sporting heroes, and was pleased to "create it", so to speak. Anyhow, if what's there does not meet the bill I doubt that anyone could rewrite it much differently, as the bare facts are true.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, in the category "People from Belfast", I am listed under "P" instead of "M". How is this rectified? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigpad_e3fc.html" title="User:Bigpad">bigpad</a> 19:59, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The myth that George Best is one of the greatest of all time is more of a local notion, or rather British if you will, than global. I appreciate the impact he had on the British psyche but outside the UK he is not universally viewed as one of the greatest of all time and can therefore not be labelled as such in the article - a pedigree one should use only very sparingly. Outside British sentiment, incl. misused and non-existent quotes attributed to Pele, there isn't very much to back this claim of being among the very greatest.</p>
