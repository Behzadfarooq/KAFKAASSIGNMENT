<li>"all distances...were zero" - if you think of the singularity as a single point, then it's meaningless to talk about distances - a distance only makes sense between two distinct points</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A common way to think about this theory is to think of global <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a> and space separately - the theory assumes <a href="../../../w/e/y/Weyl%27s_postulate.html" title="Weyl's postulate">Weyl's postulate</a>, which states that this is possible. Thinking in this way, space itself has only existed for about 13-17 <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion.html" title="Billion">billion</a> years.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The model includes all of space-time, so the question "What was there before the Big Bang?" is meaningless in terms of the standard model.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The description of the singularity as "all distances being zero" seems to me to be correct. Even if it is a point, then all distances are zero: you don't need two <i>different</i> points to measure distance. I think it gives the beginner a good picture of what the singularity is like. Also, a point is often thought of as something infinitely or microscopically small, which doesn't fit well with the (most likely) spatially infinitely large universe right after the big bang.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Rates of Stretching of Space?</span></h3>
<p><b>Because of this, the distance between distant galaxies increases</b> faster than the speed of light. This is possible because special relativity only states that matter and information cannot travel through space faster than the speed of light. It doesn't limit how fast space itself can stretch.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It doesn't limit how fast space itself can stretch." The stretching of space is not a velocity. "fast" means a change in quantity X with respect to time, usually X=distance. It only has a meaning once you know what definitions of distance and time you are talking about.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Because of this, the change in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comoving_distance.html" title="Comoving distance">comoving distance</a> between distant galaxies divided by <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmological_time.html" title="Cosmological time">cosmological time</a> can be greater than the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_of_light.html" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a>. This a theoretical concept and not an observational one. For example, galaxies whose light will not reach the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> for tens of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion.html" title="Billion">billions</a> of years can be said to be moving away faster than the speed of light according to this definition. This does not violate the laws of <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, which is a local theory, which states, among other things, that matter and information cannot travel through space faster than the speed of light, but does not deal with global <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space-time.html" title="Space-time">space-time</a> concepts.</p>
<p>If an observational definition of distance to distant galaxies, e.g. the distance <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integral_calculus.html" title="Integral calculus">integrated</a> along the path of a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photon.html" title="Photon">photon</a> from a distant galaxy to the observer, using the locally valid distances at each point of the path, is used instead, then the change in <b>this</b> distance divided by <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmological_time.html" title="Cosmological time">cosmological time</a> <b>cannot</b> be greater than the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_of_light.html" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a>.</p>
<p>A strict <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empiricist.html" title="Empiricist">empiricist</a> might say that using the former definition only relates to galaxies which do not exist, in the sense in which chocolates hidden in an unopened box do not exist to the observer, but further discussion of this should go to one of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> pages. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">User:boud</a></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">"Scientific"</span></h3>
<p>I removed the word "scientific" from the front of "theory" in the second paragraph of Preamble.</p>
<p>The pont is that a theory in physics to be <i>scientific</i> has to be either consistent with the rest of physics or openly explain why it postulates new physics ("new physics" is physics without conservation of energy). The BB theory wouldn't work if energy couldn't be created from nothing since then photons would have distance dependent redshift even in a stationary space. According to Einsteinian gravitation this redshift would be within observational error of what is observed. But it doesn't seem good enough reason for postulating physics without conservation of energy.</p>
<p>Many people don't even know that Einsteinian gravitation <i>with</i> conservation of energy (unlike "general relativity", which is Einsteinian gravitation with conservation of energy removed for mathematical reasons) predicts parameters of accelerating expansion (apparent in this case) as they are measured in the real universe. Since those facts contradict the BB theory and not addressing facts that contradict one's theory is a basic sin against science (as explained by <a href="../../../f/e/y/Feynman.html" title="Feynman">Feynman</a>) the word "scientific" should be removed.</p>
<p>IMHO we should face the fact that we don't have a scientific cosmological theory yet, and we better start treating the Einsteinian gravitation seriously, istead of switching back to the Newtonian gravitation with its "attractive" and now even "repulsive forces". Maybe after almost a century we should finally acknowlede the fact that "gravitational attraction" (or "repulsion") is gone from physics forever? Just a thought. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimJast_e737.html" title="User:JimJast">Jim</a> 11:02, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your opinion is interesting, but non-notable. The Big Bang is a scientific theory in that it is consistent with physics. Conservation of coordinate energy is not demanded in GR -- conservation of energy is a local law that is due to a time symmetry (which doesn't exist in GR). 128.138.96.220 02:08, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I would move Weyl's postulate out of the first paragraph, which should only outline the highlights of the theory, and explain it later. Most people intuitively separate space and time anyway, so it's no biggie that the theory does the same, except for people who constantly think about spacetime manifolds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right now, the first paragraph contains too many "think"s and "thought"s. We should try to find more definite language.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the different distance definitions: We probably need a page explaining the various defintions of distance in an expanding universe.</li>

<p><i>Who put the bit...</i></p>
<p>Guilty as charged. i've put in <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wirtz.html" title="Wirtz">wirtz</a>. He published in a journal whose abbreviation is identical with your nick: "AN".</p>
<p>You'd have to read the AN article (in German) to check - i don't have convenient access - so i don't remember whether his K-correction was a magnitude (logarithm of luminosity) correction or the redshift (shift in wavelength). But i agree the definition has probably evolved, though AFAIK this is where the term comes from.</p>

<p>Comment on Eddington noted. Gamow, in his 1961 revised edition of "The Creation of the Universe", which I believe was his last publication concerning the CBR before 1965, predicted a value of 50K for the CBR. After Penzias and Wilson, he changed his claim, saying that 50K was calculated as an upper limit. However, in his book no mention of an upper limit is found: Gamow never hinted that his prediction was an upper limit, but was instead the most likely value. Also, Gamows main collaborators (Alpher and Hermann, 1949) predicted a temp of around 5K, and Gamow claimed that there would be other effect in addition which would increase the temperature by around 2K more. So Gamows early 50's prediction for a <i>lower limit</i> was around 7K. In the early 50's, based on non-expanding models Finlay-Freundlich predicted a closer temperature (&lt;5K) than Gamow . Max Born, in analyzing the work of F-F, concluded around 1954 that these observations could be made using radio techniques. The distinction between CBR and CMB is never made completely explicit in the works of Gamow or others. But then I havent read <i>all</i> of his papers so I might obviously be missing the important one where he specifically predicts microwave radiation. Im trying to be as historically accurate as possible so I will continue to research this distinction between CBR and CMB before making any more outrageous claims. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 14:35, Feb 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>For a true history of the predictions of the CBR see <a href="http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~assis/Apeiron-V2-p79-84(1995).pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~assis/Apeiron-V2-p79-84(1995).pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~assis/Apeiron-V2-p79-84(1995).pdf</a> as it's quite illuminating. You can also see quite clearly that the main page here has Gamow's predictions reversed. He first predicted 5K, then 7K then 50K just before the actual discovery. The main page therefore gives a distorted view of history and should be changed. --<a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfradig_46df.html" title="User:Infradig">Infradig (andrew)</a> 00:51, 31 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The two main references in this article to non-standard cosmology are well worded and decently placed. Another thing I would like to see changed is the paragraph on Hubble. He initially found a correlation between luminosity and redshift. Only later was this interpreted as a velocity/distance relation. He was cautious the whole time, explicitly warning that it could be wrong, and that alternate interpretations of redshift will change the validity of certain interpretations of the Hubble law. In his latter years, Hubble had severe doubt about the velocity/distance interpretation, arguing that the universal expansion is incorrect (again, see references in the non-standard talk page.) Reddi, I too would like to see the non-standard articles improved, to a similar extent as this one. - <a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 00:05, Feb 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Olber's paradox</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../o/l/b/Olber%27s_paradox.html" title="Olber's paradox">Olber's paradox</a> is a metaphysical or philosophical debate based on faulty premises, much like <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xeno%27s_paradox.html" title="Xeno's paradox">Xeno's paradox</a>. Olber's paradox states that the sky should be infinitely bright always. For this to be true, space would have to be a perfect conductor of energy and there would have to be an infinite amount of energy a finite distance from Earth. Neither of these assumptions hold true when compared to reality. Olber's paradox is not a paradox to be solved but a red herring to be discarded. Though Olber's paradox is not relevant in any way to reality, solutions have also been offered based on the assumptions that the universe is essentially infinite in age and size as well as being completely ordinary with no fantastic, unobservable matter or fantastic, unobservable energies<a href="http://home.wanadoo.nl/ronald.koster/olber.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.wanadoo.nl/ronald.koster/olber.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>The cited paper is actually a very nice paper. There is one problem. He concludes that Olber's paradox results in finite energy, but he doesn't go ahead and calculate the integral. If he does, he'll find out what people did in the early 19th century when they tried this solution and that is that you end up with the sky being the same temperature as the surface of the stars. The problem with shielding is that if you shield the energy, the shielding will heat until it reaches the same temperature as the radiating object. You don't end up with infinite amounts of energy, but you end up with non-black skies. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoadrunner_b57c.html" title="User:Roadrunner">Roadrunner</a> 02:17, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once again, space is not a perfect conductor. It's very good, but not perfect. Conservation of energy rules here. Regardless of the "solution" I offered for Olber's paradox, none of that changes the fact that Olber's paradox is not science. Olber's paradox is more of a metaphysical riddle or joke than a true paradox that needs to be resolved, much like Xeno's paradox. It is offered as support for big bang, so it needs to be balanced with criticism in the weaknesses and criticisms section. - <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> 03:02, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another piece of evidence cited by proponents of the big bang theory is <a href="../../../o/l/b/Olber%27s_paradox.html" title="Olber's paradox">Olber's paradox</a>. This paradox is summed up by the question, "Why is the night sky black?". If the Universe is infinitely vast, any line extending outward from the Earth should eventually intersect a blue giant star, so the sky should be a speckled blue-white. The Big Bang theory resolves this paradox by supposing that the more distant stars are redshifted into invisibility. There are also other proposed solutions; see [3] (<a href="http://home.wanadoo.nl/ronald.koster/olber.pdf" class="external free" title="http://home.wanadoo.nl/ronald.koster/olber.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://home.wanadoo.nl/ronald.koster/olber.pdf</a>) for one example.

<dd>Plautus satire, I do not understand the significance of your argument. I suppose you've read some popular astronomy/cosmology litterature? There, as you might recall, is very often given an example: paint a number of dots on a balloon, inflate it, and it is very clealry visible that all distances increases. Also, from every point inside this surface (*not* inside the balloon, but in the 2-dimensional surface constituting the border (i.e. the 'rubber')) it would seem isotropic. Now if you instead imagine the 3-dimensional sphere, you can do the same comparison - and get an analogous result.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, I should say here that I don't know anything about you besides what I've read on this talk page, so you might think this example to be trivial. Then I cannot do anythin but encourage you to work out the maths yourself, about how the distances on <i>S</i> <sup>3</sup>(<i>t</i>) will change when <i>t</i> increses, maybe trying some random experiments with assigning dots randomly on <i>S</i> <sup>3</sup> together with an "earth" and then examining the different directions from this "earth" - calculating the number of dots less than a certain distance from it, and choosing a number of different positions of "earth" in <i>S</i> <sup>3</sup>. If you don't see already that this will in fact give an isotropy for every position of "earth" by pure symmetry reasons, try it!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is of course the possibility that the universe is best described as the interior of a ball, and hence has a 'border'. Your argument, or so it seems to me, does nothing but proves that <i>if</i> the universe is (basically) the interior of a ball, <i>then</i> there is only one point of isotropy. However, what if the universe is rather a <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_manifold.html" title="Closed manifold">closed manifold</a> (of approximately constant <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curvature.html" title="Curvature">curvature</a>)? For all that I know, it could be a sphere. Maybe there are reasons why not - I don't know of them. But to prove it impossible, you need other arguments than you have given here.</dd>

The entry as it stands makes both claims, that it is an actual explosion (in its latest incarnation it seems to suggest that hypothetical, hitherto unobserved strange primordial matter and energy is responsible, not really an explosion but something that acts identical to an explosion but is explained using newly-coined words) and that it is simply an explosive genesis or creation of some combination of space, time, matter and energy. - <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> 05:04, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a request to make here, in the cosmic background radiation subsection of the supporting evidence section of the big bang entry it states that "it says that as the universe was extremely hot at one point, it should still be a little bit warm even today, and calculations predicted a residual temperature of about 3 Kelvin". Does anybody know where I can verify how these calculations were made? Unless I'm mistaken, these calculations begin with the assumption that big bang occurred, and they also assume that redshift=distance=velocity=age and that the limits of human observation defined the limits of the universe. None of these assumptions is supported by any evidence except evidence resting only in the light of the big bang hypotheses, and these hypotheses are getting more complex and convoluted and more filled with exception than rule every month is seems. This is typical of big bang cosmologers, who often cite circular arguments as "proof" of their claims about big bang. - <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> 03:22, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Abundance of primordial elements</span></h3>
<p>Critics of big bang point to the claim that there is an abundance of primordial elements in the universe as further circular logic behind big bang. It is assumed by big bang proponents that only big bang could produce deuterium, so any deuterium in a big bang universe must be a result of the big bang, and since deuterium is believed to be rapidly consumed by stars, the age of a big bang universe therefore is finite. Critics note that if big bang did not occur, then there is another way for deuterium to be created. Critics also remark that no evidence has yet surfaced that suggests the universe is being depleted of deuterium. Assumed abundance of deuterium neither verifies nor falsifies big bang hypotheses.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Citations. There have been dozens of attempts to try to generate deuterium, but no one has succeeded. The basic problem is that any situation in which you can generate deuterium quickly becomes hot enough to convert it into helium.
<dl>
<dd>Do you understand what a circular argument is? If the initial premise (big bang) is false, the argument (deuterium could only be created in big bang) has no merit and the conclusion (big bang universe is of finite age, proven by "lack" of big bang, which is proven by assumption that big bang occured and was and is the only possible source of deuterium) is specious. The actual "lack" of deuterium, now, is dependent on the assumption that big bang did occur and is the only process in the universe capable of creating more. The universe is an awfully big place, and electromagnetic energy often does very surprising things, like fusion of deuterium.
<dl>
<dd><i>That's</i> a pretty good example of a circular argument; you are claiming that, since the big bang is wrong, there must be some other source of deuterium, and are then using this argument to refute the big bang. In reality, the original argument has the form P-&gt;Q (The big bang is the only source of deuterium), R (deuterium exists), S &amp; -P -&gt; -R (deuterium is consumed by stars), and S (stars exist). Q (the big bang occured) is a valid conclusion, and there is no circular reasoning. Of course, the truth of the premise P-&gt;Q might be questioned, but to impress a scientist you would need to provide an alternate source of deuterium, not just note that one <i>might</i> exist. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_Standeven_9e0a.html" title="User:Ben Standeven">Ben Standeven</a> 05:38, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, but Alfven did explicitly hint that he was basically saving his own butt by allowing his model to account for expansion. As I stated last year, had he been alive and aware of the recent developments concerning redshifts in plasma, he might have changed his theory. Alfven also never agreed that it was a big bang, but that the apparent expansion might be a local expansion due to a release of energy in a double-layer instability.

<ol>
<li>Deuterium will only exist if the big bang theory is true.</li>
<li>Deuterium exists.</li>
<li>Therefore, the big bang theory is true.</li>

<p>Now, the assumpution that "deuterium will only exist if the big bang theory is true" is open to debate, and may be false, but the logic is sound, and in no way circular. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a> 03:32, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>If Big Bang is true, deuterium exists.</li>
<li>Therefore, deuterium exists.</li>
<li>If deuterium exists, Big Bang is true.</li>

<p>Strangely, your argument with yourself is almost as compelling as my persuasive number below:</p>
<p>Interpretation of a <i>perceived</i> lack of deuterium as being evidence for big bang relies on two assumptions. One assumption is that big bang would be the only process capable of creating deuterium. You state this above as "deuterium will only exist if big bang is true". Another assumption is made about the total matter in the universe, which is assumed to be finite as per big bang. This finite size is used to determine amounts of deuterium "expected" from big bang as the only genesis of deuterium. This assumed finite size is determined by calculating the size of the presently observable universe (which is expanding all the time, not by magic, but by the use of better telescopes). The only evidence offered to support the claim that big bang would be the only process capable of creating deuterium is the fact that we can not presently create deuterium. No evidence is offered to support the assumption that the amount of matter in the universe is finite, and all indications are that the total amount of matter in the universe is infinite. We haven't yet seen the "edge" of the universe. The farther we look the more we discover that the universe is pretty much the same all over. A homogenous universe is not consistent with big bang, which predict the farther away you observe, the more different and strange the universe should become. What we find from observation is that the more we look the more we find the universe is bland and predictable. Just not predictable by failing hypotheses like big bang and black hole, to say nothing of the riotous unobservable dark matter and dark energy. - <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> 03:43, 20 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You don't understand the argument. It's a weak argument, but its not circular. It's not *assumed* a priori that only deuterium can be created in the big bang. The possibility that deuterium was created only in the big bang comes from the fact that people have tried very, very hard to come up with ways of creating deuterium, but have failed. (In the process of trying to create deuterium, they have manageed to create Li-6 and a whole other bunch of elements through cosmic ray spallation.) The argument is that since people have made a good faith effort to come up with deuterium production methods and consistently failed, that this is evidence that there are no such mechanisms.</dd>

<p>William C. Mitchell has expressed many of these ideas, summed in 2 books which are still available. Concerning geocentric, Y.P. Varshni gave an interpretation (although I dont recall that it had to do with isotropy, rather it had to do with the quantized redshift observations.) I am in agreement that an appeal to authority on these matters is hardly necessary. There is no authority on problems with the Big Bang that any BB proponent would recognize as valid anyhow. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 19:30, Feb 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The following statement is in the big bang entry: "<i>Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the general CMBR predictions (correcting the inaccuracy of previous predicted values), and pitched the balance of opinion in favour of the Big Bang hypothesis.</i>" Clearly this passage states that "their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the general CMBR predictions".

<dl>
<dd>And Varshni and many others have shown that big bang predicts only slightly worse (15% of the time) and with much more confidence using arbitrary nonsense data as it does actual observations. In other words, if you feed big bang random garbage data, it makes the same predictions (due to now-incalculable numbers of fudge factors) and conclusions based on garbage nonsense data as it does of the observable universe. This proves that big bang has become so complex and ad hoc that any arbitrary data put into it (even nonsense) produces the same "solution". No scientifically valid model that has any predictive capability at all makes identical predictions based on good or garbage data. The defense rests. - <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> 17:17, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>ATTENTION:</b> I wish to completely remove the following paragraph from the article, because the evidence against this view was removed from the article by others here. "Galactic evolution and quasar distribution One observation that has become increasing apparent since the early 1970s is that while the universe appears to be isotropic in space (i.e. the universe in one direction looks very much like the universe in another direction) is is not isotropic in distance. As one looks to increasingly large distances, the universe looks very different. For example, there are no nearby quasars, many quasars once you pass a given redshift, and then the quasars disappear at a further distance. Similarly, the types and distribution of galaxies appears to change markedly over time and once one passes a given distance, the number of galaxies fall off considerably."</p>
<p><b>Why can the article get away with flat out claiming that quasars are distant, when it has been shown that evidence against this view has existed since their initial discovery (early 1960s)? Why does the article omit this view, yet still claim that quasars are distant AND THEN use the claim as evidence in support of BB?</b> If you want NPOV, then you must either re-introduce properly the view that quasars are not distant (as most vividly expounded by Arp), or simply remove from the article the view that quasars are distant and hence "evidence" for BB.

<dd>I'm afraid I'm new to the Cosmology areas of the Wikipedia, and I'm not familiar with Arp's work (though I have had a quick look at his website and some others about his work). I'm curious to know how his nearby-quasars hypothesis accounts for the distribution of quasars in redshift (lots with z &gt; 2ish, but not many with z&gt;7 or so, though the UKIDSS survey expects to find ~10 of those), which is the observational fact at the heart of the paragraph you're objecting to (you can challenge the interpretation of redshift as equal to distance, but not the number of quasars observed to have a given redshift, surely?). It strikes me that the best way to resolve this would be for someone familiar with his work to write a page about it (either at <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halton_Arp_59b1.html" title="Halton Arp">Halton Arp</a> or variable-mass hypothesis or some similar title), and then when we discuss things like this we can present the observational facts (the paragraph above could be recast solely in terms of redshifts re: the observations if desired), and say that while other interpretations are possible (and give a link to that article) the mainstream scientific thinking is ... and then the interpretation in the context of the Big Bang theory (and since this is an article about the Big Bang theory that seems fair). (And is Arp really claiming, as my small amount of reading suggests, that the mass of the proton and electron change as cosmological objects evolve?) -- <a href="../../../b/t/h/User%7EBth_f25f.html" title="User:Bth">Bth</a> 20:16, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)~</dd>

<dd>You are correct, the number of quasars 'observed to have a given redshift,' is not under scrutiny, as counting them is an empirical observation which is largely independent of conceptual bias. What is more specifically objected to is that quasar redshift is strictly a Doppler effect (not to mention our friends the 'superluminal jets'.) This objection arises from a variety of causes. But in our specific case of quasars, the objection from Arp is based most on empirical observations of high-redshift objects tied directly to low-redshift objects via low surface-brightness filaments. Numerous examples of this observation exist. Arp has clearly indicated the existence of these groupings as close as the local Virgo cluster. In order to make the point that this observation contradicts the standard interpretation of quasars, and that in turn the standard interpretation should not be used as evidence for the big bang, it is not entirely necessary to go into the physics behind the observed quasar groupings, or how Arps model predicts the distribution of quasars. What is generally discounted is that the observations are even correct. This is not the first request for good information on Arp's ideas. Had I the time to re-read his work and to write a coherent and factual page on it, I would (maybe this summer?) But for now please read his books. Quasar groupings indeed take on a different light if you consider Arp's observations to be correct. Based on observed groupings, it is predicted that quasars start with very high-redshift when they are first ejected from the core of AGN (ie when they are at close proximity,) and that schematically the redshift of ejected quasar are inversely proportional to the distance away from the core. Periodicities are seen as well. We could predict the distribution of quasars around their host galaxies, and if an impartial observer where to take these assocations and look for more, they would most likely see them. Arp has been coming up with them for 40 years now. Last year(2003) he published a new "Catalog of Discordant Redshifts". Keep in mind that the variable mass theory is secondary to the actual observations however. Yes the basis of that theory is that new matter has lower mass and a correspondingly lower redshift. But please nobody confuse the theory with the data itself. I might write more after thinking more, and try to answer your question more specifically. -<a href="../../../i/o/n/User%7EIonized_5399.html" title="User:Ionized">Ionized</a> 23:59, Mar 2, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, don't have time to reply fully now (nor to read Arp's books, I'm afraid) but I'm curious: what's the problem with superluminal jets? These are a simple consequence of projection effects when close-to-lightspeed motion is close to the line-of-sight, and can be easily derived using basic relativity (and you only need special relativity).
