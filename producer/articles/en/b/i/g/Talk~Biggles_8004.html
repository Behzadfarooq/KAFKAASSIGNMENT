<p>I have a moth eared copy of Biggles in Africa (I think thats the title) where he refers to one of the natives as a 'N****R' so I dont think we can be so sure of the lack of Racism in Johns work. Saying that Im sure the text was no more racist than the average white anglo saxon at that point in time. Thats still no excuse mind. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam777_d9a0.html" title="User:Adam777">Adam777</a> 23:30, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, but to play the devil's advocate . . can it really be described as racism when (perjorative or not) this word was the normal one used by white people to refer to black people? To my way of thinking, intent is key here. If the intent is to stigmatise, then it's racism. If the intent is other, then the person may be being insensitive, but isn't necessarily being racist.

<p>A great article, but from my reading of the biggles books, his career seems to mirror the actions of one Albert Ball! Cyril Lowe may have been a good pilot but it was ball who challenged a german to a duel, it was also Ball who pretended to be hit and landed behind enemy lines when outnumbered only to take off again when his pursuers had broken combat. There are also a number of other stories from other pilots... as a matter of fact I don't think that one of the exploits of cyril has been reproduced yet dozens from other pilots have been...</p>
<p>As proof I quote from <i>They fought for the sky</i> by Quenton reynolds (1956 I think...) "One Afternoon Ball encountered two Albatrosses over the lines. He opened the attack, gave each machine minor wounds, and both headed for the safety of their home base. Ball followed and then ran out of ammunition. He took out his revolver and pursued them, but they managed to land safely. Ball, enraged and disgusted that any fighting airman would act in what he felt to be a craven manner, wrote a note on the pad all pilots carried strapped to the right thigh, weighted it and dropped it over the airfield. He said he would be over the base the next day at the same time, and he challenged his two late opponents to come up and resolve the battle.</p>
<p>Ball arrived promptly the next day and to his delight he found the two aircraft circling slowly. He flew straight towards the nearest one, intending to rely on the near-collision manoeuvre which had stood him in such good stead, but before he could close in he heard machine gun bullets whistling all around him and he knew that he had flown into a trap. He zoomed upwards and to the left, and now he saw that there were three uninvited guests at the joust. It was five against one now. He tried hard to get close enough to pick off one or two, but the Germans were wiley fliers; they swerved away, merely waiting for the chance to close in and finish him off. Ball chased them furiously, firing at longer range than he liked, but he always had to break off his run as one or two of the others manaeuvred above and behind him. Then he ran out of ammunition. Theoretically, he should not have remained alive for more than a minute. If he lit out on his ownterritory, he would be as vulnerable as a sitting duck for always three of the five stayed between him and allied territory. Then he improvised perhaps the most unorthodox and apparently suicidal manoeuvre ever attempted by a cornered airman. He put his plane in a crazy spin. The Germans, of course, were sure that he had been hit. Ball had observed a large open field below; he brought his neuport out of the spin and fluttered towards the ground. He landed. The Germans knew this was Albert Ball; Taking him prisoner would be an even greater triumph than killing him. Two of the german aircraft swooped down to land on the field; the other three flew over it, wagging their wings in derisive triumph, and then went to a nearby airfield to spread the story. Ball was slumped over the seat of his little neuport but his engine was still idling. The German pilots hopped out of their respective machinesand ran towards the neuport and its presumably wounded pilot. As they aproached Ball opened his throttle, pulled back his control stick and the little airoplane shot down the field, rose in the air and Ball headed for home without having recieved a scratch."</p>
<p>Maybe you should revise just a little. 220.101.103.200 04:12, 26 March 2007 (UTC)p-hughes</p>
<p>You make a good point, p-hughes. But can you trust someone with such a strange last name?&#160;:)Johno 13:51, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Are you kidding Johno... the guy in the book is called BIGGLESWORTH!</p>

<p>Thought I should just add that the "head on" tactic of Albert Ball is also described here. Another proof that Ball is more of the model used for the character.220.101.103.200 05:14, 28 March 2007 (UTC)P-hughes</p>
