<p>Something happened to me last Thursday when I was going home. I had a couple of miles to go when I looked up and saw a glowing orange object in the sky to the East. It was moving very irregularly, suddenly there was intense light all around me and when I came to I was home. What do you think happened to me?</p>
<p>...Infiltrate... ...the enemy fortress... ...Outer Heaven... ...Destroy... ...the final weapon... ...Metal Gear...</p>
<p>Actually there is something I have been meaning to tell you but I just couldn't. I think you should know though. On Saturday morning last week I saw a guy leaving Rosemary's room. How should I put it, it was like they were intimate. I'm sorry, sorry to bring this up during the mission, but...</p>
<p>President Baker should be somewhere to the South of where you blasted through the wall. Hurry and save him before the terrorists discover his code.</p>
<p>Snake, remember what De Gaulle said" The graveyards are full of indispensable men." Snake, you're all alone and surrounded by bad guys. Try to be careful and avoid getting into a fight whenever you can.</p>
<p>You seem to get a real thrill out of slaughtering the enemy. Are you frustrated about something?</p>
<p>You wouldn't be trying to give yourself a bogus score using some ingenious trick would you? That's about as low as anyone could possibly stoop! I can't believe you sometimes!</p>
<p>Your mission is to infiltrate the fortress Galuade, rescue the hostages and neutralize Metal Gear before its assembly is complete.</p>
<p>Variety Level 13-Rescue Meryl," The Return of Genola".</p>
<p>Even my patience has its limits. I just can't leave this thing up to you any longer. I'll do the fighting! You can just go home!</p>
<p>An Anemone or Clematis Plant's juice can cause a rash. When Pruning them it's a good idea to wear gloves.</p>
<p>I hear it's amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in flapp-jaw space with the tuning fork does a raw blink on Hiri-kiri Rock! I need scissors! 61!</p>
<p>I was a North American Fall Webworm in my past life. Those were the good old days. What were you in your former life.</p>
<p>You got a PSG-1? You can use that against Sniper Wolf. Hurry up and save Meryl.</p>
<p>Actually I am in really bad shape financially. I pay money to my ex-wife as part of our divorce settlement, among other bills, I just had no choice but to have you pay for lunch the other day. I'm really sorry.</p>
<p>Honestly though you have played the game for a long time. Don't you have anything else to do with your time.</p>
<p>Variety Level 7-Shoot down the space invaders! Training will have to be postponed if we are invaded by UFO's.</p>
<p>Snake, there is a fork in the conveyor belt. The machine is automatically sorting cargo according to some system. Take a good look at the device.</p>
<p>Big Boss here, enter the track on the bridge to the right. Over.</p>
<p>Weapon Mode-Socom-Level 1-Destroy all the targets to reach the goal. Number of targets 3.</p>
<p>Snake, like Shakespear said " Noughts had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content." Basically what it means is that your desire can get you into a lot of trouble if you're not careful. That goes for items too. Don't get too greedy or you might be sorry. Be careful Snake.</p>
<p>I say again. Your duty is to infiltrate Zanzibar Land. And seize Kio Marf, an abducted Czechoslovakian biologist.</p>
<p>Zz...zzz.</p>
<p>Snake, they've input both detonation codes. The only way to stop the launch now is to use the card key to re-input the codes.</p>
<p>That reminds me, I saw Gubayama in Shibomnigee. He said to give you his best.</p>
<p>Snake, take the power plant out. Set C4 explosives on four key points to destroy the structure. Snake, destroy the power plant's main turbine. It's located on B1 floor of the plant. Break into the B1 floor.</p>
<p>Munch, munch...Um? Raiden? I'm eating right now. Get back to me later...munch...munch....</p>
<p>La-li-lu-le-lo! La-li-lu-le-lo! La-li-lu-le-lo!</p>
<p>I'm not home right now please leave a message after the beep. BEEP</p>
<p>Mind the gap.</p>
<p>I can't believe it -- that someone who has committed all of those twisted acts in the women's bathroom would make it this far... this is the end of the world.</p>
