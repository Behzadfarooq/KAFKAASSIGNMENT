<p>I disagree. The only sections written for any sport are under the heading "rivalries," for which I think, only football should be listed. The Big Ten has long been known for its intense football rivalries, but men's basketball has been tepid at best (I'm talking about rivalries, not level of play). I think the men's basketball section should be removed, if anything. While I agree that women's basketball is an important sport for the conference, the overall repuation of play and fan interest simply doesn't support a section for that moreso than any other sport. The Big Ten is by no means known for its women's basketball, ranking typically between the 6th and 8th best conference in the country. I'd suggest instead a list of the national championships and other national accolades won by memebers of the conference across all sports.</p>

<p>Listing Penn State's enrollment as 82K is misleading and not consistent with how the other institutions are listed. This incorporates all the affiliated campuses, evn those with distinct names (Dickenson, Penn Tech, Hershey, etc.) and probably distinct sports teams and conference affiliations. This is not done for any of the other Big-10 schools (many of which would get larger if it were done), and smells of one-upsmanship. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_largest_US_universities_by_enrollment_9cf4.html" title="List of largest US universities by enrollment">List_of_largest_US_universities_by_enrollment</a> page doesn't do this either, so there is precedent and consistency to maintain. It is probably correct as well, given this is the Big 10 page: only the University Park campus is affiliated with the Big 10 athletic conference. Nestify 15:01, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Comparing the two only this "At the 1895 meeting, a blueprint for the control and administration of college athletics under the direction of appointed faculty representatives was outlined. The presidents' first-known action "restricted eligibility for athletics to bona fide, full-time students who were not delinquent in their studies." This helped limit some problems of the times, especially the participation of professional athletes and "non-students" in the universities' regular sporting events. "</p>
<p>seems to be cut and paste and perhaps part of the first para should not be to difficult to fix it give it a shot <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmith03_8e63.html" title="User:Smith03">Smith03</a> 03:19, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
