<p>If you are interested I have posted a plan for improving the Tenchi Muyo series pages in general in the ToDo Box and tasks section in the Tenchi Muyo! discussion page created by created by Crampy20, as it is a good way of improving all the Tenchi Muyo pages. --<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A few updates I should tell you about is that I am starting on working on the character section for the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenchi_Muyo%21_%28OVA%29_d63d.html" title="Tenchi Muyo! (OVA)">Tenchi Muyo! (OVA)</a> page. Also for the <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kari_Wahlgren_3fb1.html" title="Kari Wahlgren">Kari Wahlgren</a> page, since it hasn't been confirmed that she has officially been confirmed that she has reprised her roles of Mitoto Kuramitsu or Minaho Masaki for OVA 3 yet since those dubbed episodes haven't been released on Dvd yet. But I am planning to update the Kari Wahlgren page once I obtain the Dvd volume and confirm that she has reprised that role. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 05:09, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Did you know that Mashisu Kuramitsu is actually Mashisu Makibi. I have already moved the voice actor information of to the Tenchi Muyo Ova page. One other thing that you should know is that my original plan for handling OVA page and GXP page is that for characters that appear in both series I have decided their information should be placed on that page based on which series has the stronger presence for that character. Since Misao and Mashisu both have a stronger presense in the OVA series than they did in GXP then their pages are to be placed on the OVA page, just like how Minaho Masaki has a stronger presence in the GXP series. I am willing to make an exception for Seiryo Tennan. Also Tenchi's classmate Amagasaki is also an exception since Tenchi in Tokyo is a completely different continuity. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 21:14, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One last thing was that I originally was having problems figuring out what to do with the information on Seiryo's original English voice actor, but I can see that your way would work better which is also why I will support your decsion for a seperate bio.</li>

<p>I noticed your submission on Papacha's main page and not only should messages like that be submitted on a Users talk page but if you press this key symbol ~ four times on your keyboard (by pressing the button under the Esc button and holding down the shift button) it will automatically display the signature of the User who submitted it when you save. The Signature that would see are your User Info, Time, and Date Info such as I am going to do at the end of this message. <a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 03:56, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just so you know the talk page is also the discussion page. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 04:35, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>When you go for my User Page aim for the discussion link on top and at the end of your next message press ~ four times which is done by holding down shift and pressing the button between the 1 and ESC and Tab buttons <a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 04:39, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The instuctions are also on your Welcome post on your talk page just look at the second editing tip I mean that is how I learned it.</p>
<p>Yeah you just pulled it off and have just remember to that this button is the result of pressing this button ` by holding the shift button down to make ~ and that button is between the <b>1</b>, <b>ESC</b>, and <b>TAB</b> buttons. It will take practice but I am sure you can get used to it in due time. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 04:49, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a reason why the current formating for character listings was adopted by <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EAnime_a66c.html" title="WP:Anime">WP:Anime</a>.

<dd>You do know that you are wasting your time by bolding terms that are already made bold by other wiki syntax, in this case anything with a <b>;</b> preceding it. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 13:06, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>There are other ways of making text stand of turning them into section headings. One way is to surround the character's name with the <b><big>&lt;big&gt;</big></b> tag.

<p>I noticed when I was performing the proceedure on the Pretty Sammy pages that enlarging the letters <b>automatically</b> makes them bold and I also noticed that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a> also removed the bold symbols as well when the other Tenchi Muyo articles were corrected as well. I noticed that even if those symbols were still placed in then it won't do anything. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 04:16, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just found it it was this symbol&#160;; which is placed next to the to the name which is the reason why the name would go bold without the ' mark. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 04:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mia Bradly (who's name is usually credited as "Bradly" and not "Bradley", I think...) is definitely not another name of Sandy Fox.

<p>Can you provide a citation for your edit that stes the Tri-cities Fever logo has reverted to the original? Their website has not made mention of the change, they have not issued any press releases and I have been unable to find any evidence anywhere else on the Internet. If you cannot provide a citation, your edit needs to be reverted. <a href="../../../n/o/l/User%7ENolesrule_0a51.html" title="User:Nolesrule">Nolesrule</a> 05:15, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I didn't see anything on kndu.com about the logo change. And next time, please make the comment on my talk page, not my user page. thanks.</li>
<li>Do not change the Tri-Cities page until you can provide a source for the change. None of the media in your are area are reporting this change, and the team has not confirmed it on their website or in any communications, official or otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ran into a problem. I decided to check the local sites (including <a href="http://www.kndu.com" class="external free" title="http://www.kndu.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.kndu.com</a> and <a href="http://www.tri-cityherald.com" class="external free" title="http://www.tri-cityherald.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tri-cityherald.com</a>. You were right about no mention about the uniform change, but I DID see the KNDU newscast on 1/05/07 and they did say that the Fever were returning to their old colors and logo because of negative feedback (I do live where the Fever play. I guess that the new colors and helmet may end up on eBay soon). But it's nice to know that you're such a fan of arena football. I have yet to see a Fever game live in the Toyota Center but I am proud of the team, especially when they won the NIFL championship in their first season (I guess that the Spokane Shock decided to do the same in af2 last summer).

<p>Hey, when it is officially announced by the team, feel free to make the change. Until then, it's just a rumor, and should be treated as such.</p>

<p>I took care of your problem but I do have to say as advice is if you are working on a wikilink or a picture then I suggest that you use the show preview option since I am usually careful with handling that stuff rather than to risk accidently saving it. Also keep up the good work and if you can take care of the Pretty Sammy stuff if you can since it is no different than working on the rest of the series pages with that kind of adjustment. If not then I'll handle it myself. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 00:48, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
