<p>In lieu of spamming eveyone's talk page with a message of thanks, I would like to place this message here for everyone who participated in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_BigDT_2_c571.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/BigDT 2">my RFA</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you. The tremendous show of support was humbling and heart-warming. This week has been an interesting one. I will strive to earn the trust that the community has placed in me.</p>
<p>I am placing myself in <a href="../../../a/d/m/Category%7EAdministrators_open_to_recall_309a.html" title="Category:Administrators open to recall">Category:Administrators open to recall</a>. That means that if you feel I am ever using the administrative tools incorrectly, I want to hear about it, no matter how minor the concern is.</p>
<p>I will, as some have suggested I should, make sure that I spend more time on writing and on developing an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Thank you all for participating in this process. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:35, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing me in the direction of that. The list does seem adequate to deal with the present problem. Noting your concerns 9and those on the page) about the size of the list, some of the image there have been deleted and can be removed (as they could be uploaded under any name there seems little point in blocking the old titles). The page is edit protected so would you care to use your shiny new tools? The following pictures have been deleted:</p>

<p>BigDT, I'm not following what you've done to my request to have the chart in the subject line removed on the grounds of being <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Are you saying that my request was not somehow procedurally correct? I did notify its creator, <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookish_a5ec.html" title="User:Bookish">User:Bookish</a>, of this chart's violation of the Wikipedia Original Research policy and gave more than the required notice. What else is needed? --Ubarfay 09:20, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The reason I relisted the discussion is that the image was not tagged with {{<a href="../../../i/f/d/Template%7EIfdc_0b4f.html" title="Template:Ifdc">ifdc</a>}} in the five places that it was used. (I have fixed everything - it is now tagged correctly.) The creator hasn't edited since June ... so just notifying him/her doesn't mean that anyone would actually see the message ... but by tagging the articles where the image is used, anyone who is interested can come and participate. I hope that helps. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 12:42, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for the comments on RFA. Actually I agree with them so much I wonder about withdrawing. THe only consolation I can offer is (1) someone very recently pointed out about edit summaries, in particular that I could set preferences to self remind which I do now (2) Yep, until a few days ago I haven't really hung around recent changes, so the vandalism I have picked up through watch is mainly subtle enough to have got through the RCP and apart from occasion ones (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:C-Dew&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101362856" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:C-Dew&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=101362856" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I don't put remarks on vandals pages which I agree I should... although three of the recent cases was repeated vandalism from roving IPs so there didn't seem much point (3) speedy delete versus AfD I have mixed feelings about. I got pretty cross when the servers had a very slow day and someone kept speedy deleting an article I was starting here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Way_the_World_is&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Way_the_World_is&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and I am inclined to the view that new articles are so invisible anyway we should give them more of a chance. Perhaps if I hung around Recent Changes more I would have a better idea of the scale of the real problem: but I generally move slower. Anyway, your thoughtfulness is appreciated (you are actually the only oppose who has put in critical time) and as I said it ain't going to change anyone's world if I am not elected. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 19:41, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your reply. You are obviously a very good contributor and with a little more experience, I think you will be ready. I really despise numerical cutoffs (ie, you must have 4000 edits, at least 20% of which are talk and 20% of which are Wikipedia space). But I think that demonstrated positive experience in administrative areas is definitely a good thing. If you keep at it, I will definitely support next time. Good luck! --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:04, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello - there were a bunch of images not deleted (see <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2007_January_14_4292.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2007 January 14">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2007 January 14</a>) and I noted that you said they were to be kept.

May I take off the dispute tags on Lenna or is that something you should do? Thanks - <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EPAR_bf60.html" title="User:PAR">PAR</a> 20:32, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for pointing it out. I have removed the tags and left a note on the talk page referencing the discussion.

<p>Hi BigDT</p>
<p>I'm not sure you've noticed it, but the flag of Lebanon that you've listed for deletion is not identical to the proposed replacement. The images with a border are used in regards to the "flagicon" feature where it is a lot easier to use an image that already features a border, rather than having to add the border manually where most users will forget to resize the affected flags to give the finished result the same proportions. The image is only intended for use regarding the "flagicon" feature, and using such flags can create nicer lists, see e.g. <a href="../../../o/d/e/Odense_Municipality_beaf.html#Twin_cities_and_towns" title="Odense Municipality">Odense_Municipality#Twin_cities_and_towns</a> where the countries with a flag mostly consisting of white are all represented by a pre-bordered version of the flag. Such material is also very useful when it comes to material regarding the Olympics. We have a consistent system now, so I'd hate to see it go.

<dd>Thanks. Either somebody missed this one or it must be because Ligulem protected the relevant template. I'm glad almost all of this work was completed some time before he suddenly protected the entire template series. Updating to the bordered image looks like a good idea here due to the prominent white stripe, and you can do it by updating {{Country flag alias Lebanon}} to <code>Flag of Lebanon (bordered).svg</code></dd>
<dd>The relevant IOC template was unprotected so I've updated that one.

<dd>Thanks. Yes, that was his motivation. The template is {{Country flag alias Lebanon}}. Simply replace "Flag of Lebanon.svg" with "Flag of Lebanon (bordered).svg" (without the quotation marks).

<p>&lt;- The line of text looks fine, but Ligulem has not added a no-include section to the other images. I'm not sure if he had a reason for this. Anyway, the image looks fine in the tables.

<dd>You're welcome. As for the noinclude section, usually {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtected_template_c3cf.html" title="Template:Protected template">Protected template</a>}} is added to high-risk protected templates.

<p>Hi BigDT -</p>
<p>O.K. - it is time, after trying some time, to ask for help from experienced and trusted folks - I need to either REDIRECT or somehow cut the article in at least two parts - it will "hang together" if I can "splice" the entire section of "Exegetical Considerations" along with graphics (as is) on to another page as suggested - it's still a bit too long on both but this would make it 43/43 or so - so, how do I do that? Also, I probably should simply add a "See Also" to reference back and forth on the two articles because of their interconnectivity - is that a simple [[]] situation? Any help will of course be greatly appreciated.

<dd>Well, certainly splitting it is one option. But I think what would be a better idea is to do some cleanup on the one article that is there. For example, close to half of the article is in the see also, further reading, and external links section. Some of that can probably be trimmed down ... like the see also section. The various links to RCC, SDA, Mormon, JW, etc eschatology don't really need to be there - those articles aren't directly related to the two witnesses, but, rather, to <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">eschatology</a> in general. I probably won't get to it tonight, but sometime tomorrow or Monday night, I'll sit down and give it a good read to try and edit some of what's there. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:51, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For deletion did you mean ones like this ie orphans, which are the most numerous that I've seen on the untagged area. Just an image with no links to it. I think this is the case where this user created a page, but it wasn't notable enough to warrant a page, so it was deleted, but the image is still around, so I should mark it for deletion then? I've never deleted an image. There is this page, but is there anything special to deletion? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:180px-Post-1-1141028020.png" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:180px-Post-1-1141028020.png" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:180px-Post-1-1141028020.png</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion#Listing_images_and_media_for_deletion" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion#Listing_images_and_media_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion#Listing_images_and_media_for_deletion</a> --Kolrobie 22:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure I understand your question. Yes, an "orphan" is an image that has no "file links" down at the bottom. If an image has no source or no license, there is no need in nominating it at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion</a>, but if it does not qualify for "automatic" deletion, then yes, <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> is the place to go. Does that answer your question or is there more? --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:52, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I guess so. I'll think I stick to just to the methods outlined in the untagged image faq <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Untagged_images#List_of_untagged_images" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Untagged_images#List_of_untagged_images" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Untagged_images#List_of_untagged_images</a>.

<dd>Ok ... one other thing that may be helpful to check out is <a href="../../../l/i/n/Help%7ELink_69e5.html" title="Help:Link">Help:Link</a>. This page talks about making internal links. If you use [[name of page here]], then it looks a little bit easier to read than the full URL.

<p>Thank you for your support in my recent RfA. I think valid criticisms were raised in areas that I need to work on, so I've withdrawn my name. I intend to work on addressing the concerns that were raised, and think I need to work contributing without allowing myself to become as stressed as I have been at times, which did result in some inappropriate behavior. Perhaps I may re-explore adminship at some point in the future, but it's a little early to consider that.

<p>Thanks for the para-legal help with my uploaded award image to DESA today.</p>
<p>Thought I'd bother you with a related question, if OK?</p>
<p>I forgot I was not logged in -- though I could and should have been -- and made a small edit to the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award page, also today. Because I was not logged in, the history has recorded my IP Address (which, at the time, I didn't even know it might do)...</p>
<p>I would definitely like to "remove" that IP, if possible? How...?</p>

<p>Now you will think I'm a true idiot (but actuallly just a new learner!)... I also made the mistake of using my "real world" name in the first attempt to place an image of the DESA medallion on Wikipedia -- that appears as the upload/edit of 05:41, 29 January 2007. I sent a .pdf version that I soon replaced with a "better", .jpg one (which you have already helped with!)... Can this personal name be removed from general viewing, also? Thanks a million!

<dd>I have deleted that PDF so it won't show up in your contributions or on the page itself.
