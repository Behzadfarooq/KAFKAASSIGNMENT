<p>There are hidden messages in the new title sequence. Can anyone slow down the sequence to see what it says?

<dd>One step ahead of you! I have already checked the title sequence, and the "words" which seem to appear are all jumbled with the actual sequence, making a lot of the ineligble. I'm not even sure if a lot of them are actual words, they seem very random. The red "test card" is all part of it too. It just says: "This is the title sequence for Big Brother", and then some stuff about "by taking part in Big Brother you agree to abide by the rules, the rules may change at any time", as well as "NOT FOR TRANSMISSION" (?) and, curiously, "(C) Channel 4 MCMIII" ... 1903?? The titles are just random as far as I can tell, and are just meant to get people like you and me talking about them...&#160;;) <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomcage9_08d0.html" title="User:Tomcage9">Tomcage9</a> 22:18, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I slowed down the title sequence to last night's Big Brother's Big Mouth - there are four sets of scrambled words and the only complete words you see are YOU, ARE, BEING and OBSERVED in that order and one in each set - all the other words you see are incomplete.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nikki</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I know that 'Nikki' is actually a mole or fake contestant, placed by the producers into the house. She's an actress. I suppose I'm unable to cite my sources on this, given that there's secrecy involved. I suppose that because of this I can't place this information on the main page, which is frustrating. Is there any Wiki policy on citing sources for information that should be kept secret? Would it be ok to cite this information about Nikki here, on the discussion page, for posterity?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>No, I don't think you can as that info, if indeed true, cannot be verified at present. If and when it becomes apparent what you're saying is right, this would be added to the main article as it would then be in the public domain. -<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyW_ecc1.html" title="User:TonyW">TonyW</a> 23:46, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ok, fair enough. It should come out in about 2 weeks or so, with rumours appearing in a few days at least.</li>
<li>She does appear very false. Perhaps we could say in the article that her manner is apparently staged and there are rumours that she is an actress? --<a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBelteshezzar_e9c5.html" title="User:Belteshezzar">Belteshezzar</a> 23:19, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Would it not be better to place the Chronology after the list of housemates? The housemates are mentioned in the chronology but are only explained afterwards. Just makes more sense to me. And it would partially lessen the burden of such a long chronology section, if it's placed further down in the article where it's less immediately obvious.&#160;? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbara_Osgood_3922.html" title="User:Barbara Osgood">Barbara Osgood</a> 13:20, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
