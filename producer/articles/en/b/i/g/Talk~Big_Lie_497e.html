<p>perhaps the Saddam Hussein - al-Qaeda link that was claimed to exist?</p>
<p>Or how about the claim by liberals that Bush lied about WMDs as oppose to recieving bad intelligence. Al Franken and other left wing pundits repeat this hourly.</p>
<p>In my opinion, McCarthyism was a great example of the Big Lie technique. I don't know enough about it to add in a reference to it, but perhaps someone else does?<a href="../../../v/e/t/User%7EVetteDude_3819.html" title="User:VetteDude">VetteDude</a> 21:17, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>So where did Germany lose WWI? According to the WWI article Germany was forced by military means to sign an armistice.

<p>I have been searching for a while now, trying both English and German keywords, but I have not been able to find the quote that is attributed to Goebbels. While me not being able to find it is no proof in itself, I personally don't believe Goebbels actually said or wrote it in the form stated, or something resemblant, until I come across the original document containing said quote. <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerbrant_7d11.html" title="User:Gerbrant">Shinobu</a> 23:53, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it is false then the popular definition of "the big lie technique" is itself a pretty good example of big lie technique. But of course, no one could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.Jim Bowery 07:46, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article says <i>This technique, he believed, consisted of telling a lie so "colossal" that no one would believe anyone "could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously".</i> The journal <i>Skeptical Inquirer</i>, Vol 30, #2, 3/06, page 44 says<i>There is a theory in psychology called the "Big Lie" - if you tell a colossal lie often enough, people will tend to believe it's at least partly true.</i> Is this the same thing, or something different? <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 05:18, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think this article should be merged into <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolchstosslegende.html" title="Dolchstosslegende">Dolchstosslegende</a>. That article discusses a general theory, which did not originate with Hitler, whereas this article mainly describes a propaganda technique, of which that theory was a prominent part. If it were a really short article I could see it as a section within <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolchstosslegende.html" title="Dolchstosslegende">Dolchstosslegende</a> (something like <i>Use by Hitler as the "big lie"</i>), but it's too long for that, so I think ought to have a separate article, although perhaps <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolchstosslegende.html" title="Dolchstosslegende">Dolchstosslegende</a> should have a "see also" link pointing here. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 06:10, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alright wikipedians, this is... possibly... unprecedented in this topic. What? A more contemporary (though not completely) that ISN'T controversial! Can you believe it? Alright: I believe it was elaborated on more in the movie, but I do think the book has it down pretty well too: <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matilda.html" title="Matilda">Matilda</a> by Roald Dahl. In it, Ms. Trunchbull is said to "go the whole hog" and something along those lines; it is right after she hurls a girl through the window by the girl's pigtails. I don't have the book with me, unfortunately, so I can't quote it. But at any rate, if anyone can, I think this would be a less esoteric example of the Big Lie in practice.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Reading the article I catch that the Big Lie concept is somehow related to Hitler. However, is Hitler advocating Big Lies or is he saying that Jews use Big Lies. Without reading MeinKampf I would susprct the second interpretation - any German readers know the answer. The article should be clearer.159.105.80.141 15:44, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Also the Goebbel's lack of verification of a quote we have all come to know and love seems really historically important - particularly if a quote was made up ( by whom ).159.105.80.141 15:46, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Easy enough to find - MeinKampf ( wiki link ) Chapter 10. The quote is carefully excised in most sources to omit that Hitler was referencing Jewish forces. He wasn't advocating its use, just warning Germans, etc to beware of the Big Lie. I don't think this is probably a new concept with Hitler - he just used examples in his book. How does this rate a wiki article? 159.105.80.141 19:45, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Went back and read the opening sentence to the article - about Hitler developing the technique of the Big Lie - instead of saying Hitler developed the technique it would be more accurate to say he was exposing/warning about it.159.105.80.141 19:46, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The US pscychological profile - Goebbels - seems suspiciously close to what we now believe Goebbels said - a good paraphrase ( question was it a German to English or English to German paraphrase?159.105.80.141 19:51, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
