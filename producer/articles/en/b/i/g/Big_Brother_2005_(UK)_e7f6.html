<p><i><b>Big Brother 6</b></i> in 2005 was the sixth series of <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK%29_f3d9.html" title="Big Brother (UK)">Big Brother</a></b></i> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, a <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality_television.html" title="Reality television">reality television</a> show on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a>, in which a number of contestants live an isolated existence in a purpose-built house who try to avoid being evicted by public vote, with the aim of winning a large cash prize at the end of the run. This series lasted for 11 weeks, currently the second-longest that the series has run for. It was won by Anthony Hutton. The show surpassed <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_2003_%28UK%29_2048.html" title="Big Brother 2003 (UK)">Big Brother 4</a> and received the lowest viewer ratings of all the Big Brother series. The constestants had failed the most amount of house tasks of all the series and post eviction wise, none of them have managed to sustain a long term <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showbiz.html" title="Showbiz">showbiz</a> career, making it the least amount of contestants to do so in any series within a year after the show ended.</p>
<p>The sixth series began on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_27.html" title="May 27">27 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> and ended on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_12.html" title="August 12">12 August</a> of the same year. The broadcaster, Channel 4, made their previously subscription-only <a href="../../../e/4/_/E4_%28channel%29.html" title="E4 (channel)">E4</a> channel available on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeview.html" title="Freeview">Freeview</a> from the start of this series.</p>

<p>The <i>Secret Garden</i> was first used on Day 29, when Big Brother contestants <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_6%29_dd08.html#Kinga_Karolczak" title="Big Brother (UK series 6)">Kinga Karolczak</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_6%29_dd08.html#Orlaith_McAllister" title="Big Brother (UK series 6)">Orlaith McAllister</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_6%29_dd08.html#Eugene_Sully" title="Big Brother (UK series 6)">Eugene Sully</a> secretly entered the house, minutes after <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_6%29_dd08.html#Roberto_Conte" title="Big Brother (UK series 6)">Roberto Conte</a> was evicted. For several days, the three housemates had to live in the Secret Garden, with only <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_UK_series_6_8d5d.html#Makosi_Musambasi" title="Big Brother UK series 6">Makosi</a> knowing their existence.</p>
<p>The Secret Garden was decorated like a jungle, and the three secret housemates were initially only supplied with fig leaves to cover only the main essentials of their bodies. This created the idea of an <b>Adam and Eve</b> style jungle. With Makosi's help, they had to steal clothes and food from the main Big Brother House when the other housemates were asleep, and to make sure that the other housemates did not find out about them.</p>
<p>The secret housemates were forced to live in the garden for several days. At the end of their stay, Makosi had to choose two of the three secret housemates to enter the main house. She chose Orlaith and Eugene, although Kinga re-entered the house after Orlaith walked out on Day 65.</p>

<td>Big Brother played mind games with the housemates, informing them that during the week Big Brother would lie twice. Big Brother then told housemates that nominations that week were optional. This was Big Brother's first lie. All nominations are compulsory, so the housemates who did not nominate were put to the public vote as punishment. When the results of the nominations were announced Big Brother stated that Anthony, Craig and Kemal were up for eviction. This was Big Brother's second lie. In fact, these three were the only housemates to nominate, so it was everyone else who was subject to the public vote.</td>

<td><b>Exits</b></td>
<td>The housemates had to pick whom to evict out of the two people with the most votes. These turned out to be Makosi and Vanessa, with Makosi receiving the largest percentage of votes. All of the housemates with the exception of Kemal chose Vanessa to be the 7th person to leave, so on Day 50, Vanessa was evicted from the house.</td>

<td>About one hour after Craig was evicted, Big Brother called a housemate to the Diary Room and Eugene was first to respond. He sat down behind a suitcase containing £50,000 in cash - half the actual winner's prize money. Big Brother told him he had the option of winning this half of the prize, leaving the other half for the winner. Big Brother told the remaining housemates that if he turned down the money, the prize money would double to £200,000. Eugene was given one minute to make to his decision while he was watched on screen by the rest of the housemates. After about 50 seconds, Eugene had made his decision and chose to take the £50,000.</td>

<td>On Day 76, during dinner, Craig was evicted in a surprise mid-week eviction, for being the housemate to have received the least votes (only 4.1%) from the public to win Big Brother on Wednesday evening.
<p>On Day 78, the final, Kinga received the least number of public votes (3.8% of the four-way total) and came in 4th place. Makosi came third with 8.7% of the three-way vote. Eugene was next to leave, coming second with 42.7% of the final two-way vote. With 57.3% of the two-way vote, Anthony was the winner of Big Brother 2005.</p>

<cite id="fn_5"><a href="#fn_5_back" title="">Note 5</a>:</cite> Big Brother set the housemates a task, telling them Big Brother would lie to them twice. Big Brother told the housemates that the weeks nominations were optional. This was the first lie. Only Anthony, Craig and Kemal nominated, meaning that all others were up for the public vote. Big Brother then told the second lie by announcing that the housemates up for eviction were Anthony, Craig and Kemal, when in fact they were the only housemates <i>not</i> up. On eviction night, the housemates decided which of the two housemates with the most eviction votes would leave. Makosi and Vanessa were chosen by the public and all the housemates except Kemal voted to evict Vanessa.<br />
<cite id="fn_6"><a href="#fn_6_back" title="">Note 6</a>:</cite> Instead of nominating those that they wished to evict, the housemates had to nominate those who they wanted to <i>stay</i> in the house.<br />
<cite id="fn_7"><a href="#fn_7_back" title="">Note 7</a>:</cite> After Orlaith walked, Kinga was brought back in the house to replace her. She was instantly set a secret mission in which she needed to get at least one person not to nominate her. If one person failed to nominate her, she would be immune and would definitely appear in the final week of Big Brother. She passed her task as none of the housemates nominated her for eviction.<br />
<cite id="fn_8"><a href="#fn_8_back" title="">Note 8</a>:</cite> There were no nominations in the final week. There was also a mid-week eviction in the final week. The housemate to have received the fewest votes from the public (to win) by Wednesday night was evicted, leaving four housemates for the final on Friday. The housemates were all evicted on that day between 8:30 PM and 10:30 PM. They were evicted with 4th place going first and the winner leaving last.</small></p>
