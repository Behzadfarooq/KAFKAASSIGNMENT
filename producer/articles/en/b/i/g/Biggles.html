<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>In his first appearance, Biggles was a fighter pilot in the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flying_Corps_45d7.html" title="Royal Flying Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC) during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. He joined the RFC in 1916 at the young age of 17, having conveniently "lost" his birth certificate. The original Biggles stories were based on Johns' experience — and stories he had heard from other pilots — during his time in France. (Johns did not fly "scout" — or fighter — aircraft like Biggles; he flew in a bomber squadron.) Biggles was supposedly based on <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyril_Lowe_40a6.html" title="Cyril Lowe">Cyril Lowe</a>. While the purpose of the Biggles stories was to entertain young men, they paid attention to historical detail and helped recreate the primitive days of early air combat — when most pilots died in their first combat and before devices such as respirators and parachutes had become practical. Throughout his 'career', Biggles flew a number of planes which almost delineate the early history of British military aviation, from <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopwith_Camel_ca2f.html" title="Sopwith Camel">Sopwith Camels</a> during World War I to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Spitfires</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawker_Hurricane_7bea.html" title="Hawker Hurricane">Hawker Hurricanes</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>According to the novels Biggles initially joined the Army as a subaltern in the Rifle Regiment. Transferring to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flying_Corps_45d7.html" title="Royal Flying Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>, he learned to fly in the summer of 1916 at No. 17 Flying Training School at Settling in Norfolk. Posted to France with just 15 hours solo, he first flew in combat in September 1916 with 169 Squadron, RFC, (commanded by Major Paynter). Biggles began flying the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Aircraft_Factory_F.E.2_b158.html" title="Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2">FE2</a> "<a href="../../../p/u/s/Pusher_configuration.html" title="Pusher configuration">pusher</a>", and later the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_F.2_Fighter_c521.html" title="Bristol F.2 Fighter">Bristol F2B</a>. Transferred in late summer 1917, he then flew the <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopwith_Pup_ba8d.html" title="Sopwith Pup">Sopwith Pup</a> and the famed <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopwith_Camel_ca2f.html" title="Sopwith Camel">Sopwith Camel</a> as a pilot of the fictional 266 Squadron RFC, commanded by Dubliner Major Mullen. Study of the series of short stories featuring his WWI exploits suggests he claimed at least 32 kills, and was shot down or crash landed 8 times. He was awarded the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Order_3a2e.html" title="Distinguished Service Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, and the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Cross_3e00.html" title="Military Cross">Military Cross</a> and bar.</p>
<p>Later stories told of Biggles' adventures after the War, as a charter pilot of an unidentified amphibian (often illustrated on covers, anachronistically, as either a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Walrus_0101.html" title="Supermarine Walrus">Supermarine Walrus</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Sea_Otter_5190.html" title="Supermarine Sea Otter">Supermarine Sea Otter</a>), his return to service in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> (initially with a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_S6B_b7bc.html" title="Supermarine S6B">Supermarine S6B</a> type machine in the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltic_Sea_a4f2.html" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic</a>) and then as Commanding Officer of 666 Squadron, RAF, a Special Duties squadron sent around the world on specific assignments. Several collections of stories detailed further adventures in peacetime; others filled in his equally adventurous childhood in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> and the story of how he came to join the RFC, flying with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> observer Mark Way in an <a href="../../../f/e/2/FE2_001c.html" title="FE2">FE2</a> before he converted to scouts. Biggles' first post-war action saw him in the African desert with new twin-engined types (possibly <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol_Brigand_aa85.html" title="Bristol Brigand">Bristol Brigand</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Havilland_Hornet_976b.html" title="De Havilland Hornet">de Havilland Hornet</a>).</p>
<p>Biggles has a small team of friends including his cousin Algy (the Hon. Algernon Lacey), Ginger (Hebblethwaite) and Bertie (Lord Bertie Lissie), who share many of his adventures as pilots in the Special Air Police which they form after WWII, flying <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auster.html" title="Auster">Auster</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunting_Aircraft_bbd8.html" title="Hunting Aircraft">Percival</a> types, under the command of <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Commodore_36d7.html" title="Air Commodore">Air Commodore</a> Raymond, who is at this time an Assistant Commissioner at <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_Yard_5bca.html" title="Scotland Yard">Scotland Yard</a>.</p>
<p>Biggles' greatest opponent is the German spy officer Erich von Stalhein. They first meet when Biggles acts as a spy in the Middle East, where Biggles has some narrow escapes. Von Stalhein returns as an adversary in numerous other adventures. After World War II von Stalhein opts for the Communist bloc, until he gets imprisoned on the isle of <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakhalin.html" title="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a>, from where Biggles helps him escape. ( See <i>Biggles buries a Hatchet</i>-1958) After this he and Biggles are chums.</p>
<p>Though Biggles and his friends age in the books, they do so more slowly than appears historically credible. The books somewhat obviously chronicle developments in aviation technology and also social changes. In an early book, the evidence points to an English nobleman as the perpetrator, but Biggles can dismiss this out of hand as the gentry would never commit a crime; in a later novel, one of the gentry is the villain. While various natives are sometimes unreliable, the Biggles books do not really display racist views - although Johns certainly promoted the superiority of British <i>culture</i>, as distinct from race. Johns' contemporary terms for people of different colour have resulted in censorship in some places.</p>
<p>In the Biggles stories, there are several females and love affairs. However, despite brief affairs, Biggles and his chums remain steadfastly single. Biggles suffered a disappointment in WWI when he fell in love with German spy Marie Janis in <i>Affaire de Coeur</i> (set in 1918); he later rescues her from East Germany in <i>Biggles Looks Back</i>.</p>
<p>In <i>Biggles Fails to Return</i> (published in 1943), Ginger falls in love with the sister of the French pilot who has flown Biggles into France on a secret mission, and at the end of the story Ginger gets to spend several weeks in her company while awaiting transport back to England.</p>
<p>There is a documented discussion of the issue of Biggles, sex and alcohol in <i>By Jove, Biggles: The Life of Captain W.E. Johns</i> (1981) by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Berresford_Ellis_b0f9.html" title="Peter Berresford Ellis">Peter Berresford Ellis</a> and Piers Williams.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, a popular Australian radio version of Biggles was made under licence to Johns. Johns did not write the scripts and apparently ended the contract after receiving complaints from young readers that the storyline had made Biggles "go soft" by taking up a blonde female lover! Because most of the popularity of Biggles was with children, he was unable to include sexual storylines which bored them. (When the early World War I-based Biggles books were reprinted for children, book publishers also edited a case of "whisky" to a case of "lemonade" bottles, resulting in absurd episodes of squadrons risking their lives for a prize of fizzy pop!)</p>
<p>Another female character appears in the form of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worrals.html" title="Worrals">Worrals</a>, eponymous heroine of a related series of books featuring this resourceful and "plucky" member of the WAAF.</p>
<p>A further Johns creation, the commando Captain Lorrington King, nicknamed "Gimlet" also features in a series of books that intersect with Biggles at times. His regular colleagues are Corporal Albert Edward Collson, nicknamed "Copper" (he is an ex-policeman), Private "Trapper" Troublay, and Nigel Norman Peters, nicknamed "Cub".</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Biggles.html" title="Edit section: Contemporary viewpoints">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Contemporary viewpoints</span></h2>
<p>Biggles books have been satirised for their archaic use of language, notably terms such as "opined" and "ejaculated" and the use of what are now seen as offensive racial stereotypes and characterisations (Germans are often referred to as <i>the Hun</i>, for example). This led to the books being removed from most British libraries, a move which was held up derisively as an example of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">political correctness</a> since the books are quite without malice and very much of their time. Written for children, they contain no swearing and no sex but alcohol is mentioned occasionally and cigarettes are much in evidence.</p>
<p>The charges of the 1960s and 1970s, accusing Johns of calculated racism, do not hold up in the face of the evidence: from the Oxford-educated Chinaman, Li Chi, in <i>Biggles Flies Again</i>, to the feisty Polynesian girl, Full Moon, in <i>Biggles In The South Seas</i>, to the half-Indian man set to inherit Biggles' job in <i>Biggles Does Some Homework</i>, Johns' multiracial characters consistently challenge and subvert the stereotypical expectations. Biggles himself was brought up in India, speaks fluent Hindi, and has a number of Indian friends and colleagues; he asserts to Colonel Raymond, in <i>Biggles Delivers the Goods</i>, that he has "always tried to be decent to all men, regardless of race, nationality, colour or creed", and the message of the books, expressed, indeed, with often heavy-handed emphasis, is that readers should endeavour to do likewise.</p>
<p>In general the books set in the First World War are good examples of their time and genre and are likely to be acceptable to a modern audience; they are also more edgy, Biggles setting out on at least one occasion with "<a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_mist.html" title="Red mist">red mist</a>", on a death-or-glory mission occasioned by the death of a comrade. They also touch on the emotional strain of combat, Johns often describing Biggles as "highly strung" and lacking a sense of humour. The latter WW1 stories often imply Biggles was suffering from combat fatigue and stress.</p>
<p>The inter-war books are reasonably typical of boys' adventure literature of the time, and similar plots and characterisations could be found in comics and books of other genres. <i>The Cruise of the Condor</i> (1933) is representative of this period. By the Second World War the characterisations had clearly dated but popularity was assured perhaps by the public need for reminders of past success and surely by the way "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Few_a43e.html" title="The Few">The Few</a>" caught the popular imagination. Post-war Biggles books feel anachronistic and do not compare well with contemporary fiction such as <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Dare_bc87.html" title="Dan Dare">Dan Dare</a>, but the fictitious "Special Air Police" does provide numerous decent short stories, some of which stand the test of time.</p>

<p>Johns continued writing Biggles short stories and novels up until his death in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>; in all, nearly a hundred Biggles books were published.</p>
<p>Most of the Biggles books are out of print but Red Fox is reprinting many of the titles. The books are a common target for collectors, with some titles fetching high prices, especially the handful that were deleted before being reprinted into paperback. The rarest title, <i>Biggles and the Deep Blue Sea</i>, has been known to fetch $1000 on <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a>.</p>
<p>Biggles was <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodied</a> in a series of skits on the 1970s British comedy television show, <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus_5f2b.html" title="Monty Python's Flying Circus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></i>, including one titled "Biggles Dictates a Letter"<a href="http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/biggles.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/biggles.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and 'Cardinal Biggles', complete with flying helmet and goggles, assists in the interrogations in the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Inquisition_%28Monty_Python%29_b89d.html" title="Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)">Spanish Inquisition sketch</a>. Text stories in the "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brand_New_Monty_Python_Bok_f636.html" title="The Brand New Monty Python Bok">Papperbok</a>" included "Biggles Flies Down". There have been many other references to the character in film and literature. The fictional title <i>Biggles Flies Undone</i> was mentioned in the "Biggles Dictates a Letter" Monty Python's episode, but was never actually produced. In the first <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Relief_ec40.html" title="Comic Relief">Comic Relief</a></i>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Palin_778d.html" title="Michael Palin">Michael Palin</a> read the skit "Biggles Goes to See Bruce Springsteen".

<p>In Blackadder Goes Fourth Rik Mayall Captain Flashheart could be a Biggles-based character.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the British television show <i><a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_d5fc.html" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> created a Biggles-based character called <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Harkness_7f66.html" title="Jack Harkness">Captain Jack</a>, for the episode "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Empty_Child_7873.html" title="The Empty Child">The Empty Child</a>"<a href="http://www.tv.com/doctor-who-2005/the-empty-child-1/episode/407900/summary.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tv.com/doctor-who-2005/the-empty-child-1/episode/407900/summary.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

Johns' creation.</p>
<p>Biggles appeared in a short-lived <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> TV series based on the books with Neville Whiting playing the title role and was also featured in a <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> feature film called <i><a href="../../../a/d/v/Biggles%7E_Adventures_in_Time_25f8.html" title="Biggles: Adventures in Time">Biggles: Adventures in Time</a></i>, directed by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hough_2139.html" title="John Hough">John Hough</a> with <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Dickson_d4c7.html" title="Neil Dickson">Neil Dickson</a> in the title role. The film attempted to add appeal to the character by adding a <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> element but it was a commercial and critical failure.</p>
<p>An <i>Unauthorised Biography</i> by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Pearson_%28author%29_a47f.html" title="John Pearson (author)">John Pearson</a>, published in the 1980s, added new and embellished elements to the character's history, including the ageing Biggles' suicide in a vintage <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> in the 1960s. A4 format cartoon adventures in which the Biggles characters use a mix of vintage and modern aircraft were published in the 1980s.</p>
<p>There was also <b>Biggles Recounts the Falklands War</b> in 1982?, This book was not written by W.E. Johns.</p>
<p>In an episode of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Thin_Blue_Line_%28TV_series%29_12c7.html" title="The Thin Blue Line (TV series)">The Thin Blue Line</a></i> Constable Habib outrages Inspector Fowler with the suggestion that Biggles and Ginger were gay lovers, which was also a major point on Monty Python's "Biggles dictates a letter".</p>
<p>The lyrics of the <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jethro_Tull_%28band%29_f69b.html" title="Jethro Tull (band)">Jethro Tull</a> song, <i>Thick As A Brick</i>, has a line that mentions Biggles (<i>"So, where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?"</i>). Additionally, Biggles is mentioned several times in the elaborate album cover, which is a parody of a local British newspaper, most significantly in a story entitled "Do Not See Me Rabbit".</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Powers_25dc.html" title="Austin Powers">Austin Powers</a> series of movies, <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Evil_3cb9.html" title="Doctor Evil">Doctor Evil</a> has a hairless cat named Mr. Bigglesworth.</p>
