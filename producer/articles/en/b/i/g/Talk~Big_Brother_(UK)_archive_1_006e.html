<i>During the current series of Big Brother , BBLB has been criticised by many fan's saying that it is biased. Dermot O' Leary normally shows his dislike for Aisleyne and Pete and his liking for Nikki, Jayne and Glyn.</i></p>
<p>I was about to delete this myself, but I thought I should just check here. Is this statement a POV or is it well known among fans? If it is to stay it needs a proper citation. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon_Dude_ecd1.html" title="User:Anon Dude">Anon Dude</a> 18:50, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree, much of the information contained in this section is un-encyclopedic and should be removed. Please can someone (like the person who wrote it) explain why it should be kept? If there are no valid responses soon i will cut the section down to notable encyclopedic facts only. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChillymail_bc31.html" title="User:Chillymail">Chillymail</a> 21:43, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, the stuff in the format section is basically a description of the stuff that happens during <i>every show</i>. In an article about a TV show, I think the recurring features that can be found in every episode should be noted.-<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasmaDragon_68d9.html" title="User:PlasmaDragon">PlasmaDragon</a> 03:44, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really - it only contains the series format for the BBBM shows that aired during series 7 of BB UK. Minor details of the show (which are noted in this article for some reason) do change from series to series. Plus all 'Characters' info is trivial and only notes stuff that has occured during the most recent series, and the same can be said for the 'memorable' quotes. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon_Dude_ecd1.html" title="User:Anon Dude">Anon Dude</a> 13:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I still think the format of an <i>entire season</i> of the show ought to be noted. You can add some stuff mentioning that the previous series was of a different format, if you like. And I think a section in this article for the characters is entirely warranted. Other articles on TV series have a section on the characters, if not an entire separate article on the characters. Compared with the rest of wikipedia, having a few paragraphs and pictures about the characters is quite modest. By all means, however, do note in the article which minor details have changed from series to series, and feel free to move the quotes to wikiquote.-<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasmaDragon_68d9.html" title="User:PlasmaDragon">PlasmaDragon</a> 14:09, 13 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that the character section should remain as it is, but the format section is over the top. It reads like a Russel Brand fan has written this section (calling him by his first name is un-encyclopedic for a start) to glorify Brand. It may appeal to fans of the show, or to people who are familiar with the show, but someone coming to this page who does not know anything about the subject would be confused by this section, which is something an encyclopedia article should try to avoid.

<li>OK, I tried to provide a bit of an introduction to the format section, as well as provide subheadings like in the <i>Countdown</i> article. When I have time later, I'll try making "example" sections like in that article, as well as fixing some of the poor writing. However, I do thing the formulae of the jokes should be included.

<li>The main problems (IMO) the article has our 1. It is written in a very high yet unencyclopediaic detail, and 2. all the info about the show (whether it be the format, character info or quotes) refer to stuff that has occured in the <b>most recent series</b>. At most we only need a couple of paragrapghs describing the show. I will go ahead with this type of edit if no-one objects. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon_Dude_ecd1.html" title="User:Anon Dude">Anon Dude</a> 10:03, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Big Brother eye is meaningful to the article, as it is the logo of Big Brother, upon which the show is based. Also, it is painted on the set. You can see part of it in the background of some of the characters pictures. As for the characters pictures, I know they aren't the best quality, but I don't see why we should just delete them entirely. They're the best we have for now, and let's try to work on improving them instead of just destroying them.-<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasmaDragon_68d9.html" title="User:PlasmaDragon">PlasmaDragon</a> 13:57, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Big Brother eye is the Big Brother eye, not the Big Brother's Big Mouth eye. Something like this would be much more suitable for the article. Also, now the eye has been scaled down to comply with <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">fair use</a>, it looks blurry and fuzzy. The other images look as though they've been taken from the same website that other images have been taken from. The images were removed from the articles they were repeatedly inserted in because they are not of good quality, and they are distorted. <b><sub><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk to</a></sub> <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">JD</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_J_Di_0b1c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/J Di">wants e-mail</a></sup></b> 14:05, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, you have a point about the logo; I'll try to find a more specific image. However, I'm afraid I can't make any sense of "The other images look as though they've been taken from the same website that other images have been taken from." I just can't figure out what you're trying to say. And yes, I know that "The images were removed from the articles they were repeatedly inserted in because they are not of good quality, and they are distorted." You said that in your edit summary. But I would like it if you would address what I said, namely "They're the best we have for now, and let's try to work on improving them instead of just destroying them."-<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasmaDragon_68d9.html" title="User:PlasmaDragon">PlasmaDragon</a> 15:40, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks, but this is already tabled on the specific articles of specific series. In the UK we have had 13 series 7 traditional big brothers, 5 celebrity editions and 1 teen big brother. The individual articles for each series contain a tables of evictions. There is not really enough room for them in the main BB UK article. Thanks for the suggestion though.</p>

<pre>
Unlike all other Big Brother series, Teen Big Brother was pre-recorded and shown some months 
after the contestants had left the house.
</pre>
<pre>
While the show was being aired it was involved in a scandal over two of the housemates having 
sex on live TV.
</pre>
<p>So which is it: was it prerecorded or was it live? <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarik_9c52.html" title="User:Garik">garik</a> 10:21, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Therres a difference between something being aired and being live. A program doesn't have to be live to be aired. Teen Big Brother was prerecorded, and the scandal was during it's showing on Channel 4.</p>

<dd>Right. I've split off the six main seasons into separate articles with a common header linking back to the main article. Some of them could probably now do with a little expansion, especially the first three! Looking at the size of the infobox I'm now inclined to leave the celebrity and teen ones on the main article page as it seems balanced.

<dd>I just came here to split it and found that you've beaten me to it! It looks great, and thanks for the work you've put in. I think that the infobox on this page could possibly just show the finalists of each series – if this article is supposed to be an overview then we should be presenting the winner (and runner-up) in the clearest way, and the rest isn't really that interesting outside of the individual series articles. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 22:45, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>::grin:: ta. I did think that maybe just leaving the winners / last day'ers might work, but maybe that would leave out housemates that people remember and they wouldn't know which year to go to to find them. As such the infobox works as an index to the series' articles. Without the box there would have to be a list of the hosuemates alongside each season and it is probably easier to leave the infobox therefore. myabe. um ... --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">Vamp</a>:<a href="../../../v/a/m/User_talk%7EVampWillow_2eb2.html" title="User talk:VampWillow">Willow</a> 22:57, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Difficult one really, as there are probably strong arguments in favour of both options. However given that something we editors pride ourselves on is maintaining the history of an article's edits I feel that it is probably better to keep the current series split (and cut/pastes are to be avoided for that reason!) It would also reduce the likelihood of edit conflicts on the full page and the load on users downloading the full article when they aren't interested in it. If we go with your infobox then it isn't as though the main page would need updating in step with the series page for evictions (until the very end) and people interested in the current series would quickly realise where they needed to head in future. --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">Vamp</a>:<a href="../../../v/a/m/User_talk%7EVampWillow_2eb2.html" title="User talk:VampWillow">Willow</a> 11:55, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are under constant surveillance, right? And so everything they say/do potentially goes out to the outside world. So you mean that people aren't allowed to discuss their knowledge/opinions/experiences with their housemates in case the outside world hears? Hence that any activity that might inform, entertain or influence the outside world must be non-verbal?

<dd>Yes, they are under surveillance, and as such Big Brother must have thought Kitten was violating a rule by daubing messages on the mirrors during the painting task. This was after two formal warnings had been given to her by Big Brother, and this particular "rule-breaking" resulted in her third and final warning. As regards to saying 'Happy Birthday', wearing a t-shirt with those words and directed at somebody on the outside world would constitute a violation of the rule regarding "communicating a message to the outside world". If my memory serves me right, a housemate in an earlier series was pulled up by Big Brother for doing something similar with some item of clothing. It also works the other way too. Whenever an aeroplane flies over the house carrying a message, Big Brother promptly gets the housemates indoors. They don't want the "outside world" to communicate things to them. -<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyW_ecc1.html" title="User:TonyW">TonyW</a> 16:19, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>On the eviction show on June the 3rd, after Mary was evicted, Davina McCall ended the show by telling viewers to stay tuned to Big Brother to see who the new/next unlucky housemate will be.

<dl>
<dd>Well, then one would then ask why the cameras are not widescreen. You can buy widescreen camcorders on the high street and nearly all broadcasters film everything in widescreen using professional television cameras. And even if you record something in 4:3, you can easily zoom in on the 4:3 picture to create a 16:9 image. Even the pictures shot outside the house (Davina, interview etc) are in 4:3. Channel 4 News is also in 4:3, although nearly all other programmes (including adverts) on Channel 4 are 16:9. <a href="../../../n/f/h/User%7ENFH_d937.html" title="User:NFH">NFH</a> 13:32, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No idea then. That was just wild speculation.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree - that annoys me too. Even worse is when they horizontally stretch some old 4:3 footage to fit 16:9, which BBC News do occasionally. However, if Big Brother were to film in 4:3 in the knowledge that that the top 12½% and bottom 12½% of the picture will be discarded and never broadcast, then it would not be a problem, even if their cameras are too antiquated to film in 16:9. <a href="../../../n/f/h/User%7ENFH_d937.html" title="User:NFH">NFH</a> 14:58, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Big Brother Australia *groan* had different opening titles for each show in 2005 and 2006, if different only because of the colour used, as was also the case for Big Brother 7 UK shows; and Big Brother Uncut had a different theme in the first two seasons. Eviction and Live Nominations had different opening credits for a while. UpLate, Friday Night Live, and Adults Only are all worthy of their own articles, but despite all of this, they are all still on one article. <sub><a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a></sup> 16:53, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Why did someone take out the seperate page for Big Brothers big mouth and merge all the shows into one??? It was much better to keep them seperate.

<dd>Yes there used to be a seperate one for BBBM with pictures and everything. Now it is all in one. And it is a lot harder to navigate. And who cares about BB Australia why do we have to conform to their way of doing things??

<dd>Their way of doing things? Who's way of doing things? Without Big Brother Australia, Big Brother UK would be a heck of a lot more boring than it is now; not everything to do with Big Brother UK is original. Consistency is a good thing, and having the articles on separate pages just because it makes Big Brother UK different isn't a good reason to not have them all on one page. I don't do anything just for the sake of it, and my reasons for suggesting the three articles be merged are all up there. If you have a good reason for unnecessarily putting information in four different places, I would sure love to hear it. I don't find the article difficult to navigate at all, but if you disagree, perhaps you'd like to consider cutting down a few sections, namely <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK%29_f3d9.html#Big_Brother.27s_Big_Mouth" title="Big Brother (UK)">this one</a>. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">jd</a> || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 11:53, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh dear, merging the articles together wasn't a good idea, it's far too big now and many of the details are irrelevant for a all-encompassing BB UK article yet still significant for the individual shows. Rather than severely cut down the BBLB and BBBM sections I think they should go back to being seperate articles. For example, BBBM in particular is as much a vehicle for Russel Brand's humour as it is a debate on the goings on in the Big Brother house - his characters and catchphrases have little or no impact on Big Brother UK as a whole yet are worthy of a mention in a BBBM article.

<dd>Any of his "humour" can be included in this article, but they shouldn't take over an article as they once did. Most of the <i>Big Brother's Big Mouth</i> article was about the jokes and other stuff like that, and people said on the talk page that it needed to be cut down anyway. I don't remember cutting down the <i>Big Brother's Little Brother</i> article when I merged it here, but I still think the <i>Big Brother's Big Mouth</i> section really needs to be cut down. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">jd</a> || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 11:03, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>UpLate, Friday Night Live, and Adults Only could probably be seen in the same way, and at least one of these shows has done something that definitely sets it apart from the rest of Big Brother Australia. Adults Only is more notable than Big Brother's Big Mouth, Big Brother's Little Brother, and Big Brother's Big Brain put together. Adults Only got called pornography by Parliamentarians, had the Australian Prime Minister slander the show, and had the <a href="../../../a/c/m/ACMA_8a37.html" title="ACMA">ACMA</a>, a <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_agency.html" title="Government agency">government agency</a>, carry out an investigation that said that Adults Only, then Uncut, breached three television regulations. Have any of the <b>individual</b> Big Brother UK shows done anything like this?

<dd>I've just looked at the NTA website, and the only "Big Brother is completely different to Celebrity Big Brother"s I see are a question that allows a person to pick from Chantelle of Celebrity Big Brother 2005, Pete from BB2007, and Nikki from BB2007; and another question that has Big Brother, Celebrity Big Brother, I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here, and The Apprentice as answers. That doesn't really tell me much, and the fact that Big Brother and Celebrity Big Brother are both separate answers doesn't really mean much. It's quite clear that Big Brother and Celebrity Big Brother are not the same, but what I have seen on that website isn't enough to convince me that the Channel 4 website has false or misleading information on it. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">jd</a> || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 14:18, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That has to be a mistake on the Channel 4 site. If you look at press reports for the series (e.g. www.guardian.co.uk/Media/site/story/0,14173,1680567,00.html or www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2006000002-2006000661,00.html )and even Davina on air, the titles are referred to as they were originally numbered here, not related to each main series. Each series is officially just called "Celebrity Big Brother" though, so the choice of numbers is arbitrary anyway - I think it's better to go for the titles more familiar to the public and fans, look at any Big Brother forum and you'll see it's the way it was orignally numbered here. 14:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Given that both links are to newspaper websites, I don't really have an opinion on the accuracy of them, but the first one only refers to this year's Celebrity Big Brother as 2006 Celebrity Big Brother. I really don't see how the Channel 4 website could be inaccurate, as surely somebody would have seen this by now, or before it was even put on the Internet. I'm assuming the website is accurate, as Channel 4 is the network that airs the programme after all, and I think they'd know. Tra has done a lot to help avoid any confusion, so unless you can give me something that seems a bit more accurate than a newspaper site, I see no reason to move all the pages so that the article names match the season number. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">jd</a> || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 15:16, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Here's what I asked:</p>
<p>Good Evening, There has been delibriation on the numbering of Celebrity Big Brother. Does the Celebrity Big Brother 'Number/Cycle' proceed the previous Main Series of Big Brother. If Big Brother 2006 is BB7 does that mean Celebrity Big Brother 2007 will be CBB7 or CBB5?</p>

<p>Would it not make more sense just to call them Celebrity Big Brother (2000), Celebrity Big Brother (2002), etc? This avoids making any kind of judgement with regards to what number they are. Within each article, you can then start the article (for example):</p>

<dd>(de-indenting) You only need the UK in if there's already an article called Celebrity Big Brother (2004), etc. As there aren't, the "UK" is not needed.

<p>Isn't it about time to remove ==Series 7== from the main page? I mean the series now has it's own page anyway.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, plus I think a series 8 page should be started or a small section in place of the series 7 one on the Big Brother page, for the small details we know about the 8th Series. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_as_I_am_Chris_aa8a.html" title="User:Chris as I am Chris">Chris as I am Chris</a> 16:25, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What details would that be? <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di"><font color="#2EC401"><b>J Di</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di"><font color="#2EC401">talk</font></a></sup> 17:11, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that it is the last series at the current location. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_as_I_am_Chris_aa8a.html" title="User:Chris as I am Chris">Chris as I am Chris</a> 17:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that's enough information to create a new section. Could you provide an Internet source for that as well please? <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di"><font color="#2EC401"><b>J Di</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di"><font color="#2EC401">talk</font></a></sup> 17:19, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Its already stated in part of the wiki page, and there are some other little bits, just cant remember them, plus Im sure that others have some info. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_as_I_am_Chris_aa8a.html" title="User:Chris as I am Chris">Chris as I am Chris</a> 17:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see. I still don't think there'd be enough information for it to have its own section. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di"><font color="#2EC401"><b>J Di</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di"><font color="#2EC401">talk</font></a></sup> 17:31, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, maybe if we bring this back up after CBB5. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_as_I_am_Chris_aa8a.html" title="User:Chris as I am Chris">Chris as I am Chris</a> 17:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, On the panel to the right of the article, the shows are all 200? - Present except for BBBB, of which just says 2006, I dont know how to edit the pannel myself, but should this be changed as BBBB is on presently? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_as_I_am_Chris_aa8a.html" title="User:Chris as I am Chris">Chris as I am Chris</a> 19:13, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>why has this been removed?172.141.83.47 22:18, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><s>If you're referring to the infobox, I moved its section to under 'Previous seasons' as it's no longer the current series. If you click on [show] next to 'Previous seasons', you'll see the section. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 22:42, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</s></dd>
<dd>I've had another look and I think you might actually be referring to some recent vandalism. That has now been fixed. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 22:48, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
