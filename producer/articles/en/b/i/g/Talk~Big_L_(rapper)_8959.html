<p>I cleaned up this article as best as I could with what I had to work with. If some details are incorrectly restated then they should be corrected within the context of the new article by someone who has direct knowledge of Lamont Coleman. What needs to be added is something about his parents, his brother (hinted at) his religion, his schooling, etc., all of which must have had an influence on his life. Finally, there is a <b>COPYRIGHT</b> question here. The original editor included a number of lines from a recording. Who owns the copyright to them and does Wikipedia have the right to reproduce them? <a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX/MH</a> 17:19, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, fair use does cover that but I was not sure if this was the entire lyric and I could not find any attribution.

<p>I don't think that this article should say that L's death was untimely. That's not to say that it wasn't, but that to say so would not be NPOV. Alternatively, having already said that he died at 24, you might say that his death was obviously untimely. We needn't state the obvious.</p>
<p>I don't think that there should be a brief biography section, unless there is also a detailed biography section to distinguish it from. Let's leave it to readers to work out that the section is short.</p>
<p>I think that, "When I'm lifted, I'm high," and, "With new clothes on, I'm fly," should not be separated from other elements of the list by commas, because they contain commas.</p>

<p><br />
I think it should be noted that saying L was known for his freestly ability has no truth in it. At least not in the true context of the word 'freestyle'. The tracks labeled as freestyles, or radio performances called freestyles were actually written verses. This is fact, because I'm sure many of you have heard L spit the same 'freestyle' verse multiple times. It would be disrespectful to Lamont's memory to say that any of his recordings were sloppy enough to even be considered freestyles.</p>
<p><br />
No, the verses were originally freestyles, he would keep a verse from a freestyle if he liked it and reuse it.</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't know a whole lot about Big L, but this article seems very POV; for example: "Big L is also one of the more overlooked storytellers in rap." I think the discriptive words should be cleaned up by someone with a little more knowledge of the subject.</p>
<hr />
<p>In response to Tim Ivorson, what proof do you have that he was spitting witten verses. That's Insulting To L's Memory To Accuse Him Of Spittin' Writtens Unless U Have Absolute Proof. --Steve36 05:11, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"With the tragic slaying of New York rapper Big L, many of fans haven't been able to view the true side of him, after The Big Picture, loyal friends of the decreased rapper have went to the vault to find new unreleased tracks. His manager and partner in Flamboyant Entertainment, Rich King, talks about the album:</p>
<p>"We have remastered them to a quality that would seem like he was here today, it's going to be a two disc album with 24 tracks, ain't gonna be no huge list of appearances or remix of tracks, the only people who will be on the album will be the folks that Big L knew and loved, it's going to be what Big L wanted", the only confirmed producer DJ Premier, explained more about the album. "The title will be "Real Legends Never Die", we tried to have the album feel like Big L was really there, so it won't feel like we just put random tracks and that's it, it really has a Notorious B.I.G. Life After Death-feel to it, the three final tracks are, in my opinion, the most saddest and depressing tracks ever heard, a side that people never got to see from him.</p>
<p>The first single will be out in May and it's called "Do You See Me?", a track that represents Big L himself, a very powerful track. We are still working on a date for the album but I promise the fans of Lamont Coleman aka Big L, that it will be released in 2007."</p>
