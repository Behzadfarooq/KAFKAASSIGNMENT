<p>The idea of starting a circus school to train future "first" generation circus performers was the innovation of Russian born Gregory Fedin and his then wife Nina Grasavina. The school had a humble beginning working out of a Lower Manhattan loft. The circus couple collaborated with the Paul and Micheal to develop the Big Apple Circus following the European style "one ring" circus tradition. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, they located and secured an open grounds area where they could debut the Big Apple Circus. The small green tent was filled with big hearts of performers, families and circus enthusiast the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>. Headlining that show was Paul Lubin (Single Trapezist) , Ethel Janneir (Dog Act) a tight wire number, Micheal and Paul (Jugglers and Clowns), the Back Street Flyers, Mia and Jesse (double trapeze) and a host of performers. This area was located at <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battery_Park_651f.html" title="Battery Park">Battery Park</a>, in New York.</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> the circus moved from <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. By <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, two circus arts schools had been opened with money raised from the circus shows.</p>

<p>The Big Apple Circus began the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> decade with a lot of media attention, having established a special holiday celebration in honor of the circus and its staff, and then appearing in a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film.html" title="Film">film</a>.</p>

<p>By <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, the New York School for Circus Arts/Big Apple Circus relocated to East Harlem (1 East 104th Street) .

A core group of young circus "talent" participated in a circus competition resulting in a "Gold Medal" award. Three years later another group from the pre-professional circus program (located in the Harbor School for the Performing Arts in East Harlem) would compete in the II Rampe International Circus School Competition in Monte Carlo, Monaco.

<p>One of the biggest steps in the institution's history was taken in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, when the circus opened the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clown.html" title="Clown">clown</a> care unit, a group of professional clowns, trained extensively in hospital procedures, circus skills, and improvisation, make rounds as "clown doctors."</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> marked the circus' tenth anniversary, and big time celebrations were held during the entire year. A new tent and seating system was bought.
