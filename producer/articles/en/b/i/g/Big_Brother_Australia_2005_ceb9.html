<p><b>Big Brother Australia 2005</b> was the fifth series of <b><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html" title="Big Brother Australia">Big Brother Australia</a></b>, and was aired on <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Ten_7cd2.html" title="Network Ten">Network Ten</a> in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and <a href="../../../t/v/-/TV-2_2afc.html" title="TV-2">TV-2</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> with a four-week delay. The series started on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, with housemates going into the House the day before, and finished on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_15.html" title="August 15">August 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, lasting 101 days. The theme of the series was "single, sexy, and competitive".</p>
<p>Auditions for housemates were held in March 2005. In a departure from usual procedure, candidates were not required to send in videos of themselves as had been the case for prior auditions. Instead, the producers toured major Australian mainland cities and conducted interviews. They searched for sexy singles that were willing to have sexual relations on camera. Promos for the show suggested that Big Brother would be different this year, and phrases such as "Assume Nothing, Expect Anything", "Let's Play", and "Think Again" were heavily used throughout the series, especially during <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Australia%29_4c63.html#Launch" title="Big Brother (Australia)"><i>Opening Night</i></a>.<br clear="left" /></p>

<p>On <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Launch" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Opening Night</i></a>, it was revealed that $5,000 <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_dollar.html" title="Australian dollar">Australian dollars</a> would be subtracted from the $1,000,000 prize money every time the housemates broke a house rule. Such house rules included discussing <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Nominations" title="Big Brother Australia">nominations</a>, which must remain <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Secret_Nominations" title="Big Brother Australia">secret</a>; not giving adequate reasons for nominating; and forgetting to wear microphones at all times. <a href="#Michelle" title="">Michelle</a> was known for being the housemate to get the most such fines: $65,000.</p>

<p>It was also revealed that twins would be entering the house, regularly changing places without being informed of what the other twin had done while in the house. Greg and David entered the house as a single person named Logan (their shared middle name). Their task was to remain undetected for two weeks while swapping places at Big Brother's command.</p>
<p>The secret of the twins was discovered one week into the series by housemate Glenn, and this was revealed during <a href="#Lies_Exposed" title=""><i>Lies Exposed</i></a>. As a result, both Logans were able to continue living in the house, but would be treated as a single person in matters such as <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Eviction" title="Big Brother Australia">evictions</a> and nominations.</p>
<p>Late in the series a special eviction was held where one twin was evicted based on the votes of the other housemates, and the remaining twin allowed to continue in the house as a normal housemate. During this eviction process David was evicted. However, because Greg was the last housemate to be evicted, both David and Greg shared the prize equally.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2005_ceb9.html" title="Edit section: Disqualification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Disqualification</span></h2>
<p>Almost immediately upon entering the house, two housemates, Constance and Nelson openly admitted they were in relationships. A third housemate, Dean, had been confronted by Big Brother about the same matter just hours before entering the House, and he admitted that he was in a relationship. For this series, only <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_%28relationship%29.html" title="Single (relationship)">single</a> housemates had been sought by the show's producers, and these contestants had lied during the audition process in order to still be eligible for the show; going as far as taking their partners into lockdown with them, telling producers that they were friends. These housemates reasoned that once the show began airing there was no need to continue the pretense as there was nothing Big Brother could do about it now that they were already in the house (and the TV show was underway).</p>
<p>One week into the series the situation was addressed in the show. The producers announced that the threesome had broken the terms of their contract. They were sent to the stripped down <i>Rewards Room</i> before Big Brother allowed them back into the house. Unknown to the housemates, the three were nominated for eviction and the Australian public selected two housemates to be evicted. Constance and Nelson were evicted during <a href="#Viewers_Verdict" title=""><i>Viewers Verdict</i></a>, while Dean remained in the house and refuted Big Brother's assessment of his wrongdoing. The following week Dean was again nominated for eviction for this infraction, but again survived the public vote and someone else was evicted.</p>
<p>Big Brother decided that neither Constance nor Nelson should have prizes, which was disappointing for Nelson in particular because he said he only wanted to be in <i>Big Brother</i> for the prizes; especially the car - a prize that had been typically awarded to evictees of the previous year.</p>
<p>Constance broke up with her boyfriend a week after her disqualification.</p>
<p>When Dean was ultimately evicted many weeks later (after being nominated for eviction during the usual nomination process), the problem was again addressed, and after the prizes he was eligible for were presented there was some question in the <i>Live Eviction</i> show as to whether he would receive them. Gretel Killeen first asked the crowd for their opinion on whether Dean should receive the prizes. After a mixed reaction, Gretel received instructions through her earpiece and then announced that Big Brother had decided that as he had survived in the house until after the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Australia%29_4c63.html#Intruders" title="Big Brother (Australia)">Intruders</a> had arrived, he had earned the position of housemate, so would receive the prizes.</p>

<li><small>On Day 1, housemates had to, one by one, go to the Diary Room and nominate which housemate wouldn't receive their suitcase for the duration of their stay in the house. <a href="#Constance" title="">Constance</a> received the most nominations, so had to take her suitcase to the Diary Room, never seeing it again for the duration of her stay; while at the same time providing the rest of the housemates with the keys to their suitcases.</small></li>
<li><small>On Day 2, the housemates were given a quiz.</small></li>
<li><small>Also on Day 2, the Logans swapped places for the first time, during a special show named <a href="#Live_Surprise" title=""><i>Live Surprise</i></a>.</small></li>
<li><small>On Day 5, housemates were given their first task: to see how well they knew each other. They wager 50% of their budget, and passed the task.</small></li>
<li><small>Housemates found out that they have passed their task, and receive ice-cream.</small></li>

<li><small>On Day 8, Big Brother told the housemates that they were constantly told during the pre-production process, that should their relationship status change during the auditions process, that they should tell Big Brother immediately. Because Constance, Dean, and Nelson didn't do this, and lied to get into the house, they were all "evicted" to the Rewards Room. There, Big Brother told them what they have done wrong: lying about being single to get into the house.</small></li>

<li><small>On Day 23, the housemates were given a Tango task. They all had to learn how to tango, and could use a dance mat provided by Big Brother. They also had to learn using dummies. They wagered their full budget on the task.</small></li>
<li><small>Housemates up for eviction were Dean, Michael, Christie, and Glenn. Michelle used her <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Australia%29_4c63.html#Nominations" title="Big Brother (Australia)">Three Point Twist</a> on Glenn, but the line-up didn't change.</small></li>
<li><small>Big Brother informed the housemates that because of the fines they had incurred during the previous week, their $48 shopping budget had been reduced by $50, $5 for each fine incurred. Because of this, the housemates owed Big Brother $2, and could only take staples from the shop. Dean was able to retrieve the bag left there the week before.</small></li>
<li><small>Kate was given an Insider mission on Day 24. She was told that she had to sabotage the Tango task by removing at least three heads from three dummies, and hide them without being found out. She was given five days to complete her mission, and was told that she might be tailed. Tim was later given the task of discovering that Kate was trying to sabotage the task.</small></li>
<li><small>On Day 25, Kate managed to remove and hide some heads. The housemates suspected Tim of doing it.</small></li>

<li><small>On Day 31, the housemates were given a Housekeeping task. Housemates had to pair up as a chef and a waiter. The housemates wagered their full shopping budget again.</small></li>
