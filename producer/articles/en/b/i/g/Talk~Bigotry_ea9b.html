<dd><i>1598, from M.Fr. bigot, from O.Fr., supposedly a derogatory name for Normans, the old theory (not universally accepted) being that it springs from their frequent use of O.E. oath bi God. Plausible, since the Eng. were known as goddamns in Joan of Arc's France, and during World War I Americans serving in France were said to be known as les sommobiches. But the earliest Fr. use of the word (12c.) is as the name of a people apparently in southern Gaul. The earliest Eng. sense is of "religious hypocrite," especially a female one, and may be influenced by beguine. Sense extended 1687 to other than religious opinions.</i></dd>

<dd>Exactly. COMMUNISTS are often bigots. COMMUNIST PEOPLE. But the ideals of Communism do not always include bigotry. You are confusing ideals with those who practice them. Just because a person believes his way of thinking is absolutely correct does not mean he does not tolerate the opinions of others. There are many Communist parties that debate and politicize with other parties and ideologies. Religiocentrism, fanaticism, and zealotry - terms that refer to intense religious belief and a religion-centered life and mind - do not inherently show bigotry or intolerance, and to say that they do is extremely POV and, ironically, prejudiced in itself. You cannot rationally assume that all religiocentric, fanatic, or ethnocentric people are prejudiced and intolerant. Take Jesse Jackson; I think most people would say he is not prejudiced, but he is extremely "caught up" on race; it is central to his thought process and his life. He is ethnocentric, but he is not a bigot by any means. These terms are not hand-in-hand with bigotry. There is a correlation, but it is innapropriate to list them as examples of bigotry. I'm going to remove them again, and it would be nice if you could actually discuss the changes or at least provide an explanation in the edit summaries. And I'd appreciate it if you didn't set up the history/edit summaries up to make it look like you are simply reverting a vandal, kplzthx. Karwynn 06:31, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By whose definition? Certainly not by Wikipedia's. Look them up: <a href="../../../z/e/a/Zealotry.html" title="Zealotry">zealotry</a> is religion-related ambition and activism to a great excess. <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanaticism.html" title="Fanaticism">Fanaticism</a> is excessive and unquestioning enthusiasm or support for something. Neither of these definitions nor the main articles of these two subjects suggest automatic prejudice or outward intolerance; the only thing close is the fact that zealots and fanatics are intolerant of other opinions within THEIR OWN mindset (sorry for the caps, but I don't know how to do italics&#160;:'-( ). This is not prejudice. Throwing around words like "by definition" doesn't help anything. Your take on this is very speculative and involves an overly simplistic, stereotyping mindset of these concepts, no offence meant personally. Can you explain how these 4 concepts are bigotry? How do they inherently show prejudice and outward intolerance? And I'm talking about the IDEAS, not certain people who you consider zealots or fanatics. In other words, don't bring up insane pastor <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a> and treat him as a representative example of fanaticism or zealotry.

<li>Bigotry encompasses more than just 'dislike of opinions that differ from one's own'. I fixed the lead to reflect racial bigotry, etc. This seems to be a place in which many dictionaries provide an insufficient definition of the term.</li>
<li><i>Bigotry</i> is used fairly interchangeably with <i>closed-minded</i>. This is not 'editorializing'--see any thesaurus. Both terms belong to a class of perjoratives that few people would draw from in describing themselves.</li>
<li>The article seems to be rather deficient in an actual history and evolution of the concept of bigotry, but I'm not sure what could be added that's not covered under <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a> or <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_crime.html" title="Hate crime">hate crime</a>. I've read a few sociological and psychological articles on the subject of racial bigotry, but again that stuff might work better at over at <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>.</li>

<dd>People usually just use one gender or the other to avoid clutter, but it's not that big of a deal to me. The "closed-minded" thing is, though. The terms are not interchangeable. Someone can be closed-minded about an idea without being bigoted and prejudiced towards people. I'd say that's the main defference; closed-minded refers to your mindset towards an idea, and bigoted is a prejudice and hostility towards the people that idea or race is associated with. For example, I am closed-minded about abortion, but I am not bigoted towards people who get them; I don't hate them or have any prejudices towards them.</dd>

<dd>No, I see your point. I wasn't particularly married to that sentence (nor did I write it). I just didn't think it was "editorializing" to include it as the terms can be used <i>somewhat</i> interchangeably (perhaps it would be more accurate to say that a bigot is always closed minded, but a person who is closed minded may or may not be a bigot). Anyway, I'm content to leave that out, for the reasons you described above.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdmessenger_b931.html" title="User:Birdmessenger">Birdmessenger</a> 00:21, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know my story sounded personal, although it’s the only way I know how to gain a better perspective. So far the only words I have heard: victim, or victimized. I disagree, there has to be a word or way to describe resistance to victimization with no closure. A continuum of bigotry, that in a sense has become airborne, which is attributed to human combative behavior. The art of bigotry is no longer segregated to racial or religious conflicts. It’s plain and simple the art of bigotry is in the hands of the dishonest, as opposed to the self honest who strive for social honesty amongst the entire world.<a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKisida_5029.html" title="User:Kisida">Kisida</a> 17:06, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also in terms of Christianity claiming the historicity of Jesus Christ which is unsubstantiated. As it is now widley accepted by scholars that none of the Gospels were written by their supposed writers but spurrious forgeries written as many as 250 years after Jesus Supposed death. The supposedly famous and important preacher/godman was unknown to historical writers of his times(most notably Josephus). And had a mythos of virgin birth, and resurrection common to other gods/godmen including Mithra, Dionysious, Buddha, and Osiris to name a few which all predate the Christ mythos. When confronted with these facts then as today those myths are dismissed as stories where as with out substantiation or fact the Christ story is somehow beleived to be true by Christians. Without reason to back up it's similarily wild, and wholly unbeleivable claims of his life story. Again fitting the definition of a bigot as being a pejorative term against a person who is obstinately devoted to their prejudices even when these views are challenged or proven to be false.</dd>

<p>I deleted the stuff about Barbara Walker's theory. It was completely POV and non-Wiki-compatible.

If we are to discuss on linguistics, let us then also stay on linguistics and historical facts, such as transformation of the initial 'v' phonem on Latin first syllable into 'b' in Western Roman languages, on truncation of first syllables in polysyllablic words in Vulgar Latin, missions of St. Boniface in the 8th century and generic history of Dark Ages. The 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th centuries weren't exactly the golden era of religious tolerance anywhere in the world, and especially not amongst the illiterate barbarians in tribal societies, be they nominally Arian, Catholic or sacrificing humans to Wotan. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/9/2/User%7E192.100.124.218.html" title="User:192.100.124.218">192.100.124.218</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/2/User_talk%7E192.100.124.218.html" title="User talk:192.100.124.218">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_192.100.124.218_dd34.html" title="Special:Contributions/192.100.124.218">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>You're wrong. The Goths established their kingdom by merging german and roman laws. They accepted any religion without any discrimination before they adopted catholicism. The roman catholic clergy was equal and as powerfull as the wisigoths rulers, so after the conversion of the goths the king was elected by the roman clergy. The famous rules against jews raised after the conversion. They were in addition no racial laws at all, but religious ones demanding for conversion. The spanish jews were not hebrew people at all but mixed blood of hebrew, and a large part of converted roman, goths and numerous slavs and saxons slaves traded from Frank kingdom, and property of the local Jews. Most of Spanish Jews had European origin.Gollan 08:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The D-day code name BIGOT was the reverse of to gib, or to gibraltar.

<p>What's here is good, but it leaves me with the question I arrived here with: can you be quite correct, but because you won't hear any further discussion (and perhaps have reached your conclusion hastily) bigoted? I don't see why not, but I'm not certain it's so. <a href="../../../n/d/a/User%7ENdaniels_b949.html" title="User:Ndaniels">Ndaniels</a> 03:12, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Shoudn't Mel Gibson have at least an asterisk next to his name like sport players do when their achievments are tainted in some fashion, like steroids? To say Mel Gibson is a bigot when intoxicated is not quite fair when placed up against the others in the Famous Bigots list that had their views espoused while of clear mind.68.62.156.237 17:39, 10 March 2007 (UTC) Phinehas from the Attack Machine forum.</p>

<li>The list of famous bigots may be topical, but could potentially cause the page to be very messy. lets be frank: the list could potentially be thousands of names long. I have removed it. If there must be a List of famous bigots, i suggest making a new page, and keeping it separate from the actual definition of bigotry. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeatonjr_6ccc.html" title="User:Deatonjr">Deatonjr</a> 22:41, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
