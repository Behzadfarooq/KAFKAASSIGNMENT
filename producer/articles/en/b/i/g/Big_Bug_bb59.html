<p>XANA launches an attack on the Internet itself, managing to disable much of the city's infrastructure. Though most of the problems caused can be bypassed by manual controls, two trains that are completely automatic, one of which is carrying a cargo of highly toxic chemicals, are put on a collision course.</p>

<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>The episode begins at <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html" title="Kadic Junior High School">Kadic Junior High School</a> where <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Tamiya_Diop" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Tamiya</a> is bragging to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Milly_Solovieff" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Milly</a> about her fashion style. She stops talking and they start staring at <a href="../../../u/l/r/Ulrich_Stern_94b0.html" title="Ulrich Stern">Ulrich</a> as he walks by with his friends. The two immediately begin an excited chat concerning Ulrich's great looks. <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Delmas_1152.html" title="Elisabeth Delmas">Sissi</a>, overhearing the conversation, walks up to them and tells them that they are setting their sights too high and adds that they are too young. Milly retorts, asking Sissi just why Ulrich would come running to her just because she's a few years older and a <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snob.html" title="Snob">snob</a>. Sissi responds, saying that every boy in school wants to go out with her . <a href="../../../y/u/m/Yumi_Ishiyama_c57b.html" title="Yumi Ishiyama">Yumi</a>, <a href="../../../o/d/d/Odd_Della_Robbia_49ea.html" title="Odd Della Robbia">Odd</a>, and Ulrich walk over and Odd makes a derogatory comment about Sissi, who asks Ulrich when he'll admit his feelings for her. Ulrich tells her that he's just allergic to anyone who's stuck up. Odd tells Milly and Tamiya that Sissi is irresistible to boys, considering the losers she hangs out with. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Nicolas_Poliakoff" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Nicolas</a> gets ready for a fight, but Sissi tells him to back down. Ulrich says Sissi should be a dog trainer with those command skills. Defeated, Sissi and her gang retreat. Odd, reminded by the "dog trainer" comment, leaves to feed <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Kiwi" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Kiwi</a>.</p>
<p>Ulrich and Odd beeline for their dorm room. Yumi walks into <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremie_Belpois_ebe7.html" title="Jeremie Belpois">Jeremie's</a> room to find him typing on the computer. He tells Yumi that he's working on a non-natural disaster alarm, which ranks disasters on a scale of 1-10. He adds that he hopes to distribute the alarm to various media outlets, including websites. He would be automatically notified of a disaster of level 5 or higher, in which case, it could be a XANA attack. Yumi then asks Jeremie if he thinks Ulrich likes Sissi. Jeremie asks if she's kidding, noting that Yumi is jealous. In Odd's dorm room, Odd is feeding Kiwi as Ulrich lies down on his bed. Ulrich suggests they pull a prank on Sissi using Kiwi, catching Odd's attention. Sissi gets a text message on her cell phone which tells her to go to the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Garden_Shed" title="Kadic Junior High School">Garden Shed</a>. She believes it's from Ulrich.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are numerous disruptions throughout the national communications network. State establishments and ordinary citizens are reporting numerous technical problems with aircraft, traffic lights and trains. In a railroad coordination center, reports come in that all track switchover points aren't working and that two automated freight trains are on a collision course. An employee states that Trains 3611 and 9432 will collide in 26 minutes, and that Train 3611 is carrying toxic chemicals.</p>
<p>In his room, Jeremie completes his detection program, and immediately a window pops up on his computer. It is a live news feed in which <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Ellen" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Ellen</a> says major computer virus has just infected all of the nation's computer systems, disrupting communications, bank transactions, subways and air traffic control. The newsanchor also states the most dangerous incident is a likely train crash. The camera then switches to field reporter <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#John_Swamp" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">John Swamp</a>. He states that one of the trains is carrying toxic chemicals. In the event of a collision, an unprecedented environmental disaster would ensue once the chemical vapor escapes into the atmosphere. Swamp then adds that local authorities are considering a mass-evacuation of the city and its metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Jeremie tells Yumi to round up the others while he gets down to the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory_%28Code_Lyoko%29_6884.html" title="Factory (Code Lyoko)">Factory</a>. Outside, Odd and Ulrich are hiding in the bushes near the Garden Shed as Sissi walks there. The boys' cell phones vibrate, the caller being Yumi. They shut off their cell phones to continue with the prank. Yumi wonders why she can't get through to them. Sissi walks into the Garden Shed, expecting to find Ulrich, but instead, Kiwi runs at her, knocks her down, and licks her. Odd and Ulrich step out of the bushes, and laugh at her, harping on the "irresistible" joke. Kiwi walks back to Odd's room alone. Sissi mentions a school rule, which strictly forbids pets on campus. Jeremie runs over to the Factory, where he contacts <a href="../../../a/e/l/Aelita_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7a7c.html" title="Aelita (Code Lyoko)">Aelita</a>. Aelita tells him she will look around <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html" title="Lyoko">Lyoko</a> for an activated <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_%28Code_Lyoko%29_4ce5.html" title="Tower (Code Lyoko)">Tower</a>. Yumi peers into Odd and Ulrich's room, but she doesn't see anyone so she leaves. Moments later, Sissi follows Kiwi back to Odd's room as the dog goes to sleep in an open drawer. She slams the drawer shut with the intent of getting back at Odd. Yumi finds Odd and Ulrich sitting on a bench and scolds them. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Moral%C3%A9s_017c.html" title="Jim MoralÃ©s">Jim</a> comes to them, holding Odd's dog, and drags Odd to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Jean-Pierre_Delmas" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">principal's</a> office for having a pet on campus. Sissi gives a smug look as she walks by them. Yumi then takes Ulrich to the Factory.</p>
<p>In the Lab, Jeremie is watching a news update. Ellen says the trains are still on a collision course. There is massive gridlock caused traffic jams on the arteries of the major city nearby. The municipal and national police forces are inundated with calls for help, and looting is rampant as security alarms aren't working.</p>
<p>Aelita tells Jeremie that she senses pulsations in the <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html#Desert" title="Lyoko">Desert Sector</a>. Yumi and Ulrich arrive at the Factory and prepare for <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scanner_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7363.html#Virtualization" title="Scanner (Code Lyoko)">virtualization</a>. Jim leads Odd into the Study Hall along with Kiwi. Odd asks if he really has to stay here. Jim says those were the principal's orders and he has to stay here until his parents come and take the dog.</p>
<p>Yumi and Ulrich appear in the Desert Sector, near Aelita.</p>
<p>Jim is taking a nap when Odd gets a text message: S.O.S. XANA. However, he accidentally wakes up Jim, and tries to make an excuse to get out, saying Kiwi needs to defecate. Jim doesn't buy it though, and goes back to sleep. Odd then whispers to Kiwi, asking him if he wants a biscuit. Kiwi starts barking, waking up Jim again. Odd tells Jim that Kiwi really needs to defecate, but Jim says that he will personally take the dog out, while Odd stays put. He then walks out the door with Kiwi.</p>
<p>On Lyoko, four <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Bloks" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Bloks</a> appear and attack the three. Yumi and Aelita run off to the jagged rocks near the activated Tower, while Ulrich fights the Bloks. With Triplication, he destroys one, but two of the clones are destroyed.</p>
<p>Outside, Jim has Kiwi on a leash, telling the dog to hurry up as Kiwi circles a tree. When Kiwi doesn't relieve himself, Jim drags the dog back into the Study Hall. When he opens the door, he finds Odd gone and a window opened. Just then, Kiwi decides to urinate on the floor. Outside, Odd makes his way to the Factory. There, Jeremie tells him that there are 8 minutes left before the trains collide. He then tells Odd to get to Lyoko.</p>
<p>In the Desert Sector, Ulrich destroys two more Bloks, but the last one devirtualizes him with a freeze ray. The Blok then aims at Yumi and Aelita, who start running into the field of jagged rocks.</p>
<p>In the Lab, Jeremie virtualizes Odd into Lyoko. The Blok catches up to Yumi and Aelita. Yumi uses her Telekinesis to drop a rock slab on the last Blok, destroying it. Unfortunately, she is devirtualized by a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Megatank" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Megatank</a>. Aelita continues to run toward the Tower, but the Megatank is keeping up. She calls up Creativity to generate a fissure, separating her from the monster. The Megatank rolls over the fissure and fires at Aelita. Odd comes in and jumps in the path of the laser, taking the hit. With only 50 life points left, he destroys the Megatank with a Laser Arrow. Aelita deactivates the Tower, causing the trains to stop on an overpass, inches from each other. Jeremie then activates a <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel_%28Code_Lyoko%29_dd59.html" title="Time travel (Code Lyoko)">time reversion</a>.</p>
<p>Back in the past, Sissi walks towards the Garden Shed, believing Ulrich is there. When she opens the door, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Herv.C3.A9_Pichon" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">HervÃ©</a> runs at her and jumps on her. HervÃ© pronounces his love for Sissi and tries to kiss her, as he is on top of her. At that moment, a camera in the bushes flashes. Sissi tosses HervÃ© aside, who also got a text message telling him to go to the Garden Shed. As Sissi yells at HervÃ©, Yumi, Odd, Jeremie, and Ulrich watch from the bushes. They decide the picture will go to Milly and Tamiya's newspaper. As HervÃ© follows a disgusted Sissi, Yumi says,"That's really such a shame. We've just seen the beginning and the end of a beautiful romance." Everyone laughs, but Yumi and Ulrich stop and look at each other.</p>

<li>At the end of the episode, HervÃ©'s glasses don't have frames at their edges to place on his ears in order for them to stay in place.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When Odd got hit by the Megatank, he wasn't devirtualized. Any other time the gang gets hit they're devirtualized no matter how many lifepoints they have. (This is because in Season 1, Megatanks deal only 50 damage, while in Season 2, they deal 100.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aelita, Ulrich, and Yumi all get hit by lasers. Then when Jeremie's screen is seen a few seconds later, the warriors all still have 100 points.</li>
</ul>

<li>When Jeremie uploads Ulrich and Yumi, the cards for all of the characters go in reverse, but when he uploads Odd, it goes back to normal.</li>
