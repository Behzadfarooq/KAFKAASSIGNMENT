This fact is now known as <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubble%27s_law.html" title="Hubble's law">Hubble's law</a> (see <i>Edwin Hubble: Mariner of the Nebulae</i> by Edward Christianson).

<p>Hubble concluded that his observed log N(m) distribution showed a large departure from Euclidean geometry, provided that the effect of redshifts on the apparent magnitudes was calculated as if the redshifts were due to a real expansion. A different correction is required if no motion exists, the redshifts then being due to an unknown cause. Hubble believed that his count data gave a more reasonable result concerning spatial curvature if the redshift correction was made assuming no recession. To the very end of his writings he maintained this position, favouring (or at the very least keeping open) the model where no true expansion exists, and therefore that the redshift "represents a hitherto unrecognized principle of nature". This viewpoint is emphasized (a) in The Realm of the Nebulae, (b) in his reply (Hubble 1937a) to the criticisms of the 1936 papers by Eddington and by McVittie, and (c) in his 1937 Rhodes Lectures published as The Observational Approach to Cosmology (Hubble 1937b). It also persists in his last published scientific paper which is an account of his Darwin Lecture (Hubble 1953).</p>

<dd>That doesn't make this article erroneous, only misleading. A qualifyer like "(but not to Hubble)", with a footnote, may be appropriate. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 10:12, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li>A.Bellamy 15 March: But contrary to Harald88's non-standard logic, if Tommysun is right and Hubble did not believe in recession or expansion, then surely on any normal logic the Wikipedia article's claim that Hubble "discovered that, relative to the earth, the galaxies are receding in every direction at speeds directly proportional to their distance from the earth" is FALSE, and thereby ERRONEOUS on this point on the normal meaning of 'erroneous' i.e. FALSE. Such a significant falsehood about scientific discovery surely cannot be dismissed in a footnote. The interesting issue then becomes that of who first put this theoretical construction on Hubble's data and when it became generally accepted. As a matter of related interest, in a kind of half-way house position in his 1930 bestseller 'The Mysterious Universe', Sir James Jeans accepted Hubble's data as indicating recession and an expanding universe, but also accepted Zwecky's 'tired-light' hypothesis, whereby he maintained the observed red-shift was due to a combination of tired-light and recession. This was in order to conclude a much slower expansion and thus older universe than otherwise if the red-shift was wholly due to recession, and thus to remove the contradiction between the accepted age of the Sun being greater than the supposed 'observationally supported' <i>age of the universe</i> (i.e. the estimated <i>age of the expansion</i>), and hence to avoid this refutation of the then expanding universe theory. In general of course the BBT (i.e. BB theory of the age of the expansion) was initially falsified by observationally supported facts of the age of various components of the universe being greater than that of the expansion. Was Hubble himself maybe chary of expansion for such reasons&#160;?</li>

<p>Historical = Pertaining to History</p>
<p>The big bang theory pertains to the history of the evolution of the universe. That means it pertains to a history, thus making it a historical theory (but actually it is more than one historical theory since there are variations of the Big Bang theory, but the general concept is the same). Problems such as origin of the universe are solved by taking known current facts and deducing the past from them using a form of critical reasoning. The same is true with crime scene investigation. Make no mistake, the various timelines of the Big Bang itself proves that it is attributed to historical theories.</p>
<p><a name="A_question" id="A_question"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">A question</span></h2>
<p>Did the Big Bang actually make the space of the universe? I do not think that is possible&#160;:\. I was thinking there could always have been an unlimited amount of space, but the big bang just spread out the matter of the universe. After a while, all the matter from the universe could get pulled into one spot because of gravity and create anoher big bang. Is there a theory for that?</p>

<p>Howdy all. I just read this AP article: <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/03/16/national/a110240S02.DTL" class="external text" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/03/16/national/a110240S02.DTL" rel="nofollow">Evidence for Universe Expansion Found</a> at SFGate.com. While it is very interesting, I'm having trouble understanding how the "marble-sized" Universe could suddenly expand to "a volume larger than all of observable space in less than a trillion-trillionth of a second." This would seem to be faster than the speed of light. How is that possible, even in the early Universe? Did the speed of light become fixed at a later time?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">center of the universe</span></h2>
<p>Does the universe have a center point? If it evolved from a speck of some very small dimensions, that speck must have had a center, but if the universe of today has no center, where did it go?</p>
<p>And if the speck was finite, how cold some consider today that the universe is infinite?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Observed vs. inferred velocities</span></h2>
<p>There isn't a clear distinction between inference and observation in the case of the Hubble flow. In fact, the recessional velocities are actually artifacts of the expansion of space, so to claim that they exist at all is problematic. However, their inference is equally problematic from this regard. What we should do rather is make it clear that this analysis was based on observation and falsifiable theory development. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 08:45, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The question of universal irregularity</span></h2>
<p>The Big Bang is now accepted widely in scientific circles. We believe that all the known and unknown universe originated from a very small and very dense ball of extremely hot matter, which expanded in all directions at enormous speed. We cannot be sure of the original size of this fiery ball. I think some scientists refer to it as a "singularity", much the same as the centre of a black hole. If a singularity is a point of infinite density and is also infinitely small, then I see a problem with the obvious irregularity and random nature of the universe, even going back to very early times, when the first conglomerations began to take shape. The problem is this: If the universe expanded from a point source of zero dimensions, then in my view it would have had to expand in a perfectly uniform and regular way, and could not have given rise to the highly chaotic and random universe that we see all around us today. However, if the size of the singularity is anything other than infinitely small, then the seeds of all this randomness and irregularity that we now see were contained in that original small fiery ball.- goddlediddles 22 March 2006</p>

But according to the big bang theory, the history of cosmos began 13.7 billion years ago marked by an explosion. If so, the cosmos must have expanded at some stage with a speed greater than the speed of light so as to achieve its current dimension, but this obviously sounds absurd to the ear of anyone who knows the basic laws of physics.

<dd>Space can expand faster than light without violating relativity because a vacuum contains no information transfer mechanism (information must transmit through the vacuum). Hawking radiation isn't precisely information traveling faster than light (which violates special relativity) -- instead it is a consequence of quantum tunneling.

<dd>As I understand it, the "standard model" of cosmology (aka classical cosmology) is the cosmology associated with matter domination (omega_matter &gt; 0), where flatness was not assumed (omega_k &gt;= 0), and dark energy was ignored (omega_lambda = 0). This was replaced in the mid-nineties with the <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lambda-CDM_model_0d54.html" title="Lambda-CDM model">Lambda-CDM model</a> which is the current "model" where omega_lambda + omega_matter = 1 and omega_k = 0. This is different from the Big Bang which doesn't distinguish between particulars. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 05:32, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Big bang and Planck density</span></h2>
<p>Could somebody please explain how these fit together? How can a "singularity" be more dense than Planck density? Is it the assumption that natural constants do not exist in a singularity? What is the evidence for such an assumption? (Oddy 07:21, 1 May 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>The big bang is predicted to be a singularity if one models it solely using the equations of General Relativity. As you've noticed, quantum mechanical effects are expected to become significant as density approaches the Planck density, or as temperature approaches the Planck temperature, or as spacetime curvature becomes more severe than a specific value relating to Planck's constant. The four forces are also expected to unify under these conditions, further complicating the model. For these reasons, the Big Bang model is only considered valid after a certain point in time (often assumed to be the Planck Epoch, but possibly later depending on how unification works). The evolution of the universe prior to that time is unknown (we don't yet have models of how physics works that would apply under the conditions expected to be present). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 21:23, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, Christopher. Means to me that the universe started as an "object" of Planck density once the Planck epoch ended. Assuming that the mass (=energy) of the universe remained constant, since, what was the "diameter" of that object? Why did it expand considering the huge gravitational force applying? Oddy 09:21, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The size of the universe at Planck density could have been just about anything. In the simplest GR-based model, it was (and is now) infinite, being zero only at time zero. In practice, observations can only place a lower bound on the size of the (observable and non-observable) universe, based on the fact that if it was less than a certain size before <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_inflation.html" title="Cosmic inflation">cosmic inflation</a>, the ability of distant parts to interact with each other would have left a detectable imprint on the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_microwave_background.html" title="Cosmic microwave background">cosmic microwave background</a>. To the best of my knowledge, the estimated size of the universe today based on CMB observations is "anywhere from 150 billion light-years to infinite", but a) I could easily be misremembering the exact figure quoted and b) the results of that particular paper were not verified by other papers, so it can't be considered a verified, accepted value. To backtrack to the size when it was at Planck density, if you assume that it has a finite, known size today, you still have to make assumptions about the nature of the force that caused inflation, so you'll get varying answers. Short answer is "we don't know, and won't until we have a much better understanding of the mechanism underlying cosmic inflation".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Be advised that the model of when the universe approached the Planck density is derived mostly using GR, which means it isn't trustworthy, as we expect gravity to behave in a modified manner at those energies, and don't presently have a good model of how it would behave.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for why the universe expanded, the short answer is "because it was energetically and entropically favourable for it to do so". See <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_inflation.html" title="Cosmic inflation">cosmic inflation</a> for details. The idea is that, in the early life of the universe, a field existed in it that exerted a very extreme repulsive force. The repulsive <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_energy.html" title="Dark energy">dark energy</a> observed today may or may not be a vestige of this type of effect. We don't know what causes either of these. We have several models of possibilities, but they'll only be verified when we can either directly examine systems with energies in the scale where these fields become important (i.e. in a really powerful particle accelerator), or when observations of the universe rule out all but one variant of <a href="../../../m/-/t/M-theory.html" title="M-theory">M-theory</a> or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_gravity.html" title="Quantum gravity">quantum gravity</a> or what-have-you, and produce additional support of whatever the remaining model is, pinning down the form of a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_everything.html" title="Theory of everything">theory of everything</a> which would let us make predictions at higher energies than we can directly examine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Right now, you appear to be applying lower-energy models to this situation, and will of course get contradictory results (the models aren't accurate when applied to the Planck regime). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 06:04, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but if space(time) did not exist as such before the Big Bang, it would be correct to say that not only was it "enormously dense" but infinitly dense (and therefor infinitly hot?). --<a href="../../../f/b/d/User%7EFbd_0d90.html" title="User:Fbd">Friðrik Bragi Dýrfjörð</a> 13:44, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As Thomas mentioned above and I agree: "The evolution of the universe prior to that time (the end of the Planck epoch) is unknown". Indeed, we never will know and it would be a waste of time to speculate about. The universe cannot have become "real", i.e. subject to the laws of physics, before the Planck epoch was over. Assuming it had a "density" exceeding the Planck density before and during the Planck epoch (natural constants not applying, therefore), it must have "expanded" to an object of Planck density when "entering real life". That leads to the question I raised earlier: Why did it, as an object of Planck density, expand further? Temperature can't be the driving force because a "real life object" cannot be more "hot" than Planck temperature.Oddy 21:04, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Read about <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_inflation.html" title="Cosmic inflation">cosmic inflation</a> and particular the false vacuum associated with the inflaton field. There are a number of suggestions for why expansion happened in the first place but one is that the universe "rolled" down the potential and others include such suggestions as the universe "tunneled" into being with the expansion intact. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 21:06, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly disagree about us "never knowing" what happened at or before the Planck epoch.

<p>The discussion slipped away from the aspect of looking into the implications of Planck density on what happened around the big bang. Having followed the advice of Science Apologist and read along the hyperlinks I ultimately ended up again and again with terms like hypotheses, speculation, do-not-know etc. So, my intent still is to look to things that are pretty well known, here the Planck density defined by the natural constants. You inevitably get to Planck density if you track the universe back in time. Forward in time it is believed to expand, i.e. becomes less dense. Hence backward in time it was more dense. Going backward far enough it therefore must have been an object of Planck density. Going back further to an object with "supra-Planck density" means that the natural constants no longer apply. As we never will know which constants applied instead (if at all) we never will really know what was going on in the Planck epoch or before. Hence, "reality" started when the Planck epoch was over and there was an object of Planck density. The question then is: do the properties of an object of Planck density allow to happen what we believe has happened later? Please focus your response to this aspect. Oddy 03:13, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps you meant that would be a good question for a scientific paper. Several Wikipedia policies agree that Wikipedia expects its editors to present mainstream opinions and sufficiently notable minority opinions, not to decide which opinion is true. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 03:41, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You make several statements here that I don't think are logically supported. Specifically:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Your statement that the universe inevitably reaches even Planck density as one tracks backward in time isn't accepted as fact. The prediction is based on expressing the universe's expansion in terms of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a>, and so will break down at the point at which GR ceases to be an accurate model. While our current <i>best guess</i> is that this occurs somewhere near Planck temperature and/or density, there are other possibilities (the most notable recent one was the idea that extra dimensions in string theory may not be curled down to the Planck radius, which would lower the energy at which gravity unifies with the other forces to something closer to the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Unified_Theory_ab03.html" title="Grand Unified Theory">GUT</a> scale). Experimental tests of this particular hypothesis have been performed, though they were only able to rule out a small range of the options. Whenever a GUT-energy collider is built, it'll similarly narrow down options, so this is an area of testable research, not philosophical handwaving.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Your statement that backwards in time from the Planck density, the universe must have been more dense, is emphatically <b>not</b> accepted as fact. It only looks that way if you're using GR to model the universe, and you're explicitly in a region where GR ceases to be a useful model. We'll only be able to make useful predictions when we have a model that applies to systems that approach the Planck density. People have tried to look at this situation (and others in the same domain, like black hole collapse) using things like string theory, but enough assumptions have to be made (with our present incomplete understanding of physics in that regime) that varying answers are obtained. Wait until we have an experimentally-tested model of string theory or quantum gravity before expecting any kind of authoritative answer.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Your statement that in a system with "supra-Planck density", natural constants don't apply, seems to have been pulled out of thin air. A more correct statement would be to say that the idea of a "system with density greater than Planck density" isn't compatible with our present, incomplete, models of physics. If we have a system where our models predict this kind of situation, it doesn't mean the universe breaks down - it means the tool we're using to _model_ the universe breaks down. Wait for better tools to be discovered and verified.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Your conclusion that "reality started when the Planck epoch is over" is not supported by your evidence, for reasons explained above. The actual situation is that our models of reality are only accurate for times substantially after the Planck epoch.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Your question "do the properties of a Planck object allow (X)" cannot be answered with present physics, for the reason repeatedly stated above. We do not (yet) have an accurate model of how a system with Planck density behaves.</li>
</ul>
