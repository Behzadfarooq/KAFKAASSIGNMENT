<p>Hi BigHaz. Many thanks for offering me your help. I’ll probably work on the geographic distribution of Georgian dialects.

<dd>I wouldn't go using the word "pundit", just because it comes from the Indian languages in which you aren't fluent (and keep getting pestered about&#160;:P). So far so good with ye olde admin-ness. Is there a special kind of template I can add to people's pages which says "I've deleted your nn-bio", rather than the bog-standard "a tag has been placed on your nn-bio"?

<dd>Congradulations on your Adminship, to which I was happy to provide my support. Recently, I've gone through about 600 biographies as part of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Biography_Assessment_Assessment_Drive_16c6.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography/Assessment/Assessment Drive">biography assessment drive</a> that I helped put together. For those biographical topics that have not been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject and of each other, I took a more detaied look. If the article further stood out among those lacking published work references and it seem unlikely that published work references probably were not available, I place a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} template on some of them, giving the failure to satisfy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> as the reason. My hope was to prod those interested in the topic to improve the article to address the concerns given as a reason for the proposed deletion. I've received two responses. The first editor <a href="../../../j/r/e/User_talk%7EJreferee_6e45.html#Easy_with_the_Prods" title="User talk:Jreferee">provided some helpful suggestions on using prods</a> and a second editor oddly took the issue to AfD. I've modified my PRODing based on the first editor's helpful suggestions and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Yves_Pouliquen_5e32.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Yves Pouliquen">provided my reasoning</a> to the second editor as part of the AfD. I looked on your talk page, but saw no mention of the recent prodding. Would you be so kind as to tell me how you came across this issue? Thanks. -- <a href="../../../j/r/e/User%7EJreferee_f448.html" title="User:Jreferee">Jreferee</a> 16:00, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>You have just speedy deleted my article for non-notability whilst I was still in the process of stating my reasons for non deletion on the talk page, even though I clearly stated that the article was a work in progress and also added a hangon to the page.

I see you have not been an admin for very long - perhaps I can persuade you not to be quite so enthusiastic with your trigger finger!

<dd>For the record, I had read the article before I deleted it, and I deemed the band non-notable per the information provided at the time. The re-created version of the article was also listed at CSD, although I'm unsure what became of it (I didn't touch it, as there were in fact arguments being made about the notability of the band in question). At best, I'd say this is really a line-ball decision. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:47, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wasn't complaining that you hadn't read the original article, just that you hadn't allowed me any time to complete it properly. I was merely asking that you read the rewrite before deleting it again - unfortunately someone else decided to ignore the discussion and delete it anyway. Is there an award on offer for being the quickest speedy deleter?

<dd>I was drooling over you being able to read Arabic script&#160;:D A feat I've never managed yet, although at some point in time I could read Tibetan with no prob (although I didn't necessarily know how to pronounce anything correctly!). Have you yet been to the Netherlands? It's rather weird to see how easy it is to understand Dutch when it's spoken, if you don't concentrate. But if I have to read it, it's not that easy!&#160;:D -<a href="../../../y/u/p/User%7EYupik_05db.html" title="User:Yupik">Yupik</a> 12:33, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Never been to the Netherlands when I was conscious (my parents took me there as an 18-month-old on a big trip, but it doesn't count for present purposes). If you're after a quick primer on the Arabic alphabet, try to get your hands on Awde and Samano's <i>The Arabic Script</i> (or a title like that). It should be a small, dirt-cheap paperback which looks like it won't teach you anything at all, but it works like whoa. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 13:35, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'll definitely have to look for that book. I have on by Ayyad called Teach Yourself Arabic and it just never did it for me. My first contact with Dutch by the way was when my brother and I tried to learn it to annoy my mother, who knew German&#160;:D And if you ever saw my house, you'd never leave (you'd get lost in all the language books&#160;;)). One of my fav people in the world was Gerald M. Browne, who wrote most of the stuff on <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Nubian_b2cf.html" title="Old Nubian">Old Nubian</a> that exists and a lot on Coptic. Class with him was a blast. He must have known 20+ languages and was a real character. In the middle of teaching us something about Old Nubian, he would experience some revelation about its grammar so comments like "This is just like in Classical Tibetan!" were rather commonplace. And he was the reason I ended up learning to translate Tibetan texts into English&#160;:D -<a href="../../../y/u/p/User%7EYupik_05db.html" title="User:Yupik">Yupik</a> 18:31, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tagging anything's a tedious task, particularly when you realise that you've just written a series of articles that need tags.
