<p>Bout time you showed up around here. I see you've been picking up the pace of editing recently. These days there are plenty of admins, so the requirements are subtly higher than they use to be. Mainly you should do things that admins do, on a consistent basis and in a friendly manner. (by this I mean, janitor tasks like counter vandalism, and/or more boring stuff like categorizing, AfD's and other <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_backlog_317c.html" title="Category:Wikipedia backlog">backlogs</a>) Also invest yourself in some content disputes to understand and apply Wikipolicy in moving an article and discussion forward. Finally, don't seek adminship. If you've done these things for a few months; this not only increases your edit count but shows your commitment to Wikipedia; and someone will nominate you and/or you'll find adminship isn't a big deal.</p>

<p>Wow, that lady's bound and determined to get her linkspam inserted into as many articles as possible (check out her other "contributions"). Apparently she's on a mission from GOD as well.&#160;:) She just kept working away, ignoring my warnings, one edit after another -- so I'm glad you turned up to lend a hand.</p>

<p>Hi I am timeoutmom.com. I do have to say in my defense that I honestly did not know it was not allowed for me to to contribute to articles such as the christianity one and then put myself down as a reference in that one since I have information about local christian conferences specifically for moms. Also, I do have an informational page regarding toddler time-outs and present these at local parenting groups and conferences and submit articles to parenting web-sites and have time-out resources - recommended reading and of course the time-out animals. I do apologize for upsetting the Wikipedia World. I obviously wasn't trying to hide anything or be secretive since i signed up with a log on as my web-site name. So, sorry i did not know i was violating your community. I received several <b>NASTY</b> and rude e-mails which is distressing to me. It would have been better for your community to have an e-mail that is more friendly and education focused - since that is the gist of this web-site. Example: "Hello&#160;! Welcome to Wikipedia. We are glad you have joined our community. However, it has come to our attention that you are doing X (fill in the blank) and that this is something not allowed on Wikipedia. So, we did X (fill in the blank). Please go to X (fill in pages to go to) for more education and understanding about this site. If you have any questions, you may e-mail X (insert name)." So, this is something to consider before you start sending mean e-mails and bashing people. Think to yourself "Are you being helpful or harmful/hurtful?" I would categorize the e-mails/notifications I received as hurtful and mean and they simply could have been HELPFUL and educational. So, in your Wikipedia mission that you are on - consider that in your future communications and think about being INCLUSIVE.</p>

<p>Hey Big Brother 1984, Regarding your test1 sent to the above account (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:194.80.32.8&amp;diff=104211780&amp;oldid=103172423" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:194.80.32.8&amp;diff=104211780&amp;oldid=103172423" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), I was just wondering if you sent an email to abuse AT lancaster.ac.uk as I noted in the talk page? Their servers send XFF information, so they can actually find the specific user responsible for the vandalism. Since they discussed with me in an attempt to get me to reverse a six month anon-only block I laid on this IP address, they naturally would like to find these guys and discipline them rather than risk another block.</p>
<p>If you haven't sent an email, I'll be happy to send one instead (I've already established some dialogue with one of their sysadmins, so I can make sure this one gets investigated).</p>

<dl>
<dd>It's less my patience and more the result some off-wiki negotiations I held with a sysadmin. They pointed out the XFF and the fact that their abuse department should be contacted, and I undid a six month block I made in return (although personally, I'd rather just leave the IP blocked for six months so we don't have to waste time cleaning up vandalism). Thanks for letting me know, I'll send an email if someone else also lets me know that they didn't send an email. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 17:59, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. When using a user warning template, could you please specify which page you are mad at me about? It's hard to know what you think I did wrong when you don't say. You can add the page you think I vandalized to the template like this: {{test4-n | examplepage}}. Also, user warning templates should be substituted onto pages, not put there as template. You can subsitute templates like this: {{subst:test4-n}}. Thanks for your input. --24.235.229.208 20:29, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This warning is not an error. If you click the diff it will be clear that your edit added the text "fuck u" with the edit summary "(Revert vandalism by 61.88.131.154)" 61.88.131.154 removed that text, and you added it back. That is subtle vandalism, but hopefully unintentional.

<p><br />
This is an excerpt from Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments#Keep. It represents my beliefs on why verifiable articles about educational institutions should be retained on Wikipedia, regardless of their shape or size.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>1. m:eventualism</li>
<li>2. Schools are important public institutions and should probably be written about somewhere, even when they cannot sustain an article on their own.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>2. a. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is difficult to delete them, even though many think these articles are too trivial for Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>2. b. Rather than striving for an elusive consensus to delete a given school article, some feel it is always preferable and usually takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. The article itself should be replaced by a redirect. (note: this particular argument for merges is not supported by all who favor keeping school articles, see #Merge and #Don't Merge).</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>3. Those who advocate the deletion of schools sometimes use an argument to the effect that a school that doesn't have some special attribute--apart from being an institution of learning--has no identity and shouldn't be in Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>3. a. This is a case of special pleading; there is no Wikipedia policy *requirement that corresponds to this, it's just an ad hoc condition constructed to justify opposition to school articles.</li>
<li>3. b. Each school is different from every other school--a look at the latest school report card or HMI inspection report of any school should be enough to establish this truism. Someone who looks up the Oratory School would not want to see a link to the report card for Mount Tabor High School, and by providing readers with a way of finding out about individual schools, including what independent or government inspectors have to say about their teaching standards, Wikipedia performs a useful encyclopedic function.</li>
<li>3. c. Schools are not donut shops, traffic lights, or telephone books, they're where we spend a large proportion of our waking lives, where we learn to be adults, gain skills and make friends. They play a large part in determining what kind of society we have. Schools are also community gathering points, where many students and former students can share common experiences and knowledge - a central theme to Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>4. It is argued that wikipedia is a general encyclopedia, and that school articles only serve a narrow, local audience. However, Wikipedia is not paper and can afford to serve all audiences of reasonable size. Instead of removing material, technical means can be found to make general topics more prominent to researchers, such as rating more obscure pages "of little general interest" and demoting them in search results.</li>
<li>5. Schools are an excellent entry point for new Wikipedians. In reviewing their contributions, we can educate and inform them about third party verifiability and NPOV as they help build the common knowledge base. A good experience collaboratively editing something "close to home" will encourage long term involvement in a positive way.</li>
<li>6. It has been said that school articles are not maintainable because, for instance, every time a school headmaster or principal changes it should be edited to accommodate the change. There are two counters with that argument:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>6. a. the historical view</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>From the historical view, that fact about a headmaster's appointment can be recorded as a historical detail: "In 1961 Jeff Smith was appointed head of Portnoy Boys". A later editor may add that in 1971 Jeff Smith retired and Veronica Spice replaced him. In any case this is verifiable information about the school (school head appointments are public information) and also has historical value.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>6. b. the rejection of a trivial argument.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>From the point of view of the rejection of trivial argument, the question of who is and is not the head of a school is a fact without which the school article can survive. If maintaining current staff information were considered to be problematic, the pragmatic solution of removing information about current staff solves the problem without removing other information about the school, including (in most countries) links to public sources of information about schools which go back years or even decades and give extremely detailed public information about the school and its performance relative to national expectations and to other schools in the district, region, and country. And, of course, information about who was the head teacher at the time of the inspection.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>6. c. Wikipedia's editors are its readers.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>We attract readers only if we provide something of interest to them. Readers become and remain editors, only if we allow them to improve and create articles of importantance and of interest to them and others. Wikipedia is often more up to date than other encyclopedia's with far fewer articles, precisely because we're so open to growth (which means a larger number of active editors). Keeping every school article doesn't mean instantly making one for every school today, so the editor count can grow with the growth of the article count. The fact there are 6 billion people in the world doesn't make it hard to maintain school articles, it means we have that many more people to recruit editors from, if and only if we provide good encyclopedic content they are interested in. Those who are interested in editing schools are as likely as anybody else to help out in other areas of Wikipedia.</p>
<ul>
<li>7. Jimbo Wales said people should relax and accommodate those who write high school articles, as long as they're not mass-inserting a ton of one line stubs. [1]</li>
<li>8. There are multitudes of US city articles which could be said to be "trivial" , and one may say: 'well those cities usually have more people in them than a school'. Yet, Perth, Towner County, North Dakota, for example, only has a population of 13 people. So why include small cities over schools?</li>
<li>9. The determination of schools accepted and not should be consistent across the board.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi, I reverted the edits you have done to the state terrorism SriLanka article for several reasons..</p>
<ul>
<li>You have quoted from an extremely pro-LTTE site..genocide of tamils, is a site full of ,what we call crap.And wikipedia don' need crap,do we&#160;??</li>
<li>you have removed the statement made by the forensic experts..I add it back</li>
<li>Legal procedure in SL is not smooth..Its very complex and takes a lot of time to proceed a case..It was the same here..</li>
<li>And till 1995 this area was under control of LTTE. so we don't even know the founded bodies were caused by army..it could well be the LTTE too..</li>
<li>GOSL started investigations in 1999..If you want I can show you the news-paper</li>

<dd>without addressing a single issue i have raised here , you have reverted the article back to your POV ... please once again read points I have raised here..</dd>

<p>Forensic team have clearly reached a unanimous decision <b>that there are no such graves as originally alleged by the convicted prisoner Somaratne Rajapakse and others convicted of the Krishanthy Kumaraswamy rape and murder case</b> <b>..And why would you delete that&#160;??

Do you expect the GOSL to file charges against ,accused in a week or two&#160;?? And thanks for taking an general interest on my contributions..Yes,as a SriLankan I'm genuinely interested at my country,and having seeing a lot of POV targeted against my country, I decided to spend more time to make things look more neutral.. finally ,no one is whitewashing this..Why would anyone do such a thing, when the whole thing did not exist at all&#160;!! doesn't make sense at all,does it&#160;? Unless you an come up with proofs, that so called 600 plus missing people ended up in the chemmani grave, there is absolutely no point discussing this matter with you.anyway thanks for the interest taken on this issue.--<a href="../../../i/w/a/User%7EIwazaki_0652.html" title="User:Iwazaki">Iwazaki</a> 03:04, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I noticed on the HoC article talk page you seem really itching to talk about this historicity of Jesus. Now I have ducked this, basically because (as I have said) I don't think it matters what we think on the matter, hence there is no point for debate, only discussing secondary sources. But I think that, even though this is the right approach, I still feel a little odd slinking away from the matter. So I thought I'd come here and give an oppertunity for you to tell me just what all it is you think on the matter, if you wish. If you don't, then that's fine.

For example, there are now two independent mentions of Iceland observing DST, and two references to Johnston's Daily Telegraph article. In both cases, the new "DST all year round" section is inferior to the text that already existed in the previous version.</p>
<p>The daylight saving page is not the right place to catalog many jurisdictions that observe DST year round: one example should suffice and Iceland is a good candidate since it is about 1.5 hours ahead of local mean time. The right place for a more extensive catalog is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_around_the_world" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_around_the_world" rel="nofollow">Daylight saving time around the world</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the claim that there were more road deaths of school children is merely a vague "recollection" of Johnston that contradicts the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.

<dd>I'm not the author of the article. I'm an admin going through the speedy deletions and this one just doesn't qualify.

<p>Take your own advice and chillax for a day or two. I've been in your situation before, where being right, or at least partially right makes you just want to fix things quickly; and being unable to do that on a Wiki which is designed to be quick and offer immediate gratification can be frustrating.</p>
<p>From my initial read this situation escalated because you re-added copyvio material. Now were some new pages monitors/admins overzealous, sure, but you initiated the copyvio; they were simply doing clean up work. The entire situation could have been avoided if someone, anyone, simply stubified the article with original writing. An article will come of this eventually. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 02:25, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
