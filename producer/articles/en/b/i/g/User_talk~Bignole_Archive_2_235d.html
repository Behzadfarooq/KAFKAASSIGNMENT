<p>I confess I am a Wiki newbie, so I'm hoping you'll clarify your edit summary on <a href="../../../j/a/s/Friday_the_13th_Part_VI%7E_Jason_Lives_1742.html" title="Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives">Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives</a>. I stumbed across this article and thought I'd try to take out the POV - it's not a movie I care much about, so I figured I was neutral. To me, the only clear POV was in the critical and fan response section, though I agree with you that the whole article could use a re-write. I figured it was OK to remove the tag because I didn't see any real discussion on the POV issue. Seems to me that the article calls for a "needs re-write" tag, if such a thing exists, more than a NPOV tag. Please let me know if there is some larger Wiki protocal that I should know.--<a href="../../../q/b/a/User%7EQball6_6cc5.html" title="User:Qball6">Qball6</a> 22:31, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry I ain't replied to your message, been busy. The <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiProjectHorror" class="extiw" title="wiki:WikiProjectHorror">Horror Wikiproject</a> really is mostly based around horror movies and fiction. '<b><a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_%28movie%29.html" title="Halloween (movie)">Halloween</a>'</b> the 1978 movie's article is a good example of what a decent horror article can be. Just don't help them trivia sections grow, but add info into the body of article. Help however you can, even if really minor or really major.

<dd><b>Because they are fan edited, all you have to do is register.</b> That's not true at all. I'm not sure where you're getting that. BOM is the most reputable boxoffice site on the web. You said The-numbers.com lists their sources, but I just looked at profiles of some other films and they do no such thing. It's interesting: they have <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Scanner_Darkly_%28film%29_acb6.html" title="A Scanner Darkly (film)">A Scanner Darkly</a></i> budget listed as $20m, but Linklater himself said it was only $6m. They have <i><a href="../../../x/2/_/X2_%28film%29.html" title="X2 (film)">X2</a></i> budget listed at $125m, when it's actually only $110m. They have <i><a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Harbor_%28film%29_b157.html" title="Pearl Harbor (film)">Pearl Harbor</a></i> at least $10m too high. And they too have budgets listed for films not out yet (<i><a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_3_8aa2.html" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformers_%282007_film%29.html" title="Transformers (2007 film)">Transformers</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../b/e/o/Beowulf_%282007_film%29.html" title="Beowulf (2007 film)">Beowulf</a></i>) <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrumbsucker_df4f.html" title="User:Crumbsucker">Crumbsucker</a> 17:28, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>BOM.com and The-numbers both rely on fan information to be provided to them.</b> That's not true at all. BOM's provides info from direct studio sources, and occasionally trade and newspapers for budgets. They are the most reputable box office website and its creator is regularly quoted in mainstream newspapers. The-numbers.com is just an amateur site. They are apples and oranges. If the Numbers.com guy says <i><a href="../../../v/a/r/Variety_%28magazine%29.html" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> (a film industry trade paper) gave a budget of $450 million for the two Pirates sequels, it's more than likely that it is the correct budget. <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hollywood_Reporter_1f3b.html" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> (another film industry trade paper) reported this figure as well.<a href="http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/va/20060717/115312222300.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/va/20060717/115312222300.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> As for <i>Superman Returns</i>, the budget that BOM gives includes prior pay or play money from <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_Lives_1c11.html" title="Superman Lives">Superman Lives</a></i> and money Warner got back from tax credits. That is the explanation <i>Variety</i> gives at the end of this article on Warner's <i><a href="../../../p/o/s/Poseidon_%28film%29.html" title="Poseidon (film)">Poseidon</a></i>.<a href="http://stage.variety.com/article/VR1117943708?categoryid=1019&amp;cs=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://stage.variety.com/article/VR1117943708?categoryid=1019&amp;cs=1" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrumbsucker_df4f.html" title="User:Crumbsucker">Crumbsucker</a> 05:04, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, if you look at the histories, you have that backwards. What happened was, I think, everyone became a bit too..."excited"—feh. arguably not great news, but I digress—and someone moved it to "The Dark Night". Then someone just copied and pasted the contents to what was already a somewhat biased redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dark_Knight_Returns_30ae.html" title="The Dark Knight Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>. In the end, that GIPU probably had the most sense of all. He mentions Batman, both books and the new movie. Then someone else changed the movie title to "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dark_Knight_%28film%29_7d0d.html" title="The Dark Knight (film)">The Dark Knight (film)</a>" as it should be. Thus, it all worked out. Now the only possible probably problem is that the title "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dark_Night_0947.html" title="The Dark Night">The Dark Night</a>" redirects to this movie.

<dd>No worries, I've had my share of mess-ups, too. I was the one who tried to copy the article from Untitled Batman Begins sequel to The Dark Knight (which already existed as a redirect). Obviously, I found out that the history page needed to be moved with the article. It's obviously fixed now; it was hard to back off and let someone else revert my mistakes. There's still one issue with the article, though: the talk page leads to Talk:The Dark Knight instead of Talk:The Dark Knight (film). Any idea on how to fix this?

<p>I suppose I didn't think that the previous edit to the plot outline was accurate (not to mention sloppy), highlighting the symbiote as the villain, which contrasts Ziskin's statement. I mentioned the ambiguity because Spider-Man isn't a villain to himself without the influence of the symbiote. I put back in the fact that Spider-Man "himself" was a villain due to the symbiote's influence, so the plot outline seems to make sense now. Let me know if this is agreeable, and feel free to make any minor edits. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> 20:54, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your first comment had line breaks like this:</p>
<p><i>I don't think we need to be vague about the fourth villain, because Laura Ziskin has already stated that one will be Peter himself. The #5 reference goes to the interview where she says,</i></p>
<p><i>"And Ziskin promises one foe will be Spidey himself.</i></p>
<p><i>"He'll have to battle villains within," she says. "I love what we've done with this character."</i></p>
<p><i>We need something more than just "fourth villain". Bignole 20:27, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>Having had a look at the "season" pages which you have cited, I have decided not to change my vote - the list definately needs to be tidied up into a standard list of episodes, but not deleted because the "season" pages are really only episode summaries, rather than offering any additional information about directors, etc. <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob_Castle_7101.html" title="User talk:Bob Castle">talk</a></b></small> 18:08, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, I still think having a short list of episode summaries from all seasons on one page and in a table (albeit an untidy table at the moment) is potentially useful. I image what the list's creator is aiming towards is something like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stargate_SG-1_episodes_00dc.html" title="List of Stargate SG-1 episodes">List of Stargate SG-1 episodes</a>, which is a featured list. It might also be worth having a quick gaze at something like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Blackadder_episodes_3919.html" title="List of Blackadder episodes">List of Blackadder episodes</a> as well, for something which I consider to be a good list. <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob_Castle_7101.html" title="User talk:Bob Castle">talk</a></b></small> 18:36, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't particularly think that either should, or will, be deleted. As long as the list of episodes has very brief summaries of episodes, then it poses no problem for the season pages, as these are clearly designed to be longer, more detailed descriptions. <b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBob_Castle_6920.html" title="User:Bob Castle">Bob</a></b> <small><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBob_Castle_7101.html" title="User talk:Bob Castle">talk</a></b></small> 18:53, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Bignole. I'm not sure what your proposal to keep both is but I'd like to know. Could you give me a link? As long as the list page and the individual episode pages are kept I'll be happy.

<dd>I don't mind if the DVD info is merged with the main Smallville page, merged because they don't contain the exact same info. I definitely think the summaries need major changes so they are NPOV and not just teasers. I tried to move the first few summaries towards this. It's true the season pages need a lot of work. A lot of info on the list page isn't in the season pages, mostly writer and director. Wikia is sorely lacking in bunch of its episode pages as well. I disagree that the episode pages are destined to be deleted. My prediction is that the list page will win out, just because of all the other pages like it. Because of this, I think effort should be put into the list page as it's the one that will stick. It's following the same format as the featured list of article pages, so I think that's what wikipedians prefer. Again, I'm sorry for the premature redirect but I really think that's going to be the ultimate result. As far as fancruft being added to the episode pages; we must remain vigilint but any Smallville page is going to have that issue. That's not a reason to delete a page. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 02:13, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The DVD box says the type of format but maybe that's not important. I just added it becuase I wanted to make sure that every bit of info in the season pages was contained in the list page, anticipating it becoming a redirect. The reason the Simpsons page is just a list is because there are so many episodes. You'll note that each Simpsons episode has its own page. As far as linking to the season pages from the list page I don't think it's a good idea, it's not flexible. Stacking the episodes one on top of another creates a lot of formatting problems. Some episodes have 3 or 4 writers and others just one. Some episodes may have several notable guest appearances and others 0 or 1. What if you want to add the production code as I've been doing? Unless you add it to all entries at once it will look strange. With individual pages you can add at your leisure. I don't find it easier to edit the long season pages. You may be able to edit just a subsection if your edit is that kind, but if you have to edit the whole page it takes a bunch of scrolling and can be difficult. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 02:37, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Since you think the list page can stay could you remove the Afd tag? We should probably archive it and link to it from the top of the list page. I also think our talk page discussions are of value and could be put on the list page's talk page. I won't go copying and pasting your words but if you agree you have my permission to copy and paste what I said as well. If the discussion is now "are the individual episode pages kosher" we should probably discuss that next. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 03:05, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I guess I just disagree. Most list of episode pages have individual episode pages for popular shows and I don't think Smallville should be any different. I'm sorry if you think this is not a good reason but I think it is. We should create a discussion to find consensus. If the consensus is get rid of them I won't fight it. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 03:21, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>hi Bignole,</p>
<p>my assumption would be to use the same tags as if it was a stationary image that we are dealing with. So if it was created by someone who has not died since 70 years + lifetime, the work is probabably copyrighted. however if you created it yourself, choose a tag that you find suitable. Maybe if you could provide me a link I could take a look in order to help you more specifically. with kind regards <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 13:39, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I took a look at the image. I would say it would still be covered by the regulations concerning screenshots, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot#Copyright_issues" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot#Copyright_issues" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. IMO the clip is so short, it might as well be just a screenshot. Agreeably this case is not very clear, but lack of any other tags I would still go with the screenshot copyrighted tag, it comes closest to it. I am sure others would disagree with me. <a href="../../../g/r/y/User%7EGryffindor_3473.html" title="User:Gryffindor"><font color="red">Gryffindor</font></a> 21:17, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You definitely have my sympathy about this weirdness over the <i>Smallville</i> character basis. Normally, when I see two people fighting on and on about something like the wording of a single sentence, I'd just call them both nuts. But you're right. I cannot fathom why KenA goes on and on about something he doesn't have a quote to support. He wants to insert a sentence that just isn't accurate because the Siegels haven't said what he wants to say they've said. If he ever comes up with a legitimate quote otherwise, he wins, and that's fine because we'd know the article was accurate. Anyway, it's the weirdest squabble I've seen in Wikipedia, because it boils down to fighting over a single sentence, as little as a single word. Good luck with this. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 16:44, 11 September 2006 (UTC) P.S. And I'd say that our own earlier little disagreement (see above) about the wording of a sentence in that same article, which you and I quickly figured out how to fix, illustrates that I'm definitely a third party to the dispute with KenA. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 16:48, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't give it to me, reference it in the article. I was merely stating that you should put citations next to your work on the page. I didn't plan on rushing to delete anything. But, you should be aware that there are many editors for that article, and some may think that it's inclusion is not necessary and delete it on principle, regardless of cites. To be on the safe side, I would hurry and cite the music to at least give it some foundation, it will be easier to fight for on a talk page if you can prove that it's noted in other places. To do a proper reference place "&lt; ref &gt;" at the beginning of your internet link and "&lt; /ref &gt;" (except don't put the spaces in there, I only did that so you could view it) at the end of the internet link.

You can read all about it on his talkpage now that you have restored the content. To reiterate, the talk that was relevant was kept at <a href="../../../m/o/d/Talk%7EModern_geocentrism_3e58.html" title="Talk:Modern geocentrism">Talk:Modern geocentrism</a>. This is why it is in line with talk page guidelines. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 02:20, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>That you cannot remove warnings from your talk page is stated on the article at <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemoving_warnings_48c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Removing warnings">Wikipedia:Removing warnings</a> but the page itself says it no longer applies since it is out of date! <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a></p>

<p>An administrator told me that you are right warnings should not be removed when currently relevant. Out of date ones however can be removed. After all there is the history page specifically designed for archival. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a></p>
<p>The removal of out of date warnings was, the administrators suggested, to be done by the user not an administrator.<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a></p>

<p>Yes, they can be removed, but you should read that the user in question should never be the one to remove them. You should contact another administrator to remove them. They should assess the situation and note the dates of the warnings and your conduct since them. The fact that a week has passed is not valid enough to warrant removal of all warnings. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a></p>

<dd>Well, since your first warnings (for 3RR) was August 10, I think you should find out what a relative time frame is best appropriate before removing. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 15:08, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe you should check that, I was told by the administrator that I had to wait for the end of the issue that had arisen and that I, not an administrator, should remove them.<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a></p>

<p>Yes, I was originally going to do it that way to save the history from being so long but found it easier to edit each individually rather than scroll through the whole list in one edit. Thanks for the comment, though: I didn't think of vandalism. I'll certainly consider your suggestion, if I make any other multiple additions for Smallville seasons in the future. Unfortunately, I didn't see your comment until I was already finished season 5.

<p>I don't know if you know, but Freddy did reside at 1428... cause it's in The Final Nightmare. Someone even linked a screenshot from nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com to the Freddy Krueger page that proves it. Sorry dude. --The Skunk 10:30, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Everytime i edit something latley you keep going back and changing it. I'd like to know why and I'd like it to stop because it's starting to frustrate me. I'd like an explination, thank you</p>
