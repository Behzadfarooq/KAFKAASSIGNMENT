<p>Wikipedia had two problems: Catholics want to use it as propaganda tool. And Evangelicals are harassed in every article on religion.

<dd>Catholics want to use it as a propaganda tool. So do atheists. So do <a href="../../../p/e/t/PETA_7157.html" title="PETA">PETA</a> people. So do born again Christians. But the whole thing is that Wikipedia ISN'T a propaganda tool. Articles should present the issues in an unbiased fashion. My reverts to your articles were because you replaced content with your opinion. Wikipedia is not a place for original research. It may be that your views on spiritual warfare are right - I don't know - to be perfectly honest, I didn't take the time to read the whole thing. But the problem is that you replaced a well-written article that had a ton of sources with an unsourced opinion piece. In another article - <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Brethren_5b1b.html" title="Plymouth Brethren">Plymouth Brethren</a>, you copied and pasted content from brethrenonline.org. Neither of those actions are acceptable. This has nothing whatsoever to do with theology. If you want to contribute, by all means do so, but articles need to be written from a neutral point of view and need to be sourced. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:01, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No! nobody in a southern baptist church post garbage as "free distribution of bibles by protestants led to PROFANE uses from Bible". And you call it a neutral point of view?. What book from southern baptist theology you has ever reads?. I`m a baptist. your catholic proselytism using wikipedia will be reported to jimbo wales.

<p>Sorry, I'm staring at that page because the user (and now an IP most likely that user as well)_ is removing the AfD tag, and I've been reverting the vandalism too often.

<p>Hi, I just saw you big collection of 'saved' religious userboxes from the collection. I've working on implementing <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_German_solution_3a25.html" title="Wikipedia:The German solution">Wikipedia:The German solution</a> as mentioned/praised by Jimbo, i.e. migrating userboxes out of templatespace into userspace while keeping them as pseudo-templates there. (look at my userboxpage to see what I mean). This would allow users to decide whether to just transclude the boxes or to subst them (personally I find C&amp;Ping the code a bit clunky). Would you be willing to help me in that effort? Also, may I link to your userbox collection (feel free to link to mine)? Best wishes (click the X). <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharonX_e9a8.html" title="User:CharonX">Charon</a><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharonX_Userboxes__8e0a.html" title="User:CharonX/Userboxes/"><font color="black"><b>X</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharonX_e660.html" title="User talk:CharonX"><font color="green">talk</font></a> 12:05, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would strongly suggest making subst the default (heck, regardless, it should be the default in the current library - that takes one of the biggest pieces of ammunition away from the anti-UBX side - namely, the argument that they can be used for vote stacking - and it keeps administrators from being able to vandalize user pages by vandalizing a single template like they did with <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristian_3dad.html" title="User:Christian">User:Christian</a> in the now-deleted history). By making subst the default, you keep people who don't really know any better from getting confused when they see changes.</dd>
<dd>Feel free to link to my page</dd>
<dd>As far as the copy process itself, it could quickly and easily be done with a bot. I don't know that there's any reason for manually copying code. I'd wait on mass copying, though, until the policy is finished. Otherwise the effort may just need to be repeated again when the final new home for the userboxes is decided on. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 12:23, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As for my vote on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Gotchi_e540.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gotchi">AFD</a>, I fully explained myself there. The article is essentially a vanity article. It falsely claims that the term was coined in 2006.

<dd>Even if I do that (which, actually, has already been done), that isn't goint to stop the issue. One way or another, the issue needs to be finally settled. Either the German Solution needs to be adopted, it needs to be firmly established what T1/2 mean, or there has to be a unanimous agreement that out-of-process deletions stop.

<dd>It's happening by what authority? People have been copying userboxes to user space for a while. There's nothing stopping that from happening. But without a magic wand being waved (vote, directive from Jimbo, whatever), by what authority will it be enforced? By what authority will we not go through deletion, DRV, etc, forever? By what authority will it be ensured that the deletion wars aren't just going to move to userspace? The moment some of the die-hards decide they don't like Christian boxes in user space, they'll start deleting them there, too. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 08:47, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Authority? What kind of place do you think this is? When I saw "No new policy is needed to do this, and this is not a policy proposal. Just go ahead and do it," written at the top of the page, I thought "finally, someone gets it!" It's just a matter of people using user space versions of the boxes and stopping with the recreating them in template space. There are already people from both sides of the controversy supporting the German solution.</dd>
<dd>Still, I won't entirely blow off your request for authority - look at <a href="../../../j/o/u/WP%7EJOU_d366.html#No_new_namespace.2C_userboxes_OK_in_userspace" title="WP:JOU">WP:JOU#No new namespace, userboxes OK in userspace</a>. Just two days ago, Ashley Y added the March 17 bit from <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerInParadise_01a3.html" title="User talk:StrangerInParadise">User talk:StrangerInParadise</a>. Jimbo very clearly says that POV userboxes are ok in user space. Tony has said that he doesn't oppose the German solution in principle, but is waiting to see what it looks like in practice. If there ends up being a lot of vote-stacking or otherwise POV warrioring that seems to involve userboxes, then they probably won't stay safe, but I'm sure as hell willing to work with userbox people to make this solution work. The answer is probably for the keepers of userboxes to apply some level of judgement, and not allow abuse. Anyone so hard-line that they don't accept userboxes even in user space is going beyond what Jimbo said, and will face friction because of that. Jimbo's word carries a lot of weight here; you may have noticed. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 09:00, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>number one: There was citations,links and sources(books and newspapers,and many web documents) in article on Bible Society,telling on Catholic persecution against Colporteures in that countries.

<dl>
<dd>With all due respect, the issue is your understanding of the English language. You are seeing Catholic bias in articles where there is none. The reason I have reverted most of your edits is because there are severe problems with spelling, formatting, grammar, or bias.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example, in your changes to <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Brethren_5b1b.html" title="Plymouth Brethren">Plymouth Brethren</a>, you have created two copies of the article. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plymouth_Brethren&amp;oldid=56714346" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plymouth_Brethren&amp;oldid=56714346" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> for your version of the article.) When this gets reverted, it isn't going to have anything to do with Catholicism - it's because the edit is unusable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, a number of links that you create are incorrect. To create a link to a Wikipedia article, use double brackets. For example:</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>[[Christianity]]</b> creates a link to the article <b><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a></b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Use a pipe (shift + \ on American keyboards) to give an alternate title for the article. For example:</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>[[Christianity|This is Christianity]]</b> creates a link to the same article, but instead has the label <b><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">This is Christianity</a></b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Use one bracket for external internet links. For example:</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>[http://www.christianity.com]</b> creates a link to the external website <a href="http://www.christianity.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christianity.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>To provide an alternate name for the article, use a space:</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>[http://www.christianity.com A website called "Christianity"]</b> creates a link to the the same website, but with the text <b><a href="http://www.christianity.com" class="external text" title="http://www.christianity.com" rel="nofollow">A website called "Christianity"</a></b></p>

<dd>In many cases, you have created links that do not display properly. I have corrected them where possible or deleted them where I did not consider them to be appropriate.</dd>

<p>Hello Big DT writes me please!. Your edition from Plymouth Brethren had following errors: closed are no a recent division from exclusives. closed are very different to exclusives. Even publish a cassette/book displaying Exclusive teachings and rebuking it as hereticals. closed NEVER had chosen an universal leadership. closed and open brethren are NO identical to open and closed communion plymouth brethren. By example El Salvador plymouth brethren are closed and open communion. Plymouth brethren in Venezuela are closed and closed communion. Plymouth brethren in mexico are open and closed communion. Plymouth brethren in switzerland are closed and closed communion but no related to closed p b in venezuela.

<p>Hey, thanks for reading what I wrote and changing your vote - I think WCityMike has gone overboard in his deletion listings today. Every film article he's nominated *is* notable in the community, even if *he* isn't aware of it.

<ul>
<li>I'm sure he didn't mean anything by it ... it's probably something along the lines of he saw one and then went right down the list and nominated all of them without taking the time to check and see how notable they are. Honestly, before tonight, I had never heard of any of them other than New Voages. But I've just barely gotten over the debacle that is B&amp;B + Coto and I haven't really looked at anything Star Trek related in a while. It just floors me how they took the greatest franchise in the world and ruined it. Heck, the writing on the Hidden Frontier episode I watched tonight was better than some of their trash. But anyway ... B&amp;B rants aside, now that I know there are other Star Trek fan movies out there, I may have to take a look at some of them. So at least something good has come from this. &#160;;) <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:29, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Why did you change the Vigil template back?

<li>I didn't revert it back - I proposed a third alternative. The original text was "This member is a Vigil Brother in the Order of the Arrow". Rlvese's rewording was "This user has the Vigil Honor in the Order of the Arrow." I changed it to "This user is a Vigil Honor member of the Order of the Arrow." This preserves Rlvese's "Vigil Honor" instead of "Vigil Brother" and "this user" instead of "this member", but was an alternative to the weird-sounding "has the". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 21:16, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>My Spanish doesn't go much beyond "buenos dias" and "Necesito ir al la baño" (basically the first day of Spanish class - I switched to Latin ... I'm fluent in Latin). I took a look at the link using Altavista. Please keep in mind that these computer translations are not very good. They give you the general topic, but words are out of order and the thought is lost. Words get translated differently than you plan. For example, "stop", "halt", "don't go", "pause", "stay here", etc all mean the same thing. But that gets lost in the translation. I couldn't find "closed brethren" or "exclusive brethren" in the article or anything that would help me to understand the differences. I'm sure it's a very good paper in Spanish - but I don't understand Spanish and computerized translation just isn't that spectacular. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 02:08, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello Big DT writes me please!. You can't find terms "closed" "exclusives" "open" and "plymouth brethren"- by the way this last term is even offensive for some brethren assemblies,the article must to be called brethren assemblies if you want a neutral point of view-. Your use from latin,only demonstrates you are very catholic or ecumenical prone,a class from Charles Colson southern baptist. I have find tonns from false info. on baptists in wikipedia,you no respond to it,but you are concerned only with articles affecting catholicism. Why?. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/1/User%7E201.208.220.134.html" title="User:201.208.220.134">201.208.220.134</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_201.208.220.134_7bab.html" title="Special:Contributions/201.208.220.134">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<ol>
<li>The very article we are discussing - <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_Brethren_5b1b.html" title="Plymouth Brethren">Plymouth Brethren</a> - has nothing to do with Catholicism. I actually have NO interest in writing about Catholic subjects. Again, as I have said before, none of this is an issue of content. Rather, it is a language barrier. You may be interested to know that there is a Spanish wikipedia - <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org" class="external free" title="http://es.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org</a> . You could contribute on there and learn how Wikipedia works. Right now, some of your edits here just problems and there is a language problem with me explaining the issues. I believe that most of the bias you are seeing doesn't really exist.</li>
<li>Plenty of people learn the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> language for reasons other than Catholicism. To say that knowing Latin makes me Catholic is patently silly. Besides, even if there somehow were something wrong with learning <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, when I was taking Latin classes, I was an agnostic. I was saved my second year of college.</li>
<li>You said that the article you linked would explain to me the differences between "Closed" and "Exclusive" Brethren. If I am not going to find the terms "Closed" and "Exclusive" in the article, how is it going to help me understand the difference?</li>

<p>1) HELP!- This article is so past my knowledge that I don't know how to fix it. I figured I'd find a member of the Christianity project to take a look at it. Its only lucky that I happened to find a fellow Virginian. It also helps that you are a Protestant and therefore more knowledgable about presumably Protestant eschatology (sp).</p>
<p>2) The article seems to be posted by a reverend of some (unknown) denomination, but the tone doesn't seem particularly mainstream, although that could just be his choice and style of words.</p>
<p>3) The article makes no pretension of being NPOV and is clearly meant to be a document for both potential converts and current followers of "x" denomination. I'm going to therefore post a NPOV tag on it, as appropriate. I don't think wikipedia is the place to find converts or to post sermons.</p>
<p>4) I suspect the text is a copyright violation stolen from a religous tract, but I'm not sure</p>
<p>5) I've heard of the "5 Crowns," but only in passing, so your help would be apperciated.</p>
<p>6) Thanks for you time. I'm just a little overwhelmed here.</p>

<p>Here's one solution for you if you use IE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you have the "Links" toolbar displayed. If you do not, right-click on the toolbar and hit "links"</li>
<li>From the "Favorites" menu, choose "Add to Favorites", click the "Create in" button to display the folder list and choose "Links". Name your new item "Add tildes".</li>
<li>You will see "Add tildes" appear on your "Links bar". Right-click on it and choose "Properties".</li>
<li>In the URL box, add this code: javascript:void(insertTags('~~~~','',''))</li>
<li>Click ok, answer yes to any warning.</li>
<li>Now, clicking on that button will add your signature in Wikipedia.</li>

<p>Thanks for reviewing the image licensing issues on the Utah-BYU rivalry page. I uploaded most of those images without much thought to the licensing rules, thinking that proper citation would be sufficient. I am curious as to the reasoning behind your tagging the following image for deletion:</p>
<p>Image:SITyDetmer.jpg</p>
<p>It seems to me that this is a proper use of a copyrighted image. Please show me where I'm wrong. Thanks.--<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECincyUte_38fd.html" title="User:CincyUte">CincyUte</a> 01:07, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The fair use criterion {{<a href="../../../m/a/g/Template%7EMagazinecover_03ec.html" title="Template:Magazinecover">Magazinecover</a>}} says that publication covers may be used "to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question". The fifth item under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Counterexamples" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use#Counterexamples</a> names as an example of what is NOT fair use, "A photo from a press agency (e.g. Reuters, AP), not so famous as to be iconic, to illustrate an article on the subject of the photo." This image is being used to illustrate Ty Detmer, not to illustrate SI, and thus it does not qualify for what is considered fair use on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 01:10, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello BigDT, thanks for notifying me about the listing of this image for deletion, and also for your follow-up message. I have removed the image from the two user pages, and also checked on the usage in all the other articles. It seems to me that we are on very firm footing to use a single frame image (1/30th of a second) from a broadcast that lasts much longer than that (3 hours I think) on any article dealing with the subject matter shown. Also, the image is degraded by virtue of being a photograph of a TV set. The image is used for educational purposes and there is no possible way that the photo could be interferring with the commercial rights of the copyright holder. I think removing the image completely would be a mis-step. If there are any further actions I can take to ensure that the picture is used appropriately in each of these remaining articles, I stand ready to do what is needed. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 13:54, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would suggest perhaps (1) reducing the resolution to 400x300 or something on that order to make it a "web resolution" screenshot as called for in {{<a href="../../../t/v/-/Template%7ETv-screenshot_6e4d.html" title="Template:Tv-screenshot">tv-screenshot</a>}}. You may even want to go so far as to delete the larger version so that someone doesn't revert to it. (2) Remove the image at least from <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trophy.html" title="Trophy">trophy</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/v/Bevo_%28mascot%29.html" title="Bevo (mascot)">Bevo (mascot)</a>, where it unambiguously is just illustrating the subject of the broadcast, rather than the broadcast itself. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi BigDT, thanks for your suggestions. I agree with you that the connection to <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trophy.html" title="Trophy">trophy</a> is small. Perhaps if we had an article on this specific trophy, but we don't, so I'll remove it. Could you please take another look at <a href="../../../b/e/v/Bevo_%28mascot%29.html" title="Bevo (mascot)">Bevo (mascot)</a>? The image is used there in the "public appearances" section and mentions the fact that it is the current Bevo - which we don't have another photo of. If we can agree on these changes and if I replace the image with a smaller one, would that address your concerns sufficiently for you to remove your listing at Images for Deletion?

<dd>Thanks! It's not working yet. Did you select the "enable" check box further down the page? You may also have to authenticate it first - wikipedia will send you an e-mail to click on. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 16:51, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It was checked ... but somehow, my email address itself had been blanked ... I'm not sure why it let me check enable email without supplying an address. Go figure. Anyway, I have supplied my email address, confirmed it, and re-checked the button. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 16:54, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I thank you for the kind words. However, given that users with more time and edits than I have are frequently turned opposed largely on the basis of time and edit count, I don't know that there would be much point in going through the process at this point in time. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 19:15, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
