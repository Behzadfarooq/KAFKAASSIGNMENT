<li>Uploaded a few... I can't get any for the housemates that are already gone as far as I can see. Also, I'm not sure I'll get a decent picture of Lea - they're all getting ready for the eviction and she *may* be gone by the time I get back in later. The live feeds seem to focus less on some members of the household, that's why I haven't got one for all of them so far. They're not always that flattering either. <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelardore_3570.html" title="User:Celardore">Celardore</a> 16:51, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>To make things clear, the 'black' logo should be used, for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is better quality image, for technical reasons.</li>
<li>Both logos are correct. Saying "It's not black" is incorrect.</li>
<li>No need to fix what isn't broken.</li>
<li>The black one is more widely used on wikipedia.</li>
<li>The white one has been uploaded by a known troublemaker trying to get his way.</li>
<li>The black and gold colours are more widely used - look at the screenshot on this page and the diary room colour scheme for examples.</li>
<li>The white background is used on the C4 website for purely design reasons, and they have always used white backgrounds.</li>

<p>True, however on this site, do you prefer to be referred to as <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox">FireFox</a> or your name on your birth certificate?

<p>Sam consistently presents as female and wishes to be referred to as such, therefore there is no debate.

<dd>It would in no circumstances be correct to refer to Sam as a "she" in this article - because it is <b>not true</b>. If <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, for example, wanted us to call him "Danny B", are you saying we would refer to him as Danny B in articles? Because we would not.

<p>To "avoid confusion", why don't you EXPLAIN the situation, and not just put down what YOU think is right? Can I point you to the wikipedia page about <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Edna_49ef.html" title="Dame Edna">Dame Edna</a> please? And if you believe in putting everything that Channel 4's (highly edited) page says, why don't we just scrap the whole BB7 page and just put one big link to there?</p>
<dl>
<dd>What about <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Edna_49ef.html" title="Dame Edna">Dame Edna</a>? Dame Edna is a <b>character</b>, not a real person. Therefore we are going to refer to Dame Edna as whatever gender (she) is portrayed as, <b>as her character</b>, regardless of who "plays her". Sam is a real person, he isn't played by anybody, he isn't a character, so your referral to the page "<a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Edna_49ef.html" title="Dame Edna">Dame Edna</a>" is highly irrelevant. — <i><b>FireFox <sup><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><span style="color:black">user</span></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:black">talk</span></a></sub></b></i> 10:23, 01 June '06</dd>

<dd>Hi Samantha and everyone. I put down my opinion yesterday morning as there seemed to be differing and strongly held views about this topic, and there is a good arguable case for either gender providing a proper explanation is given in the article. Might we have a quick (say 24hr) vote on if we should use he or she or s(he). I believe Sam is entitled to 'she', but if no-one else feels strongly enough to give their opinion then just leave as is--<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShojo_5998.html" title="User:Shojo">luke</a> 04:46, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Well, if we're going to do it in the true wikipedia way, this debate would be closed as "no consensus". So I'm closing it. Now. At no consensus. It stays as 'he' merely because every other transvestite on wikipedia is referred to as their actual sex (Note I said _sex_, and not _gender_).

<dd><u>comment</u> Little attempt was made to find common ground (consensus) on anyone's part. eg - Are Sam's wishes not to be characterized in terms of sexuality apart from as <i>Sam</i> (as she told Lea during the temping task early this morning) unreasonable/reasonable/silly etc. eg - what about the fact that Sam likes to meet gay men rather than str8 men when clubbing. Is Sam just trying to make a point?

<dd><i>Transgender people should be referred to using pronouns consistent with their current gender identification or gender presentation - for example, if a person lives as female and appears female, use female pronouns.</i></dd>

<dd>Sam wishes to present as female, so it seems we should use the appropriate pronoun in the absence of any consensus here to the contrary. This guideline seems fair to me, but are there any other "official" Wiki documents that deal with this issue. Or perhaps people feel that this guideline should be ignored in Sam's case.

<dd>I don't like that, it looks as if the different shades of red mean different things. I suggest a darker red for ejected/walked (or two different shades if you want), and the lighter shade for evicted. Same goes with the blue, I think just one shade is better. EDIT: Actually just had a second look, I don't understand why Lea, Richard and Susie are shaded a light blue. What's the significance of that?

<dd>Yeah, it does look a bit blue. When the person who I asked to put the colour code on the table, put the colour code on the table, the table was fine. It was as good as perfect. My next suggestion was going to be to ask for the colour key to be put in at the top and bottom of it, but certain people (no names) decided to totally ignore me when I tried to ask them about it. So because of that, other people have made, from my original idea, a bunch of pretty and confusing colours that now mean nothing to me. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small><sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font> 13:08, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All Big Brother shows are hardly the same. Changing the colours of the table would only beneficial for the BB7 UK article, as it has the nominations table. Other additions, such as who walked, and who was ejected, are not relevant to the BB AU article. I'm sure there's other things as well. But the point I'm trying to make is, if each country had its own template thing, it could be adjusted to better suit the article it's going to be used on. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small><sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font> 13:27, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just want to offer my opinion on the matter. When I looked at the table just now, I had to think for a few seconds to realise why three of the housemates were grey. Once the housemates who have been nominated are shaded blue, the "white, grey" pattern is eliminated, and just makes it confusing to understand what grey means unless you think about it. I haven't read any of this debate above, but that's just my 2¢ — <i><b><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><span style="color:#000000">Fire</span></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:#000000">Fox</span></a></b></i> 13:37, 21 June '06

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reason for exit in infobox</span></h2>
<p>In the infobox, on some of the housemates there is a reason of why they left (walked, ejected). This makes it wider than necessary, and cane be included in the section about each housemate. I think we should get rid of that bit from after the day number, and changed the legend from "Evicted" to "Left" or something. Something to think about, if it says why they left other than the normal way, shouldn't it say why someone entered other than the normal way? (Golden housemate, replacement for someone who walked.)

<p>In the lead it says "Shown on Channel 4 from 18 May 2006 to 18 August 2006". But this appears to be only counting the original 14 people. George has walked and not been replaced, making 13 weeks, Susie has been added making 14 again, and 5 more are coming in on Friday making it 19 weeks.

<dd>I don't think the number of housemates affects the length of the series. There's often a double eviction or two during the series. I don't think all 5 housemates of the secret house are going into the main house. And there's always more than two people in the house on the last day anyway. They're probably trying to pad out the numbers so that there's a good number of people left on the last day. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small><sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font> 18:05, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The 5 housemates entering the secret house will (quite certainly) not all enter the main house at all. My guess would be a couple or three of them will enter the main house, along with the 'transferee' returning. If the housemate numbers end up to night anyway then I am sure they will plan a midweek or double eviction. — <i><b><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><span style="color:#62AC65">Fire</span></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:#62AC65">Fox</span></a></b></i> 18:07, 27 June '06</dd>
