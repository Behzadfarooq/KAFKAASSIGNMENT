<h2><span class="mw-headline">Philosophical and religious interpretations: esoteric cosmologies</span></h2>
<p>Regarding the recent edition made into this part of the related section by <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a>:<br />
Please donnot change at your own discretion concepts that what you never heard or studied before. They were inserted into the text in the appropriate section and in a formal and neutral language. It would require for you some years to study the basics and more years to start understanding any of these esoteric cosmologies; in the same way as it takes some years for any of us to learn the basics of a future profession through an university degree and then it takes many more years of experience to develop the proficiency and skills that may turn each of us into a recognized master professional in the respective field.<br />
When you change or edit something without the specific knowledge, then you most probably currupt or distort the data, as it happened in this case, and misguide the readers who expect to be reading or studying a most accurate article in this current theme of the Big bang.<br />
The data about "esoteric cosmologies" was inserted with good will, in the most accurate and sintectic way to transmit to the reader the position according this mentioned field of human knowledge (scientific or not) about the theme of the article. It is perhaps from a minority, but still it represents the thought of this minority in societies around the world (against) the Big bang theory. If the majority here finds it inconveniente to have it here, then you should delete it all, instead of trying to reword it in order to support the position of the majority (as it was the case): it becames then an premeditated immoral action to fake concepts (distortion) in order to support our own position (does any true scientist, physicist, here do the same action-practice in order to find support to his/her experiments or theories? I think not, so please do have some consideration). Thank you. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriathus_59bc.html" title="User:Viriathus">Viriathus</a> 00:50, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With appreciation for your contributions to this article, the philosophical and religious interpretations are entirely peripheral to the subject of the Big Bang. The briefest of summaries is what is hoped for. If summaries cannot be made of the connection between emanationism and the Big Bang, then perhaps the suggestion that there are parallels between the two should be removed. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 00:55, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The emanationism, in esoteric cosmologies, refers to expansion of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plane_%28cosmology%29.html" title="Plane (cosmology)">spiritual worlds</a> till a material state of the universe is reached and not to an expansion of the physical-material universe itself as postuladed in the big bang theory: this was already stated in the original lines that you have "summarized":</p>
<dl>
<dd>" In <a href="../../../e/s/o/Esotericism.html" title="Esotericism">esoteric</a> cosmologies, including <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosicrucian.html" title="Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theosophy.html" title="Theosophy">Theosophical</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufism.html" title="Sufism">Sufi</a> and the <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> (related to the conception of "divine retraction", <a href="../../../t/z/i/Tzimtzum.html" title="Tzimtzum">tzimtzum</a>, as explained in the <a href="../../../z/o/h/Zohar.html" title="Zohar">Zohar</a>), expansion refers to the <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emanation.html" title="Emanation">emanation</a> or unfolding of steadily denser planes or spheres from the spiritual summit until the lowest and most material world is reached. The emanation is conceived to have been originated, at the dawn of the universe's manifestation, in The Supreme Being Who sent out - from the Absolute's "Chaos" beyond comprehension - the dynamic force of creative energy, as sound-vibration, "the Word", into the abyss of space (this dynamic force is being sent forth, through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit the universe). Then, at the midpoint of the evolutionary cycle, the reverse process begins: the lower worlds gradually dematerialize or etherealize and are infolded or indrawn into the higher worlds; the heavens are 'rolled together as a scroll' (Isaiah 34:4). Thus, outbreathing and inbreathing can refer to the expansion of the One into the many, and the subsequent reabsorption of the many into the One, not to any 'smeared-out singularity' and its subsequent physical expansion as postulated in the Big Bang theory. The most basic teachings of these esoteric cosmologies can be regarded as similar to the conception of a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steady_state_theory.html" title="Steady state theory">steady state</a> universe based in the <a href="../../../a/e/t/Aether.html" title="Aether">aether</a> medium, as postulated by the non-mainstream "Physics of Creation" (Aspden, Harold (2003), <i>The Physics of Creation</i>, PhD.

<p>If it is true that esoteric cosmologies are more comfortable with the falsified steady state theory, then such a summary belongs at <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steady_state_theory.html" title="Steady state theory">steady state theory</a>. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 01:12, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your words were "<i>If true, then bye-bye! There are plenty of religious ideas that conflict with the Big Bang. Place this on steady state if you like.</i>" . But you seem to forget that the mentioned section already states for a long time:
<dl>
<dd>"<b>Philosophical and religious interpretations</b>": (...) Some people believe that the Big Bang theory lends support to traditional views of creation as given in Genesis, for example, <i>while others believe that the Big Bang theory is inconsistent with such views</i>. "</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>But then, your excuse says it all: only what is seen as supporting your theory is valid here. What is seen as being against your theory is erradicated, regardless if those against are rooted on society perpectives (even if a minority) and/or if they present any references support (that may carry evidences). Well, if your action corresponds to the same criterium or method used by the current Science (Physics) that supports the Big bang theory, I am glad I am not an adherent of such theory. It is strange also how one editor, by its own, can take the decision of what should be included or not, when such an important article is faced with different perspectives about the theme it describes.

<dd>The differences between Milne’s concept of space-time and Einstein’s concept of space-time appear to run much deeper than is commonly appreciated. For instance the Standard Cosmological Model maintains the big bang was not actually an explosion, but simply the expansion of space. This is completely at odds with the cosmology of Milne which is represented exactly by an explosion of matter into space. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPervect_20ec.html" title="User:Pervect">Pervect</a> 18:44, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We could throw some other links in there too, like <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_creation_cosmology.html" title="Self creation cosmology">Self creation cosmology</a>. I'm not sure whether this approach would make people happy or more upset, though.

<dd>Milne's Model should probably be put in another header. Even if you don't regard it as legitimate, perhaps it should go under "Summarily dismissed models of historical interests" In fact, I don't consider Milne's model to be "beyond" the big bang, as it predates it, and it is in no way compatible with the FLRW metric, which all of the other models seem to have in common. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoolin_05fe.html" title="User:JDoolin">JDoolin</a></dd>

<dd>No, no, no. Perhaps I was unclear in my statement. In the "beyond" section, there should be listed those theories, which agree with standard big bang model predications (which agree with the observations), except for very early times, very late times or very far away. The Milne model doesn't qualify as it is in disagreement with observations. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 19:02, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This leaves "beyond the big bang" with only three entries:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/r/a/Brane_cosmology.html" title="Brane cosmology">brane cosmology</a>, subcategories brane inflation, <a href="../../../e/k/p/Ekpyrotic.html" title="Ekpyrotic">ekpyrotic</a>, <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclic_model.html" title="Cyclic model">Cyclic_model</a>, pre big bang, <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randall-Sundrum_model_c98a.html" title="Randall-Sundrum model">Randall-Sundrum_model</a> mentioned as subcategories</li>

<li><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaotic_inflation.html" title="Chaotic inflation">Chaotic_inflation</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The last two entries are just stubs, though. We can always hope someone will expand them, I suppose. <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclic_model.html" title="Cyclic model">Cyclic_model</a> is described currently as a sub-category of brane and would replace oscillatory which is also outdated. If there is a non-brane cyclic version around, it's not documented in the wikipedia that I could tell. If there is an article on a non-brane cyclic model, it should be linked here. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPervect_20ec.html" title="User:Pervect">Pervect</a> 20:26, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems reasonable to me to put <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milne_Model_ff89.html" title="Milne Model">Milne Model</a> in a list of "considered dead" models, as it appears to be considered dead. In my opinion, rumors of its death have been greatly exaggerated. I think it is a much stronger model than Friedmann's Solution to the Einstein Field Equations, and if it is allowed to be scrutinized in both its original format and this encyclopedia format, Milne's Model will eventually be recognized as the correct one.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the Standard Model is described on that page, I think different scientists have different conceptions of the universe, running the gamut between pure Milne Cosmology and pure Friedmann cosmology. Stephen Weinberg, for instance, in "Dreams of a Final Theory", says "It is misleading to say that the universe is expanding, because solar systems and galaxies are not expanding, and space itself is not expanding. The galaxies are rushing apart in the way that any cloud of particles will rush apart once they are set in motion away from each other."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I hope I have given some kind of start to an article on Milne's Model, and I would welcome other people to edit if they see I have made some factual error. I think I have described the Friedmann Metric and the Standard Model accurately. Pjacobi has mentioned that my comparison may be original research, and I only intended it to be common knowledge. I want to encourage experts to go and check whether my representation of the Standard Model is accurate, especially in light of Weinberg's opinions above. Is Weinberg in disagreement with the standard model or have I somehow misrepresented the Standard Model? The general consensus on Wikipedia seems to be contrary to Weinberg.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can say that my interpretation of Milne's Model is very different than that of Peebles. Peebles mentions that Milne introduced the phrase "Einstein's cosmological principle" for "the assumption that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic in the large scale average," and that "his attempt to base a complete world picture on this principle is no longer considered interesting." If anyone cares to read the book for themselves, they will see that Milne brought up "Einstein's cosmological principle" primarily to attack it, not to base a complete world picture on the principle.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also Peebles says "Milne considered the particle horizon an argument against relativistic cosmology." Whether Milne thought this or not is unclear from my reading, but the fact that the particle horizon had not been observed in 1933 may have had something to do with it. I would be embarassed too, if I had to publish a theory that predicted a continuous finite background radiation which was obviously not observed by experiment. Even if it were considered dead, Milne's model should have been resurrected when this background was discovered.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All I can say is that this book is out there in the libraries, "Relativity, Gravitation, and World Structure." Read it for yourselves. Don't take my word for it or Peebles, or Kragh's, or ScienceApologists, or anybody else's. Certainly, I may have incorporated my own thinking into the article, but I think the model has been unfairly treated by others, and just as people who think the current Big Bang theory is correct have written and maintain the article on the Big Bang, it seems fitting that other models are presented by people who believe they are correct.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Big Bang and an Infinite Universe</span></h2>
<p>Is the concept of an Infinite Universe at odds with the Big Bang? If so, how? (Simonapro 20:50, 28 August 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>The short version is, the universe having (potentially) infinite extent doesn't cause problems for the big bang. If you follow GR strictly, and ignore quantum gravity effects, you get an arbitrarily large universe still compacting to zero extent. If you take a more cautious view, and just roll things back to the point where quantum gravity effects would be expected to dominate, you end up with a situation where the newborn universe is infinite in extent, but any local part of it still expands vastly in the manner described by the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Attempts to measure the size of the universe by looking for artifacts that "wrapping" of space back onto itself would produce have been tried, but the results are inconclusive ("at least 150 billion light-years and maybe infinite", if I remember correctly). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 21:08, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What I am reading in the article is that <i>Hubble's law suggested that the universe was expanding, contradicting the infinite and unchanging static universe scenario developed by Einstein.</i> I think this statement is basically suggesting that the universe is not infinite? I understand that at some point there may have been an infinite universe, but what about now? (Simonapro 21:23, 28 August 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>The problem wasn't with an infinite universe - it was with an infinite universe where parts weren't moving (much) with respect to each other, that had been around forever. That would seem to inevitably result in several problems. The biggest visible one being that every line of sight would eventually end on the surface of a star, making the sky as bright as the Sun. Another problem is that you'd have to invent some mechanism for producing new hydrogen and getting rid of iron and other fusion products, or else stars would all have burned out by now. Another problem is that you have to invent some mechanism for producing the substantial amounts of deuterium observed, as this doesn't seem to be produced by stars (it's instead consumed, very quickly). Lastly, plugging any static, infinite universe into Einstein's equations gives you a spacetime that should collapse in on itself locally.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The big bang solved the problems by proposing a universe that was still at least potentially infinite in extent, but that had a finite age and that had space constantly expanding. The expansion of space solved the local collapse problem (unlike an unmoving, non-collapsing universe, it was a solution consistent with the equations - a <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_Sitter_space_0b86.html" title="De Sitter space">de Sitter space</a>). The limited age of the universe meant we didn't have to worry about all lines of sight ending on stars, as we could only see out to a finite distance, and that we didn't have to worry about fusion products being recycled, as initial stores of hydrogen were enough to power stars to the present time. The presence of deuterium was explained by the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis_3706.html" title="Big Bang nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a> period, which happened briefly enough that it could form without immediately burning up afterwards.</dd>

Einstein's conception of the Universe, and of the laws therein, were always with respect to his view of a higher power and he felt therefore that the static universe fit most closely his conception of a god. There are some great books in the science section of your local library or bookstore regarding Einstein's philosophy. As experiment and observation have evolved we know that the Universe is not static, but a dynamic infinite universe is still within the realm of possibility and citations of peer-reviewed research as such should be reflected in the article. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrobayes_1618.html" title="User:Astrobayes">Astrobayes</a> 21:46, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The purely-GR version of the model predicts that a singularity existed at the very beginning of the universe, as the starting point for expansion. This singularity no longer exists under that model. As I mentioned in the previous thread, a more realistic view is that the view based on General Relativity is only valid back to the point where GR is expected to break down (when the primordial plasma is at the Planck temperature, or when the curvature of spacetime is greater than some Planck-related value that I'm forgetting at the moment). Under this view, no singularity ever existed, though we don't really know what _did_ happen prior to this point (that would take a theory of <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_gravity.html" title="Quantum gravity">quantum gravity</a> to handle the extreme space curvature, and a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_everything.html" title="Theory of everything">theory of everything</a> to handle force unification at Planck temperatures). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 15:07, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I second that motion. This article is in no way neutral. Right now, if you say you think there was a big bang, you are accused of believing the stuff presented here, but if you say the big bang theory is wrong, then people wonder how you would think that since that's inconsistent with Hubble's Law. Anyway, it is obvious that things are moving apart, and likewise, they must have previously been closer together. You can take that to it's natural conclusion that things were at a point, or you can take that to another reasonable conclusion that things were flung past one another. The arguments presented here are monolithic and it seems to me, almost intentionally misleading. The theory that is presented here is completely inconsistent with the special theory of relativity. No one has either verified this or contradicted this yet; it only gets removed from whatever article I put it in. Any statement of actual interest that I've made regarding this Big Bang theory or the Standard Cosmological Model has been removed without refutation or argument. I find this to be very interesting because it seems to indicate that you're not sure that I'm wrong, only that it doesn't sound right. Well why don't you know what your theory says? When I have an awkward position regarding the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milne_model.html" title="Milne model">Milne model</a> I can state it with certainty and defend it well. When the proponents of the Big Bang have an awkward postion regarding the Big Bang, they delete the question. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoolin_05fe.html" title="User:JDoolin">JDoolin</a> 06:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How can you support a theory that applies Special Relativity only locally? Where is your concrete evidence that the FLRW metric applies to ANYTHING? How do you explain the Cosmic Background Radiation? You say it is predicted? Do you have a mechanism? Half of you think that it's coming from far away, and half of you think it is coming from the vacuum of space? But that debate is not presented here. You are pretending it is monolithic.</p>
<p>How do you think that inflation *explains* anything? Guth only said that it was needed. Now you stand behind speculation about what causes it as though these speculations were somehow proof of your theory! Inflation should be an effect of something obvious, not something that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>Now a colliding galaxy has produced a lot of extra nonbaryonic matter. I hear on the radio and on TV that you are using this as proof--new evidence for your theory because you need a lot of extra nonbaryonic matter. But you need it *constantly*, not as a short result of an explosion!</p>
<p>You are continually asked by everyone who comes along how a symmetrical distribution of matter can affect the shape of spacetime, and you continually put off anyone who asks as uneducated and ineducable. It is a good question, and you simply cannot answer it.</p>
<p>You are all insane! You have NOTHING. This theory is completely without merit! The FLRW metric is without proof, without reason, without logic, without clear explanation, without a hint of experimental evidence, and without merit.</p>

<dd>Whatever - it's still a blip on the cosmology landscape and should not be given to much weight. Looking at the list the big guns are all missing and that must count for a lot in a summary article such as this. Whilst I agree dissenting views must be included, undue weight is always a problem. The Big Bang is the best we have but there are real problems with it which most astrophysicists acknowledge - however that doesn't make it wrong but in need of refining - something explained very well in this article. There should be some mention of the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonstandard_cosmologies.html" title="Nonstandard cosmologies">nonstandard cosmologies</a> (which I would much prefer to call <i>alternative cosmologies</i> as that would narrow the field and leave the creationists out) and there probably should be a brief mention of the creationist cosmologies themselves (for completeness) - but these should be minor footnotes and not a separate section. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 17:23, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been gone on vacation, and once again people aren't addressing the same points I've repeated over and over throughout this talk page, and its archives. So one more time:</p>
<p>How can I explain Special Relativity, the FLRW metric, the Cosmic Background Radiation, inflation etc.? I can't. Others can, and I think I can explain asymmetry, but that isn't why we're here. See the second info box at the top of this talk page. Then reflect on why we had to put it there.</p>
<p>"Right now the article is POV skewed with no dissenting opinions given." But if you guys couldn't find the dissenting opinions in the article, then how could you move them into the new section? The 7 subheadings about "problems" are also dissent and rebuttal.</p>
<p>"An Open Letter to the Scientific Community" has been presented as news almost every time we go around this merry-go-round.

<dd>Note that I have no "pet view" in this context; perhaps you are trying to protect your own? I try to impose <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, which commands appropriate representation of all notable pet views. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 10:28, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see no signs other than the assertations of Harald88 that this article is biased. The article seems to go to great lengths to list problems and inconsistancies with the theory. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefffire_7481.html" title="User:Jefffire">Jefffire</a> 21:30, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article does say that expanding space has been "observed" in the first few sentences. That seems intentionally misleading. All that has been observed is light and particles. Even if there WERE stretching of space, you wouldn't observe it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The article also does not list ideas in an order where it is clearly stated what assumptions were made; what are the axioms, and what are concluded from these axioms. In most other fields, one starts with an observation and/or set of assumptions. Instead of saying you "assume" the FLRW metric, you seem to have adopted it as though you know it from experience.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We assume that things fall, or we assume that we can't see at night. With enough experience, these assumptions transform into beliefs. We accept these things as valid because we take them from repeated observations--not from deductive reasoning. Perhaps you feel you know the FLRW metric from experience, but your experience is having your grade based on being able to express it correctly. You have no corroborating experience based in the physical world. But what has happened is that you believe the FLRW metric with the same faith that you believe that things fall or that we can't see in the dark. In fact, it would be easier for you to consider a world where things don't fall, or where you can see in the dark than it would be for you to conceive of a universe where a homogeneous distribution of matter has no effect on the warping of space.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, citing the minority opinions of people who see that this theory is completely flawed is about the best we can do. We certainly cannot "cite" your lack of evidence. Where is your lack of evidence published? How could you publish your lack of evidence? Your lack of evidence is not cite-able.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I have cited a very well-respected source, which is often given credit for motivating the Big Bang model. "Relativity, Gravitation, and World Structure," by A.E. Milne which does give a self-consistent cosmology and has been slandered relentlessly by cosmologists. This book is a much more effective minority opinion than that given by the Open Letter to the Scientific Community, because it gives the answer which "most scientists and mathematicions thinks is impossible." In any case, it will not fare well as long as you do not let go a few of your assumptions. Milne's model does not work in the FLRW metric, and it shouldn't. It's not supposed to. It's not designed that way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I find it somewhat annoying that "The Big Bang" are good words for what could be a good theory, but instead have become a misnomer for a bad theory. Why don't you call your theory the "Rubber Bang" or the "Infinite Expanding Spatial Model?" Something that would fit it, instead of taking laypeople's words and then insulting them when they use these words for what they actually should mean? It reminds me of Orwell's 1984 when people couldn't think straight because all their words had been redefined or removed from their vocabulary. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoolin_05fe.html" title="User:JDoolin">JDoolin</a> 03:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I still can't find any acknowledgment of Wikipedia policies in the above. Even if 98% of all scientists wrongly write as if expanding space has been observed and the FLRW metric is known from experience, without any evidence and relentlessly slander Mr. Milne, then that's the view Wikipedia should report. Correcting those alleged errors should come from scientists among themselves, not through Wikipedia which is much more likely to introduce errors than to correct them. Nobody reads this article to learn what we think, they want to learn what everybody thinks. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 05:19, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>AFAIK, <i>nobody</i> here claims that Wikipedia should not report on the view that the Big Bang happened. But I may be mistaken, and is so, please point out which editor demands that!</dd>
<dd>Instead, the debate is about the <i>presentation</i> of the minority view of a notable number of relevant scientists who have a differing opinion. Obviuously the debate has <i>not</i> been settled, but <i>again</i> the NPOV banner has been removed! I'll try a compromise solution, but I will reinstall the banner if it is reverted. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 19:26, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree no editor demands that Wikipedia should not report on the view that the Big Bang happened. I too was writing about presentation: the majority view presentation shouldn't be rewritten as suggested by JDoolin, whose critique is based on the assertion that the majority view is wrong. We should ideally do the same presentation regardless of who we think is wrong. We should present the majority view the way the majority presents it, combined with minority criticism when appropriate. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 20:12, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On that we fully agree. For such neutral renditions neither the version by JDoolin, not the version by SA is suited - the last version is even one of the best examples of anti-NPOV propaganda that I have seen in recent time: "There currently are very few researchers who doubt the Big Bang occurred; those who do are often adherents to non-standard cosmologies of their own invention."!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh, maybe a little. How would I express that? "very few" emphasizes half-empty over half-full, but it looks necessary to say it's a relatively small minority. "adherents to non-standard cosmologies of their own invention"? My only experience is on Wikipedia, but my guess is that if all the mainstream cosmologists went away, the alternative people would argue more loudly than ever - with each other. At least the previous post doesn't ignore anything I've said before, and I'll let the rest of you debate that one. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 23:14, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point is partly the content (unwarranted, probably exaggerated statements), and partly the phrasing. One can say the same thing in different ways, and propaganda is to present it in such a way that it the reader tends to think either better or less good of the subject matter than is carried by the facts. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 19:42, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed - most active astrophysicists will talk about the problems with the simple BB model but accept that on the whole it exlains observations better than anything else we have.

<p>Quoth <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a>: "minority view of a notable number of relevant scientists who have a differing opinion" --&gt; What makes their number notable? There are more than one thousand astronomers and cosmologists who agree on the Big Bang. The Open Letter tries to count "hundreds" of scientists, but on careful evaluation there are probably something like less than 15 researchers who are active in cosmological research who signed this statement. We mention the nonstandard cosmology proponents in proportion to the prominence of their arguments in this article. In fact, we give them more space than we should if you were to use the criterion ratio of peer review text that supports the Big Bang to peer review text that disputes it. By my rough estimation, less than 0.01% of peer review articles regarding cosmology dispute the Big Bang. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 19:43, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Again: obviously it's about presentation, and not about space. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarald88_dacc.html" title="User:Harald88">Harald88</a> 19:49, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>But there is no alternative presentation that takes up the same amount of space as the current article that I've seen. The only alternative was one which promoted the dispute to a new section -- hardly in keeping with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a>. Since no one has proposed an alternative wording of the sentences dealing with nonstandard opinions, I submit that there really is no dispute, just sour grapes. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceApologist_b6a9.html" title="User:ScienceApologist">ScienceApologist</a> 19:53, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have to agree with the comments that this article is rather POV. I don't claim to be a scientist or anything. I came by the article to just read about it without really knowing anything on the subject. But the article frankly really does read like the title should be 'The Big Bang _LAW_'. While it does list some disputes of the theory, the tone with which these are presented is as if these disputes were laughable. This same tone is prevalent throughout the article, and the message I got from reading it is 'Big bang is undeniably correct. Everyone agrees except for a couple of silly scientists here and there who don't know what they're talking about.' Which seems pretty strange to me considering how much hand waving there seems to be in any of the competing theories, including big bang. The proclamation feels quite arrogant and political. 24.23.231.54 03:14, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course what does or doesn't make it POV is whether it's true that "everyone agrees except for a couple of silly scientists...", not whether you think there is hand waving in the Big Bang theory. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 04:59, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is certainly not the only thing that matters and it even wasn't his/her point if I read it well.

<dd>You're right about one thing - "the tone with which [disputes] are presented" is debatable under NPOV apart from the question of how much attention should be given to a small minority. Oops. But it should be OK to say that virtually all professional astronomers support the Big Bang. Also, the user did indeed emphasize "hand waving there seems to be in ... big bang", which is expressing a POV, not criticizing the balance. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 21:40, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
