<p>The station began broadcasting on 1395 kHz <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amplitude_modulation.html" title="Amplitude modulation">AM</a> (215 m <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medium_Wave_6ce8.html" title="Medium Wave">Medium Wave</a>) from a transmitter leased from Nozema Services in the Netherlands, but the station claimed that because the coverage was poor due to the services provided by Nozema it had terminated its on air transmissions. Nozema reported that it had terminated its services because the station had given the company a worthless cheque in payment. (For details and a picture of the cheque, see Pied Piper link under external sources.) The station continues to broadcast 24 hours per day from the same studio as Radio London International in Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, on 1395 kHz AM, satellite and the Internet. Ray Anderson reported on the station's information site during June 2006, that the station would return from a new 50 kW transmitter in the Netherlands on the same frequency as before, and these broadcasts commenced on 19th September 2006. According to WHOIS sources, the station's Internet service is registered to an individual named Les Plock who appears to be operating his business from servers located at a Chelmsford Housing Authority house on Dorset Avenue in Great Baddow, Chelmsford in Essex.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_L_%28Radio_London_International%29_b070.html" title="Edit section: Ownership">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ownership</span></h3>
<p>During its very brief history this station which was founded by Ray Anderson who continues to participate in its operation, the station has used several corporate names including: Radio London International, Big L and Radlon Media. When the Nozema transmissions were terminated, Nozema claimed that it was due to non-payment, although the station claimed that it had withheld payment due to poor service. However, Radlon Media Limited did present Nozema Services with a cheque for 30,000 Euros in July 2005, but that cheque subsequently bounced. At the time of writing, Nozema are still pursuing their claim for monies owed. The Ofcom licence states the station has always been under the ownership of Big L Limited, but it is unclear whether the other companies that have been involved were its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>In addition to the financial dispute over the transmitter lease, TM Century in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas.html" title="Dallas">Dallas</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, claim that they have not been paid the jingle package 'Big Time Radio (Studio Dragonfly series)', which was custom-sung for the radio station upon an order submitted by Ray Anderson. Similar complaints have been made by other companies for their services provided to the station.</p>

<p>The station was initially launched in May 2005 by Radio London International Limited, a company run by Ray Anderson. Beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, Ray Anderson of Frinton-on-Sea, Essex teamed up with Christopher Gaydon (also known as Chris Elliot) of Kent, England, to produce a history of <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonderful_Radio_London_f625.html" title="Wonderful Radio London">Wonderful Radio London</a> in both printed book and audio CD formats, and to accompany this promotion with a restricted service license for a 1 watt station operating for less than a month. This promotion was tainted with controversy due to the origin of the printed and audio copyrighted works being claimed by Chris Elliot as his own property that were subsequently published by Ray Anderson's East Anglia Productions. (See <a href="http://radlon.bravehost.com/" class="external text" title="http://radlon.bravehost.com/" rel="nofollow">Wonderful Radio London Copyrights</a> for further details. East Anglia Productions was absorbed by East Anglia Productions, Ltd., following the personal bankruptcy of Ray Anderson, East Anglia Productions, Ltd., soon found itself in financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Following a series of further restricted service license broadcasts also using 1 watt, Ray Anderson attempted to create a full time station using a leased transmitter in the Netherlands. The name of the new station was <b>Radio London International</b> (which borrowed from the name of the station <b><a href="http://www.cracksman.connectfree.co.uk/pirates.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cracksman.connectfree.co.uk/pirates.htm" rel="nofollow">Wonderful Radio London International</a> (WRLI)</b>, which had been formed in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> with the help of <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Pierson_8809.html" title="Don Pierson">Don Pierson</a> who had created the original offshore station of the 1960s. Chris Elliot had been engaged to produce syndicated programs for WRLI and as a result he had come into possession of files, notes and recordings that belonged to others involved in the WRLI project. By the time Ray Anderson launched his own Radio London International on Saturday, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_14.html" title="May 14">14 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, he had already parted company with Chris Elliot who, at the time of writing, is still one of many of Ray Anderson's unpaid creditors.</p>

<p>Radio London International Ltd, was put into compulsory liquidation on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_10.html" title="February 10">10 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. The assets of the station were bought in September 2005 by Big L Limited which was registered four days before Radio London International went on the air. This new company with registered offices in <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birmingham.html" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, England, is in fact a reregistration of a company name that had just previously been deleted from the Companies House registry. However, due to a trade mark dispute with another British (and non-broadcasting station) company called Radio London, Ltd., which had registered a variation on the original "rl" logo belonging to the original Wonderful Radio London of Texas, the new Big L, Limited, decided to rebrand its own station as <i>Big L</i>. (The original 1960s logo was never registered as a trade mark since the station was classified as a <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate_radio.html" title="Pirate radio">pirate radio</a> operation and the logo of "rl" was in fact a mere alteration of the logo "li" once owned by the American manufacturing company <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litton_Industries_6808.html" title="Litton Industries">Litton Industries</a> (which has since allowed its own logo to lapse as a registered trade mark. The unique design of the "li" logo had been painted on the funnels of Litton ships and the variation of "rl" was painted on the funnel of the ship that served as the home of Wonderful Radio London.) <a name="References" id="References"></a></p>
