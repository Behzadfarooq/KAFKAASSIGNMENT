<h3><span class="mw-headline">Intro</span></h3>
<p>I have put up an RfC, because I do not thing much progress will be made with the same four characters arguing in circles. Here are the major questions as I see them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there enough qualifications in the article? All the participants, to the best of my knowledge, agree that funding and academic positions in cosmology go almost exclusively to big bang proponents. We also seem to agree that there remains a minority of physicists, largely outside of academia, who are actively critical of the big bang.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In its stable state, the article has a couple of sentences about opponents in the "Features, Issues and Problems" section which mention the opponents of the big bang, and their attitudes towards its more baroque features (inflation, dark matter, dark energy).</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Should we include relatively recent, controversial research results</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>such as the low-<i>l</i> multipole debate (A. de Oliveira-Costa, M. Tegmark, M. Zaldarriga and A. Hamilton, "The significance of the largest scale CMB fluctuations in WMAP", <i>Phys. Rev.</i> <b>D69</b> (2004) 063516 <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0307282" class="external text" title="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0307282" rel="nofollow">arXiv:astro-ph/0307282</a>. D. J. Schwarz, G. D. Starkman, D. Huterer and C. J. Copi, "Is the low-<i>l</i> microwave background cosmic?", <i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i> <b>93</b> (2004) 221301 <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0403353" class="external text" title="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0403353" rel="nofollow">arXiv:astro-ph/0403353</a>. A. Slosar and U. Seljak, "Assessing the effects of foregrounds and sky removal in WMAP", <i>Phys. Rev.</i> <b>D70</b>, 083002 (2004). <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404567" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404567" rel="nofollow">astro-ph/0404567</a>. C. J. Copi, D. Hueterer, D. J. Schwarz and G. D. Starkman, "On the large-angle anomalies of the microwave sky", <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0508047" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0508047" rel="nofollow">arXiv:astro-ph/0508047</a>.) None of the authors of these papers suggest they invalidate the big bang model, although some suggest that it is an unusual effect which may signal new physics. It has been suggested that we include them as a criticism.</li>
<li>Such as an (as-yet) not peer reviewed paper of <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElerner_3f7c.html" title="User:Elerner">Elerner</a>, "Evidence for a Non-Expanding Universe: Surface Brightness Data From HUDF" <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0509611" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0509611" rel="nofollow">arXiv:astro-ph/0509611</a> which is highly critical of the big bang (in particular, the theory of an expanding universe), but has appeared less than two months ago and has not undergone peer-review.</li>
<li>Such as the month-and-a-half old paper (R. Lieu, J. P. D. Mittaz and S.-N. Zhang "Detailed WMAP/X-ray comparison of 31 randomly selected nearby clusters of galaxies - incomplete Sunyaev-Zel'dovich silhouette" <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510160" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510160" rel="nofollow">arXiv:astro-ph/0510160</a>) which is also highly critical, has not been peer-reviewed, but is not written by contributors to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>What, if anything, should we say about recent discordant data (I think it is at roughly the two-standard deviation or one in twenty level) for the abundance of Lithium-7? <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501591" class="external text" title="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501591" rel="nofollow">arXiv:astro-ph/0501591</a></li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In general, what should be reasonable criteria for including recent, controversial research results in an article about a theory such as the big bang, about which thousands of articles are published each year?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Are the present sections on some of the unsolved problems of the big bang (inflation, dark matter, dark energy and especially baryon asymmetry) sufficient, or do criticisms need to be increased, or interspersed throughout the main text of the article?</li>
<li>Did cosmologists predict the CMB from the big bang theory? Is the single world "qualitative" in the introduction adequate, or do we need to include the fact that they didn't predict the exact temperature? If so, where?</li>

<dd>I vote for keeping this article about the Big Bang. Alternative models (such as <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a>) should be linked from a (relatively brief) section about alternative views. According to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, in the "pseudoscience" section, article space is supposed to reflect the relative fraction of the scientific community that supports a given view. As the vast majority of publications - and textbooks - state that the big bang model is the most accepted model of the early universe, I don't think giving <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> a large amount of space <i>at <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a></i> is justified. Allegations of systemic bias in the scientific community are, frankly, off-topic. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 17:01, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thomas, the competing views are not pseudoscience, aka., a field not of science but protraying themselves as such .... it is actual competing scientific theories, though the BB is given the limelight (for various reason, not to least of that it is associated with other creation myths).</dd>
<dd>And ... please explain how is the allegations of systemic bias in the scientific community off-topic? They are at the heart of this topic and part of the dispute.</dd>
<dd>Sincerely, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> 17:14, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I did not claim that <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> was pseudoscience. I merely pointed readers to the section of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> that describes how much space should be given to dissenting views in science articles. Discussion of systemic bias is off-topic because discussing it doesn't change the number of scientists in either camp. You can argue that the numbers would be different if processes were different, but playing "what-if" leads to no solid conclusions. Nobody is disputing that <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough to get a mention as a dissenting view. For anything more than that <b>in the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> article</b>, you're going to have to wait until you succeed in popularizing it in the scientific community. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 17:31, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is a <b>"popular" idea in the scientific community</b> (though not as much as the BB) and is commonly <i>known</i> in the laymen community ... it though is <b>not widely accepted in Peer-review</b> .... and that is the crux of the disagreement. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> 17:49, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>According to Google scholar, which I admit is not the last word on anything, there are 30,500 papers containing "big bang" <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22big+bang%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22big+bang%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and 34 containing "plasma cosmology" <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22plasma+cosmology%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22plasma+cosmology%22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. That hardly qualifies as popular. â<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 19:00, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Did you miss the "though is <i>not widely accepted in Peer-review</i>"? Scholar.google surveys <i>Peer-review</i> articles mostly .... I do not find it surprising that the result was low .... infact, the 34 seems to be good (understanding that Scholar.google's spider has not made it very comprehensive currently; I have drawn nothing in searches of common topic in S.g). <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> 20:19, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>No, I did not miss that. I guess I don't see how one would define "popularity in the scientific community" other than through articles published. â<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 21:30, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a>'s comment pretty much sums up the point. In order to make judgements on how accepted an idea is in the scientific community, you need a (reasonably) objective yardstick to measure it with. Peer-reviewed publications, while an imperfect yardstick, is the best one available. Relax requirements for review, and you get everything from harmonics theory to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autodynamics.html" title="Autodynamics">autodynamics</a> to <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">creation science</a> in the queue. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a>, you argue about bias, but I'm not convinced that it would affect the count significantly. The whole point of science is that views change when sufficient evidence is presented. Remember, the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bang_a993.html" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> model itself was laughed at when it was first proposed, yet it accumulated enough evidence to get published and popularize its view. This is <i>normal</i> for science. To claim that there is systematic suppression of unorthodox ideas to the degree that a majority or near-majority can be turned into a thousands-to-dozens minority stretches credibility. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 21:56, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I would tend to think that given the title of this article that it should confine itself to the Big Bang hypothesis, providing See also links for other views. The inclusion of the steady state model is justified from a historical perspective, but other less developed criticisms should not be permitted to obscure a laymanâs understanding of the core ideas.</dd>
<dd>That is the fundamental role of an encyclopedia; to provide an understanding of a concept to those outside the field of inquiry, not to be a forum for debate. I have followed this disagreement since its inception here and at plasma cosmology, and I am left with the impression that some feel that somehow the inclusion of marginal ideas in Wikipdeia serves to give those concepts more weight than they would otherwise warrant among the fieldâs community. This clearly violates the spirit if not the letter of policy in this place.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, even if the Big Bang hypothesis was found to be fundamentally wrong tomorrow, this article should not be cluttered with opposing theories; only the mention of that fact, how it was determined, and links out to the current contenders. For a good example of how this should be done see: <a href="../../../l/u/m/Luminiferous_aether.html" title="Luminiferous aether">Luminiferous aether</a>. <a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDV8_2XL_8587.html" title="User:DV8 2XL">DV8 2XL</a> 17:11, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"to provide an understanding of a concept to those outside the field of inquiry, not to be a forum for debate"? Yes wikipedia is not a battleground .... but to understand the concepts and issues to those outside the field of inquiry the more or less obvious criticisms and problems with the concepts and issues should be noted. <i>To gloss over issues is not helpful to those outside the field of inquiry</i>.</dd>
<dd>Also of note, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not only a encyclopedia, but more</a> ....

<dd>Ok, people itâs time for a reality check. Nobody working in any field or serious student (above high school) consults Wikipedia on matters of fact in that field. <i>Nobody.</i> The reasons are obvious and donât need to be recited. Consequently it is clear that anyone pushing a unique or non-standard POV is doing so only with the intention of broadcasting it to a wider audience. Stripped of all the obscuring rhetoric, this argument is about presenting a minority idea to the public in a manor that gives the impression that its status is equal to the more widely held one. And this is quite simply not the case. Were Wikipedia closed or limited I would have some sympathy for this effort (although I add in haste I still would not support it) but this is not the case. Alternative views can be presented in their own articles, limited only by general policies that demand an honest and neutral treatment.</dd>

<li>The tragedy of this from my perspective is that I <i>like</i> Plasma Cosmology, it is an elegant and evocative hypothesis, and in my heart I hope it âwinsâ in the long run. This however does not blind me to the fact that it has a long way to go, and that it is not the widely excepted view. Getting it to that point is going to take much more effort in more productive endeavors than driving it up BB supporterâs noses in places like this. A nonsensical dispute like this gives the whole study of PC an aura of desperation, and is frankly beginning to take on the same tone as the Scientific Creationism arguments. Others are watching, and may come to similar conclusions to the determent of the theory in the Public Mind.<a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDV8_2XL_8587.html" title="User:DV8 2XL">DV8 2XL</a> 21:27, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Are you serious? Because the BB proponents do not adhere to the NPOV in wikipedia and that a point of order to be neutral is made that opposing views (such as Plasma Cosmology and the Quasi Steady State) are going to be looked down on? That's nonsensical. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a>
<ul>
<li>No I'm afraid that's the way it will play. BB has the advantage of being generally perceived as the scientific standard (no I don't like that phrase myself, but it does cover it), all others will be seen in competition. As I said no rational worker in this field will come here to do research. Those people that do will come from outside and will examine this argument and and not see BB pushing POV by not giving opposing views equal time in an article <i>on</i> Big Bang; because this discussion is at BB and about what is proper to put in BB, not the activities of its proponents elsewhere. Like it or not right now, right here PC proponents are looking a little hysterical.

<dd>You have to give us some criteria for deciding which framerworks are scientific and which are not scientific. If Wikipedia is as neutral as you claim then the best we can do is report mainstream and outside the mainstream. That would necessitate inclusion of creationist nonsense as well. Just because you personally don't like a particular objection doesn't mean that your objection is encyclopedic. There is, of course, a difference between people who develop ideas out of religious zealotry and those who develop them out of grudges, history, or their own judgements, but I don't see how the former can be rightly called non-scientific while the latter is called scientific since neither is mainstream. While I think plasma cosmology is far less controversial than Humphreys' white hole cosmology, I don't see how we can claim that his criticisms are somehow less notable or less "scientific" than the criticisms of Lerner. Please let me know if you have another way of looking at this. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 17:47, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>If we are going to make any progress, perhaps we ought to confine the discussion to the points above.

I do not think that there should be a "extensive section" but there should be a non-partisan section on scientific critiques and views (with the main 2 are the Quasi-SS and plasma cosmology from my unbderstanding) (and, to some extent but <i>seperate</i> from the scientific ones, acknoledgement of pseudoscientific critiques) ... and it is question of how much statments of need to be qualified (explicitly state who thinks what and who thinks that this or that is wrong) and now much weight should be given to information that is in harmony with the big bang and the data that not in agreement with the Big Bang. BUT ... it is not just "recent claims of flaws" in the Big Bang model ... there is historical flaws in the Big Bang that need to be pointed out.

<dd>For now, I only want to address one point listed at the beginning of this section: The inclusion of "breakink news". Whereas it is rarely a problem to add a newly discovered Saturn moon-let minutes after the announcements, this doesn't apply to papers in cosmology. A standard encyclopedia would always choose the safe side and only excerpt from textbooks, but Wikipedia usually tries to be more up to date. But there is a reasonable limit to this. Hundreds of new papers a month hit the preprint servers. Deciding ourselves which to included is near to <i>original research</i>. But going after the echo in popular astronomy newstickers or press, is an even more skewed sample. For obvious reasons, this will select the papers with the most bizarre claims. O.K. some of these claims may come out to something, but disasters like <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0507619" class="external text" title="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0507619" rel="nofollow">astro-ph/0507619</a> are common and putting this into Wikipedia gives undue weight. Of course some people will prefer even more skewed samples, like those promoted by the <a href="http://www.cosmology.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=64" class="external text" title="http://www.cosmology.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=64" rel="nofollow">Alternative Cosmology Group</a>.

<dd>AlfvÃ©n is a good example of how things should be included in Wikipedia, in my opinion. His research in MHD and plasmas is reported in Wikipedia well. The point is that with hundreds of papers coming out each month each purporting to explain different aspects of cosmology, there really is no standard way to include the information in a digest setting such as this. We need to be judicious in our selection of ideas for inclusion. In general, the rule of thumb I used when rewriting this article a year ago was that if something hasn't made it into a review article or a layman's summary yet, it should be excluded. This wouldn't apply to pages such as "plasma cosmology" which are small and driven by individual researchers. Including obscure and possibly incorrect information without the adequate qualification is more problematic than being completely inclusionist. The Big Bang became a featured article because we excluded a lot of information and made editorial judgements as to what was important. This discussion helps in establishing what is important. Consensus seems to be that it is important to maintain the Big Bang as the paradigmatic framework that it currently functions as. After all, this is Wikipedia and if tomorrow we discovered that the Big Bang was wrong, the article would change to reflect this. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 14:11, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree. The point is that some papers give low estimates, and quote remarkably small errors which disagree with the concordance BBN value. The point is that these errors are statistical errors from measuring helium-4 abundance in different HII regions, and take no account of the systematic effects, which are estimated to be an order of magnitude or more larger.

<p>The scientific community has for the most part accepted the big bang theory. It might be wrong but you will never gain any ground by editing an online encyclopedia in order to introduce alternate theories. An analogy would be the special theory of relativity in 1905. Einstein did not petition (or harass) the Encyclopedia Britannica to support his theory and qualify the articles on Newtonian mechanics. He published relativity and waited for the scientific community to embrace it based on experimental evidence and his theoretical arguments. Whatever motivates one to use an open source encyclopedia to push a new theory -- convenience, impatience, or desperation -- these efforts will fail. <a href="../../../j/h/g/User%7EJHG_7c26.html" title="User:JHG">JHG</a> 08:55, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have decided to stop editing for the time being. Basically, I'm tired of arguing on the internet, and feel like there are more productive outlets for my energy. Have fun, and I hope you manage to resolve this mess. â<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 15:45, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">different interpretation of the theory</span></h2>
<p>To at least attempt some comprehension about a different interpretation of the 'big bang' theory, see first the contri-bution which describes the origins of the African 'Kwaanza' holiday, and those which describe a mucousal oracle bead chronicle.</p>
<p>Among all the historical memory-perfect images preserved within the tiny oracle bead artifact which can be viewed, some show ancient volcano eruptions. Various 'big bang' theories which must be intellectually attempted include introspection about the causes of each ancient volcano, as augmented with the aural effects of the tiny voice strip also struck within the mucousal bead chronicle. The visual imagery is memory-perfect -- meaning that it includes information showing both organic genotypes and phenotypes, and inorganic chemical compositions viewable as the contents of the oracle bead.</p>
<p>In other words, the tiny oracle bead seems to talk and emit other significant sounds as a consequence of its included voice strip -- including 'big bang' effects. 11/25/2005 19:39, 25 November 2005 (UTC) beadtot</p>

<dd>Googling musousal oracle bead chronicle leads to many gems. Thanks for the laugh. --<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Potter_73b9.html" title="User:Jason Potter">JPotter</a> 22:55, 25 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
