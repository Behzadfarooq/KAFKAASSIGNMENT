<p>Mary Katherine was born <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850.html" title="1850">1850</a>, in <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pest%2C_Hungary_6251.html" title="Pest, Hungary">Pest, Hungary</a>. The eldest daughter of a wealthy physician named Dr. Michael Horony, she and her siblings were educated as aristocrat's children. Each of Doctor Horony's children were literate, and Mary Katherine spoke several languages. In 1860, Dr. Horony , his second wife Katharina, and his children left <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, ultimately reaching <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> on board the ship <i>Bremen</i> in September 1860. Although no conclusive evidence or records exist, Dr. Horony was to accept a position as personal physician to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> born <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximilian_I_of_Mexico_6f7f.html" title="Maximilian I of Mexico">Maximilian I of Mexico</a>. Many authors have stated that Horony left <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> in 1863 with his family long before the crumble of Maximilian's rule. The family settled in a predominantly Hungarian area of <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davenport%2C_Iowa_19e4.html" title="Davenport, Iowa">Davenport, Iowa</a>. Horony and his wife both died in 1865 within a month of one another. Mary Katherine and her younger siblings were placed in the home of her brother in law, Gustav Susemihl, and in 1870, they were left in the care of attorney Otto Smith.<sup id="_ref-bork1935_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bork1935" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Unhappy with her fate, "Kate", ran away from her <a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster_home.html" title="Foster home">foster home</a> and allegedly stowed away on a <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverboat.html" title="Riverboat">riverboat</a> bound for <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. Repeated stories tell the tale of a young Kate that was discovered by the boat's captain and that he took pity on the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stowaway.html" title="Stowaway">stowaway</a>, granting her his protection and passage.</p>
<p>While in St. Louis, Kate claimed to have married a dentist named <i>Silas Melvin</i> and that the two had a son. Subsequently, the two were said to have died of <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Fever_dbd1.html" title="Yellow Fever">Yellow Fever</a>. No record currently proves the marriage, birth of a child, or the deaths of either Melvin or the child. In fact, recent research using <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancestry.com.html" title="Ancestry.com">Ancestry.com</a> proves that Silas Melvin is enumerated in a Saint Louis census. Kate's claims of Melvin's being a dentist are unfounded, since this enumeration states that Melvin was an employee of a St. Louis <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asylum.html" title="Asylum">asylum</a>. Since it is during the early 1870s that Kate met <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doc_Holliday_64c8.html" title="Doc Holliday">Doc Holliday</a>, there is speculation that she may have confused the two and their occupations when recalling the facts later in her life. <sup id="_ref-boyer_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boyer" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>By 1874, Kate had made her way to <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_City%2C_Kansas_24f1.html" title="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City, Kansas</a>, where she was known as "Kate Elder." It is alleged that she and another woman were fined and working as sporting women in a sporting house run by <i>Bessie Earp,</i> wife of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Earp_326b.html" title="James Earp">James Earp</a>.</p>
<p>In 1876, Kate had moved to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Griffin%2C_Texas_1ec4.html" title="Fort Griffin, Texas">Fort Griffin, Texas</a>. There she met <a href="../../../w/y/a/Wyatt_Earp_5f3f.html" title="Wyatt Earp">Wyatt Earp</a> and his companion <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattie_Blaylock_4d34.html" title="Mattie Blaylock">Mattie Blaylock</a> and began her long-time involvement with Doc Holliday. Doc had once stated he considered Kate to be his intellectual equal.</p>
<p>Wyatt Earp, in the controversial Stuart Lake biography <i>Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal</i> tells a colorful tale of Kate helping Holliday escape lawmen in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Griffin%2C_Texas_1ec4.html" title="Fort Griffin, Texas">Fort Griffin, Texas</a>, by setting fire to a shed, but there is no other historical evidence for this tale <sup id="_ref-KHT_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KHT" title="">[3]</a></sup>. Kate acknowledged the story but did not admit its truth.</p>
<p>Picking up her own account, Kate and Doc went to <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinidad%2C_Colorado_ab8f.html" title="Trinidad, Colorado">Trinidad, Colorado</a>, and then to <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas%2C_New_Mexico_88b2.html" title="Las Vegas, New Mexico">Las Vegas, New Mexico</a>, where Holliday was breifly a keeper of the Center Street "gin mill." Doc and Kate met up again with Wyatt Earp and his brothers on their way to the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Territory_7e22.html" title="Arizona Territory">Arizona Territory</a>. <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil_Earp_0487.html" title="Virgil Earp">Virgil Earp</a> had already been in <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescott%2C_Arizona_8aa1.html" title="Prescott, Arizona">Prescott</a> before Wyatt talked the families into moving to <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tombstone%2C_Arizona_450d.html" title="Tombstone, Arizona">Tombstone</a>. The group arrived in December 1879. Holliday and Kate stayed behind in Prescott to advance Doc's gambling winnings at a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Card_game.html" title="Card game">card game</a> called <a href="../../../f/a/r/Faro_%28card_game%29.html" title="Faro (card game)">Faro</a> . They then arrived in Tombstone in the fall of 1880. <sup id="_ref-bork1935_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bork1935" title="">[1]</a></sup> Despite reports, there is no conclusive evidence which proves Kate owned and operated a <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordello.html" title="Bordello">bordello</a> or "sporting house" in Tombsone. Kate was often confused with a bawdy sporting woman called Rowdy Kate.</p>
<p>Holliday, who like Earp was an opportunist, had been suspected in the robbery of a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stagecoach.html" title="Stagecoach">stagecoach</a> running between Tombstone and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benson%2C_Arizona_8809.html" title="Benson, Arizona">Benson, Arizona</a>, and the murder of stagecoach driver, Bud Philpot, which occurred near Tombstone on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">March 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Behan_fcbf.html" title="John Behan">John Behan</a> discovered that Doc and Kate had a drunken fight, and he offered Kate more alcohol in exchange for her testimony, implicating Doc. Holliday was arrested based on her testimony. But the next day, a sober Kate recanted her story, and Holliday was released from jail.</p>
<p>Kate traveled to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globe%2C_Arizona_4fc0.html" title="Globe, Arizona">Globe, Arizona</a>, where she owned a small <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boarding_house.html" title="Boarding house">boarding house</a>. She occasionally traveled to Tombstone to see Holliday until he left for <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> in April 1882. In 1887, Kate traveled to Redrock,Colorado, which is close to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_Springs%2C_Colorado_d0e9.html" title="Colorado Springs, Colorado">Colorado Springs</a> to visit with family. Although no proof exists, Kate ventured over to <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenwood_Springs%2C_Colorado_5b9d.html" title="Glenwood Springs, Colorado">Glendwood Springs</a> to be with Holliday as he was dying.</p>

<p>After Doc Holliday's death, Mary Katherine Horony married Irish blacksmith George Cummings in <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen%2C_Colorado_7311.html" title="Aspen, Colorado">Aspen, Colorado</a>, on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_2.html" title="March 2">March 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a>. They moved to <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisbee%2C_Arizona_a5e5.html" title="Bisbee, Arizona">Bisbee, Arizona</a>, where she briefly ran a bakery. After returning to <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willcox%2C_Arizona_1bc7.html" title="Willcox, Arizona">Willcox, Arizona</a>, in <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochise_County%2C_Arizona_babf.html" title="Cochise County, Arizona">Cochise County</a>, Cummings became an abusive alcoholic and they separated. In 1900, Mary Katherine moved to <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochise%2C_Arizona_0aef.html" title="Cochise, Arizona">Cochise</a> (which is now a <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_town.html" title="Ghost town">ghost town</a>) and worked for John and Lulu Rath, owners of the <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cochise_Hotel._fad8.html" title="Cochise Hotel.">Cochise Hotel.</a> Cummings committed suicide in Courtland, Arizona, in 1915.</p>
<p>In 1910, Mary Katherine is enumerated as having moved onto the Dos Cabezas, Arizona, homestead of miner John J. Howard. When Howard died in 1930, Mary Katherine was the executrix of his will and left the homestead with inheritance.</p>
<p>In 1931, Mary Katherine contacted her lifelong acquaintance, Arizona Governor <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Hunt_e53f.html" title="George Hunt">George Hunt</a>, and applied for admittance for the <i>Arizona Pioneer Home</i> in Prescott, Arizona. In the 1920s, the home was established by the state of Arizona for destitute and ailing miners and male pioneers of Arizona. It took Kate 6 months to be admitted, since the Pioneer Home had a requirement that a resident must be a U.S. citizen. According to the 1935 Bork interview, Kate was owed money by the Howard estate. Kate spent time with her family while the home was "adjusting" records (which read that she was born in Davenport, Iowa).</p>
<p>She was granted admittance as one of the first female residents of the home. She lived there and had become a very outspoken resident assisting other residents with living comforts. Kate wrote many letters to the Arizona state legislature, and when she was not satisfied she would contact the governor. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kate died on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">November 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, of old age. She is buried in Prescott, Arizona.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Nose_Kate_9300.html" title="Edit section: Kate on the O.K. Corral">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kate on the O.K. Corral</span></h2>
<p>Near the end of her life, several reporters had tried to record Kate's story of her relationship with Doc Holliday and her time in Tombstone. However, she only allotted time to two authors: Anton Mazzonovich and Prescott historian, Dr. A.W. Bork.</p>
<p>In 1939 Kate wrote a letter to her niece, Lillian Raffert. In the letter, Kate revealed that she had stayed with Holliday at Fly's Boarding House. The room was along Fremont Street and the open alley way between the boarding house and the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunfight_at_the_O.K._Corral_678b.html" title="Gunfight at the O.K. Corral">O.K. Corral</a></p>
<p>There is some historical evidence authenticating her claims of being in the vicinity of Tombstone with Holliday during the days leading up to the fight. Kate is precise regarding minor details and states that she was with Holliday in <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tucson%2C_Arizona_9259.html" title="Tucson, Arizona">Tucson</a> at a "feasto". There was a <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fiesta.html" title="Fiesta">fiesta</a>, which was the San Augustin Feast and Fair, in Levin Park on October 1881. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_20.html" title="October 20">October 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgan_Earp_a9a2.html" title="Morgan Earp">Morgan Earp</a> rode to Tucson to alert Holliday of the impending trouble. According to Kate's recollections, Holliday asked her to remain in Tucson for her safety, but she refused, instead going with Holliday and Earp.</p>
<p>As part of Kate's 1940 recollection, on the day of the gunfight, a man entered Fly's Boarding House with a "bandaged head" and a rifle. He was looking for Holliday, who was still in bed after a night of gambling. Kate recalled that the man who was turned away by Mrs. Fly was later identified as <a href="../../../i/k/e/Ike_Clanton_569e.html" title="Ike Clanton">Ike Clanton</a>. Clanton's head had been bandaged after being <i>buffaloed,</i> or hit over the head with the butt of a pistol by town marshall Virgil Earp. <sup id="_ref-bork1935_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bork1935" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-boyer_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boyer" title="">[2]</a></sup> In addition to subsequent testimony from many of Tombstone's residents, Kate claimed tensions had escalated between the Earps, Ike Clanton and the "Cowboy" faction.</p>
<p>The Earps and Holliday walked down Fremont Street to confront the cowboys in the vacant lot west of Fly's Boarding House. Author Glenn Boyer disputes that Kate saw the gunfight through the window of the boarding house. She would have been able to see the fight only if she stuck her head out the front window of Fly's. It is more plausible that Kate had heard testimony from accurate accounts of the actual gunfight and than repeated them in her letter to her niece. <sup id="_ref-boyer_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boyer" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kate claims after Doc Holliday returned to his room, he sat on the edge of his bed and wept from the shock of what had happened during the close range gunfight. "That was awful," Kate claims he said. "Just awful."<sup id="_ref-bork1935_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-bork1935" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-boyer_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-boyer" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
