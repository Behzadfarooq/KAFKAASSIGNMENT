<p>The film begins with Trinity escaping from police and a group of <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_%28The_Matrix%29_2d54.html" title="Agent (The Matrix)">Agents</a>. Later, computer programmer Thomas A. Anderson, an internet hacker known as "Neo", is searching for “the Matrix”. After a cryptic message on his computer, he travels to a nightclub where he meets Trinity. Neo believes that a hacker named Morpheus is the key to answering the question of “what is the Matrix?” The next morning, Neo receives a call from Morpheus. He informs Neo that he must leave his building, quickly and quietly, or he will be apprehended by several government-looking officials. Despite Morpheus' guidance, Neo is apprehended by the Agents. Neo wakes up in his bed believing it all to be a dream. Morpheus calls and informs him there is a car waiting to take him to a secure place so they can meet face-to-face.</p>
<p>Morpheus explains that he has been searching for Neo his entire life, and informs him that the Matrix is what Neo considers to be reality. He offers Neo a choice to leave the Matrix (via a blue pill) or see the real world (a red pill). Neo accepts the red pill, and soon finds himself inside a liquid-filled chamber connected by several wires. As the connections are severed, he is flushed into a pool of waste water. Morpheus, in his ship the “Nebuchadnezzar”, rescues Neo. After Neo recuperates, Morpheus explains the truth about the Matrix to Neo. The actual year is approximately 2199. Early in the <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_century.html" title="21st century">21st century</a> mankind created <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificially intelligent machines</a>, however war broke out. In a desperate attempt to cut off the machines' supply of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_power.html" title="Solar power">solar power</a>, the sky was blacked out. The machines nevertheless emerged victorious, and turned humans into a new source of energy. Morpheus and Trinity are part of a group of free humans who "unplug" other humans from the Matrix and recruit them to their resistance against the machines. Morpheus believes that Neo is "the One", a man with limitless control over the Matrix. He was prophesied by the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle_%28The_Matrix%29_3946.html" title="Oracle (The Matrix)">Oracle</a> to "hail the destruction of the Matrix, end the war, bring freedom to our people".</p>
<p>On board the “Nebuchadnezzar”, Neo meets the rest of the crew, Apok, Switch, Mouse, Cypher, Tank, and Dozer. Neo undergoes training where he is digitally downloaded with knowledge inside the Matrix. Over a ten hour period, he learns several forms of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_arts.html" title="Martial arts">martial arts</a>. Morpheus tries to test Neo, and the two <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spar.html" title="Spar">spar</a> inside an environment similar to the Matrix. Morpheus uses this time to teach Neo that the rules of the Matrix can be bent, or even broken by mental effort. Through further training, Neo learns that injuries suffered inside the Matrix are reflected in the real world. He also learns that the Matrix is policed by Agents similar to those who arrested him. The Agents are sentient programs whose purpose is to eliminate any threats within the Matrix. They have the ability to possess anyone still plugged into the Matrix. Once Neo fully understands the true nature of the Matrix, the Agents will not be able to stop him.</p>
<p>Morpheus and his group enter the Matrix so Neo can meet the Oracle. During his private meeting with her, she reveals that Morpheus believes in Neo so blindly that he will sacrifice himself to save Neo's life. Neo will have to choose between his life and that of Morpheus'. When the group attempts to exit the Matrix they are ambushed by several Agents. Morpheus is captured when he sacrifices himself to save Neo. Cypher is the first to exit the Matrix, and is soon revealed to be the saboteur of the group. Having struck a deal with the Agents, Cypher proceeds to unplug everyone while they are still inside the Matrix. Tank survives Cypher’s attack and kills him before he can unplug Neo and Trinity. Three Agents interrogate Morpheus, in an attempt to learn the access codes to the mainframe of Zion, the human’s last city. Neo and Trinity begin staging a rescue attempt for Morpheus. Arriving at the Agents’ headquarters, a massive gunfight ensues, leaving most of the lobby in ruins. On the roof, Neo shows more confidence in Morpheus’ belief when he dodges several bullets fired by an Agent. They use a helicopter to attack the interrogation room and rescue Morpheus. In an abandoned subway station, Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix. However, the phone being used to exit is destroyed by Agent Smith. Neo stands his ground, and the two erupt into combat. Neo flees the subway, after Agent Smith is hit by a train, and prepares to find another exit.</p>
<p>Tank attempts to guide him to the nearest exit as Sentinels (attack robots) locate the “Nebuchadnezzar’s” position in the real world. The crew’s only weapon is an electromagnetic pulse device that can only be used when no one is plugged into the Matrix. Tank guides Neo towards an "old exit", but Smith is already waiting. He shoots Neo dead. As Trinity whispers to Neo that she is in love with him, his heart begins to beat. Within the Matrix he stands up; the Agents shoot at him, but he stops their bullets in mid-air. As they fall to the ground, Neo sees the artificial Matrix as lines of streaming <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrix_source_code.html" title="Matrix source code">green code</a>: he finally becomes "the One". Agent Smith makes one last attempt to physically attack him, but Neo effortlessly blocks his punches with one hand. He then kills Agent Smith and returns to the real world barely in time for the ship's electromagnetic pulse to destroy the Sentinels. The denouement has him flying off into the air following a threat to the machines via the phone.</p>
