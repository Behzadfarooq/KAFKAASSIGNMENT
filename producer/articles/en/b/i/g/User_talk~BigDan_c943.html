<p>Hi BigDan,</p>
<p>Fantastic work you've been doing on television stations! I have edited the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Television_37fd.html" title="Prime Television">Prime Television</a> article to conform to wikipedia standards. <b>Bold text</b> is generally only used for the article title itself, and for other words or phrases that redirect to the article. Dates are usually formatted like [[1 Janauary]] [[2000]], this way the dates will automatically appear in the format each user has selected. Again, keep up the good work! -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 01:12, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you removed the info on A-League from the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Soccer_League_%28Australia%29_34dc.html" title="National Soccer League (Australia)">National Soccer League (Australia)</a> page on the basis that it is enough to create a new article. Like it says on the discussion page, I've started working on one, with the info there... the name <a href="../../../a/-/l/A-League_1f29.html" title="A-League">A-League</a> is already taken by an American league, so i titled it <b>A-League (Australia)</b>. The work in progress can be found here - tell me what you think, add more info, or add it to the full website if you think it is ready.

<dd>Yeh, I had a look at the page, it looks good - I've got exams for the next 2 weeks, so I won't be making any changes to it. Thanks <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> 10:48, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've merged the two A-League articles together, creating the <a href="../../../a/-/l/A-League_%28Australia%29_5df9.html" title="A-League (Australia)">A-League (Australia)</a> page. Personally, I think it's a better title than <i>Hyundai A-League</i>, as the sponsorship may change and the page and links would need to be moved. However, changing the <a href="../../../h/y/u/Hyundai_A-League_cef5.html" title="Hyundai A-League">Hyundai A-League</a> page into a re-direct to the <a href="../../../a/-/l/A-League_%28Australia%29_5df9.html" title="A-League (Australia)">A-League (Australia)</a> page would solve any problems with people looking up 'Hyundai A-League', and links that are already linked to your page. I changed the message on the <a href="../../../a/-/l/A-League_1f29.html" title="A-League">American version</a> page, to my article. If you have any objection to the redirect, let me know. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbinomonkey_5636.html" title="User:Albinomonkey">AlbinoMonkey</a> 05:44, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>My response:</b> I have no objections to that...although I made one change...I deleted <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Venables_9fb4.html" title="Terry Venables">Terry Venables</a>'s name from the page, as he is no longer going to be the technical director of the Jets. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDan_9e8b.html" title="User:BigDan">BigDan</a> 03:49, Dec 21, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, you seem to have duplicated content on one of these pages to create the other with a similar name. Did you really just want to move to a new name? If so there is a procedure to do this and you can work on the original article in the meantime. I can help if this is the case. One of the two articles will need to be deleted eventually because duplications are not permitted. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:44, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for your reply. If you tried to move <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regional_Television_a5b1.html" title="Regional Television">Regional Television</a> to <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regional_television.html" title="Regional television">Regional television</a> this would fail because the latter already contains an article now. You need to go to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_moves_b0bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested moves">Wikipedia:Requested moves</a> and make an entry (copy the format of the others). Explain why it should be done. The merits of the move will be discussed and, if there is a consensus to move, it will be performed by an admin. When the move is performed, the entire edit history of the old article will be copied too. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 04:32, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, in the future, if you want to change the name of a page, follow the instructions at "<a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_rename_%28move%29_a_page_3490.html" title="Wikipedia:How to rename (move) a page">Wikipedia:How to rename (move) a page</a>". Don't just copy the content, because every article has a page history showing changes. When you copy the content, that historical record is separated from it. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 03:10, 2005 Jan 18 (UTC) (<b>Reply</b>: thanks for the message.

<p>Hello BigDan, good to see another Australian radio fan on Wikipedia. I've been doing a little work on ABC Radio articles, e.g. <a href="../../../6/1/2/612_ABC_Brisbane_2fcf.html" title="612 ABC Brisbane">612 ABC Brisbane</a> and <a href="../../../7/0/2/702_ABC_Sydney_df92.html" title="702 ABC Sydney">702 ABC Sydney</a>. I'm part way through doing a list of all <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Local_Radio_2c27.html" title="ABC Local Radio">ABC Local Radio</a> stations. I see that you've done one for ABC Upper Hunter. Two things I want to ask you:</p>
<p>(1) I believe that ABC Local Radio stations should have titles conforming with their on-air identity, e.g. "666 ABC Canberra" instead of "2CN". Would you agree to me changing the titles of <a href="../../../2/n/c/2NC_29b2.html" title="2NC">2NC</a> and <a href="../../../2/u/h/2UH_4c15.html" title="2UH">2UH</a> to "1233 ABC Newcastle" and "ABC Upper Hunter"?</p>
<p>(2) What's the on-air identity of ABC Upper Hunter and ABC Central West? You see, when I was in Wollongong, the on-air ID was always "97.3 ABC Illawarra" yet their website, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/illawarra" class="external free" title="http://www.abc.net.au/illawarra" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/illawarra</a> shows just "ABC Illawarra". I won't complete the list of ABC Local Radio stations until I'm sure of what the on-air identities are.</p>
<p>Good work on the Australian broadcasting pages, and I look forward to working with you. --<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumehwy_cbbe.html" title="User:Humehwy">Humehwy</a> 06:03, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd have no problems you changing the titles to conform with ABC on-air identity...as long as you keep 2UH and 2NC as redirects...also, ABC Upper Hunter only identifies as "ABC Upper Hunter" during the mornings when it airs its breakfast program. The rest of the time, they use 2NC's on-air IDs...I'm not sure about ABC Central West, I've never been able to recieve it...<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDan_9e8b.html" title="User:BigDan">BigDan</a> 13:57, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've moved both the 2NC and 2UH pages to <a href="../../../1/2/3/1233_ABC_Newcastle_7f92.html" title="1233 ABC Newcastle">1233 ABC Newcastle</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_Upper_Hunter_4c34.html" title="ABC Upper Hunter">ABC Upper Hunter</a>. It's okay, when you move pages, redirects are put into place automatically. I think it's better for on-air names to be used rather than callsigns -- for instance, nobody would title an article "2SYD" -- but "Nova 96.9" would be perfectly acceptable for the same station! By the way, the ABC website's reception guide doesn't give a transmitter for ABC Central West in Bathurst -- the main Orange area 549AM transmitter is supposed to suffice, I guess. Anyway check out <a href="../../../6/1/2/612_ABC_Brisbane_2fcf.html" title="612 ABC Brisbane">612 ABC Brisbane</a> -- this is the format I'd like to use for ABC stations. For the regional stations, I'd have to determine whether their on-air ID is "xxx ABC Region_Name" or just "ABC Region_Name". --<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumehwy_cbbe.html" title="User:Humehwy">Humehwy</a> 05:40, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah good...I know there's no ABC Central West transmitter in Bathurst...the 50kw transmitter in Cumnock near Orange is supposed to serve nearly all the Central West. I agree with the rest of what you've said. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDan_9e8b.html" title="User:BigDan">BigDan</a> 11:26, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, seeing as we are not allowed to use fair use images on userpages or user subpages (see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Fair_use_policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use#Fair use policy</a> (item #9)), I took the libery of turning this gallery page into a list of links instead. If you upload any free licensed images feel free to display those in a gallery, but not the fair use ones. Thanks.</p>
<p>P.S. You may want to consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Movepage/User:BigDan%5CImages" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Movepage/User:BigDan%5CImages" rel="nofollow">moving</a> that page to <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDan_Images_2ee0.html" title="User:BigDan/Images">User:BigDan/Images</a> (with a / instead of a \), that way it would act as a proper <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubpage_5405.html" title="Wikipedia:Subpage">subpage</a>. No huge deal though, the only difference is that a link back to your userpage will automaticaly be added to the top and you can link to it from your userpage with just [[/Images]] instead of the full name. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 00:59, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I am trying to introduce a club for rugby league supporters that will be more than just a wikiproject and help to encourage rugby league participation and article improvement. I have written down some of my thoughts about what wikileaguies should attempt to do and would be interested if you, like other rugby league supporters, would be willing to be involved on some level. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rugby_666/Sandbox/The_Football_Fellowship_%28rugby_league%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rugby_666/Sandbox/The_Football_Fellowship_%28rugby_league%29" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, leave signage and thoughts on the talk page if you are interested.

<p>Hey I've noticed you're a regular on rugby league articles, particulary NRL ones. I need your advice on something I'm thinking of starting up on the project. Many WikiProjects have Article Improvement Drives which have different levels of success. I'm thinking of starting one up for this one too, but instead of voting on an article I would rather strive to improve one NRL club every fortnight and bring it up very close to featured status. Now it seems as though there'd be a lot of work involved, but there are also a lot of club fans out there who'd probably be willing to participate. Basically there are 30 weeks in the NRL season and there are 15 club pages that are not yet featured. I propose that we all have a schedule to work on one new article every second round, in alphabetical order. By the end of the season hopefully we will have 15 near-complete, if not complete articles. My only concern at this stage is the dedication of editors to help out other team pages that they are not interested in. Basically in order to get the support of editors like these, we need a few leaders in the project. If you are willing to dedicate a bit of your time every week into this and if you have any further suggestions, could you let me know at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Rugby_league_Article_improvement_drive_06a2.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Rugby league/Article improvement drive">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Rugby league/Article improvement drive</a>?

<p>Hello! If you are receiving this message, that means that your user page is in a specific year category. Per a recent user-category per deletion, all specific year categories are to be deleted. If you wish to continue using year categories, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using an age group category, such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_in_their_30s_2bf8.html" title="Category:Wikipedians in their 30s">Category:Wikipedians in their 30s</a></li>
<li>Using a decade category, such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_born_in_the_1970s_3955.html" title="Category:Wikipedians born in the 1970s">Category:Wikipedians born in the 1970s</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish, you may do both. Hopefully, this change in categorization will be quick and painless. Happy editing! --An automated message from <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedRobot_c4d1.html" title="User:MessedRobot">MessedRobot</a> 13:14, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
