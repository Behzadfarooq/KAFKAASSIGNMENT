<dd>I didn't necessarily mean "vandalism" in the sense that we use it here, but more "something that probably shouldn't have been in the article". Like you, I can sort of see where he's coming from as well, while disagreeing with the substance of his edits (hence the discussion that was going on on his user page).

<p>Hello, mate, I see that you are interested in Eurovision. Would you like to be involved in connecting with more eurovision wikipedians to do up the eurovision pages in a more coherent manner? I have come across the Eurovision wikiproject page, which seems to have been dormant for over two years. It may be an idea to have a look there and see how we could improve the eurovision coverage. I have done up the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congratulations_%28Eurovision%29_e5d7.html" title="Congratulations (Eurovision)">Congratulations (Eurovision)</a> page so far and put notes about it on the pages of those who performed there.

<p>I attempted to scare him off....it was sarcastic. Anyways he hardly gets a slap for saying he is raping children, please. Is there anybody with out a bias here? W/e, it is all subjective. You personally attacked me by hurting my feelings, but meh. I apologize for breaking wikipolicy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I do take your point, but under the circumstances you could've chosen a better way of scaring him off. Given that the article he was vandalising was dealing with Israeli military action, throwing the word "Nazi" around the place strikes me as probably not the best way of seeming unbiased. A warning may have been slightly too hair-triggered on my part, but given the way that the editing of that article was starting to go it seemed to require speedy action.

<p>I must say you have embarked on a really tiresome mission - there are a few hundreds of ESC entries to date! Unfortunately, for most of them it is really hard to tell anything more than what you can find out at the Diggiloo Trush, or what goes into the artist/country article anyway. So, I am afraid these will remain "permastubs". Also, as concerns the interpretation of the lyrics, please be aware that there sometimes is more than one possible interpretation, so you might have quite a lot controversies within this area.</p>
<p>With regard to such less "notable" ESC entries, as well as one-hit-wonder participants, how about having them all described in "country in the ESC in a given year" article, where the selection process and all other related trivia and stuff would go? This would make for a more substantial article in terms of size, as well as spare the readers some clicking. I was also wondering whether you might find the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_ESC_entry_6ede.html" title="Template:Infobox ESC entry">Template:Infobox ESC entry</a> useful.

<dd>BigHaz, I apologize for the inconvenience. In the cases of the "ugly-looking code" on your page, it was a matter of separating many "is" from "is interested in" redirects for religion userboxes as part of <a href="../../../g/u/s/WP%7EGUS_633c.html" title="WP:GUS">WP:GUS</a>. I see you already removed the redirects. You might be interested in looking at other userboxes in the directory at User:Rfrisbie/Userboxes/Religion. If you don't see what you are looking for, I am willing to help you design one or more boxes and place them as your own subpages, which could be added to the directory, if you choose. Again, my apologies, but some <i>more</i> inconveniences are inevitable from this controversy.

<dd>Apology accepted, however I would ask two things in future: Firstly, that you take the time to Preview the edits to make certain that the box (as against the code) is there. Secondly, that you not mark an edit which alters the appearance of a page as Minor. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:28, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you. I was aware of the code rather than the box being there. That was a result of unmerging the "is a..." redirects from the "is interested in..." redirects caused by admins against the "is a..." boxes. I deliberately didn't move the "is a.." boxes so they could be pointed elsewhere if users so chose. The "m" flag was at the request of "Recent changes" patrollers. I know this is not an ideal state of affairs, but I take responsibility for pissing off some people in the hopes of untangling a mess and offering people some real choices in userspace that no longer are available in templatespace. Again, thanks for accepting my apology. Also, If you still are interested in displaying any userboxes more like your links originally produced, I'm willing to help you create them in your userpages and list them on userspace directories.

<p>Hello BigHaz. Can you look at this template that <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandru_Busa_bb99.html" title="User:Alexandru Busa">User:Alexandru Busa</a> created please? I think that Alexandru is a big <a href="../../../r/u/s/Ruslana.html" title="Ruslana">Ruslana</a> fan judging by his contribs and the POV is shown in this template. AFAIK, the 14 most popular songs were selected irrespective of whether the artist was dead (<a href="../../../d/o/m/Domenico_Modugno_c08d.html" title="Domenico Modugno">Domenico Modugno</a>), in seclusion/refused (<a href="../../../a/b/b/ABBA_de88.html" title="ABBA">ABBA</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_Gall_5b08.html" title="France Gall">France Gall</a>), so I feel that Alexandru gives us the impression that Ruslana snubbed the show when she was in fact not selected for the show.

I still will have to talk to Alexandru because I feel that the template is POV, as I don't think his posts addressed my point.

As for the montage, I wrote the description in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congratulations_%28Eurovision%29_e5d7.html" title="Congratulations (Eurovision)">Congratulations (Eurovision)</a> article from my watching of my recording of the show. There was a winners' montage but there were only about 15 or so, for about 10 seconds each, it had Marie N, Charlotte Nilsson, Secret Garden, Niamh Kavanagh, Herreys, Bucks Fizz, Marie Myriam... and more but those were the most recent ones which were shown and Ruslana was not in it and I feel that they (EBU) would have just chosen whichever songs they liked as they owned the footage irrespective of what the artists thought (dead or alive).

<dd>Ironically, that's one of the very few existing ESC entries that I've not yet touched. If it'd been deleted (i.e. if responsible admins like yourself hadn't seen it), I would simply have given it the standard notability treatment per the other ESC entries - assuming that's the way to go about these things. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 06:47, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>May I bring to your attention the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkification.html" title="Turkification">Turkification</a> article. There seems to be an edit war involving a couple of Greek users who seem all the too-eager to insert some highly POVish statements. It seems that there are unable to comprehend the scope of the article and Im unable to revert for fear of breaking the 3RR. Would you take a look over there? Thanks in advance:)--<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilhan_1962.html" title="User:Kilhan">Kilhan</a> 12:27, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thats a shame because I think someone with your weight and articulation skills would help to resolve this particular situation. And really, its just one of many articles that are heavily biased against Turkey. Anyway, I understand your decision to keep out of this.
