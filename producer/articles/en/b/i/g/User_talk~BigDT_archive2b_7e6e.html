<p>I myself did google and initially came to the same conclusion as you. Unfortunately I noticed that nearly every single reference is based on her IMDb trivia page. I don't know if any of those sources are reputable. If you found something more solid, great, but if not I think leaving her off the page Old Dominion page for the time being would be best. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 06:48, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Nothing other than that ... although it couldn't possibly be but so hard of a thing to check out. At any rate, it's not "vandalism" - just a question of fact. I have no particular preference as to whether she is listed - if you want to take her back off, I won't rv it again. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 07:03, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I've been trying to do some google searches, and frankly almost every single hit is based off of the IMDb page. I'd rather stay on the safe side of things and keep her off considering there isn't any information on when she even attended the school.

<p>Thanks for tagging Interpride as a copyright violation. I just wanted to bring you up to speed on some details of process that you might not be aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you tag a page with {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">copyvio</a>}} it is customary to delete all the text from the page, in order to stop the copyright-violating text from propagating to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Wikipedia%7EForks_and_mirrors_eb09.html" title="Wikipedia:Forks and mirrors">mirror sites</a>.</li>
<li>A page can only be speedily deleted for copyright violation if:
<ul>
<li>The page was created in the last 48 hours (this one was)</li>
<li>The article and its entire history contains only copyright violation material (this one was)</li>
<li>Uploader makes no assertion of permission or fair use, and none seems likely (this applies)</li>
<li>Material is unquestionably copied from the website of a commercial content provider</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The final criterion did not apply here. A website with a .org address is not a commercial content provider.</li>
<li>You should either tag a page with {{<a href="../../../c/o/p/Template%7ECopyvio_c034.html" title="Template:Copyvio">copyvio</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-copyvio_e567.html" title="Template:Db-copyvio">db-copyvio</a>}}, not both.</li>
<li>If tagging a page with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-copyvio_e567.html" title="Template:Db-copyvio">db-copyvio</a>}}, the template {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENothanks-sd_0210.html" title="Template:Nothanks-sd">nothanks-sd</a>}} should be placed on the uploader's talk page.</li>

<td>Of course, there's a difference between assuming good faith and ignoring bad actions. If you expect people to assume good faith from you, make sure you demonstrate it. Don't put the burden on others. Yelling "Assume Good Faith" at people does not excuse you from explaining your actions, and making a habit of it will convince people that you're acting in bad faith.</td>

<td>This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Things which can cause the loss of good faith include vandalism, personal attacks, and edit warring. Assuming good faith also does not mean that no action by editors should be criticized, it only means that one should not ascribe said action to malice. Automatically accusing the other side in a conflict of not assuming good faith regardless of their motivation is failing to assume good faith in itself.</td>

<p><br />
Thank you for taking the time</p>
<p>It may be that many hits are from blog commenting, but there are 21,000 sittings according to Google. And I do not think, you think that a few people did all this.</p>
<p>With so much time on there side you don’t think they would try to get some attention from any notable media outlet, for crying out loud people with much smaller issue’s and much less time on there side get signifying more attention.</p>
<p>The truth is TTJ isn’t in the market for good looks all it does is trying to get there massage across and according to there web director (you can contact him just like I did by e-mail) they get thousands of hits a month and that satisfies them.</p>
<p>About the rabbi’s you missed the point all I was trying to say is that for example if the pope, the secretary of state of the Vatican and cardinal Edward Egan of New York sign a proclamation on something doesn’t this mean that a significant amount of people in the catholic religion think the same way?</p>
<p>The same way when rabbi’s in the position of the ones mentioned take a position on anything it carries the thinking of a nice majority if not all of satmar.</p>
<p>And about the newsletter it’s not only e-mail the reason I spoke about e-mail is that e-mail is blocked very easily and the fact that thousands of people let this in there inbox and don’t spam it means a lot in my opinion</p>

<p>there are currently numerous incorrect entries or they lack NPOV in its present state. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/e/o/User%7EPeoplestruth_d721.html" title="User:Peoplestruth">Peoplestruth</a> (<a href="../../../p/e/o/User_talk%7EPeoplestruth_01ac.html" title="User talk:Peoplestruth">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Peoplestruth_8736.html" title="Special:Contributions/Peoplestruth">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Peoplestruth, one of the goals of Wikipedia is to write articles that are neutral in their point of view. Your come across as having a message you are trying to convey in your edits. For example:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=US_Imperialism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53242963" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=US_Imperialism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53242963" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <i>The United States is the most powerful imperialist country as evidenced by the presence of US brands, corporations, culture and media in most countries.</i> IN YOUR OPINION, the US is the most powerful imperialist country. That isn't a statement of fact, rather, it is one of opinion. If you can find an article about, say, North Korean opinion on US Imperialism, a meaningful statement would be, "Premier Il of North Korea says that the US is the most powerful imperialist country".</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kilusang_Mayo_Uno&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53242566" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kilusang_Mayo_Uno&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53242566" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <i>...US Imperialism which is economic and political domination by the US and US corporations.</i> Again, you are stating as fact your opinion. You could say, "... what they view as US Imperialism ..." AND provide a source verifying that this is, in fact, their view.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_People%27s_Army&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53240956" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_People%27s_Army&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=53240956" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <i>The NPA is <b>incorrectly</b> classified ...</i> Again, this is your opinion that they are incorrectly classified, it is not a statement of fact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps. You are welcome to contribute, but you need to work to have neutral edits, not ones that push a point of view. I would suggest taking a look at this policy paper - <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>.

<p>Ok, the first two are not as strong as i'd like, but for the third one, it is technically true since the NPA was classified as a foreign terrorist organization, which they are not as they do no operate outside their national boudary. it IS an incorrect classification.</p>

<p>When using template tags on talk pages, don't forget to <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">substitute with text</a> by adding <b>subst:</b> to the template tag.

<p>"(How about if we split the difference and say, "Obviously, none of these predictions has come to pass"?)". Fine with me. We got into this linguistic mess because, originally, there were some predictions with future dates in there. So the last line said something like "have not yet come to pass". Someone took those out because they were Apocalypse predictions, rather than specific Rapture predictions. So that phrase had to be revised. Right now, I can't find any future Rapture date predictions from any prominent people, but if you know of any, feel free to add them. (If you think this is complicated, take a look at date-setting in <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_Oil_a7ee.html" title="Peak Oil">Peak Oil</a>). --<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagle_f5e2.html" title="User:Nagle">John Nagle</a> 04:12, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't know how many notable ones there are. It seems like everyone got out of the game of predicting the rapture after it didn't happen in 2000. There are plenty of random little websites where someone has their date that they have set, but those are the product of one person's imagination. I don't know of a denomination or notable individual who has predicted the rapture date recently. If you google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=2007+rapture" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=2007+rapture" rel="nofollow">2007 and rapture</a>, 2007 is a pretty popular number these days. Israel took over Jerusalem in 1967 and the rapture (obviously) has to be within a generation of Israel taking over Jerusalem and a generation (obviously) is 40 years, meaning that the rapture will be in 2007. Never mind that the same logic was used for 1988 (40 years after 1948) and 2000 (2007 minus a 7-year tribulation). But that said, I don't know that anyone notable is claiming it - just random websites with one person's opinion. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:24, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with that. Date setting seems to be somewhat out of fashion right now. <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Robertson_25ef.html" title="Pat Robertson">Pat Robertson</a> made a prediction for April 29, 2007, but he made that in 1990.

<dd>Cyde was not the one who closed that TFD. His behavior on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_Christian_82ae.html" title="Template:User Christian">Template:User Christian</a> was rather bad, but he had nothing to do with closing the sums of pi thing. As for an RFAr, if someone more familiar with WP policies and hoops and bells and whistles else wants to start one, I'd be happy to put my $.02 in, but honestly, (1) I don't care that much and (2) one way or another, it's going to be moot - either <a href="../../../m/a/c/WP%7EMACK_60e9.html" title="WP:MACK">WP:MACK</a> will get implemented or it won't.</dd>
<dd>I really don't care too much. Abuse of power is something that just irks me out of general principle. But anyway, I didn't sign up for an account so I could fight userbox wars - I signed up for one because I have an interest in Christian theology and I wanted to improve some of the woefully bad articles. I just got irked over the weekend when I saw my user page had been changed and then looked at the history and saw the vandalism on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser_Christian_82ae.html" title="Template:User Christian">template:User Christian</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:44, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
