<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBigfoot_ef17.html" title="Edit section: Bossburg Tracks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bossburg Tracks</span></h2>
<p>I see that the Bossburg tracks--famous because one of the track-maker's feet seems to have suffered from some sort of clubbing deformity--are mentioned, but the discussion of the subject is limited to the usual "where and when the trail was found" info and then the well-known (at least in bf circles) quote about nobody being "sick" enough to have hoaxed it, etc. I have an article from <i>Skeptic</i> magazine, though, about how there were some suspicious aspects to its origin, the seemingly non-sensical path the tracks took, as well as the fact that someone had hoaxed a film of an injured, limping bigfoot either before or after the discovery (a significant distinction I need to recheck); in any case, the Bossburg incident is more complicated than presented in the Evidence article. For the longest time, I thought the whole thing represented very compelling evidence--if not the *most* compelling evidence--supporting Bigfoot's existence, but there actually *is* a cogent "hoax" counter-argument. Should this be summarized and included? Massofspikes 14:40, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For this article, I would suggest a brief mention of the tracks, perhaps a pic to go with it, but a more-detailed "pro-con" entry in the separate evidence page that texasandroid created. Personally, I don't think the tracks are enough to prove Bigfoot at all. Although I believe in the existence of the animal itself, I have to agree with scientists who expect a lot more...namely a body. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 15:05, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, now I'm starting to get a bit confused. I was under the impression that, for the main article, we were going to say, in a short and introductory paragraph, basically, "Evidence exists, but is disputed, blah blah," and then provide a link to an "Evidence" page wherein we get into more detail; this is as it stands now. *My* point was that, on the "Evidence" page, where we get into those details, it doesn't present much regarding the Bossburg tracks save the usual "it would be difficult and weird to fake tracks like this" argument, with no counter-argument. I know they'll never take the place of a corpse, but the Bossburg tracks were pretty influential in that they were one of the key pieces of supposed evidence that turned Dr. Krantz into a believer. He was certainly their most vocal proponent. Anyway, the hoax argument is what I'm volunteering to provide since I have an article on hand that explains it. (If I had to break down, percentage-wise, the degree to which I believe it exists vs. the degree to which I don't, I'd say I'm stuck at something like 51%/49%; and, I, like you, know that the conundrum will never be resolved to everyone's satisfaction, regardless of *what* is found or filmed, until that something is a corpse. And even if such an animal *does* exist, I'm not so sure that'll ever happen. Then again, who says its existence *should* be verified? Would sasquatch benefit from being discovered, or would man, as is typically the case, cause it more pain than help? I, for one, would never want to see one behind bars at a zoo...)

<dd>I think a more appropriate title for articles supplementing Bigfoot would be the have "Bigfoot" first, then the additional, i.e. "Bigfoot: supportive evidence"; "Bigfoot: evidence against", etc. I would also think that since there is a large history and supportive evidence of the tracks alone, that it could qualify as a separate article in its own right. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 17:36, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay. Let's not worry about the title. It'll keep. And I think the article itself does a good job of presenting both the evidence &amp; "problems" with that evidence. What *I'll* do is add a sub-sub-heading, 3.8.3, and call it "Hoaxing of physical evidence" and use it to deal with the Bossburg tracks, with a "for example" as means of segueing into it. Yes, there *is* a sizable history behind the tracks, but there are moderately lengthy histories behind *many* of the supposedly "great" evidentiary finds. That Skookum body cast, for example, could reasonably warrant its own page (uh...it doesn't actually have one, right?), but perhaps we shouldn't overly complicate things with too, too many links...at least for now.

<dd>Well, I'll be a son-of-a-sasquatch: I see the Skookum cast DOES have its own page. (Good timing, Totnesmartin.) I'd argue that it doesn't need it, though, given that its description could just be fleshed out a little more on the evidence page...this and the fact that, on its *own* page, the only "skeptical" response is a single sentence w/o a citation. In any case, I had this idea: merge "Absence of fossil evidence" w/ "Inconclusive evidence." THEN there could be a 3.8.2 called "Hoaxing" or "Hoaxes," etc., because, save for that little mention of "hoaxing at worst" under "Inconclusive evidence" (a clause that could be removed), there's no mention at all of hoaxes as a "problem." It's under this hypothetical 3.8.2. that I could intro hoaxing with a sentence or two, then segue into the Bossburg tracks as an example of a possible hoax of what had long been considered a pretty good piece of evidence.

<p>There's an exact analogy on <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Ness_monster_9c80.html" title="Loch Ness monster">Loch Ness monster</a>, actually. I created a section on Hoaxes, but left out the iconic "Surgeon's photograph" as it had already been treated elsewhere in the article. The similarly-iconic Bossburg tracks could have the same treatment. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotnesmartin_9344.html" title="User:Totnesmartin">Totnesmartin</a> 20:38, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just FYI, before I commit it to Wiki: Looking at my source material, it offers no claim as to *how* the cripple-tracks were made, just that the tale as usually told ends with the "so sick" quote by John Napier and goes no further. What this source gives, is the *rest* of the story--that of an individual by the name of Ivan Marx who, along with Rene Dahinden (who'd moved a trailer onto Marx's property so the two could search for tracks together), were the ones to come upon the tracks. Well, actually, it was Marx who found the tracks and relayed the discovery to Dahinden. Dahinden was a little suspicious at first, though, thinking it too good to be true that such remarkable prints were along his regular search route, but they couldn't resist what seemed to be the greatest and longest trail ever--featuring a seemingly validity-endorsing deformity, to boot--even if whatever made it appeared to wander about absurdly with no rhyme or reason other than to leave over 1,000 tracks in the snow. Dahinden eventually left, but Marx kept telling Dahinden about how he'd continued finding tracks, handprints, etc., and then, if that weren't enough, that he'd videotaped the crippled bigfoot, itself. It didn't take long for the video to be exposed as a hoax, though. So the evidence of the Bossburg tracks being fraudulent is, at its core, circumstantial. Granted, there IS the chance that the tracks were real and the faked video concocted as an afterthought, but the claim is that the whole thing is tainted given the fact that Marx not only found the tracks to begin with, but was later revealed to be a person not averse to deception and hoaxing. Also, this same article in <i>Skeptic</i> throws a *little* bit of doubt on Krantz's statement that the remains of bears that have died natural deaths are never found: a wildlife biologist, Dr. Bindernagel, tells the magazine that he's found two bear skulls himself, but that there's no way to know if they died of natural causes or by human action. From this, the article postulates that, since bears occasionally ARE killed by humans and their bones found, the same should have happened with bigfoot by now, as well. Hmmm...I don't know about that. A bigfoot, should it prove to be real, isn't the same thing as a bear. I've read about people coming upon a bigfoot, convincing themselves somehow that this bipedal thing off in the distance isn't a human, having the cool and quickness to raise a gun in time, and *seeming* to shoot it, only to have it then lope off as if unhurt. I'm not so sure that a single shot with your typical rifle could fell something as supposedly large as a bigfoot. If such a wound occured, it might kill it <i>eventually</i>, but, by then, the animal would have done what a great many animals do when they're hurt or dying: gone into hiding. I mention this because I'm not sure whether it's even an argument worth including. To me, it's a lot like the "why are the pictures always blurry?" "argument" put forth by skeptics who ask the knee-jerk question but don't give it a lot of thought. Massofspikes 23:12, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>In spring of 2005 scientist conducted a study which proved bigfoot to be an actual being, more or less human but actualy a desendant of the bible figure Cane, who killed his brother Able and was cursed to walk the earth for the rest of his days. Scientist came to this conclusion after 3 years of intensive DNA research on a clump of hair. They found that Bigfoot is actualy a cross between a human and an ape. they are not yet sure how this unuseual breeding came about. After confirming the existance of the creature they furthured their research and estimate there to be anywhere from 600 to 3,000 in the continental United States with even more in Canada. they are still conducting research and are studying the habits of a family of these cretures in northern Montana. see CIA report 486 document 17 artice 12</i></dd>

<dd>So far, I get the impression that the Bossburg tracks are considered to be among the strongest evidence by serious scientists with an open mind towards Bigfoot, and we get a lot of "hoax" additions to the Bigfoot article that don't cite a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> source that calls whatever it is a hoax. So, if you want to move a well-regarded incident into a hoax section, make sure you cite someone who calls it a hoax in print (otherwise, pretty much everything about Bigfoot would be in a hoax section). <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 04:05, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, as I'm sure you've read above in my brief synopsis of the issue, the tracks were found by an individual under what you'd call either serendipitous or suspicious circumstances, depending on your beliefs. Not long after they were discovered, the very same person orchestrated what is considered by almost everyone in the bigfoot community to be a hoax: a video of a crippled bigfoot. Additionally, I've since discovered that somebody cited in the main Bigfoot article an online transcript of a magazine article that theorizes the means by which such a cast might have been made--in other words, a refutation of Krantz's claim about it being well-nigh impossible that the tracks be hoaxed--but only used the article ("Cripple-Foot Hobbled," I believe it was called) to glean the basics of the tracks' discovery. In other words, the find is not quite as "well regarded" as you think. Did you know about this Marx character and the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the Bossburg tracks prior to my brief summary? No, the <i>Skeptic</i> magazine issue I'm using as my primary source doesn't come out and say, specifically, "so, then, the Bossburg tracks are without a doubt a hoax. The End." It only mentions the discovery's many suspicious aspects and comes to the conclusion that this incident doesn't do a very good job in passing the "extraordinary-claims-require-extraordinary-evidence" test. Just as with the Patterson Film, their validity will be forever argued. Nobody made a deathbed confession regarding the Bossburg tracks, if that's what you're looking for, and Krantz (one of your "serious scientists," I'm guessing) <b>had</b> been fooled before. He mentions in his very own book, <i>Bigfoot Sasquatch: Evidence</i>, his coming upon (or being told about) footprints seeming to ascend a steep and snowy hill with a stride between them that appeared impossible for a human wearing carvings to duplicate. Once again, he thought had a sure thing. That is, until a student athlete confessed to donning fake feet, putting them on *backwards*, and running *down* the hill. In any case, when it comes to the Bossburgs, something other than the idea that "these footprints Dr. Krantz trumpeted as being real are so unique and unprecedented that they seem to validate the claim of Bigfoot-as-actual-animal like nothing else" needs to be mentioned.

<dd>I felt I had to explain my reasons because, to your understanding, the Bossburg tracks represent "well regarded" pieces of evidence among the "strongest" in existence. Apparently, you'd not heard the argument questioning their validity. As for your criterium, <b>nobody</b> can out-and-out call them hoaxes. There's no way to make that determination with 100% accuracy--everyone originally involved in the tracks' discovery and immediate analysis is dead. One source explains WHY it very likely *WAS* a hoax given the circumstances involved. Another explains HOW it could have been done. This isn't enough, though, to add to the evidence section as an example of how even the holiest and most revered of bigfoot "evidence" can turn out to be, if nothing else, highly questionable? Maybe the whole thing should be written about in the "inconclusive evidence" section instead...or, as someone suggested, given its own page. Massofspikes 01:08, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None of that is really necessary. Nobody can call it real either. All people can do is cite discussions, researchers and points that have already been published. Our personal chains of reasoning don't really matter. We don't call things hoaxes or real in Wikipedia. We just cite published researchers who call them hoaxes or real. If published material points both ways, we cite them both; for example "so-and-so says it is a hoax for such-and-such reasons, while so-and-so's opponent says it is real for such-and-such reasons". <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 15:00, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a study: Molecular cryptozoology meets the Sasquatch by Dave Coltman and Corey Davis in TRENDS in Ecology and Evolution Vol.21 No.2 February 2006. It concludes:</p>
<p>"There are several possible explanations for these results. First, as suggested from molecular analysis of hair from a suspected Yeti [1], the Sasquatch might be a highly elusive ungulate that exhibits surprising morphological convergence with primates. Alternately, the hair might have originated from a real bison and be unrelated to the Sasquatch. Parsimony would favor the second interpretation, in which case, the identity and taxonomy of this enigmatic and elusive creature remains a mystery."</p>
<p>It has one plausable origin of big foot; bipedal bisons that can just return back to all fours to escape detection. I don't know if that is interesting to anyone, though.</p>

<p>I see that most of the article is concerned with the question: "Does Bigfoot really exist?" and the debate back and forth about this point. My feeling is that most people, in the USA anyway, don't take Bigfoot seriously at all and consider him a fun folklore figure. A modest proposal: What if the article took the point of view that Bigfoot is mainly a fictional figure and had only a small section at the end on evidence of his possible real existence? At the very least it would be a lot more pleasant to read. As it is you can feel the hostility between the two sides in almost every sentence.

<p>It now reads: "<b>Bigfoot</b>, also known as <b>Sasquatch</b>, is an alleged apelike animal said to inhabit remote forests in North America, with many of the sightings occurring in the Pacific north-west of the United States and British Columbia, Canada."
