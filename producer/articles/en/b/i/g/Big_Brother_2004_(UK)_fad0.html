<p>On day 57 he was evicted following an argument with fellow housemate Shell Jubin, after which a fan of Victor's sent death threats to Shell's parents house.</p>
<p>TV critics, notably Ally Ross (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_%28newspaper%29_f6cd.html" title="The Sun (newspaper)">The Sun</a></i> TV Critic), have credited Victor for saving the <i>Big Brother</i> UK franchise, by stirring controversy and his 'straight talking' attitude towards housemates. The previous year's show had been criticised for being dull, leading to record low viewing figures and a subsequent drop in eviction votes. Viewing figures increased this year to an average of 7 million every night.</p>
<p>Since leaving the house, Victor has appeared on <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_Poker_Club_80b3.html" title="Celebrity Poker Club">Celebrity Poker Club</a> as well as various other channel 4 shows.</p>

<p>Trailed as "Big Brother turns evil", it was controversial from the start. The house was smaller and more claustrophobic; there was one bedroom; and the prize money of £100,000 was reduced if housemates failed their tasks. Big Brother promised tougher challenges as well as surprises to test the minds of housemates. The makers were initially criticised for choosing contestants specifically to boost ratings, opting for people that were openly gay (Marco, Dan and Kitten), a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transsexual.html" title="Transsexual">transsexual</a> (<a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadia_Almada_e498.html" title="Nadia Almada">Nadia</a>), a former <a href="../../../a/s/y/Asylum_seeker.html" title="Asylum seeker">asylum seeker</a> (Ahmed), and a person who claimed to be bisexual (Jason, although he later revealed that this had been a fabrication to improve his chances of being selected). This feeling soon dissipated to a large extent as the personalities of the housemates overshadowed these issues.</p>

<p>The housemates were all strong, opinionated characters. On Day 2, the housemates were to decide who was least deserving of their suitcase; they chose Kitten. On Day 5, the rebellious housemates decided to move the refrigerator into the bedroom, but the housemates (especially Kitten) were disciplined for their actions.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> However, some housemates such as Victor, did not respond well to the task. On Day 6, Emma and Kitten discovered a room; this turned out to be the Big Brother Bedsit.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> On Day 8, Kitten was ejected in the first week for constant rule-breaking. In Big Brother's first example of evil towards the housemates during the programme, £1,000 was deducted for every minute Kitten remained in the house. Therefore, there was no eviction in Week 1. At the end of Week 1, the housemates had £91,000 left in the prize fund.</p>

<p>Another task was introduced, which could have potentially made the housemates lose £10,000, involved Stuart's knowledge and Jason's strength. Stuart was required to answer general knowledge questions in the Diary Room while Jason had to spin a turntable on which the rest of the housemates sat. The housemates lost £5,000 during the task. In an interesting twist, Big Brother decided that Ahmend has not abided by the task rules and therefore another £1,000 was lost. At this point, the total was £85,000. On Day 10, the housemates were told of the first week-long task: Big Brother Food to Go, a 24/7 fast food challenge. The housemates failed the task. A fake eviction on Day 15 saw two of the housemates, Emma and Michelle, confined to the nearby "Big Brother <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bedsit.html" title="Bedsit">Bedsit</a>" where they could see and hear what was happening in the house without the others knowing. This was originally supposed to happen on Day 8, but Kitten's eviction postponed it.</p>

<p>After Emma and Michelle's return to the house, scenes of aggression and violence erupted resulting in on-site security staff having to enter the house for the first time in the show's history. Some viewers of the live feed also called the police; after a short investigation, a joint statement by Hertfordshire <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Police_e109.html" title="British Police">police</a> and producers Endemol said that they were satisfied with steps being taken to ensure housemates' safety and well-being. Police were also reportedly questioning each contestant as they left the house. Emma was moved back to the bed-sit and later evicted permanently. Several remaining housemates (Victor, Jason, Nadia, Vanessa, Marco) were given a formal warning. A psychologist on the show resigned, claiming that his warnings that Endemol's deliberate selection of housemates likely to cause conflict would lead to the fight went unheeded. Although the fight was quite destructive, almost seven million people watched the daily highlight show including the fight.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> The eviction originally planned on Day 22 was held off until Day 29.</p>
<p>Following the fight the arguments continued, but nothing on the scale of what producers refer to as "Day 20" or "Fight Night". Following an appearance on <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_UK_c4d8.html" title="MTV UK">MTV</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Request_Live_8c4d.html" title="Total Request Live">Total Request Live</a></i> Emma and Victor clashed again and had to be separated by the security on the show.</p>

<p>As a result of the fighting on Day 20, Emma was ejected from the Big Brother House on Day 23. The housemates were given a paper-maché task on Day 25, which was to create a unique housemate sculpture. The sculpture was later torn down by Ahmed. On Day 29, Vanessa was evicted. It was also revealed that the live task show would be dropped from the television schedule so that another daily highlight show could be watched in its place.</p>

<p>On Day 30, Big Brother gave the housemates another task that risked their prize fund. Before the challenge started, the housemates had £77,000, having lost £23,000 during their stay so far. Their task dealt with unscrambling the other housemates and resisting an electric shock. The contestants lost a total of £3,000 in the task, lowering the maximum prize to £74,000.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Since the rules stipulate that a replacement housemate may be added in lieu of a walkout or ejection, a surprise new housemate, Becki Seddiki, entered the house on Day 31 as Emma's replacement. She was immediately given a task by Big Brother to (based on first impressions) kiss one of the housemates and that housemate would be up for eviction. This became known as the "<a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Iscariot_cdd5.html" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas</a> kiss". She chose popular housemate Michelle, leading to her being perceived by many as a traitor, and her fate was sealed. Marco was evicted on Day 36.</p>

<p>On Day 40, a major row broke out between Michelle and Becki when Michelle saw a plane flying over the garden with the message, "The Sun - Only Becki nominated Michelle."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> On Day 42, the housemates participated in a silent protest against Big Brother. Michelle decided to steal the Diary Room camera and attempted to incinerate it using a match. Because the camera base is fireproof, this did not work. As punishment for this, Michelle was given her "first and final warning" and Big Brother burnt Stuart's cowboy hat, as Stuart sat behind the sofa in horror. Becki was evicted on Day 43 because of her unpopularity by kissing Michelle and therefore nominating her.</p>

<p>Big Brother gave the housemates a boot camp task. Jason and Michelle were selected as sargeants while the rest of the housemates were privates. In the Diary Room, Jason and Michelle were told that if the privates passed the task, then they would be up for eviction, and if the privates failed the task, then the two sargeants would be nominated. The privates passed, and all six were automatically nominated for eviction. On Day 48, the housemates participated in a dating service. Ahmed badly upset Michelle during the boot camp task and this was not well received by the public; he was evicted on Day 50.</p>

<p>The following week the flamboyant, aggressive Victor Ebuwa was evicted in a shock result that was mainly a result of a fight with Shell Jubin during a Wedding Day task. This task was also the scene for one of the most embarrassing Big Brother moments of recent times as wannabe-singer and chorister for the day, Michelle Bass, ad-libbed her way through the classical <i>Pie Jesu</i>. The housemates failed the task. Victor was evicted on Day 57.</p>

<p>The following week Michelle was evicted. The series was notable for her romance with Stuart Wilson. It is widely believed that they were the first couple to have full penetrative sex on the main <i>Big Brother</i> UK show (this having already taken place on <i>Teen Big Brother</i> in 2003), following two incidents where they made a crude tent under the dining table and discarded their microphones. However their actions were not visible, and both parties have refused to confirm or deny it, however in a recent interview with Davina on the Charlotte Church show, Michelle confirmed that "she did it" under he table. Michelle's self-confessed jealous behaviour gave some viewers the impression that Stuart was an unwilling participant in the affair, but he has stated since that this was not the case. The relationship continued after both had left the house. They have since split up.</p>

<p>Two days before the final day Stuart Wilson received only 7% of the votes to win, the lowest amount of the contestants in the house, and so was evicted in a surprise move mid-way through a party. He was told he was to leave immediately, without saying goodbye to the remaining housemates. He received a rapturous reception upon leaving the Big Brother house.</p>
<p>Nadia, as expected by all the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bookmaker.html" title="Bookmaker">bookmakers</a> (she was favourite for six weeks) won Big Brother (UK) 2004 with 74% of the vote. She was greeted by an adoring crowd who chanted her name.</p>
<p>BB5 was also notable for the introduction by two of the housemates of the 'eviction pose', which led to several evictees doing poses during <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_UK_series_6_8d5d.html" title="Big Brother UK series 6">Big Brother 6</a></i>. First Victor struck a 'cool' pose in keeping with his house 'gangsta' persona, leaning against the wall sideways on to the waiting audience. Later Dan (who could possibly have seen Victor before the inner doors closed) stood, head bowed, arms out, before lifting his head.</p>
<p>Final vote breakdown:</p>

The Big Brother 5 prize fund</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the central twists to Big Brother in 2004 was the fluctuating prize fund. Housemates could either win or lose money depending on how well they completed the task. As the winner, Nadia received £63,500, meaning that the housemates lost £36,500 during the 71 day run of the programme.</p>

<p>The housemates lost £9,000 during week one. Kitten was ejected from the Big Brother house, but she refused to leave. Big Brother decided to drop £1,000 from the prize fund for every minute that Kitten remained in the house. She stayed inside the house for nine minutes and the housemates lost £9,000. At the end of week one, the prize was £91,000.</p>

<p><cite id="fn_1"><a href="#fn_1_back" title="">Note 1</a>:</cite> In week 1, housemates had to nominate who they didn't want to receive their suitcase, not who they wanted to evict. Kitten refused to nominate. Kitten was ejected after constant rule breaking.</p>
<p><cite id="fn_2"><a href="#fn_2_back" title="">Note 2</a>:</cite> This week, housemates were told there was a double eviction, and the two housemates to be evicted were Emma and Michelle. In reality, the public had been voting which two housemates enter a secret Big Brother Bedsit, in which the two evictees would live for five days, and be able to watch their fellow housemates on a television screen, and then return to the house, still able to win the prize money.</p>
<p><cite id="fn_3"><a href="#fn_3_back" title="">Note 3</a>:</cite> Emma and Michelle made their nominations from the Bedsit. The other housemates could not nominate them, assuming them to be evicted.</p>
<p><cite id="fn_4"><a href="#fn_4_back" title="">Note 4</a>:</cite> Due to Emma’s ejection from the house, Week Three’s eviction was postponed until Week Four.</p>
<p><cite id="fn_5"><a href="#fn_5_back" title="">Note 5</a>:</cite> In Week Five, new housemate Becki arrived. She could not be nominated, and believed she could not nominate. However, Big Brother told her that she must nominate one housemate who will automatically face eviction by kissing them. If she didn’t do this, she would be up for eviction. Becki kissed Michelle, meaning she was up against the two housemates with the most nominations, Marco and Nadia.</p>
<p><cite id="fn_6"><a href="#fn_6_back" title="">Note 6</a>:</cite> Jason and Victor were banned from nominating due to constant discussion of nominations</p>
<p><cite id="fn_7"><a href="#fn_7_back" title="">Note 7</a>:</cite> In the housemates army task, sergeants Jason and Michelle were told of the twist in nominations. If the privates passed the task, all six privates would face eviction. If the privates failed, sergeants would face eviction. Privates passed, meaning the six of them faced eviction.</p>
<p><cite id="fn_8"><a href="#fn_8_back" title="">Note 8</a>:</cite> All housemates faced eviction automatically.</p>
<p><cite id="fn_9"><a href="#fn_9_back" title="">Note 9</a>:</cite> There were no nominations in the final week. With five housemates remaining, the housemate with the least public votes to win would be evicted in a surprise eviction during a party. Stuart was this housemate, leaving Dan, Jason, Nadia and Shell in the final four.</p>
