<p>Big Brother 7 Different lists of Big Brother All-Stars candidates accidentally revealed on CBS.com</p>
<p>The 20 candidates for the all-star edition of Big Brother have been (apparently accidentally) revealed CBS.com. Strangely, the site is showing at least two separate lists of possible houseguests. (The list is supposed to be officially unveiled June 21, when viewers will be able to vote for their favorites from a group of 20; only the top six will enter the house, along with a group that producers select.)</p>
<p>At 6:09 p.m. ET, I went to the showâ€™s official site and the following list of candidates, written in white text and formatted as a poll, came up instead of the showâ€™s actual site, which was visible just moments earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alison(BB4)</li>
<li>Amy(BB3)</li>
<li>Brittany(BB1)</li>
<li>David(BB4)</li>
<li>Diane(BB5)</li>
<li>Drew(BB5)</li>
<li>Erica(BB4)</li>
<li>Jack(BB4)</li>

<li>Janelle(BB6)</li>
<li>Jason(BB3)</li>
<li>Josh(BB3)</li>
<li>Kaysar(BB6)</li>
<li>Maggie(BB6)</li>
<li>Mike(BB5)</li>
<li>Monica(BB2)</li>
<li>Nicole(BB2)</li>
<li>Roddy(BB3)</li>
<li>Shannon(BB2)</li>
<li>Will(BB5)</li>
</ul>
<p>Earlier today, JokersUpdates.com posted a screenshot that showed a slightly different list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alison (BB4)</li>
<li>Bunky (BB2)</li>
<li>Dana (BB4)</li>
<li>Danielle (BB3)</li>
<li>Diane (BB5)</li>
<li>Erika (BB4)</li>
<li>George (BB1)</li>
<li>Howie (BB6)</li>
<li>Ivette (BB6)</li>
<li>James (BB6)</li>
<li>Janelle (BB6)</li>
<li>Jase (BB5)</li>
<li>Kaysar (BB6)</li>
<li>Lisa (BB3)</li>
<li>Marcellas (BB3)</li>
<li>Michael (BB6)</li>
<li>Mike (BB5)</li>
<li>Monica (BB2)</li>
<li>Nakomis (BB5)</li>
<li>Will (BB5)</li>
</ul>
<p>Why two different lists? And why is their site working sometimes and not other times? Maybe someone screwed up, or maybe theyâ€™re screwing with us.</p>
<p>I remember seeing that explained, but can't quote the source anymore. The initial list that jokers published was both a CBS mistake and correct. Once discovered, rather than indirectly validating the list by removing it, they tried to discredit the leak by posting incorrect lists to cause confusion. So yes, they screwed up AND they were screwing with us.</p>

<p>In order to follow the guidelines of the Big Brother WikiProject, once the first episode premiers, we should aim to have this page look like <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_7%29_a7ce.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 7)">Big Brother (UK series 7)</a>, which epitmizes the guidelines set by the WikiProject. This includes {{<a href="../../../b/i/g/Template%7EBig_Brother_housemates_2437.html" title="Template:Big Brother housemates">Template:Big Brother housemates</a>}} and sub-headings of the houseguests.

<dd>The UK and Australian versions air more frequently during the week, so it makes sense that their relevant Wikipedia pages are updated more frequently. Because the US version only airs three times a week, should it only be updated after an episode airs or as events occur in the house? For example, live feeds are already airing but the first in-house episode is not until tonight. Update now or then? <a href="../../../f/m/m/User%7EFmmarianicolon_02b0.html" title="User:Fmmarianicolon">Fmmarianicolon</a> 12:36, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I haven't seen the premiere, so I don't know quite how it works this season, but the US series works differently than the other Big Brother shows, so I don't know how this template is going to work.

<dd>I'm assuming you mean in a general sense, with no indications of HoH or PoV for the US series. I noticed you shot down my idea of repurposing the legendrem parameter for showing the Head of Household. I can accept that, but it seems to me that the current status of housemates should be indicated somewhere, beyond just Evicted and Nominated. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 04:00, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it shouldn't. Parameters "legendevic", "legendnom", and "legendrem" have been provided to allow editors to change the legend text locally. If left blank, the defaults are:
<ul>
<li>legendnom = Against Public Vote</li>
<li>legendevic = Not in house</li>
<li>legendrem = Removed</li>
</ul>

<dd>To my understanding, these defaults are set for circumstances particular to the current UK series, making them ill-suited for the other series, the US series in particular. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 05:15, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will of course defer to a more veteran watcher. I am a little surprised, though. For some reason I was under the impression that the rules were generally simpler for the other shows, but "against public vote" and "not in house" seem pretty confusing to me. Is it really that incorrect to call candidates for elimination "nominees" and eliminations "evictions"? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 08:41, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm not sure but colors should be something like this: Green should be HoH - HoH is "safe" Green is associated with safety. Red should be evicted - Red is often seen as a negative.

But it seems that the template parses the text in the name fields to make a link to a housemate's heading in the article. Changing the name field text would break the link. Concerning a fourth color, I don't see much need for one. But then, I am not familiar with the other series. I think if there is need for another element in the legend, it should probably be something other than a color, and be versatile enough to accomodate cases such as that of the veto. Perhaps I'll take a look at the template some more and see what I can come up with. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 18:40, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I know that this article gets augmented with information from the live feeds, and even though it is slightly annoying that after (for instance) Sunday's episode (nominations) the article already lists the veto winner (which doesn't "take place" until Tuesday's episode), I'm not going to complain about that. However, how did people know who was going to be evicted before Thursday's show? Is it not really "live" as it purports to be? Is it just filmed earlier on the Thursday? I'd think that as it generally has a number of minutes' worth of "boring" footage (ie. people standing around after someone gets evicted) that it is in fact live... â€“ <a href="../../../d/v/a/User%7EDvandersluis_3730.html" title="User:Dvandersluis">Dvandersluis</a> 17:25, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The evictions are live. In the first few weeks, the votes are pretaped due to the volume of house guests. It would take a lot longer for 14 people to vote live. Therefore, most feeders are able to tell through discussions and pre-eviction strategy. For example, feeders knew that Nakomis was going to go because Kaysar informed his alliance that they did not have the votes do they should "dump them". This meant they should forget trying to save Dedmon and, instead, tip the votes in favor of keeping Diane. Since feeders already knew of Danielle's (she made a deal), Jase's (hated Dedmon), and Marcellas' (promised Diane a vote against Dedmon) votes we just add two Season 5 votes and the votes end up being at least 5-5 for a tie. So, to make it a short answer: they watch the feeds, cobble together information from prvate talks, and make their best guess from what was said. 68.51.57.237 03:30, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't believe the current spoiler warning is sufficient for the article. Even with the warning, the infobox which keeps track of the nominations, veto, etc. is still visible on the right side of the article. Since some people seem to get off on posting information the second it happens, the infobox should probably be moved down the page, or removed altogether. Otherwise it is possible to come to this page on Monday, read the spoiler warning and intend to leave so you don't spoil the show, but then glance to the right and see a big veto symbol next to boogie's name. <a href="../../../c/j/o/User%7ECjosefy_550b.html" title="User:Cjosefy">Cjosefy</a> 13:07, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know what the answer is. I just want there to be some way to have the spoiler warning mean something. As it stands, I can't go to this article at all because the infobox at the very top gives away all the possible spoiler information. This is an issue that will continue for each new season of BB, so I think it should be taken care of. If it is possible to allow the current infobox to stay the same, yet be hidden by default, I vote for that. <a href="../../../c/j/o/User%7ECjosefy_550b.html" title="User:Cjosefy">Cjosefy</a> 19:07, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Having the infobox collapsed by default is unnecessary, in my opinion. Anyone who is concerned about absolute up-to-date info on the house status can just as easily scroll down to <i>Nominations and evictions</i>. With something as visible as the infobox, I look at it from the perspective that it's not official until it's broadcast on television. I think it'd be a decent courtesy to hold off on updating the infobox until after the Pacific broadcast. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 20:04, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>There is no must about it. In case you hadn't noticed, I wrote most of that, so nobody else has even voiced an opinion on anything that that page says.

<dd>Why don't we all just get along? There's a rather simple way we could solve this - why can't the infobox just be moved down to where it cannot be seen on the first page. I certainly don't want to see this turn into a locked entry because we can't agree on a damn infobox and keep changing it back and forth. Personally, I think the collapsable one is best, but Geoking seems to think not.

<dd>Oh, no no, we aren't fighting or anything; this is a <i>healthy discussion</i>&#160;:) Seriously though, the infobox can't be moved down, otherwise that defeats the purpose of it being there. And I just thought of something, but correct me if I'm wrong: All <i>Big Brother America</i> seasons, with exception to one, have been released on DVD boxsets, so information on previous articles will always be a potential spoiler; in which case, what makes this article any different to those previous ones, except for the fact that this season is current and ongoing? If information is currently, and will always be, a potential spoiler, it should be treated like every other <i>Big Brother America</i> article, even if the infobox was originally changed to serve a completely different purpose. â€”<font face="tahoma"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 12:02, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This isn't left - right politics or anything, but I kind of think the latest entry for Week 5 was using biased language. As if Janelle's wins (punctuated by exclaimation marks) somehow triumphed over Danielle's failure ("Danielle was very wrong..."). There is no precedent for posting anything other than what happens in the game. Let's not editorialize it. I'm not going to edit it, because we should come to a consensus.</p>

<p>How are we going to handle to Coup d'Etat in the various tables associated with this article? I know another user added an extra row (Nominations post-Coup d'Etat), and I did the same on the voting history table. But I feel as though this makes the tables cluttered, and it also doesn't answer who won the coup d'etat in the table. Perhaps there's a better way of handling it? --<a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbrown_535f.html" title="User:Mrbrown">Mr. Brown</a> 06:06, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, the Coup d'Ã‰tat will make tables cluttered. My suggestion is that the only three rows of the table should be "Week," "Nominated," and "Evicted." Nominated should be the people nominated either after the Power of Veto ceremony or the Coup d'Ã‰tat. Therefore, it only shows the two people nominated for eviction and the evicted housemate. We avoid the need to show a winner of HoH and Cd'E. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoking66_2d58.html" title="User:Geoking66">Geoking66</a> 04:01, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are people I know that have read this article have wondered if they missed part of an episode because there was live feed info in there, and they didn't remember seeing that on the broadcast. By indicating info that came from the live feed as live feed, it may be beneficial to readers who haven't kept up closely with the show. We have to remember that this article may be read by people other than fans of Big Brother.</p>

<dd>There should be a spoiler warning at the top of the article. If people start think they've missed an episode because of information that's been put in the article after viewing it on a live feed, with all due respect, that's their problem.

<p>I have to agree with the citation of live feed verses broadcast. Wiki represts information and when possible it is presented in manner consistent with saying where that information comes from. Often if this is not done wiki requests it. Just like you would not put all the information for the show on wiki without saying what week it is from; so too it is not prudent to put information that has come solely come from the webcast without citing.<br />
<b>Specifally:</b><br />
I am not refering to information that is posted prior to broadcast that will be known to everyone upon watching the next installment; I am refering to any information that would and could only be known by watching the webcast.<br />
<b>Example:</b><br />
I watched the episode where Will was evicted and I did NOT see Erica say that she had ever found out about "Operation Double Date". She did convince Jannell that it was a better strategy to get rid of Will rather than her, but this was based on both of them finding out they were both told that they were both in Chilltown followed by a comment on secret ninja moves. The fact that they realized they were being played is not the same as finding out that the plan was refered to as "Operation Double Date". This discussion needs to be address and resolved; or one might be inclined to edit the enitre piece based on only information from the broadcast. <a href="../../../c/p/r/User%7ECprockhill_2955.html" title="User:Cprockhill">cprockhill</a></p>

<p>Is it notable that for the past eight veto competitions, the winner has been one of the nominees (who then vetoed themself)?

<p>Big Brother may well be fixed, but unsourced rumors and POV editorializing do not belong on Wikipedia. If it is to be included, find a source alleging it. -- <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 02:57, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that the reference to Will and Boogie's ongoing diary room phone calls has been removed. Where could such a signature set of scenes from the season belong? In light of Boogie's teary unanswered call after Will's eviction, it seems that not including it might miss one of the most emotionally honest and genuinely sad moments of the season, if not of all 7 US seasons.</p>

<p>Please take it easy when using Boogie in the article. It gets annoying when there are 15 "Boogie"s in just a 1 week entry. 75.21.113.23 06:48, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to CBS, Mike is HoH. People keep changing this in spite of notes in the page. Please notice that at the CBS site it shows a post-Janelle houseguest list and Mike is still listed as HoH. I believe that this is because it may influence who gets to talk first/last on the final episode. Regardless, if CBS lists Mike as HoH after he has already evicted Janelle, I don't think we should be overriding CBS's definition of HoH. Sure, this will change once the winner is announced, but to remove it now is wrong.</p>

<p>The recent addition of a paragraph about speculation should get a source site; a news article, a magazine article, an article or interview on the internet...etc. Otherwise it is just a rumor. <a href="../../../c/p/r/User%7ECprockhill_2955.html" title="User:Cprockhill">cprockhill</a></p>
