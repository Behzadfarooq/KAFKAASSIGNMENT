	    <p>The <b>Big Three</b> is an historical term used in the United States to refer to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_College_b1fc.html" title="Harvard College">Harvard</a>, <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_College_c980.html" title="Yale College">Yale</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton</a>. The phrase <b>Big Three</b> originated in the 1880s, when these three colleges dominated college football<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. High schools' college admissions counselors and colleges' admissions guides sometimes use the initialism <i>HYP</i> to refer to these colleges. In the early 1900s, these schools formed a sports compact which predates the <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a>. And they continue to refer to their intercollegiate rivalries as a 'Big Three' or 'Harvard-Yale-Princeton' meet.</p>
<p>In the past, these colleges had a special, iconic status which is related to, but separate from their stellar academic reputations. When only academic reputation is considered, these three schools currently are outstanding, but not clearly separated from other top schools and, depending on which ranking is used, sometimes but not always the top three.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>These colleges have, in the past, been set apart from others by a special historic connection with the <a href="../../../w/a/s/WASP_ca86.html#The_original_WASPs" title="WASP">WASP establishment</a>; as <a href="../../../e/2E/_/E._Digby_Baltzell_1087.html" title="E. Digby Baltzell">E. Digby Baltzell</a> writes, "the three major upper-class institutions in America have been Harvard, Yale, and Princeton." Baltzell also goes on to write that "Throughout the thirties and well into the forties, Harvard, Yale, Princeton and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, were still staffed almost entirely by old-stock Protestants."<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In any case, academic factors alone do not explain the separation of these three colleges from close academic rivals, nor do they explain why they are usually named in the order "Harvard, Yale and Princeton."<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt puts them into social context:</p>
<dl>
<dd>We drew recruits from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and many another college; from clubs like the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset_Club_35b7.html" title="Somerset Club">Somerset</a>, of Boston, and <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knickerbocker_Club_a442.html" title="Knickerbocker Club">Knickerbocker</a>, of New York; and from among the men who belonged neither to club nor to college, but in whose veins the blood stirred with the same impulse which once sent the Vikings over sea. (Theodore Roosevelt, 1899) <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Of the three, Princeton University was traditionally the preferred choice of the Southern upper class.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Burt (1963) described the social prestige of the Big Three:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is, above all, the national social prestige of the Big Three which is competition with the purely local social prestige of the University [of Pennsylvania]. Upper-class boys from all over the country, including Philadelphia, go to Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Only from Philadelphia do upper-class boys go in any significant numbers to Penn. This is of course a universal national phenomenon. The pattern of upper-class male college preference, as deduced from a counting of noses in the various <i><a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Register_1606.html" title="Social Register">Social Registers</a>,</i> can be summed up as "The Big Three and a Local Favorite."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Burt goes on to note "Every city sends or has sent its Socially Registered sons to Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, in some preferred order, and to one local institution. This order varies. New York sets the pattern with Yale first, Harvard second, Princeton third, then Columbia. St. Louis and Baltimore are Princeton towns. Most other cities (Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati) are Yale towns. Only Boston, and occasionally Washington, are Harvard towns."</p>
<p>The connection between certain colleges and social ranking is old; Jerome Karabel, in a note citing Kenneth Davis, says that "in the mid-eighteenth century, the [president of Harvard] personally listed students when they enrolled, according to ... 'to the Dignity of the Familie whereto the student severally belong'—a list that was printed in the college catalogue and that determined precedence in such matters as table seating, position in academic processionals, even recitations in class."<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>. Ronald Story, however, says that it was during "the four decades from 1815 to 1855" that "parents, in Henry Adams' words, began 'sending their children to Harvard College for the sake of its social advantages.'"<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A further intensification of the importance of the Big Three occurred during the 1920s; According to E. Digby Baltzell<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup>, "in a ... managerial society, the proper college degree became the main criterion for potential elite status... it was during the [1920s] that certain institutions of high prestige, such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton (and Stanford on the West Coast) became all-important as upper-class-ascribing institutions." Not coincidentally, this was also the era when the Big Three became concerned by "the Jewish problem" and began instituting interviews, essays, and judgements of "character" into the admissions process<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup>. From the 1930s on, Big Three admissions became progressively more meritocratic, but still include non-academic factors such as "lineage."</p>
<p>Yale, Harvard, and Princeton have in the past been regarded as the goals for many children in <a href="../../../w/a/s/WASP_ca86.html" title="WASP">WASP</a> circles. Some educators have attempted to discourage this fixation. Jay Mathews, author of <i>Harvard Schmarvard</i>, addresses seniors obsessed with HYP, and similar prestigious institutions, with the analysis, "It does not matter where you go to school, it matters what you do when you get there and what you do after you graduate." It is notable that according to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_Review_c6c9.html" title="Princeton Review">Princeton Review</a>, Harvard is ranked as the #2 "dream school" among US college applicants in 2005, with #1 being <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a>.</p>

<p>The actual academic quality of the three colleges is a matter of judgment and debate. So is their selectivity. Yale had the lowest admissions acceptance rate (8.6%) among major US colleges in 2006, with Harvard and Princeton coming in second and third. While the information may be outdated, U.S. News ranks Harvard as most selective, followed by second-place Yale (even though they have the same inter-quartile SAT range among their entering class).</p>
<p>US News' rankings place a high value on low admissions rates, small class sizes, and high rates of alumni giving; which disfavors larger institutions, which may reject as many or more applicants, but nevertheless have higher admissions rates. They also disfavor schools with math and science-based curriculum, as well as public schools, because they tend to have a lower short-term graduation rates.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_2002.html" title="September 2002">September 2002</a> issue of <i><a href="../../../w/o/r/Worth_%28magazine%29.html" title="Worth (magazine)">Worth</a></i> magazine ranked <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high schools</a> on the basis of the number of students from those high schools <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matriculation.html" title="Matriculation">matriculating</a> at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. <i>Worth</i> magazine argued that the three schools were "three of the most selective Ivy colleges; the term HYP has come to signify the elite college standard."</p>

<p>Over the past half-century, the 'Big Three', and the rest of the Ivy League, have increasingly stressed both diversity and academic merit in their admissions process, and in part have freed themselves from some of their WASP roots. Notwithstanding, their students, on the whole, lack in economic diversity. As Jerome Karabel, a Harvard graduate and the author of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chosen_%28Jerome_Karabel%29_4fc8.html" title="The Chosen (Jerome Karabel)">The Chosen</a></i> detailing the history of the admissions process at HYP, noted:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Big Three are notoriously lacking one of [diversity's] most critical dimensions: class diversity. In a study of the percentage of low-income students in 2000 (as measured by the proportion of federal <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pell_Grant_e543.html" title="Pell Grant">Pell Grants</a> - need-based awards that do not have to be repaid and make up the bulk of many poorer students' aid) at the nation's leading universities, the Big Three were found to be among the nation's least economically diverse schools. Of the 40 universities studied, Harvard and Princeton ranked 39th and 38th respectively, with Yale at 25th. While the three top universities in economic diversity were all public institutions (the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Los_Angeles_9767.html" title="University of California, Los Angeles">University of California at Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley_70e2.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">UC-Berkeley</a>, and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_San_Diego_00bc.html" title="University of California, San Diego">UC-San Diego</a>), the next two - the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Southern_California_4e4b.html" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a> - were private.

<p>The three colleges, when named together, are often named in the order Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.

<p><b>Harvard-Yale-Princeton</b> (variously <b>HYP</b>, <b>H-Y-P</b>, <b>H/Y/P</b>, the <b>Big Three</b>, or the <b>Ancient Three</b>) is an athletic association involving <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>, <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>, and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>. The athletic agreements among the three universities were first formalized in 1906, although their <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">football</a> teams had been engaging in three-way competitions, which newspapers had been referring to as "HYP", since at least the 1880s. The Big Three made further formal agreements in 1916 and 1923, and although in part they have now been superseded by the <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a>, formed in 1945, the three universities still sponsor events that involve only themselves.</p>
<p>The first Big Three agreement in 1906 was the result of a conference on football called by President of the United States <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Roosevelt_3623.html" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> in October 1905 as a result of deteriorating relations, particularly the exclusion of Princeton by Harvard and Yale, and increasing violence of play. The agreement of June <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a>, the <b>Triple Agreement</b>, was originally proposed by President <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> in December 1909 out of a desire to reduce injuries, and took several years to come to fruition, resulting in common eligibility requirements. The Three Presidents' Agreement agreement of January 1923 covered financial arrangements, scouting, and scholarships, amongst other things. In 1926 there was a disagreement between Harvard and Princeton, that caused a hiatus in the Big Three that lasted for 8 years.</p>
