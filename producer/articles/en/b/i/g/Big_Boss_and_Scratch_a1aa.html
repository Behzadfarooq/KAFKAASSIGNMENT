<p>Big Boss is Empire City's worst nightmare. He's Empire City's most nefarious of all criminals and the mastermind behind the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crooks.html" title="Crooks">Crooks</a> organization that's made up entirely of professional burglars, <a href="../../../m/u/g/Muggers.html" title="Muggers">muggers</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thieves.html" title="Thieves">thieves</a>. Big Boss, however, will not tolerate illegal drugs and used his influence to keep them out of Empire City (unknown to the authorities, though). He rules the criminal world with a literal iron fist, using his cybernetic left hand to smash things when enraged, especially his desk (in the comic adaptation). He talks like <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_G._Robinson_87cd.html" title="Edward G. Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a>, nearly always uttering a soft spoken 'mahh' as he speaks to himself, his thugs, foes, or anyone else.</p>
<p>In the toy series as well as once in the episode <i>The Case of C.O.P.S. File #1</i>, he is seen carrying a strange cane he uses as a rifle weapon. Surprisingly fast and agile despite being a grossly <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obese.html" title="Obese">obese</a> 350 pound man, Big Boss makes sure that no criminal caper goes on without him knowing about it and giving his approval. He's also never without his personal yes-man named <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squeeky_Kleen_1737.html" title="Squeeky Kleen">Squeeky Kleen</a>, who serves Big Boss hand and foot. He is seen with three moles on the upper left hand corner of his forehead and a white suit with about four <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police.html" title="Police">police</a> badges on them that he uses as trophies after he brought down four <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_officers.html" title="Police officers">police officers</a>, who foolishly dared to challenge him to battle and lost.</p>
<p>In the comic series, Big Boss has a personal grudge against Bulletproof for sending his twin brother, the Crime Boss of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, to prison. Big Boss's brother later died in confinement - thus nephew <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserko.html" title="Berserko">Berserko</a> (his brother's son in the comics) ended up under his care, much to Big Boss's constant annoyance.</p>
<p>Big Boss shares similarities with such other criminal villains as <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lex_Luthor_a258.html" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a>, the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingpin_%28comics%29.html" title="Kingpin (comics)">Kingpin</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Thorne_121f.html" title="Rupert Thorne">Rupert Thorne</a>, with one exception - he is never shown to be involved in any legitimate business practices. It is assumed all his wealth comes from crime.</p>

<p>Big Boss is never without Scratch who keeps him company everywhere he goes at all times.

<p>Big Boss hates to get his suit dirty and in this episode, Big Boss orders a new stain resistant suit made to completely resist dirt. But, when Bowser, Blitz, and Highway came to take down <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berserko.html" title="Berserko">Berserko</a>, Rock Krusher, and Squeeky Kleen, Berserko witlessly threw the suit at the COPS causing the chemicals inside the suit stolen from a <a href="../../../l/a/b/Laboratory.html" title="Laboratory">laboratory</a> to get screwed up, causing the suit to act as a big magnet, attracting all the dirt directly at Big Boss.</p>
<p>Big Boss, very enraged, ordered his crooks to fix up a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula.html" title="Formula">formula</a> that could reverse the effects of the ill-fated suit and get the dirt away from him. Squeeky had to have <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._BadVibes_and_Buzzbomb_86f4.html" title="Dr. BadVibes and Buzzbomb">Dr. BadVibes</a> make out the formula hoping that would cure him of this dirty predicament. Later, Squeeky was able to escape from the C.O.P.S. and raced back to Big Boss at his <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penthouse_apartment.html" title="Penthouse apartment">penthouse</a> with the formula and, at his order, splashed the formula on him. The viewer then saw the dirt get dissolved away - and the suit too, revealing Big Boss' <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pig.html" title="Pig">pig</a> trousers, a white sweatshirt, and an angry Big Boss chasing after Squeeky Kleen.</p>

<p>Big Boss has a mother known as Big Momma who paid him a visit in Empire City in this episode to accompany him to an <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auction.html" title="Auction">auction</a> brought on by Commissioner Highwaters to raise money for charity. Big Boss had to struggle to be good in front of his momma even though it was pretty difficult thing to do for a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kingpin" class="extiw" title="wikt:kingpin">kingpin</a> such as Big Boss. He even had to hide his true colors from her by pretending to run an <a href="../../../o/r/p/Orphanage.html" title="Orphanage">orphanage</a> with his crooks posing as <a href="../../../o/r/p/Orphans.html" title="Orphans">orphans</a>.</p>

<p>Big Boss is a very greedy, selfish man who took all the glory for himself in this episode when he awarded the Crook of the Year Trophy to himself after <a href="../../../b/u/t/Buttons_McBoomBoom_5aa2.html" title="Buttons McBoomBoom">Buttons McBoomBoom</a> and Berserko duked it out with each other to see who should be voted Crook of the Year.</p>

<p>Big Boss wishes to make all of Empire City his own and will do whatever it takes to do it, whether that is taking the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> hostage in <i>The Case of Big Boss' Master Plan</i> or, in this episode, using The Ground Shaker to level the city to the ground, destroying it, unless all of his demands are met. But thanks to the C.O.P.S., the machine is destroyed, Empire City is on solid ground once again, and Big Boss' penthouse is flooded with Big Boss and Squeeky Kleen inside trying to make a getaway before the now non-existent earthquake, hits the city.</p>

<p>Sometimes Big Boss likes to take advantage of the city's problems and uses it to his own advantage. In this episode, Empire City has lots of financial troubles and Mayor Davis has declared that all unnecessary <a href="../../../e/m/p/Employment.html" title="Employment">employment</a> in Empire City must be eliminated. Bulletproof had to assure the C.O.P.S team that the C.O.P.S. organization is not one of those unnecessary employment areas. However, Big Boss made C.O.P.S. to be one of them by faking retirement and took off to a tropical island hideaway, anticipating the C.O.P.S. to be given the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_slip.html" title="Pink slip">pink slip</a>. Afterwards, Big Boss returns to pull a heist on the Empire Central Railroad train that's coming to Empire City to deliver relief funds to the city, which was successfully thwarted by Bulletproof, Mainframe, and Mace, who all got their jobs back afterwards.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Boss_and_Scratch_a1aa.html" title="Edit section: The Case of the Lowest Crime">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Case of the Lowest Crime</span></h3>
<p>For all of his faults, however, Big Boss has one good virtuous point: his dislike of illegal drugs. He refuses to deal in them and has used his influences to keep them out of Empire City (Although, the legal authorities are unaware of this.). When the Crystal Twist epidemic, brought on by Addictem, severely hits Empire City, it hit Big Boss personally head on when his bumbling nephew, Berserko accidentally fell into a large cache of the drug product, temporary putting Berserko into a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coma.html" title="Coma">coma</a> and had to be rushed to the <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a> immediately. Big Boss is deeply worried about Berserko. Even though Berserko is very stupid and screws up a lot, Big Boss really cares about him. After all, Berserko is family. So, Big Boss decides to personally get involved.</p>
<p>The C.O.P.S. have been so busy with the resulting crimewave as a result of the appearance of Crystal Twist (even <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longarm.html" title="Longarm">Longarm</a> was affected by the drug product), they haven't had time to trace the source of the drug. Big Boss enters the precinct to offer his help. He brings along Buttons McBoomBoom, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mace_and_Nightshade_3caf.html" title="Mace and Nightshade">Nightshade</a>, and <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_BadVibes_and_Buzzbomb_114f.html" title="Doctor BadVibes and Buzzbomb">Buzzbomb</a> to assist the C.O.P.S. in their efforts to stop the drug plague.</p>
<p>Bulletproof reluctantly agrees to a truce and accepts Big Boss' help. The C.O.P.S/Crooks alliance wastes no time chasing Addictem, the one responsible for the epidemic, all over Empire City until he arrives at the Empire City Hospital, where he ends up being caught by Berserko, who has awakened from his coma. There, Addictem is arrested by the C.O.P.S. and hauled off to jail. Bulletproof admits he is surprised that Big Boss has done something good for Empire City. Then, he receives an alert that Big Boss' crew has returned to their thieving ways and it looks like things are back to normal for both the C.O.P.S., the Crooks, and the city.</p>
