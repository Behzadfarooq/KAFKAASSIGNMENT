<dd>There are various multicamera areas in the house. Because of switching between cameras not everything that happens is always recorded. Sometimes they might be recording from another camera when something happens and it is missed. A camera is always running in the toilet and presumably it can be switched-to whenever something broadcastable happens in that room. The times when housemates are actually <i>using</i> the toilet are not broadcast. When people have locked themselves in the toilet for other reasons such as to be away from the other HMs these moments have sometimes been broadcast. Housemates are allowed to speak via telephone to a psychologist for one, one-hour session each week or more if required. These sessions take place in the diary room and are not recorded. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 02:20, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>the article features reference to Product Placement as being a bad thing. For the 2 million people who watch the show it's obviously not that much of a turn-off and let's not forget the show costs money to produce so if they can't raise revenue we'll be stuck with re-runs of "Everybody Loves whats-his-name"</p>
<p>The only people complaining about it regularly are those on one particular unofficial 'fan' site that seems incapable of finding anything nice to say about the program, the producers, the housemates or the hosts. Makes you wonder why they expend so much effort. And they seem to have brought their little campaign of hate here.</p>
<p>Also... what proof is there that the link to the unofficial site mentioned in the entry is "the most popular"? I suspect that certain portions of this entry have been corrupted by their negativity and would question it's impartiality <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 211.26.10.138 (<a href="../../../2/1/1/User_talk%7E211.26.10.138.html" title="User talk:211.26.10.138">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_211.26.10.138_cc30.html" title="Special:Contributions/211.26.10.138">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>that's just personal opinion, and probably the view of those who also buy stuff from spam. it's a fact of life that just about every show or movie features product placement. BB is less guilty in this respect that many other shows. It helps to pay for the show, just as the 'BB proudly brought to you by' bumpers and commercials in between the segments. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 211.26.10.138 (<a href="../../../2/1/1/User_talk%7E211.26.10.138.html" title="User talk:211.26.10.138">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_211.26.10.138_cc30.html" title="Special:Contributions/211.26.10.138">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The website refers to it as <b>Big Brother Australia</b> only once as I can see - in the footer and I suspect (but admittedly don't know) that's more to do with it's licensing with Endemol to differentiate it from other countries shows.

<p>Is it worth mentioning under a Trivia section perhaps that Australia's version has a "no-smoking" policy,(and smokers on the show are forced to quit) this is particulary noticeable to someone like myself who having just recently moved to the UK, and in the UK version people are often seen smoking (dare I say it chain-smoking) even.</p>

<p>I changed one caption (on <i>Uncut</i>) before realising that many pics now have new captions. Is it really necessary to describe the colour of the title graphic pictured, when that graphic is pictured? Explaining that "The above title, is blue", and "The above title, is darker blue" seems redundant when we can see it for ourselves. I also think it is wrong to say that "The theme of Friday Night Live, is orange". Just because the makers of the show switch the colours around occasionally, to claim that the colours used form a <i>theme</i>, and that they are <i>symbolic</i>, is a real stretch. Maybe they just change the colours for variety, and to look pretty? Sure purple often represents passion, and that might be why it was chosen for <i>Adults Only</i>, but then to also infer that green is symbolic of <i>nominations</i> and that orange represents Friday Night Live seems pretty questionable. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 05:09, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some good commentary on the stupidity and sociology of various aspects of the show are at the site <a href="http://www.eyeonbigbrother.com" class="external free" title="http://www.eyeonbigbrother.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.eyeonbigbrother.com</a> site. Comments are both insightful and to be commended. Particularly appreciated by the older watchers of the show. Could this be added as an external link on the page please? The site is equally as valuable as the Behind Big Brother Australia site, if not more so. As well as the commentary, there are links to a Chat Room and Feedback from Readers of the site.</p>

<dd>Hi, I'm connected with eyeonbigbrother.com (not my site, but I help out occasionally). I appreciate the consideration of including the link. I actually attempted to get the site included, for the very reason of giving a resource for users seeking criticism of the show. The response was apathetic, and eventually shot down by barrylb. You can read my request for re-inclusion on his talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Barrylb/Archive_1#Big_Brother_Australia_external_link" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Barrylb/Archive_1#Big_Brother_Australia_external_link" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Obviously, the season is almost over for this year but it would be nice for wikipedia to recognise the value of the site as a resource of the criticism that the show has garnered over the course of this series. I can also assure you that the request above was entirely independent of eyeonbigbrother, and the quote that you suggest is "an attempt at self-advertising" was infact a legitimate comment based on the experience from my previous attempt to include the link. Of course, it would be appreciated if you would reconsider this decision; which after all was removed as a result of only one users actions, and the ensuing silence of all others. Hopefully the site, which has received attention and interviews from other media outlets such as syn fm and Sydney Morning Herald (with an article published by the author of the site featured this week) will now have proven itself worthy for inclusion into wikipedia. --Dust77 00:19, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be a mini edit war going on about the wording 'seasons' vs. 'series'. If you want to be consistent, this needs to be shown in the article titles as well. In that light, to me it seems the best idea to be consistent with what the production company itself uses on their website, which is 'series', as can be seen on <a href="http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/news/article_15.asp" class="external text" title="http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/news/article_15.asp" rel="nofollow">their own website</a>. This is also consistent with the other article titles that are already existent. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">Joanne</a><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoanneB_dae6.html" title="User talk:JoanneB">B</a> 20:47, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The word occurs there, yes, a couple of times.

Also, take a look at the 'rules' that they set up (linked in my previous comment here): the word season is used, once, but most of the time they use 'series'. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">Joanne</a><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoanneB_dae6.html" title="User talk:JoanneB">B</a> 21:24, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not really all that fair - most instances of the word series are used in references to a particular series - <i>Series 6</i>, <i>Series 5</i>, <i>Series 4</i>. The way the word season is used on the website is exactly the same way I'm saying it should be used on the article; and its usage in that context shouldn't be changed. If something in Wikipedia articles says <i>series X</i>, it should really be changed to <i>Big Brother 200X</i>. But I'm not suggesting that everything be changed; I think the word season should be used when it's used in a way similar to the way it is used on the website. —<font face="tahoma"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 21:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi all, today I've added an external link to our site <a href="http://www.big-brother.com.au" class="external text" title="http://www.big-brother.com.au" rel="nofollow">Big Brother Australia Unofficial Forum</a> and it got removed with a reason that it was spam. I think that our site is as valuable as behindbigbrother. Let me give you an example this year there was an incident on the show and the official forum was closed because people started discussing the issue and the officials didn't wanted them. We were the once that provided that opportunity to viewers to share their opinion with others. We've been out there since BB 06 started and already our page ranking is higher than behindbigbrother (fluctuating between 4 and 5). We've been interviewed about the incident and how people reacted. We've been giving information on chat with evicted bb members (Dino for example). Also for the period of 4 months we got 12000 members contributing on our forum. If that's not enough what else do we have to do to prove that the site should be added as an external link? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by SolitaryBG 01:28 UTC, 7 August 2006 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SolitaryBG_01%7E28_UTC%2C_7_August_2006_0213.html" title="Special:Contributions/SolitaryBG 01:28 UTC, 7 August 2006">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Should the fact that Big Brother 2002 have the first companion Celebrity edition be included in Facts?</p>
<p>Should there be a mention that in the first 3 series, there was charity side and psychological side to the show? (i.e. evicted housemates had items auctioned for charities on ebay, and there was the mastercard challenges for the HMs to win money for themselves and charities, and then on Uncut, they had guests to explain the behaviour) These were lost in later series.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think Celebrity Big Brother should be put in the facts section, but I think everything else should go in the relevant seasons' articles. <sub>J Di</sub><sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a></sup> 10:16, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think the Facts section needs to be here. I know it is there to summarise information, which makes this sound even more odd (to me), but information in the Facts section is in the rest of the article. Other information should be on the articles of the individual seasons. Some of the information there is non-notable as well. I'm not saying that it needs to go, but I'd like to know what other people think about this. jd || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 15:06, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
