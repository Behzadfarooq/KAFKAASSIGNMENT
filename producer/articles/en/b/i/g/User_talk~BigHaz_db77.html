<p>Now that I'm here, feel free to put any questions/concerns/comments below (preferably in their own section) if you want me to respond. Please specify where you want any responses (if they're necessary). Unless otherwise specified - or unless there's a good reason to do so - I'll reply here. Further, I can and will reply to deliberately inflammatory remarks in order to provide context, should the situation escalate or be at risk of doing so.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why an article was deleted, please read <a href="../../../w/h/y/Wikipedia%7EWhy_was_my_page_deleted__3f96.html" title="Wikipedia:Why was my page deleted?">this page</a> first. It should at least serve to clarify the situation, even if it doesn't give you an answer. I'm more than willing to answer, of course, but I'll assume that you've read it through.</p>
<p>I can now also be Emailed if you feel that that's a better way to do things. I can't say that I'm a convert to the idea just as yet, but we'll see how it goes. If you want to guarantee a fast response, please accompany your Email with a comment here (just something like "check your Emails" or "I've commented on the such-and-such by Email" should do the trick).</p>
<p>Where archiving is concerned, I'll archive all "dead" discussions when the page gets too long and leave "live" ones out for a while. That way we don't run the risk of having bits and pieces scattered everywhere. If you want to "resurrect" a dead discussion, just let me know and I'll do the Dr Frankenstein impression.</p>

<p>You deleted my Randolph's Law entry. A number of us here in the Quizzo community of Philadelphia want it back. The plain fact of the matter is that the phrase is in local usage. If you'd like to see a citation online, the best I can do at the moment is <a href="http://quizmasterchris.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://quizmasterchris.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://quizmasterchris.blogspot.com/</a> which is the blog I recently started for the quizzes I run.</p>
<p>I'm new to entering anything on Wikipedia, and I don't know what the next step is, but I think your arbitrary deletion is ridiculous; it amazes me that you've determined from the other side of the planet that people here in a certain subculture aren't using a piece of slang.</p>
<p>I don't plan to spend hours &amp; hours of discussion on this. If you want the email addresses of Quizzo players in this area who can back me up on this usage, I can provide them. You took this down, I think the bulk of the work in putting it back up is your responsibility.</p>

<dd>Not so. I don't for a moment deny that a particular subculture uses the word (and indeed in my own experience of pub trivia quizzes, it's certainly got a ring of truth to it). The point is, though, that Wikipedia rests on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> (which is provided by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> which are independent of the subject and non-trivial, usually discounting blogs) rather than truth. When the term catches on with the broader community, it's a term which can have an article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <strong class="selflink">Schreit mich an</strong> 21:45, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who died and made you the decision maker as to what the "broader community" is? Clearly all of Wikipedia - and in fact reality - contains all manner of local terminology. I'm abundantly sure there's all manner of FARK-isms related to FARK.com on here for example, and that's only language used within a single website, which is little more than a high volume blog. I am absolutely stunned that someone like you has all day to click through Wikipedia and delete all of the articles you don't think are important enough. This is my first experience trying to append Wikipedia &amp; I don't find this response to be at all welcoming, encouraging or helpful. I don't find your response to be at all acceptable; what's the next step? Sincerely, Crandolph (incidentally both this comment &amp; the preceding one were very obviously "signed" - look at the text, I signed my user name AND actual email address - I'm just new on here so I don't know all of the quirky little custom details.) While I'm at it, you'll note that a whole lot more time, effort, bandwidth and usability could've been had if you just let things alone instead of fighting me on this.</dd>

<dd>In terms of me being "the decision maker", I'm not. As an administrator, I simply work within the guidelines and policies established by consensus over the period that Wikipedia's been operating. One of these is the requirement for independent and non-trivial sources to be supplied to assert the notability of anything having an article. That's not <i>my</i> policy, it's the policy of Wikipedia. If there's local terminology, FARK-isms or anything else here which doesn't live up to those standards, you're welcome to mark it for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletion</a> yourself or let an administrator know so that they can delete the article in question. However, <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">the fact that there are other articles not living up to those standards</a> doesn't mean that this particular article is able to be kept in any way - it simply means that nobody's done anything about those other articles yet, which is the way of things when you realise that this website is run on an almost exclusively volunteer basis. I don't "have all day" to look at articles, no. It just so happened that this particular one was recently created at the time that I was looking at the recently-created articles. Someone else may have found it faster or slower than me. My intention is not to "fight you on this", either. I'm more than happy to help you get to know your way around the place, but adopting a belligerent attitude in relation to my explanation of what happened isn't a good jumping-off point.</dd>
<dd>If you don't find my response to be acceptable, you have a couple of options. The first is to find reliable, independent and non-trivial sources and write the article again. You can even run them by me or another administrator first to see if they are in fact the kinds of things I'm talking about if you want. That way, assuming the sources can be found, we'd have an article on our hands. The other option is to go to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> and see what the people there think. They'll be able to view the article as it was when I deleted it and see whether it should be recreated. That said, DRV takes time and effort and in this case is highly unlikely to overturn my decision as it was policy-based. I'd recommend the first option, if you want an opinion. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <strong class="selflink">Schreit mich an</strong> 00:18, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You clearly contradict yourself here; if you're an "administrator" by whom I should "run things by" and if you're deciding what is and isn't "non-trivial" and "independent" then you're very clearly also a decision maker. Yes, yes you are.</dd>

<p>No, I have no inclination to waste my time and defecate all over the hard work of other concerned people by deleting their posts. I can see editing posts, I can't see deciding that what other people think is important is in fact trivial and untrustworthy and needs to be removed. I also value "truth" above "consensus." You win, you put the time in, this is your toy. Enjoy it. Keep in mind that none of this makes me think of Wikipedia as a useful or reliable tool. What it makes me think is that I should remove it from my list of reliable, unbiased reference sites on my pub quiz blog. Have a nice life. Crandolph --Crandolph 06:46, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the record, you've misinterpreted my comments. There are accepted standards for what a "non-trivial source" is and what "independent" means. It's not a free-for-all by any means, because obviously that way lies madness. My offer of "you can run this by me" was from the perspective of an experienced user who's familiar with the way that both terms are used here. You'd be welcome to run the exact same things by another experienced user if you feel that you wouldn't get a fair hearing with me, but there <i>are</i> objective standards for these things and what I was offering to do was to help you in the application of them. In much the same way, if I were to join your pub quizzes, there would probably be terms and rules (objectively defined) which I wouldn't necessarily latch onto immediately. You or another experienced pub-quizzer would be in a position to help me understand them.</dd>
<dd>You're welcome to view "truth" as being greater than "consensus", but that's both a false dichotomy and a misapprehension of how Wikipedia is intended to work. "Consensus" is not the opposite of "truth", but rather the general agreement of most users here that things need to operate and be sourced in specific ways. You're welcome to oppose that consensus, but I don't think you'll get particularly far. "Truth", on the other hand, is (surprisingly enough) not the watch-word for what gets included. "Verifiability" and "notability" are. You'll not find a single encyclopedia - open-source and online or professionally published - which has an entry for absolutely everything in the world, so I fail to see why Wikipedia should instead. Britannica, Americana and whatever other encyclopedias you can name all have standards, and Wikipedia has them too.</dd>
<dd>It's somewhat ironic, but if you believe that the removal of your article demonstrates why Wikipedia should not be seen as a "reliable, unbiased source", you've actually demonstrated that you wish it to be neither. Without the same procedure which operated to delete your article, there'd be nothing stopping people from creating articles on nonsense or from editing articles to include nonsense with impunity. In both of those cases, I'd hesitate to use Wikipedia as a reliable and unbiased source (unless, of course, I felt compelled to argue that the elephant lives in trees or whatever else some lunatic felt like adding). Presumably, the next time someone's preparing a quiz question about "Randolph's Law", they'll have to look elsewhere. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <strong class="selflink">Schreit mich an</strong> 08:41, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Context:</b> As should be rather obvious from the foregoing, this was a simple case of "Why is my pet neologism no longer here?" I'm in two minds about leaving the link to the user's blog (which someone has already kindly commented on with the Notability page, although he's assumed it was me), although it explains why the article in question has now been protected. Those who are interested in how it is possible to entirely misunderstand what "encyclopedia" means are welcome to hunt for the post on his blog, paying attention to the mistaken claims of what I'd have allowed to stay (foreign language slang or whatever, apparently). Just be careful of the sour grapes underfoot, since clearly the Pub Quiz community bites. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <strong class="selflink">Schreit mich an</strong> 00:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking at my recent deletions, I assume you're talking about Alessandro Volta Elementary School. As can be seen from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Alessandro_Volta_Elementary_School|deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&amp;page=Alessandro_Volta_Elementary_School|deletion" rel="nofollow">log</a>, I deleted it as an advertisement. This is because the tone of the article was that of an advertisement and not that of an encyclopedia article. If you'd like help in improving the tone, I'd be more than happy to help out with that. As a second point, though, please remember that blanking my User page is a form of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a> and not something you should be doing as a way of making your point heard. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <strong class="selflink">Schreit mich an</strong> 04:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. I see exactly where you are coming from, with the list. I wanted to start a list with many names of explorers from the time of 1400-1600, but that only spans 200 years. It has been deleted (what good fortune) and so I may create another list named Early Explorers 1200-1600. That way, it will be just better in so many different ways. Thanks again for helping. It really helps&#160;;)</p>

<dd>You're welcome. I can't guarantee to be much use, since my knowledge of that period in Europe is frankly abysmal, but I'll do what I can. The trick is always going to be the context of the thing, though.

<p>I just checked, and you did block him correctly - for 24 hours, with your comment being "persistent vandalism on Holocaust article - keep an eye on him"&#160;:) If he vandalises again, you might want to consider an indefinite ban because the account is only being used for vandalism.&#160;:)</p>

<p>I am respectfully requesting that you withdraw both your [prod] tag and the [hoax] tag from this article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) because it is not a hoax -- this is a matter which has been under "discussion" within the fan community for some time, and while Guiness are unlikely to reprint all their books, it is likely to persist until the new edition is released in the Autumn clarifying the position.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) because is is surely improper simultaneously to recommend the deletion of an article as a hoax, and to recommend deletion because the issue of a hoax has been raised. Unless , of course, you belong to the Wiki-<a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">Cabal</a>, but in that case you would have deleted and salted already.</dd>

<p>In short, this is a genuine controversy and one which, IMHO, deserves recording for its duration, for the benefit of those who seek clarification.<br />

<dd>In response to your two claims: Firstly, it may well not be a hoax, but I can find no evidence online of the fan community (or anyone else, for that matter) discussing it. If you can provide evidence of that discussion, you're welcome to add it to the article and remove the tag. Secondly, I'm not quite sure what you mean by ascribing those actions to me. I'm recommending the deletion of the article for the reason outlined in the Prod tag, that is that there appears to be no controversy. If there is no controversy, then claiming that there <i>is</i> controversy is an attempt at either creating a hoax or seeding controversy here (which is obviously a bad idea, since as an encyclopedia Wikipedia exists to describe existing controversies rather than start new ones). Given that there's no tag for "there is no controversy", I went with the first option. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <strong class="selflink">Schreit mich an</strong> 21:52, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Which is, of course (and I'm not ascribing it as your fault) where we ht the Wiki Stone Wall. If you know about it personally, and cite that knowledge, the Cabal delete everything as <a href="../../../o/r/_/OR_1d00.html" title="OR">OR</a>; if you cite fan-based discussions, it gets deleted as not notable or not sourced, and the likelihood of anyone in the accepted media discussing a fan nit with Guiness BoR (an English institution, even before one of the borthers was killed in an extremist incident) is next to zero. Whereas, if you're one of the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">Cabal</a>, you just write what you want, secure in the knowledge that anyone who tries to disagree will be switched out by your colleagues. Thank you for listening. I don't thank you for being (IMHO) *wrong*, but thank you for listening. -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 07:16, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I can see your frustration, and I'll give you this much. If you can find anything which actually mentions it (whether it's fan-based or not), and it's added to the article, I'll go into bat for the article. I can't guarantee anything, but if there's something out there online I'm willing to at least <i>try</i> to come to the party on this. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <strong class="selflink">Schreit mich an</strong> 07:21, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>It was innocent playing around. We're best friends. It's really awesome that you'd do that for someone though, don't get me wrong.

<dd>I thought there was perhaps another interpretation, so don't think I actually added a warning template or anything (which I didn't). It just looked a tiny bit suspicious at the time, but I'm glad to see there was nothing nasty going on. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <strong class="selflink">Schreit mich an</strong> 01:49, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
