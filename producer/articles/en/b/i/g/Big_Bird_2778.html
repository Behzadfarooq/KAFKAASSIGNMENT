</div>
</div>
<p><b>Big Bird</b> is a full body <a href="../../../m/u/p/Muppet.html" title="Muppet">Muppet</a>, featured on the children's television show <i><a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i>, which airs on <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Broadcasting_Service_0dd7.html" title="Public Broadcasting Service">PBS</a>. Since <i><a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i> began, America's most famous 8 foot 2 inch big <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow.html" title="Yellow">yellow</a> <a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird.html" title="Bird">bird</a> has entertained millions of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-school.html" title="Pre-school">pre-school</a> children and their parents with his wide-eyed wondering at the world. He is sometimes referred to as "Bird" by his friends.</p>
<p>Performed by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroll_Spinney_d8ce.html" title="Caroll Spinney">Caroll Spinney</a> since 1969, this big yellow bird can <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roller_skate.html" title="Roller skate">roller skate</a>, <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_skate.html" title="Ice skate">ice skate</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dance.html" title="Dance">dance</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singing.html" title="Singing">sing</a>, write <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poetry</a>, draw and even ride a <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicycle.html" title="Unicycle">unicycle</a> — pretty talented for a character described in the TV show's writer's guide as a 6-year-old bird. But despite this wide array of talents, he is prone to frequent misunderstandings, on one occasion even singing the alphabet as one big long word, pondering what it could ever mean (see <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC-DEF-GHI_83e1.html" title="ABC-DEF-GHI">ABC-DEF-GHI</a>). He lives in a large nest behind the 123 Sesame Street Apartment and he has a teddy bear named Radar (a nod to <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radar_O%27Reilly_db2f.html" title="Radar O'Reilly">Walter "Radar" O'Reilly</a> of <a href="../../../m/2A/a/M_A_S_H_%28TV_series%29_6762.html" title="M*A*S*H (TV series)">M*A*S*H</a>, who had a teddy bear and was also lovably naive and innocent).</p>
<p>This character helps children feel okay about not knowing everything because he himself does not know everything, and encourages them to inquire: a common Big Bird phrase in recent years has been: "Asking is a good way of finding things out!". In addition to letters and numbers, he also teaches other life lessons: "I guess it's better to be who you are. Turns out people like you best that way, anyway."</p>
<p>For many years his best friend <a href="../../../a/l/o/Aloysius_Snuffleupagus_4480.html" title="Aloysius Snuffleupagus">Mr. Snuffleupagus</a> ("Snuffy" for short) was deemed as imaginary by the human cast. Every time Snuffy would visit, he would coincidentally leave just before the adults arrived. Despite not being believed by the adults, Big Bird continued to assert that Snuffy was real. In the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> a string of high-profile child sexual abuse cases caused <i><a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Workshop_98f5.html" title="Sesame Workshop">Sesame Workshop</a></i> (then <i>The Children's Television Workshop</i>) to eliminate this running gag, fearing that children would take to heart the message that, if adults don't believe something out of the ordinary, they'd be just as well off to remain silent. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Big Bird took center stage on <i>Sesame Street</i> in the early 1980s, when the show dealt with the death of storekeeper <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Hooper_2f51.html" title="Mr. Hooper">Mr. Hooper</a> (necessitated by the death of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Lee_99e0.html" title="Will Lee">Will Lee</a>, the actor who played the role). Big Bird's realization that Mr. Hooper wasn't just gone temporarily, and Big Bird's acceptance of Mr. Hooper's death, have been hailed as a milestone in children's programming. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Big Bird's big screen debut, <i><a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_presents_Follow_That_Bird_8315.html" title="Sesame Street presents Follow That Bird">Sesame Street presents Follow That Bird</a></i>, he is sent by a bird social worker to live with a foster family of dodos. He soon runs away from his new home to get back to Sesame Street but he is <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidnap.html" title="Kidnap">kidnapped</a> and dyed <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_blue.html" title="Baby blue">baby blue</a> by two ratty <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circus_%28performing_art%29.html" title="Circus (performing art)">circus</a>-owners.</p>
<p>Big Bird also had a role in the feature film <i><a href="../../../e/l/m/Elmo_in_Grouchland_51c5.html" title="Elmo in Grouchland">Elmo in Grouchland</a></i> and several other movie-length features such as <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bird_in_China_bd2b.html" title="Big Bird in China">Big Bird in China</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bird_in_Japan_62b1.html" title="Big Bird in Japan">Big Bird in Japan</a></i>.</p>
<p>While Big Bird is generally deemed a canary, when he visited the <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighborhood_of_Make-Believe_4941.html" title="Neighborhood of Make-Believe">Neighborhood of Make-Believe</a> in episode 1483 of <i><a href="../../../m/i/s/Mister_Rogers%27_Neighborhood_4a16.html" title="Mister Rogers' Neighborhood">Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</a></i> (which aired on Wednesday <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_3.html" title="June 3">June 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>), Big Bird shared with X the Owl that he is in fact a Golden Condor. On the same program, when King Friday XIII asked him if he was related to the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassowary.html" title="Cassowary">cassowary</a>, Big Bird replied, "I'm more of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condor.html" title="Condor">condor</a>."</p>

Big Bird's Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As <a href="../../../m/u/p/Muppet.html" title="Muppet">Muppeteer</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroll_Spinney_d8ce.html" title="Caroll Spinney">Caroll Spinney</a> has aged, the show has gradually started to train new performers to play Big Bird. These apprentices include both <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Lyon_0c50.html" title="Rick Lyon">Rick Lyon</a> in the opening theme song of the show's 33rd season on, and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Vogel_35a7.html" title="Matt Vogel">Matt Vogel</a> in the show's <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journey_to_Ernie_2b4b.html" title="Journey to Ernie">Journey to Ernie</a> segment.</p>
<p>Caroll Spinney was sick during the taping of a few first season episodes, so Daniel Seagren performed Big Bird in those episodes. He also performed Big Bird when he appeared on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ed_Sullivan_Show_37bd.html" title="The Ed Sullivan Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></i> in 1969. According to <i>The Story of Jim Henson</i> by Stephanie St. Pierre, the costume was built for Jim Henson to perform, but when Jim Henson tried it on, <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kermit_Love_fdba.html" title="Kermit Love">Kermit Love</a>, who had built the costume, didn't think that Jim Henson was walking like a bird is supposed to walk, and Jim decided not to perform Big Bird. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Oz_3baf.html" title="Frank Oz">Frank Oz</a> was offered the part, but since he hated performing full-body characters, he turned down the job.</p>
<p>The Big Bird performer is completely enclosed within the costume, and extends his right hand over his head to operate the head and neck of the puppet. The muppeteer's left hand serves as the Bird's left hand, while the right hand is stuffed and hangs loosely from a fishing line (which can occasionally be seen in closeup shots) that runs through a loop under the neck and attaches to the wrist of the left hand. The right hand thus does the opposite of the left hand: as the left hand goes down, the right hand is pulled up by the fishing line. For some of the Journey to Ernie segments, a second puppeteer (usually Jim Martin) controls Big Bird's right hand. He is concealed by dressing in a body suit the same color as their <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chroma_key.html" title="Chroma key">chroma key</a> background (something that obviously can't be done on the main Sesame Street set).</p>

<p>While many <i>Sesame Street</i> adaptations use characters similar to Big Bird (such as the green parrot Abelardo on <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Plaza_Sesamo_4e85.html" title="Plaza Sesamo">Plaza Sesamo</a></i>), some even use the exact same character. On <i><a href="../../../z/h/i/Zhima_Jie_60c5.html" title="Zhima Jie">Zhima Jie</a></i> in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>, Da Niao (大鳥) lives in a nest at the park. Sesame Workshop refers to him as a cousin of the American character. The producers of <i>Sesame Street</i> however usually demand the bird to be renamed. On <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>'s <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesamstrasse.html" title="Sesamstrasse">Sesamstrasse</a> he's called Bibo, as he appears as the same puppet character, just redubbed in <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a>. In Portugal, he's <i>Poupas</i>, or <i>Poupas Amarelo</i> (<i>amarelo</i> means <i>yellow</i>). In the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> he is completely replaced by a separate character, a large, light blue bird with a much shorter beak than Big Bird, called <i>Pino</i>. Pino is also somewhat more childish than Big Bird but is said to be the cousin of the American Big Bird. In <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, Big Bird's counterpart was a tall, pinkish female bird called Gallina Caponata (lit. Caponata the Hen) who hosted Barrio Sesamo from 1979-1980. More recently in Spain, the name Gallina Caponata has been transferred to the American Big Bird character in the dubbed version of Play With Me, Sesame. In <i>Susam Sokağı</i>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> adaptation of Sesame Street; is in more of an orange tone than yellow, and despite his size he's called as "<i>Minik Kuş</i>", meaning "Little Bird". In Mexico, he cannot be called "Big Bird" because in their country, "bird" refers to a man's anatomy, particularly the penis. Therefore, a different name is used: Abelardo. The <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> version (<a href="../../../v/i/l/Vila_S%C3%A9samo_dcc7.html" title="Vila Sésamo">Vila Sésamo</a>) was called Garibaldo and was blue, not yellow. On Egyptian Sesame Street (Alam Simsim) the full body puppet similar to Big Bird is a furry green creature called Nimnim (Tiny).</p>
