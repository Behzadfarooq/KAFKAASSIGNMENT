<dd>The question of whether certain <a href="../../../s/u/c/Successor_states.html" title="Successor states">successor states</a> should most aptly be designated as brand new entities that have undergone an outright "resurrection" like the mythical <i><a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_%28mythology%29.html" title="Phoenix (mythology)">Phoenix</a></i> that arose from the ashes of its former grandour. Or, on the other hand, if is it more helpful to understand Serbia-Montenegro as a <i>de facto</i> continuation of the former state - one whose capital, currency<sup><i>?</i></sup>, army, and [for a while] name it inherited. The same would apply for Turkey, Russia, Colombia, Austria, Pakistan and other "<a href="../../../r/u/m/Rump_state.html" title="Rump state">rump states</a>" or dismembered states, that have decreased considerably in vastness. I'm not quite sure just what I'm trying to say here - other than that a descrpitive definition would propbably be in order just below each heading. 8v] <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 14:09, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<li>As for successor states, in the case of the USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Ottoman Empire, etc, the dissolution of the union caused several new independent states to emerge. With the freedom of Ireland, the United Kingdom continued to exist parallel to the Republic of Ireland. So, I suppose there could be different classifications for reconstituted successor states (USSR-&gt;Russia, Ottoman Empire-&gt;Turkey) and another for simple dissolutions (Czechoslovakia-&gt;Czechia/Slovakia). I'm not particularly interested in charting border changes for independent states (UK-&gt;UK and Ireland, Ethiopia-&gt;Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea).</li>

<dd>Hm..

My point is simply that the retension of the <u>name</u> and <u>flag</u> of a state that loses or gains territory in my mind signifies the continuation of a state rather than the founding of a new state (or the restoration of an ancient state). <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 15:12, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<li>Yes, I do have your namespace pages watched, Nighstallion. They're handy-dandy.</li>
<li>"Koavf" means "King of All Vext Fans." It comes from a 1999 comic book called Vext, by <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Giffen_1f78.html" title="Keith Giffen">Keith Giffen</a>. In issue five, there was a contest, and I won it, since I was the only person that entered (it was cancelled with the next issue.) Since I forgot to give them my address, and the editor of the book left DC Comics right after that, I never got my award, so as a consolation, I crowned myself KOAVF. Not too exciting, but there you have it.</li>

<p>Hello again! Mindful of <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a> and your contributions on geographic articles, I've drafted a 'provisional' article with definitions and maps of prominent entities containing <i>America</i>. I'd very much like your input on its talk page, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Is the proposed article title sufficient: "...in/of the Americas", "Regions of the Americas", etc.?</li>
<li>(2) Are there any notable territories I'm missing, or are the definitions deficient somehow?</li>
<li>(3) Can you suggest a way to better render the maps? I've a vision of how I want them to appear (two columns on the right side of the article), but my knowledge of the coding to get there is admittedly limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember this is a draft, not public.&#160;:) Once I get feedback from you and others (over the next few days), I will place this as a legitimate article and include links in appropriate articles.</p>

<dd>Hello EPA. As you would have noticed, I was being bold and so I went right on ahead and made my suggestions experimentally directly in your draft page. I didn't really have all that much to add, it actually looks rather complete as it is. But as always: maps, diagrams, standardized infoboxes, bulleted lists, charts and tables are all stylistic elements that appeal to people such as myself (e.g. when seeking inform,ation from a textbook, webpage or newspaper article), and so large blocks of prose might rather be converted into these forms. Just a thought on pedagogical detail/style here...</dd>
<dd>Anyhow, happy wikibreaking, and do let me know if there are other projects that my attention ought to be drawn to<i>!</i> =J <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 15:29, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>I'm all for consistency. I comtemplated putting everything into a columnar chart/table and or expanding the definitions, but I don't want to subjugate the article – intended as a primer of sorts – to possibly <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">subjective, endless editing</a> (that we're all too familiar with with the other geographical articles). As usual, I've gone to some effort to at least <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite sources</a> and rationale, and to create consistent maps for clarity. As well, wikilinks to the appropriate detailed articles oughta suffice.</dd>

<p>Hey Big Adamsky, I noticed that you made an edit that replaced a map that a cartographer created and I helped to update with numbers for the Peripheries of Greece. By removing such map (and the "Local Government" section), you essentially eliminated a whole section that included links to main articles (like "Peripheries of Greece"), as well as cut out a map created by a fellow cartographer. Next time, I suggest that you put a request in to the map creator, or an entry in the discussion page before blindly replacing the map. For one - the map you replaced it with is harder to read and is thumbnailed, with no reference to the main article about the Peripheries. Would you agree? I went ahead and replaced the original map and cleaned up the list - Please, please leave it as it is - it is a nice reference for the page. Thanks! <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 1:10 1MAR06 UTC.</p>

<dd>Hi Libra. The main article linked to in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html#Local_government" title="Greece">that section</a> also features the same numbered map, which the text refers to with corresponding numbers. The only drawback is that the numbered map shows only one layer of administrative divisions, viz. the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peripheries_of_Greece_cd90.html" title="Peripheries of Greece">peripheries</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/e/Image%7EGreece.geohive.gif_5459.html" title="Image:Greece.geohive.gif">The map that I had contributed</a> gives also the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefectures_of_Greece_26c5.html" title="Prefectures of Greece">lower level of local government</a>, all in the same map. As for thumbnail readability, its size is adjustable, no problem, and it is meant for you, the reader, to click on it to view it in full size. Thanks anyway.&#160;:) <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 12:39, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Hey, please don't think I am starting something here - the map you found is a great, detailed map. I just didn't think it was fair to remove the whole "Local Government" section which had links to the Peripheries main article. I moved the detailed map that you included with the Peripheries and Prefectures to the main article page of the Peripheries... I hope this will suffice! Unless we can somehow rewrite the main page edit of Local Government to include your map there with a lead-in to the more detailed map (and map numbers) on the Peripheries page... what do you think? <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a> 9:36 1MAR06 UTC</dd>

<dd>One other thing - don't forget that the map you are including is all in GREEK, and English users NEED to have the numbered map for the ENGLISH equivalent (since, technically, this is being posted in the English pages). Just a thought. Tell you what - if you rewrite the main page article of Local Government to include your map with a reference to more detail on the Peripheries page, I will work on updating the Peripheries page to include a more detailed map (with numbers) of the Prefectures... what do you think? <a href="../../../r/a/r/User%7ERarelibra_30fe.html" title="User:Rarelibra">Rarelibra</a></dd>

<p>Hi. You asked me briefly about the 3RR. The <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> intends to counter revert wars. That's all... it is by itself not the means to block vandals. More importantly, admins are requested not to take sides, so all involved parts may be temporarily blocked. So keep that in mind when you revert. It should not be considered a punishment though. For that reason, it is also not applied retroactively.</p>

<dd>Hello. You are most probably right about that.

As I stated on the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Talk%7EFinland-Swedes_c059.html" title="Talk:Finland-Swedes">talk page</a> a while ago, I think the highly inflammatory statements about the "world's most pampered minority" needs to be followed by a general discussion on <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_minorities.html" title="Model minorities">model minorities</a> and the mechanisms and dynamics of majority-minority relations in general.&#160;:) <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 20:31, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Hi. I sent messages to some Swedish Wikipedians recently whom I had noticed wrote articles on Swedish topics. You were not off the top of my head a contributor on Swedish topics, and I probably forgot many others that have written great articles. Anyway, related to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_1.0_24e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia 1.0">Wikipedia:Wikipedia 1.0</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStable_version_9108.html" title="Wikipedia:Stable version">Wikipedia:Stable version</a>, on getting stable article versions for eventual printing, etc. So if you know of any "decent" articles, perhaps have written yourself, you can nominate them at <a href="../../../s/w/e/Wikipedia%7ESwedish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board_Swedish_quality_articles_9d99.html" title="Wikipedia:Swedish Wikipedians' notice board/Swedish quality articles">Wikipedia:Swedish Wikipedians' notice board/Swedish quality articles</a>.

<p>Thank you for your recent contributions to Greenland related articles, including the subdivision templates (you got that from Swedish wikipedia?).

<dd>Hello Jens! Yes I, too, thought that the series of articles could use a template for administrative divisions, since Greenland is listed under administrative <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subdivisions_of_Norden_7689.html" title="Subdivisions of Norden">subdivisions of Norden</a>. And so I copied the one from the Danish WP, however I removed the region South Greenland, which to my understanding is an <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_informal_regions.html" title="Lists of informal regions">informal region</a>, but not a separate county (<i>amt</i>). I also created one for the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Template%7ESubdivisions_of_New_Caledonia_ec5b.html" title="Template:Subdivisions of New Caledonia">New Caledonian provinces and municipalities</a>.</dd>
<dd>In my opinion, since they are all stubs, they do not merit having separate articles to differentiate between municipalities and settlments/towns. One article is enough to explain to the reader that the name of the main town can also refer to a vast area of wilderness and includes smaller settlements, as well. Besides, if the municipalities <i>were</i> to have entries of their own, we would have to make dab-pages for every single name for the reader to choose. <b>:v)</b> <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 12:41, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Hi - well it just looks better (to me, at least) to have the content of a box contained within a border so as to visually separate it from the text of the article itself. You don't agree? Most templates follow this style, not because they <i>must</i>, just because that has been deemed preferable. <i>//<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Adamsky_7ebf.html" title="User:Big Adamsky">Big Adamsky</a> 14:06, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</i>

<dd>Hi&#160;:). Well i don't think so. many templates are too big, and it's a good thing to give readers an option to hide/show them. This was the main reason to reformat to div's. but I think it's possible to reformat them in order to have padding, just i don't see such a need. --<a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETasc_7881.html" title="User:Tasc">tasc</a> 14:14, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Woah, I'm not sure I fully understand the exact meaning of all those terms - all I know is that it tends to help the reader if the article is well structured, both in content and in graphical apperance.

As for Pacific islands, I guess the atolls mentioned explicitly could be easily pinpointed, but open-sea tests where only a territorial sea is cited are slightly trickier to locate. But the question is, does it really matter? As I see it, the reader/viewer gets the general picture anyway.

<dd>Ah, sorry about that, NS (just checked the edit history...). I think my mind might have been stashed elsewhere while I was idling around doing random fixings. My reason for changing the size of the tiny image was that I couldn't get it centered in the field and also that I thought it was too small for such a dark and cluttered image.

They are provinces, but just as countries are countries and we don't suffix them with the word 'country' I think the rule should be the same for provinces, but it's up for debate!&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/o/z/User%7EJoziboy_398a.html" title="User:Joziboy">Joziboy</a> 23 March 2006, 16:32 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments. Could you clarify further on the flags please? All the five are the current flags and not of the previous era. Well, the map predominantly shows southern India and Sri Lanka. And thus I think we can live with country borders visible in the corners (as you would see, I have specifically excluded that mention from the legends). Nicobar, sure, as a Danish colony, but I could not find a reference to that effect specifically for the given time-period (and am still wondering why <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> reference excluded it as well...).

<p>About French communes, the rule on Wikipedia (and elsewhere) is to include the article la/le/les whenever this article is an official part of the name. It is not a matter of personal decision, it is just a matter of following official names as they appear on INSEE website or other official French government websites. In France you don't have the same kind of confusion in placenames that may exist in other countries like, say, Brazil. So if the French government officially says the particle is part of the name, then we use it (e.g. <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Blanc-Mesnil_1c28.html" title="Le Blanc-Mesnil">Le Blanc-Mesnil</a> or <a href="../../../l/27/%C3%AE/L%27%C3%8Ele-Saint-Denis_1638.html" title="L'Île-Saint-Denis">L'Île-Saint-Denis</a>), but if the French government says the particle is not part of the name, then we don't use it (e.g. <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mont-Dore_e87d.html" title="Mont-Dore">Mont-Dore</a> in Auvergne, or Rivière-Salée in Martinique). Do you see what I mean? There's no room for personal decision making here. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 22:36, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the feedback; remember, the poll is still formative but I think good to go. Since there are literally <i>reams</i> of talk pages/discussions which concern the topic, most of which is rather <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flame_wars.html" title="Flame wars">circuitous</a>, a succinct précis of the issue is necessary to provide context (hence the intro). Moreover, I think this has proved useful in prior polls. As for the actual leads, this one in particular, I'm not necessarily in disagreement with being upfront; however, recent article instability has resulted from an unwillingness or inability (intractable, I think) of various sides to accept what <i>was</i> a conciliatory version (with a wikified note) for weeks.</dd>
