<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vesna's surname</span></h2>
<p>Why is Vesna the only houseguest without a last name listed in the sidebar? Does she not have one (unlikely), or is it just that nobody knows what it is (and why not)? You'll have to forgive me, I'm located in the U.S. and can only keep up with the series from the official website, so my information is a little limited... --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatadyBag_273f.html" title="User:PatadyBag">PatadyBag</a> 22:12, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it's probably because noone knows it. I might go and see if I can find it on google right now. I don't beleive the official website has the surnames, which is odd. <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclone49_674c.html" title="User:Cyclone49">Cyclone49</a> 12:39, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't know where the custom of the official media (show, website) not broadcasting the housemates surnames came from. As far as I know they have never done it - only in third party media such as newspaper articles. With a first name like "Vesna" you would think google would be able to find it pretty easily, but it doesn't appear to be that way! <a href="http://www.behindbigbrother.com" class="external free" title="http://www.behindbigbrother.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.behindbigbrother.com</a> is another handy resource for BB AU stuff. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 13:05, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Most media outlets have media-liason agreements with Endemol Southern Star, which involves not revealing surnames until the season ends.

<p>Could someone that is a hardcore fan of the series please add information regarding the "belindagate" incident that supposedly happened in the 02 or 03 series. (Apparently housemate belinda admited something illegal and the producers covered it up)</p>

<li>Hi, I've added information under '2003' about Belindagate. I also anonymously added some information about the "Uncut" problems in 2005.

<p>In the Friday Night Live section, it describes the 3 prizes. I deleted a part of a sentence about the rewards room. It said this</p>

<dd>Week one winner Glenn took friend Logan. The first male/female couple to enter the room was Rachael and Tim.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I personally think that's unnecessary. If you list the first two people, why not list them all? Also why would we need to know the first male/female couple. Post your opinions here, put it back if you want, but with EVERYONE who has been in the rewards room, rather than the first and the male/female couple.</dd>

<p>Barry,</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could please refrain from removing the link (www.insidebigbrother.com) from the Big Brother (Australian TV series) page.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.atienmedia.com/insidebigbrother/" class="external free" title="http://www.atienmedia.com/insidebigbrother/" rel="nofollow">http://www.atienmedia.com/insidebigbrother/</a> and <a href="http://www.insidebigbrother.com" class="external free" title="http://www.insidebigbrother.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.insidebigbrother.com</a> are completely different sites owned by different people. They have nothing in common.</p>
<p>I understand that you do not think that it should appear on the page, but I have just started helping with the insidebigbrother website and would like it listed on this wikipedia page for everyone to enjoy. The content on insidebigbrother relates entirely to Big Brother, so there is no reason why it should not be able to be listed. I could understand if the site had nothing to do with Big Brother, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is all about free speech and free content.</p>
<p>We are hoping that people will enjoy the insidebigbrother.com website throughout 2006, so we would appreciate it if you could please leave the hyperlink on the Big Brother (Australian TV series) page.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

If it's notable/useful/popular, someone without a direct connection to the site will add it. --<a href="../../../q/i/r/User%7EQirex_bef6.html" title="User:Qirex">Qirex</a> 10:36, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not long ago there were a heap of links to Big Brother related pages, but they were all taken down. These were not all added by people who own Big Brother site. There is no reason why the link should be taken down.</p>
<p>The link is not harming anyone. It is just informing people of the website and hopefully people will enjoy going to the link.</p>
<p>If you could please refrain from removing it, that would be much appreciated.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New format</span></h2>
<p>I'm not really sure about this new format with the old housemates in a new page and the seasons reversed. Personally I feel it's actually more cluttered this way, and IMO the old format was much more easier on the eyes. Considering every other Big Brother page (plus the Idol pages) use the old format, I don't why this one shouldn't use the old format as well. <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclone49_674c.html" title="User:Cyclone49">Cyclone49</a> 11:25, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I made the changes. At the time I thought the page was looking stale and needed a lift. The old housemate details, whilst still valid information, is mostly redundant now. I find every other international page on Big Brother a little crowded and ugly-ish as well&#160;:( Ideas? -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> | <a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">Talk</a> 11:35, 27 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's a bit premature at the moment. Considering it's only going to increase by a couple of paragraphs each <b>year</b>, it probably shouldn't be done until the article gets large enough to warrant it. I've noticed the UK did have quite larger articles on each season back when it was on one page, so it probably did need to be seperated, but I think we should wait a while before we do it with this article. At the moment the information on each season is quite small, so each article would be barely be more than a stub. Perhaps if the information on each season gets extended quite a bit it might be a good idea to do the change you sugegsted. <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclone49_674c.html" title="User:Cyclone49">Cyclone49</a> 13:08, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My deletions</span></h2>
<p>I am deleting this bit from "Criticisms":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>despite the fact that the rules state there is no television viewing in the house (although the rules also state that Big Brother can change the rules at any time, and since Big Brother himself allowed the screening, this can be included in "changing the rules").</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Claiming there is some of problem with the producers of the show showing a program when "the rules state there is no television viewing in the house" seems silly. Clearly the rule is meant to refer to ordinary broadcast television, not the special videos and broadcasts that Big Brother shows on the plasma screen as part of the show's normal proceedings. All series of Big Brother have featured live and video images over the plasma screen be it Gretel talking to the housemates or farewell massages from evicted housemates. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">MinorEdit</a> June 29, 2005 00:58 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism / What the?!?!?!</span></h2>
<p>This entry under "Criticisms" has me puzzled:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The unpreparedness and the subsequent poor handling of the Merlin Luck affair by producers and host Gretel Kileen in 2004.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems rather POV to me. Was this really a criticism? Speaking of POV, I saw the show and thought Gretel handled it very well. The person who did not handle it well was Merlin. He was staging a protest, but wouldn't speak. Not too good a protest then, as all the points he presumably wanted to make all went unsaid, and nothing was discussed. Gretel handled it so well, that she in fact extracted an apology from Merlin when he returned for the following day's Nomination show. Actually I did hear one criticsm from none other than George Negus, when he indeed claimed that Gretel was not prepared for a politcal protest on Big Brother. Clearly an assertion I disagree with. I can only assume that this former 60 Minutes reporter has never watched the show or seen Gretel in action: she is clearly an extremely intelligent woman and skilled live TV presenter, and has dealt with any unexpected eventuality on the shows I have seen. I'm going to evict this entry soon if no strong objections. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">MinorEdit</a> 13:03, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is more a question about the show, than the article - <i>In a departure from usual procedure, candidates were not required to send in videos of themselves as had been the case for prior auditions. Instead, the producers toured major Australian mainland cities and conducted interviews.</i>. I find this strange, seeing as they wouldn't have found their previous 2 winners (<a href="../../../r/e/g/Regina_Bird_4489.html" title="Regina Bird">Reggie</a> from Hobart or <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trevor_Butler_8aa1.html" title="Trevor Butler">Trevor</a> from Broken Hill) had previous seasons been done this way. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 06:44, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Who knows why the producers changed their methods? Perhaps they thought it would be quicker and easier than sitting thru all those tapes? Perhaps they figured people from smaller places who really wanted to apply would travel to the auditions? Possibly they figured that after four seasons where people could send in a tape, all those likely to do so, had done so already? Maybe they wanted to open things out to those without access to a digital camera or without the inclination to send in a tape but willing to attend an audition? Perhaps they thought they'd get a different breed of person applying this time. Probably all the above are true to some extent? The recently evicted Kate (BB Aust 2005) indicated on her eviction that she finally auditioned this year because of the switch from sending in a tape to attending auditions. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">MinorEdit</a> 06:58, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">PLEASE move that "spoiler" regarding the winner</span></h2>
<p>I went to wikipedia to send a weblink to a co-worker to tell her of BB Australia. Though I expected there to be up-to-date news regarding the winner of the season, I didn't expect it to be given away without any warning. Under the line that says "Spoiler warning" the VERY NEXT LINE gives away the warning. (Quoted below). Just less than 15 words away gives the winner. If this had come at the END OF THE ARTICLE or somewhere lower that I had to look to find, then the ending (which I have yet to watch) would not be ruined for me. Very VERY frustrated at the lack of understanding regarding this.</p>
<p>Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.</p>
<p>The Winner of Big Brother 2005 is 'Logan Greg', who, because of co-currently entering the competition with twin brother 'Logan David', shares his AU$ 865'000 prize money. Runner-up, Tim, who was tipped to win, went away with the usual prize winnings.'</p>

<p>Barryb and Longhair,</p>
<p>If we can sort this matter out amongst ourselves (as advised by Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution) that would be best.</p>
<p>Otherwise I will be making a complaint. www.insidebigbrother.com is an unofficial site such as www.behindbigbrother.com. There is no reason why one should remain and not the other. If insidebigbrother.com is removed for the reason of "self promotion" then why is behindbigbrother.com not removed for the same reason?</p>
<p>I have been an active member of insidebigbrother.com and helped contribute to the website through articles. I would like to see the site remain on wikipedia.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned previously, it offers unique content and also services such as the inside big brother tipping competition - something that other sites do not have.</p>
<p>I do not feel the reason of "self promotion" is valid when removing the link. It is dissapointing to see this kind of behaviour on wikipedia, which is governed by many users.</p>
<p>If you still feel that insidebigbrother.com should not be added as a link, and you believe that behindbigbrother.com should be added as a link then I ask that we seek mediation from a sysop.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David - a fan of insidebigbrother.com (and also behindbigbrother.com too for that matter).</p>

<p>The site is also in the unique by the way it offers big brother tipping, something that other australian big brother sites do not offer. I would like to point out that the tipping feature is of worth.</p>
<p>and yes, the site does use google adsense and displays advertising, but so does behindbigbrother.com.

<dd>Please tell us - how many real users are there? How popular is your site? When was your site first established?

<dl>
<dd>Barry,</dd>
</dl>
<p>The insidebigbrother.com site was first established in mid 2005 so we had our own domain name and moved from free hosting. People have added it to Wikipedia who are not closely associated with managing the site. Doing a search via google you will also see that it is added to other big brother related websites and not by people managing the site.</p>
<p>As for the question "How popular is your site?" - that data should not be needed to suffice a link on wikipedia. I see that question as intruding, and one that I don't feel I need to answer. "How many real users are there?" - again I believe that to be intrusive - and 'users' is a broad descriptor.</p>
<p>And now a question for you if that is okay,</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does behindbigbrother.com stay, and insidebigbrother.com get removed?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you say "because it has been around for a long time" and "it is popular" I do not see those as valid reasons. I believe it is about the quality of the website, and the services they have to offer. Behindbigbrother.com is a great website and I believe it should remain, but insidebigbrother.com I also think is a great website and should also remain.</p>
<p>(Both sites are very similar, yet insidebigbrother offers services such as tipping which we had a programmer write for us. Isn't it best to give potential users more choices? offer them tipping?)</p>
<p>I honestly cannot see why insidebigbrother.com is being removed, it is not spam - it is content rich with specialised programs that we had programmed for us. Why do you take it as spam?</p>

<p>I am the webmaster of Behindbigbrother.com. I don't want to turn this into war of the fansites, but on repeated occasions I have found insidebigbrother to be copying directly from my website. Here is an example: This news story, "<a href="http://www.behindbigbrother.com/showarticle.php?articleID=659" class="external text" title="http://www.behindbigbrother.com/showarticle.php?articleID=659" rel="nofollow">FNL gets pre-BB6 spinoff</a>" was directly copied word-for-word by insidebigbrother <a href="http://insidebigbrother.com/showarticle.php?id=70" class="external text" title="http://insidebigbrother.com/showarticle.php?id=70" rel="nofollow">here</a> (they just edited out the credit to the user who submitted the story). Insidebigbrother was born out of an imitation of behindbigbrother.com - they use the same news engine as us and conveniently started using Google Adsense a few days after it was put on behindbigbrother. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebiv_6100.html" title="User:Sebiv">sebiv</a> 17:29, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the chance that the news story is deleted I have also created a <a href="http://www.behindbigbrother.com/images/insidebigbrother.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.behindbigbrother.com/images/insidebigbrother.jpg" rel="nofollow">screenshot</a>. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebiv_6100.html" title="User:Sebiv">sebiv</a> 17:54, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello, and thanks for your input. There's not much we can do about your claim to copyright infringement other than recommened you seek your own legal advice. What we're trying to determine here is whether or not insidebigbrother.com is a site of note in regards to the Big Brother series, or just mere linkspam. Several questions remain unanswered which I trust will be replied to once <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDavid_5754.html" title="User:WikiDavid">User:WikiDavid</a>'s block expires. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 17:59, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sebiv, as you said this is not a war of the fansites. There are 100's of Australian Big Brother fan websites and there is no reason why we can't all operate. As for the above article you are mentioning this was provided directly to insidebigbrother.com from a fan via the "submit news" feature on the site. It was not taken directly from any website. It was also submitted to us (and published) one day prior to when it appeared on your website making it impossible to be stolen from you. Obviously, no-one knows where all the fans get their news from but it's a little egotistical to imply that it was taken from you.</dd>

<dd>You're going to have to do better than that - anyone can fake a submission date on an article. I wrote that article myself, and whether you're going to pass the blame to an anonymous user doesn't change that fact. --<a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebiv_6100.html" title="User:Sebiv">sebiv</a> 10:02, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>haha, I find it so amusing that all of these assumptions get thrown around - I think it says a lot about the maturity of you guys.</dd>
<dd>* "Insidebigbrother was born out of an imitation of behindbigbrother.com" (We actually found this really bad fan site in the USA and imitated that, sorry)</dd>
<dd>* "they use the same news engine as us" (The same news engine as you? We had ours created from scratch, so no it is not the same)</dd>
<dd>* "and conveniently started using Google Adsense a few days after it was put on behindbigbrother" (No, we have been using Google Adsense since 2002 on our other two websites (Which are PR7 authoritative sites by the way))</dd>
<dd>I don't believe wikipedia is a place to throw around empty assumptions.</dd>
<dd>behindbigbrother.com is more popular than insidebigbrother.com - insidebigbrother.com is a new website. That I do not dispute, but it would have been great if this could have been a more intelligent debate, and not "i reckon yous copied this from the other website" etc etc.</dd>

<dd>See above? And can't we resolve this matter on the actual mediation page itself rather than duplicating info everywhere? Thanks for you time spent making sense of this matter. It's much appreicated. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 13:40, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Normally how I work it is you make your statements on the mediation page, we bash it out on the talk page then I make the final suggestion on the mediation page. This leads to the mediation page getting less cluttered I have found. I think this is going to be a fairly easy one to resolve so if its ok by you can we do it here? If you really want we can do it on the mediation page, after all, its your mediation&#160;:) - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 13:45, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's fine. I've been before the ArbCom before, and assumed (perhaps incorrectly) you did things the same way. No problems. I see resolution forthcoming. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 13:47, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
