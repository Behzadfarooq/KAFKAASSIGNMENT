<p>hi, on august 9th, you deleted several of my pictures that I have uploaded onto wikipedia, may as to why you did so? furthermore those pictures were my property as I had stated with the proper wikipedia media license. your removal of my pictures should be considered vandalism as you did not give a specific reason for removal. anyways, cheers. <a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustrian_Guy06_8e5d.html" title="User:Austrian Guy06">Austrian Guy06</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I am not an administrator so I have deleted neither your pictures nor anyone else's. I did, however, nominate three of your pictures for deletion. You can see the nomination page, which gives my reason for nomination, <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_2006_August_9_6951.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2006 August 9">here</a>. Wikipedia is not free webhosting. If you upload pictures that have no encyclopedic purpose, they will be deleted. It's as simple as that. Before you accuse someone of vandalism, please read <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 11:27, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello, BigDT. I am currently involved in a dispute with two editors about the use of the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Image%7EGulf.png_1c61.html" title="Image:Gulf.png">Gulf Oil logo</a> in the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betelgeuse_incident.html" title="Betelgeuse incident">Betelgeuse incident</a> article. It seems to me that this logo does not significantly contribute to the article, and thus fails the eighth point of the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia fair-use policy</a>. The <a href="../../../t/o/t/Image%7ETotalpre92.PNG_8964.html" title="Image:Totalpre92.PNG">Total logo</a> has just recently been added to the article, and though I haven't yet said anything about it, I think this image also adds nothing significant. I would appreciate your opinion on the matter; the discussion is ongoing at <a href="../../../g/u/l/Image_talk%7EGulf.png_7da1.html" title="Image talk:Gulf.png">Image talk:Gulf.png</a>. Thank you for your time. —<a href="../../../b/k/e/User%7EBkell_6f8f.html" title="User:Bkell">Bkell</a> (<a href="../../../b/k/e/User_talk%7EBkell_38f8.html" title="User talk:Bkell">talk</a>) 17:30, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You said: "Hi. I noticed you tagged Image:Accepted Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.jpg with {{<a href="../../../n/r/d/Template%7ENrd_af95.html" title="Template:Nrd">nrd</a>}}. Is there a specific concern that you had? It is tagged with {{<a href="../../../c/d/c/Template%7ECdcover_ffea.html" title="Template:Cdcover">cdcover</a>}}, which itself contains a fair use rationale, namely, that the image is used "soley to illustrate the audio recording in question". With DVD covers, CD covers, etc, the rationale is usually considered to be obvious and the vast majority don't have anything above and beyond the tag. I looked at the page where this image is used and didn't see a problem with it. Is there a specific concern that you had?"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, the criteria has been tightened up recently. All fair-use images have required a rationale, but this is more widely enforced now. My specific complaint with this image is that the article it is used on already has a lot of copyrighted images... six, by my count. This is really too many for an article without much length (though the length is just fine, my complaint is with the image count). This was the first image I found, though, so was the one I tagged as missing the rationale. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 21:13, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for starting this discussion... as I have been quite discouraged by the <b>userfy</b> judgement to begin with. Below is what I appended to your message... seems like Wikipedia has a bunch of hypocrits as they want to promote the collaboration of data, but alienate users when they have no interest in a subject. Honestly I almost flamed you before really reading your message because you are a VT fan and thought you were just being malicious, but I am relieved to find out that you are trying to help me out. Thanks and hopefully you haven't found as much red tape as I have found contributing to Wikipedia. Thanks again for your support. <a href="../../../j/a/z/User%7EJazznutuva_0eb0.html" title="User:Jazznutuva">Jazznutuva</a> 16:54, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This WikiProject should not have even been userfied given the other University WikiProjects that have been left alone (see Wikipedia:WikiProject Cornell University, Wikipedia:WikiProject Ohio Wesleyan University, Wikipedia:WikiProject Georgia Tech, Wikipedia:WikiProject University of Texas at Austin), however I accepted the opinion of the masses to userfy despite the project only being run for 3 days before nomination for deletion. I agree with BigDT with <b>userfy</b> of this project being very discouraging as this project took many hours to create after I had researched that there were several other Universities with projects that had been open for much longer than mine lasted. I'll go with the consensus... but a pure deletion would be mind boggling to me considering the active University projects let continue. Jazznutuva 16:49, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

MFD is pretty straightforward, but my bigger question is that the creator (<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZandweb_51b9.html" title="User:Zandweb">Zandweb</a>) was active on November 16th; have you asked them yet whether they want to continue building the portal? Maybe they'll {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">db-author</a>}} it for you and save you the trouble. Otherwise it doesn't seem to be in any article pages, so it'll do little harm if it's around 5 more days, and you'll get a greater consensus for your removal than just two people; there's also <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ossetia_8bee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ossetia">Wikipedia:WikiProject Ossetia</a>, which seems to be fairly quiescent. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 14:16, 22 November 2006 (UTC) 14:13, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absolutely nothing had been done on the portal - it was an empty portal page that takes 10 seconds to create and hadn't been touched since its initial creation. Any obviously delete-worthy portal I found that had any content whatsoever - even lousy content - I nominated at MFD - but there were several portals that had no edits beyond initial creation using {{<a href="../../../b/o/x/Template%7EBox_portal_skeleton_74ee.html" title="Template:Box portal skeleton">Box portal skeleton</a>}} and those I tagged for speedies. In my mind, the blank article criterion is clearly appropriate for a portal where nothing whatsoever has been done and MFD would only introduce an unneeded step. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 18:32, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I noticed that you corrected what i had overwritten. It doesnt matter if God said that Boise State will be going to the Fiesta Bowl, it still as of RIGHT NOW, is undicided whether Boise will actually get the bowl bid. Another Bowl could logically pick them over the Fiesta Bowl. So thats why i was changing all those Bowl "predictions." Dawg1279 06:09, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>They aren't "predictions". A "prediction" is that Virginia Tech will play UGA in the bowl formerly known as Peach. Miami to the Smurf Turf and Boise to the Fiesta are 100% set in stone and just waiting to be announced. None of the BCS bowls are officially announced until next Sunday - not even tOSU to the MNC. Boise to the Fiesta is 100% completely set in stone, but it will not be announced until Fox's selection show. Miami to the Smurf Turf is 100% set in stone and the article I found says it will be announced on Tuesday. Bowls that are not 100% set in stone (ie, VT+UGA -&gt; Peach) should not be listed, but there is no reason not to list ones that are only pending the formality. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 06:07, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you don't include any non-free content in it, then it could be used on your user page. For example, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Florida" class="extiw" title="commons:Category:Florida">Commons:Category:Florida</a> includes a lot of free graphics that pertain to Florida.

<dd>Yes ... it obviously needs to be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, in other words, the proclamation needs to be published in a newspaper or put on the city website or some such thing, but yes, it is generally considered a legitimate example of <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">fair use</a> to include the flag of a country/state/city on the article about that entity. The image looked a little ragged and would probably need to be cleaned up, but I would assume that if the city were to select that for its flag, they would have marketing people that would take care of such things. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah ... I'm not overly concerned about the new one ... just the old one. I have no qualms with anything you did or said ... I just saw the message and wanted to let you guys know what was up. There really isn't an "edit war" there ... just my effort to ensure that it is either really is a free image or that it is properly tagged as a non-free one. It's important that if Wikipedia is going to really be a "free content" encyclopedia that we (1) remove non-free copyrighted material for which there is no legitimate "fair use" justification and (2) ensure that non-free material is correctly tagged. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:30, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, BigDT, good to hear from you again. Sorry I didn`t respond to your message right away. I gave it some thought, and I think I would prefer to do the Bible chapters straight through rather than skip around. I know the last three books of Moses are not terribly exciting, but maybe we can speed up the rotation again so it won`t take all year. Let me know what you think. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnie_Love_dc9c.html" title="User:Donnie Love">Donnie Love</a> 14:51, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your welcome. You may have noticed that I'm trying really hard to reduce wikipedia vandalism. I just wondered if I was following the correct protocol for doing so? should I message a user when I revert their edits?</p>

<dd>Thank you for your good work you have done so far. To answer your question, yes. Please see <a href="../../../u/s/e/Category%7EUser_warning_templates_29f9.html" title="Category:User warning templates">Category:User warning templates</a> for a <i>very</i> long list of templates you can use. The short version of it is that if it is simple vandalism, use one of the "test" templates. If it is likely just a test (ie, blanking a section possibly in <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>, saying "can I really create a page", or just hitting buttons), use {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest-n_7724.html" title="Template:Test-n">test-n</a>}}. If it is their first offense and obviously vandalism, use {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest2_cdb7.html" title="Template:Test2">test2</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest2-n_c296.html" title="Template:Test2-n">test2-n</a>}}. If it is a later offense or blatant vandalism, use {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3_288f.html" title="Template:Test3">test3</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest3-n_e0f8.html" title="Template:Test3-n">test3-n</a>}}. If they have already been warned and it's obvious that they need to either stop or be blocked, use {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4-n_3ce0.html" title="Template:Test4-n">test4-n</a>}}. Once someone has been warned with test3 or test4 and continues to vandalize, they should be reported at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> so that an administrator can block them.

<dd>Thank you for pointing it out to me. I have nominated it at <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>. FYI, there are multiple overlapping procedures for dealing with copyvio images. Images that were blatantly copied from some website with no assertion of permission or fair use can be tagged with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-copyvio_e567.html" title="Template:Db-copyvio">db-copyvio</a>}}. Possibly unfree images where the source or license is disputed can be taken to <a href="../../../p/u/i/WP%7EPUI_d69d.html" title="WP:PUI">WP:PUI</a>. Images missing essential data can be speedy deleted (see <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> for criteria). <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> partially overlaps <a href="../../../p/u/i/WP%7EPUI_d69d.html" title="WP:PUI">WP:PUI</a> and also handles deletions for reasons other than copyright. So basically, there's a long list of possible procedures to choose from. ;) <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 05:40, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you. As a sysop on the Dutch wiki, I often delete images nominated for deletion which gave been copied from the english wiki. Often the issue is clear, such as fair use, something we do not allow. But once every few months, such as in this case, the situation is less clear, and the uploader on the dutch wiki acted in good faith. However, the procedures here on en: are hard to remember, with numerous tags and procedures for different cases. It would probably take me the better part of half an hour to read through the different procedures and decide upon a tag, and even then there is a good chance I might err.

<dd>What is bugging me more is the "an article that you helped to create - [[{{{1}}}]] - " which has two pauses in short succession and uses an unnecessary qualification of the authorship of the disputed article. —<a href="../../../d/g/i/User%7EDgies_d44c.html" title="User:Dgies">Dgies</a><sup><a href="../../../d/g/i/User_talk%7EDgies_d02f.html" title="User talk:Dgies">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dgies_24b2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dgies">c</a></sup> 19:53, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>" and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia's deletion policy</a>).

Removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the proposed deletion process, but the article may still be sent to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles for Deletion</a>, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached, or if it matches any of the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion criteria</a>. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerry_lavoie_92fa.html" title="User:Jerry lavoie">Jerry lavoie</a> 21:10, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
