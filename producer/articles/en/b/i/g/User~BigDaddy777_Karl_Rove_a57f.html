Like Atwater, Rove is well known for his effective campaign tactics, employing <a href="../../../p/u/s/Push_poll.html" title="Push poll">push polls</a> and frequently attacking an opponent on the opponent's strongest issue.</p>
<p>In 1981, Rove founded <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_mail.html" title="Direct mail">direct mail</a> consulting firm, Karl Rove + Company, based out of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin%2C_Texas_6b79.html" title="Austin, Texas">Austin, Texas</a>.

<p>According to the campaign manager of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCain_2b79.html" title="John McCain">John McCain</a>'s 2000 presidential bid, a <a href="../../../p/u/s/Push_poll.html" title="Push poll">push poll</a> was conducted during the 2000 South Carolina primaries which asked potential voters "Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCain_2b79.html" title="John McCain">John McCain</a> for president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?". <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.

<p>George W. Bush was inaugurated in January <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. Rove accepted a position in the Bush administration as Senior Advisor to the President.

After Rove's appointment, the administration was criticized for attempting to shift blame away from the federal government for the failures by claiming that state and local officials (specifically Louisiana Governor Blanco and Mayor Ray Nagin) had not declared a state of emergency at the time <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/katrina/nagin.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.snopes.com/politics/katrina/nagin.asp" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>,<a href="http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=10C710DD85B30BA0" class="external autonumber" title="http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=10C710DD85B30BA0" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>,<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/08/20050827-1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/08/20050827-1.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>,<a href="http://www.gov.state.la.us/Press_Release_detail.asp?id=97" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gov.state.la.us/Press_Release_detail.asp?id=97" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>.</p>

The leak is a potential violation of federal law.</p>
<p>Wilson, who in February 2002 investigated claims of attempted 1990s uranium ore purchases by Iraq from <a href="../../../n/i/g/Niger.html" title="Niger">Niger</a>, wrote an opinion piece in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, published <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">6 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>,<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0706-02.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0706-02.htm" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> suggesting that the Bush administration misrepresented intelligence findings to justify war against Iraq. Wilson said that his African diplomatic experience led to his selection for the mission: He is the former ambassador to <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabon.html" title="Gabon">Gabon</a>, another uranium-producing African nation, and was once posted in the 1970s to <a href="../../../n/i/a/Niamey.html" title="Niamey">Niamey</a>, Niger's capital.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/opinion/06WILS.html?ex=1121313600&amp;en=50292a4af26496e7&amp;ei=5070" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/opinion/06WILS.html?ex=1121313600&amp;en=50292a4af26496e7&amp;ei=5070" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> Wilson, who was open about the CIA's sponsorship of his trip (which he called "discreet but not secret"), wrote that he had been "informed by officials at the Central Intelligence Agency that Vice President <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Cheney_58d2.html" title="Dick Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>'s office had questions about a particular intelligence report" relating to the sale of <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">uranium</a> <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowcake.html" title="Yellowcake">yellowcake</a> from Niger (<i>see also <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellowcake_Forgery_412e.html" title="Yellowcake Forgery">Yellowcake Forgery</a></i>). Of his trip to Niger Wilson wrote, "I spent the next eight days drinking sweet mint tea and meeting with dozens of people: current government officials, former government officials, people associated with the country's uranium business. It did not take long to conclude that it was highly doubtful that any such transaction [purchase of uranium ore] had ever taken place." Wilson also noted that U.S. Ambassador to Niger <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbro_Owens-Kirkpatrick_3e62.html" title="Barbro Owens-Kirkpatrick">Barbro Owens-Kirkpatrick</a> "knew about the allegations of uranium sales to Iraq — and that she felt she had already debunked them in her reports to Washington."</p>

<p>Eight days after publication of Wilson's article, syndicated columnist <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Novak_f400.html" title="Robert Novak">Robert Novak</a> wrote an article dismissing the importance of Wilson's trip to Niger. Novak wrote that the choice to use Wilson "was made routinely at a low level without <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">[CIA] Director</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Tenet_1671.html" title="George Tenet">George Tenet</a>'s knowledge." Novak went on to identify Plame as Wilson's wife: "Wilson never worked for the CIA, but his wife, Valerie Plame, is an Agency operative on weapons of mass destruction. Two senior administration officials told me Wilson's wife suggested sending him to Niger to investigate the Italian report. The CIA says its counter-proliferation officials selected Wilson and asked his wife to contact him."<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/printrn20030714.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/printrn20030714.shtml" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> Although Wilson wrote that he was certain his findings were circulated within the CIA and conveyed (at least orally) to the office of the Vice President, and George Tenet himself had written not only of his familiarity with the report but that it "was given a normal and wide distribution" in intelligence circles,<a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/press_release/2003/pr07112003.html" class="external autonumber" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/press_release/2003/pr07112003.html" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> Novak questioned the accuracy of Wilson's report and added that "it is doubtful Tenet ever saw it."</p>
<p>Although the Novak article called her a CIA "operative," it did not necessarily identify Valerie Plame as an "undercover" (or <a href="../../../n/o/c/NOC_8d64.html" title="NOC">NOC</a> agent). However, the publication of her name and a brief account of her duties was enough to abruptly end her "undercover" status, as well as that of her <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brewster_Jennings_%26_Associates_521d.html" title="Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates">cover firm</a> and other agents using its cover (as well as their contacts).</p>
<p>Nearly a year after Wilson's editorial was published (<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_12.html" title="July 12">12 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>), the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's Report on the US Intelligence Community's Prewar Assessments on Iraq stated that Plame "offered up [Wilson's] name" for the trip. Several high ranking CIA officials disputed this claim, however, and indicated that the person who made the claim was not present at the meeting where Wilson was chosen. "In an interview with <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_magazine.html" title="Time magazine">Time</a></i>, Wilson, who served as an ambassador to Gabon and as a senior American diplomat in Baghdad under the current president's father, angrily said that his wife had nothing to do with his trip to Africa. 'That is bullshit. That is absolutely not the case,' Wilson told <i>Time</i>. 'I met with between six and eight analysts and operators from CIA and elsewhere [before the Feb 2002 trip]. None of the people in that meeting did I know, and they took the decision to send me. This is a smear job.'" <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,465270,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,465270,00.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001918.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001918.html" rel="nofollow">[40]</a></p>

(Cooper's article in <i>Time</i>, citing unnamed and anonymous "government officials," confirmed Plame to be a "CIA official who monitors the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction." Cooper's article appeared three days after Novak's column was published.) Rove's lawyer, however, asserted that Rove "never knowingly disclosed classified information" and that "he did not tell any reporter that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA." This second statement has since been called into question by an e-mail, written three days before Novak's column, in which Cooper indicated that Rove had told him Wilson's wife worked at the CIA. If Rove were aware that this was classified information at the time then both disclaimers by his lawyer would be untrue. Furthermore, Luskin said that Rove himself had testified before the grand jury "two or three times" (three times, according to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_3.html" title="July 3">3 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-rove3jul03,1,2388418.story" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-rove3jul03,1,2388418.story" rel="nofollow">[68]</a> in addition to two interviews by the FBI) and signed a waiver authorizing reporters to testify about their conversations with him. Luskin stated that Rove "has answered every question that has been put to him about his conversations with Cooper and anybody else." Rove's lawyer declined to share with <i>Newsweek</i> reporter <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Isikoff_4198.html" title="Michael Isikoff">Michael Isikoff</a> the nature or contents of his client's conversations with Cooper. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow">[69]</a> <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000972841" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000972841" rel="nofollow">[70]</a> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1079464,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1079464,00.html" rel="nofollow">[71]</a><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-rove3jul03,1,2388418.story" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-rove3jul03,1,2388418.story" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/02/AR2005070201043.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/02/AR2005070201043.html" rel="nofollow">[73]</a></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">6 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Cooper agreed to testify, thus avoiding being held in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contempt_of_court.html" title="Contempt of court">contempt of court</a> and sent to jail. Cooper said "I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions for not testifying," but told the judge that not long before his early afternoon appearance at court he had received "in somewhat dramatic fashion" an indication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep his source's identity secret. For some observers this called into question the allegations against Rove, who had signed a waiver months before permitting reporters to testify about their conversations with him (see above paragraph). <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050706/ap_on_re_us/reporters_contempt_62;_ylt=ArnUNjXzbMhKbNhtcoEGde1ZJ_wA;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050706/ap_on_re_us/reporters_contempt_62;_ylt=ArnUNjXzbMhKbNhtcoEGde1ZJ_wA;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl" rel="nofollow">[74]</a></p>
<p>Cooper, however, stated in court that he did not previously accept a general waiver to journalists signed by his source (whom he did not identify by name), because he had made a personal pledge of confidentiality to his source. The 'dramatic change' which allowed Cooper to testify was later revealed to be a phone conversation between lawyers for Cooper and his source confirming that the waiver signed two years earlier included conversations with Cooper. Citing a "person who has been officially briefed on the case," <i>The New York Times</i> identified Rove as the individual in question,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/politics/07leak.html?hp&amp;ex=1120795200&amp;en=211258b05dea0ba7&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/politics/07leak.html?hp&amp;ex=1120795200&amp;en=211258b05dea0ba7&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage" rel="nofollow">[75]</a> a fact later confirmed by Rove's own lawyer.<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8525978/site/newsweek/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8525978/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow">[76]</a> According to one of Cooper's lawyers, Cooper has previously testified in August 2004 before the grand jury regarding conversations with <a href="../../../i/2E/_/I._Lewis_Libby_53d8.html" title="I.

In a <i>Time</i> article released <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_17.html" title="July 17">17 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Cooper says Rove ended his conversation by saying "I've already said too much." If true, this could indicate that Rove identified Wilson's wife as a CIA employee prior to Novak's column being published. Some believe that statements by Rove claiming he did not reveal her name would still be strictly accurate if he mentioned her only as 'Wilson's wife', although this distinction would likely have no bearing on the alleged illegality of the disclosure. The White House repeatedly denied that Rove had any involvement in the leaks. Whether Rove's statement to Cooper that Wilson's wife worked at the CIA in fact violated any laws has not been resolved.</p>
<p>In addition, Rove told Cooper that CIA Director George Tenet did not authorize Wilson's trip to Niger, and that "not only the genesis of the trip [to Niger] is flawed an[d] suspect but so is the report" which Wilson made upon his return from Africa. Rove "implied strongly there's still plenty to implicate Iraqi interest in acquiring uranium fro[m] Niger," and in an apparent effort to discourage Cooper from taking the former ambassador's assertions seriously, gave Cooper a "big warning" not to "get too far out on Wilson." Cooper recommended that his bureau chief assign a reporter to contact the CIA for further confirmation, and indicated that the tip should not be sourced to Rove or even to the White House. The <i>Washington Post</i> reported that the CIA, contradicting Rove, "maintained that Wilson was chosen for the trip by senior officials in the Directorate of Operations counterproliferation division (CPD) -- not by his wife -- largely because he had handled a similar agency inquiry in Niger in 1999"<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001918.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081001918.html" rel="nofollow">[84]</a>, though she is reported to have suggested him for the 1999 trip<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8525978/site/newsweek/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8525978/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow">[85]</a>.</p>

Yes. Did Rove say that she worked at the 'agency' on 'W.M.D.'? Yes. When he said things would be declassified soon, was that itself impermissible? I don't know. Is any of this a crime?

In addition, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft, from whose prior campaigns Rove had been paid $746,000 in consulting fees, had been briefed on the contents of at least one of Rove's interviews with the FBI - raising concerns of a conflict of interest with the not-yet-recused Attorney General. <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0533,waasweb1,66861,2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0533,waasweb1,66861,2.html" rel="nofollow">[89]</a></p>

<p>In an email sent by Rove to top White House security official <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hadley_45aa.html" title="Stephen Hadley">Stephen Hadley</a> immediately after his discussion with Matt Cooper (obtained by the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> and published on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">15 July</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>), Rove claimed that he tried to steer the journalist away from allegations Wilson was making about faulty Iraq intelligence. "Matt Cooper called to give me a heads-up that he's got a welfare reform story coming," Rove wrote to Hadley. "When he finished his brief heads-up he immediately launched into Niger. Isn't this damaging? Hasn't the president been hurt? I didn't take the bait, but I said if I were him I wouldn't get Time far out in front on this." Rove made no mention to Hadley in the e-mail of having leaked Plame's CIA identity, nor of having revealed classified information to a reporter, nor of having told the reporter that certain sensitive information would soon be declassified.<a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050716/D8BC7F500.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050716/D8BC7F500.html" rel="nofollow">[90]</a> Although Rove wrote to Hadley (and perhaps testified) that the initial subject of his conversation with Cooper was welfare reform and that Cooper turned the conversation to Wilson and the Niger mission, many months later Cooper disputed this suggestion in his grand jury testimony and subsequent statements: "I can't find any record of talking about [welfare reform] with him on July 11 [2003], and I don't recall doing so," Cooper said. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1083899,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1083899,00.html" rel="nofollow">[91]</a><a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000980363" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000980363" rel="nofollow">[92]</a></p>

<p>Critics of Bush consider this to be an expansion of the criteria, i.e., that Mr. Bush now reserves the right to fire only in the event of an actual <i>conviction</i>, which clearly requires a higher standard of proof and would in any case take much longer. Supporters believe that this is consistent with the position President Bush has taken from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Others counter this view by relying on Bush's one previous mention of illegality, his September 30, 2003 remarks, to suggest that Bush has never meant anything <i>other</i> than that <i>only</i> a criminal conviction would prevent someone from working in the White House, though it seems exceedingly unlikely that any presidential administration would continue to employ someone while they were in prison.</p>

<p>The unusual circumstances of this case led a number of media organizations to file a friend-of-the-court (<i><a href="../../../a/m/i/Amicus_curiae.html" title="Amicus curiae">amicus curiae</a></i>) brief on behalf of the journalists who were subpoenaed (Matthew Cooper, Judith Miller, and <i>Time</i> Inc.). In this brief, lawyers representing 36 media organizations, including ABC News, AP, CNN, CBS News, WSJ, Fox News, <i>USA Today</i>, NBC News, <i>Newsweek</i>, and Reuters, argued to the court that "there exists ample evidence in the public record to cast serious doubt as to whether a crime has even been committed under the Intelligence Protection Act in the investigation underlying the attempts to secure testimony from Miller and Cooper." <a href="http://www.bakerlaw.com/files/tbl_s10News/FileUpload44/10159/Amici%20Brief%20032305%20(Final).PDF" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bakerlaw.com/files/tbl_s10News/FileUpload44/10159/Amici%20Brief%20032305%20(Final).PDF" rel="nofollow">[127]</a> <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Toensing_cd5b.html" title="Victoria Toensing">Victoria Toensing</a>, the principal author of the <i>amicus</i> brief, also contended that Ms. Plame didn't have a cover to blow, citing a July 23, 2004 article in the <i><a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Times_50df.html" title="Washington Times">Washington Times</a></i> which argued that Valerie Plame's status as an undercover CIA agent may have been known to Russian and Cuban intelligence operations prior to the Novak article.</p>
<p>Perhaps because Toensing's brief did not address issues relating to (possible) perjury and obstruction of justice charges, nor many other possible violations associated with the disclosure of classified information, many of these same news outlets continue to suggest the possibility that Rove may have violated the law. (The <i>amicus</i> brief predated the publication of internal <i>Time</i> email, as well as Cooper's own testimony and published account of Rove's role.) Although some reporters speculate that Rove's (future) legal defense might be built upon testimony that he was ignorant of Plame's protected status at the time he outed her as a CIA employee, most agree that if it could be proven that he had heard of her CIA covert status or knew material was classified when he spoke to journalists, Rove could face far more serious charges.</p>

<p>This may be seen by Bush's political opponents as setting <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">precedent</a> for the prosecution of similar leaks, and Karl Rove is likely to face greater consequences than Randel if indicted for violating Section 641.

<p>While the breaking of <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valerie_Plame_dd1f.html" title="Valerie Plame">Valerie Plame</a>'s cover as a NOC operative of the CIA may be regarded as serious in and of itself, there has been debate over the damage caused by the leak, and the areas into which that damage may extend, particularly in relation to Plame's work with her cover company, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brewster_Jennings_%26_Associates_521d.html" title="Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates">Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates</a>. Legal filings by Independent Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald contain many pages blanked out for security reasons, leading some observers to speculate that Fitzgerald has pursued the extent to which national security was compromised by the actions of Rove and others.</p>
<p>While a preponderance of evidence to date appears to suggest that retaliation for Wilson's public contradiction of the Bush Administration claim (that Iraq had attempted to obtain enriched uranium) was the motive for the leak, another explanation holds that the leak was an attempt to sabotage an investigation into Saudi oil reserve (see <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_oil.html" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a>).</p>

<p>Rep. Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, has sent a letter asking for a formal investigation of the time between the start of Rove's investigation and John Ashcroft's recusal:</p>
<dl>
<dd>There has long been the appearance of impropriety in Ashcroft's handling of this investigation. The former attorney general had well documented conflicts of interest in this matter, particularly with regard to his personal relationship with Karl Rove. Among other things, Rove was employed by Ashcroft throughout his political career, and Rove reportedly had fiercely advocated for Ashcroft's appointment as attorney general. Pursuant to standard rules of legal ethics, and explicit rules on conflict of interest, those facts alone should have dictated his immediate recusal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The new information, that Ashcroft had not only refused to recuse himself over a period of months, but also was insisting on being personally briefed about a matter implicating his friend, Karl Rove, represents a stunning ethical breach that cries out for an immediate investigation by the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility and Inspector General.<a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0533,waasweb1,66861,2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0533,waasweb1,66861,2.html" rel="nofollow">[135]</a><a href="http://www.archive.org/download/dn2005-0818/dn2005-0818-1_64kb.mp3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archive.org/download/dn2005-0818/dn2005-0818-1_64kb.mp3" rel="nofollow">[136]</a></dd>
