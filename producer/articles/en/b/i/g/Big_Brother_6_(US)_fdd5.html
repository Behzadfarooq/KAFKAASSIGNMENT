<p>A group of fourteen contestants (referred to as <i>houseguests</i>) were confined in a house together, and the objective of each was to remain in the house the longest. Each week of the show, there was a <b>Head of Household</b> (HoH) who was able to nominate two other <i>houseguests</i> for removal, followed by a <b>Golden Power of Veto</b> competition in which contestants competed for the right to choose to replace one of those nominees, and finally, at the end of the week, a vote by the contestants to select one of the nominees to evict from the house. The two people remaining at the end of the competition would be subject to a vote by a <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jury.html" title="Jury">jury</a> of the previously evicted contestants, with the winner receiving $500,000 and the runner up $50,000.</p>

James entered the house with his secret partner and girlfriend Sarah. He was evicted on Day 61. He lied about his profession in the beginning of the game, stating that he was a teacher, to make himself look less strategic and canniving. James was constantly made deals behind people's backs, but was remembered for winning the most Golden Power of Veto competitions in one series (four), until Janelle broke that record during Big Brother 7.</p>

She entered with her ex-roommate Ashlea, but Ashlea was the first person to be evicted. She became part of the Sovereign Six alliance. At one point, her popularity rating on the CBS website was 93%, making her one of the most popular houseguests of all time.</p>
<p>Janelle was "Head of Household" during weeks 7 and 10 and veto-holder in weeks 7 and 9. She also won the second and third "America's Choice" votes, which were a phone call from a loved one (prior contestant and love interest Michael) and a visit to the set of <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_and_a_Half_Men_6c35.html" title="Two and a Half Men">Two and a Half Men</a>, respectively. She also won a number of other show prizes, including the "PB&amp;J Pass" which gave her the ability to exempt one houseguest (including herself) from having to eat peanut butter and jelly for the week if they lost the food competition. Janelle and her alliance, "The Sovereign Six", battled with the opposing alliance The Friendship throughout the season. Janelle came in third, eliminated on Day 76.</p>
<p>Janelle returned to Big Brother for season 7 (All Stars). After dominating the competitions by winning 4 HoH's and 5 veto's, Janelle was evicted on Day 67, becoming the last member of the jury.

She played the game with fellow housemate and sorority sister from another college, April. Jennifer became HoH during Week 7 after winning the HoH competition "Pressure Cooker". During the competition, she promised newly-returned houseguest Kaysar Ridha that she would nominate two people from her own alliance in an attempt to "backdoor" James. She also promised Kaysar that she wouldn't nominate him that week. Jennifer later talked about her agreement with Kaysar with her fellow alliance members Maggie Ausburn, Beau Beasley, April Lewis, and Ivette Corredero, referred to collectively as the "Friendship". At the nomination ceremony, Jennifer changed her mind on what she committed to do with Kaysar and nominated two people from his alliance, Rachel Plencner and Janelle Pierzina. She explained to Kaysar that she could not nominate two people who were close friends from her own team and risk that his alliance wouldn't backstab them like the week before he arrived. Soon afterwards, many of Jennifer's alliance members came up with the idea to backdoor Kaysar instead of James. When Rachel won the Power of Veto competition and took herself out of the nomination chair, Jennifer nominated Kaysar in her place, going against both parts of her pact. Kaysar was then evicted from the house by a unanimous vote, making Jennifer a huge target with the remainder of Kaysar's alliance. Janelle won the HoH competition in Week 8 and nominated Jennifer and Maggie. Although Janelle won the Power of Veto competition and replaced Maggie with Ivette, Jennifer was eliminated on Day 48 making her the first jury member of the season.</p>

Shortly after Kaysar entered the house he was shown being extremely nervous because the houseguests knew he was Iraqi and that would make him a fast target for eviction. His worst fears were confirmed when he went up on the block the first week. Kaysar became HoH during Week 3 after winning the competition "Majority Rules". After the nominations, became part of the "Sovereign Six". During Week 4, Maggie won the HoH competition and nominated James and Kaysar, the two biggest threats from the opposing alliance. After James' partner Sarah won the PoV and removed James from the chopping block, Maggie nominated Kaysar's close friend and alliance member Janelle. By a 7-1 vote, Kaysar was evicted from the house because he was viewed as a strategic threat; only James voted to keep him.</p>
<p>At the close of the program after Kaysar's eviction, host Julie Chen revealed to the houseguests that American viewers would vote to return a previously evicted houseguest to the house: Michael, Eric, or Kaysar. The houseguests were stunned because their new strategies had to consider the unknown factor of who would be returning after the next nominations for eviction. Kaysar won the "America's Choice" poll with an overwhelming 82% of the 5 million votes. Immediately after returning, Kaysar competed in the HoH competition "Pressure Cooker", where the Houseguest who held down a button the longest would become the new HoH. The competition lasted over fourteen hours until he and Jennifer were left. Jennifer offered through an intense series of negotiations that if Kaysar let her win the competition, she would not put him up for eviction. She also agreed that she would nominate two people from her alliance, use the PoV, and then nominate and evict the truly unpopular James. During nominations, Jennifer went back on her word, nominating Rachel and Janelle for eviction. Rachel won the PoV competition and used it to save herself. Jennifer, breaking the other promise she had made, put Kaysar up for eviction beside Janelle. This led to his second eviction.</p>
<p>Kaysar was voted into the Big Brother All-Stars house for the seventh season of the US series. However, Kaysar was evicted fifth, just missing a spot in the jury.</p>

Though the house was clearly divided, Maggie managed to convince Howie to nominate two of his own allies (James and Sarah) instead of two members from hers. Howie's nomination of James and Sarah changed the entire course of the game, and Maggie's alliance ultimately won out against the Sovereigns when Maggie's ally Ivette Corredero evicted Janelle Pierzina on the 76th day in the house. Maggie and Ivette were the final two players remaining in the game. On the Day 80, the jury voted and gave Maggie the $500,000 prize in a 4-3 vote against Ivette.</p>

<p>For the 2005 season, the producers chose to make some changes to attempt to increase interest in the program. The theme song of the show was changed, but more significantly a new house was built. Some new features included making the house two stories, a secret room, a private bathroom for the HoH, a co-ed shower, and a digital picture frame for the houseguests. In keeping with recent Big Brother tradition, the sixth season was given a <i>twist</i> and the theme <i>Summer of Secrets</i>. The twist was that every houseguest in the game had one secret partner, but every pair believed that they were the only ones working together.</p>

<p>In the first week of the game Rachel won Head of Household competition by being the last one aboard a giant surfboard in a two hour endurance competition. A majority alliance began to form and 4 people ended up as <i>outcasts</i> with no attachments: Ashlea, Michael, Janelle and Kaysar. Rachel nominated Ashlea because she did not get to know her well, and Kaysar for being introverted and not interacting with all the houseguests. Rachel then won the Power of Veto and chose not to use it. Ashlea was the first contestant evicted in a 9-2 vote.</p>

<p>Eric won the second Head of Household and as a member of the majority alliance, nominated two more of the outcasts: Janelle and Michael. James won the <b>Power of Veto</b> but did not use it. After a fight between Eric and Michael, the rest of the house decided to eliminate Michael in a 9-1 vote.</p>

<p>In week 3, Kaysar became the Head of Household. He had been targeted in previous weeks and earned safety with the title, using it to build alliances as much as he could. Desperate for allies, he first recruited the person he had been becoming close friends with in the house, Janelle. He then lured two sets of secret partners (Rachel &amp; Howie and James &amp; Sarah) away from the dominant alliance, forming a group he called the "Sovereign Six". He stated his plans for the alliance as, "Rachel and Howie, James and Sarah, Janelle and me - Final Six." Kaysar then nominated Maggie and James. The <i>Sovereign Six</i> worked together in the <b>Power of Veto</b> competition, deliberately helping James to win it and remove himself from the chopping block. Kaysar then nominated Maggie's secret partner Eric to ensure that one of the pair would be evicted. The house decided to eliminate Eric, who had become the leader of the <i>Friendship</i> alliance in a close 5-4 vote. The <i>Friendship</i> consisted of Eric, Maggie, Ivette, Beau, April and Jennifer.</p>

<p>Maggie came back to win the next Head of Household that evening and vowed revenge on Kaysar for eliminating her partner. She nominated James and Kaysar, but was forced to replace James with Janelle when Sarah used the <b>Power of Veto</b> she had won to remove James. Kaysar, the founder of the new <i>Sovereign Six</i> alliance, was eliminated in a 7-1 vote.</p>

<p>At the beginning of week 5, a new twist was revealed to America and to the houseguests. As had been done in the third season, one of the evicted houseguests was voted back into the house. This time the viewers were asked to vote online or by <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text_messaging.html" title="Text messaging">text messaging</a> for either Michael, Eric, or Kaysar to return to the game (Ashlea would also have been eligible to be returned, but she disqualified herself by voluntarily leaving sequester due to an illness in her family). However, the returning houseguest would not come back until the next week leaving Howie, who had won that week's HoH competition, one chance to eliminate an enemy. This week was the turning point in the game, because Maggie was able to convince Howie (against his partner Rachel's better judgement) that James and Sarah were betraying their alliance and were immediate threats to everybody in the house. Howie was convinced and nominated the pair, ensuring that one of them would be eliminated no matter what happened. Fans of the show regarded his nominatation of his own alliance members (who had intended to be loyal to him) as being, at best, a very poor decision. His own statement at the time was "this will either be the greatest move in Big Brother history or the dumbest", demonstrating his own lack of confidence about what he had done. James ended up winning the <b>Power of Veto</b> again and removed himself, and Howie nominated Ivette in his place. Sarah was then evicted in a 6-1 vote.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the sixth week, Chen announced that over 5 million people had voted and that Kaysar would rejoin the house with 82% of the vote. In the next HoH competition, Jennifer survived the longest competition in Big Brother history, a fourteen hour endurance challenge, by outlasting and deceiving the newly-returned Kaysar. She swore on her life and pretended to shed tears in order to convince Kaysar that she would nominate two members of her own alliance in order to backdoor James, a common enemy in the house, even though this would work against her strategically. She broke her promise and nominated two members of the <i>Sovereign</i> alliance, Janelle and Rachel, two of the strongest players in the game. When Rachel won the <b>Power of Veto</b> and saved herself, Jennifer nominated Kaysar instead of previously agreed upon James. This led to the confrontation between Howie and April when he claimed that she was full of lies and accused her of pulling the strings in her alliance. Following Kaysar's eviction, Howie and Janelle spent a good portion of their time during the week directly yelling insults and verbal attacks at members of the <i>Friendship</i> while they casually passed by. On this occasion, Big Brother producers chose not to intervene. These events widened the split in the fan base, creating a sharp division between those who empathized with how <i>The Friendship</i> was being treated, and those who supported the <i>Sovereign Six</i>.</p>

<p>In the seventh week, another twist was announced by host Chen. The houseguests were informed that the week would not follow the typical schedule, but would instead be accelerated in order to accommodate a double eviction. Less than 48 hours after the live Thursday night broadcast, another houseguest would be evicted. After a brief trivia competition, Janelle emerged the victor and was told that she had to immediately nominate two houseguests for eviction. She nominated Jennifer, the previous HoH who betrayed the trust of the <i>Sovereign</i> alliance, and Maggie, the figure head of the <i>Friendship</i> alliance. Amassing further power, Janelle seized the <b>Power of Veto</b> and in a move that shocked the nominee herself, used it on Maggie and nominated Ivette, guaranteeing Jennifer's future eviction. The next HoH competition was once again won by a member of the opposing alliance, Beau, jeopardizing remaining <i>Sovereign</i> members Janelle, Rachel, and Howie.</p>
<p>As Head of Household, Beau chose to nominate Howie and Rachel, two strong secret partners. This shocked some members of the house because Beau was known to dislike Janelle. James, again, was victorious in the <b>Power of Veto</b> competition setting a Big Brother record for most vetoes won. James did not use the <b>Power of Veto</b> and in a 5-0 vote, Rachel became the 8th houseguest evicted from Big Brother 6 because she was considered too strong a player and the bigger threat.</p>

<p>The next week April, another member of the <i>Friendship</i>, won HoH, breaking the alternating trend and jeopardizing the <i>Sovereign</i> alliance. She nominated Howie and Janelle as pawns to finally evict outcast James who had been trying to play both sides since Sarah's eviction. April then consolidated her power by winning the <b>Power of Veto</b>. True to her word, April used the power of veto to save Janelle and put up James, leading to James' eviction.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_6_%28US%29_fdd5.html" title="Edit section: Week 10">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Week 10</span></h3>
<p>The <i>Sovereigns</i> regained control as Howie once again became the HoH the following week. On an episode airing <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a>, houseguest April called the viewers of the show "pieces of shit" for voting in an <b>America's Choice</b> poll for Janelle to win a phone call over a member of her own alliance. Janelle decided to receive a phone call from Michael, who was voted out on week 2, a person who she had known for barely over two weeks. This angered members of the <i>Friendship</i> who had been longing to talk to loved ones, family members, and husbands who they had been missing dearly for months. The <i>Friendship</i>, and April in particular, openly accused the producers of rigging the vote and refused to believe America would actually vote for an "evil" person like Janelle to win over one of them, demonstrating their complete lack of awareness of how unpopular their group was among the fan base.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, it was announced that there would be another double eviction, and fortunately for the <i>Sovereign</i> alliance, Howie held HoH for that week. Unfortunately for him, his reign would only last for 48 hours. He was required to quickly put up two houseguests for eviction, and he nominated the last pair in the house, Ivette and Beau. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_3.html" title="September 3">September 3</a>, Beau left the house after Maggie won the veto and chose not to use it. Ivette then won the next HoH competition, and nominated Howie and Janelle, hoping to evict Janelle. At the "Final Five" <b>Power of Veto</b> competition, Janelle saved herself from certain eviction by winning. Ivette put April on the block in her place, but on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_8.html" title="September 8">September 8</a> Howie was evicted.</p>

<p>Janelle won the Final Four HoH in a <i>Before or After</i> trivia competition. Janelle then put Ivette and Maggie on the block. Her plan was to sow discord and tear up the alliance of Ivette, Maggie, and April and after a fight between Ivette and April, she had some measure of success. Ivette won <i>Power of Veto</i> and saved herself, forcing April, the only remaining eligible player, to be nominated for eviction. In the end, Ivette evicted April because she was the only one left with a vote.</p>
<p><a name="Week_12" id="Week_12"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_6_%28US%29_fdd5.html" title="Edit section: Week 12">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Week 12</span></h3>
<p>With only 3 players remaining, a three part competition was used to determine who would be the last HoH. Ivette won the first round which was an endurance test, assuring her place in the final round. In the second round Janelle beat out Maggie in a physical and memory game of past events in the house. The stakes were enormously high at the live <i>Final Head of Household</i> competition. If Janelle won, she planned to evict Maggie in the hope that she would have a better shot at winning the money at the end. Ivette decided that if she won, she would evict Janelle because her alliance members had promised to not vote for her if she had evicted Maggie. Ivette and Janelle were neck and neck in the competition, leading to a double tie breaker. The deciding question was this: "How many hours have you spent in the Big Brother house from the moment you entered until 5:00 this evening?" Ivette answered 1,875 and Janelle answered 1,900. The answer was 1,797, earning Ivette the right to choose who would be evicted. She eliminated Janelle, leaving Ivette and Maggie in the final 2.</p>
<p>On finale night (<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_20.html" title="September 20">September 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>), Maggie Ausburn became the winner and champion of Big Brother 6, narrowly defeating her friend and fellow <i>Friendship</i> alliance member Ivette by a 4-3 vote.</p>
