<p>Skimming briefly through, the section on 'notable people' seems out of place - it gives no clue as to who they are, and why they're mentioned. Although some of the people are presumably mentioned in the article, surely the link when they're mentioned is enough? As for the ones who aren't, and have no page of their own, it seems pointless to mention them. Unless they're any objections or somebody wants to expand it, I'll delete that section. <a href="../../../i/n/e/User%7EInebriatedonkey_f665.html" title="User:Inebriatedonkey">Inebriatedonkey</a> 20:28, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

I think some people lack imagination. Some people choose to believe only what they can see or touch, ect. This may be my opinion, but I believe it best for people to keep open minds. Honestly I can't say if Big Foot is real or not, it sure would be interesting if it was though, huh?</p>
<p>Bigfoot has been a staple of Television shows</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yep, there was a touching made-for-TV movie, starring the actrees who played Marilla Cuthbert in the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_of_Green_Gables_8a5e.html" title="Anne of Green Gables">Anne of Green Gables</a> movie. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Ed Poor</a></dd>

<dd>And you blame the author of this article of lacking NPOV? Read elsewhere in this encyclopaedia that <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Goodall_49a7.html" title="Jane Goodall">Jane Goodall</a> believes in their existence. She isn't the least among primatologists. As long as people like her are claiming that, whe should leave the possibility of their existence open, or otherwise we are breaking the NPOV principle. Moreover, the article on theLoch Ness monster, which is even much less likely to exist (bordering with the absolutely impossible) features a similar consideration of arguments for and against. Go complain there first before screaming for adaptation here. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaesarion_63c7.html" title="User:Caesarion">Caesarion</a> 12:41, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that in Wikipedia we're not supposed to think that something is "obviously" a myth -- and we're definitely not supposed to <i>say</i> so. :-) IMHO, NPOV means we say "Some people think A and some think B. The opinion of the expert community is X." (Personally I agree that it's a myth).</p>
<p>"something that is definitely not a bear (although it could conceivably be a person in a furry costume). " -- The point of this is that it is definitely either a real bigfoot or an actor in a great costume -- according to expert analysts it can't be anything else.</p>

<dd>Yes, which is why I didn't make the edit. That, plus I really enjoyed "Harry And The Hendersons"</dd>

<p>Also it must consider, before exactly taking the declarations from the family of Wallace, that exists certain portion of significant evidence, like are indigenous traditions, stories previous to 1958, information of sightings in several parts of the United States (not only in the West Coast), in which Wallace could not have some interference. It is not logical to think that outside able to influence in all the reports of apelike creatures (and malodorous), in American territory.</p>
<p>There's a point there, but I'm having trouble thinking of how to rephrase the less-than-masterful English. -- <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakenelson_4b56.html" title="User:Jakenelson">Jake</a> 06:51, 2003 Sep 20 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm curious as to why neither this page or the page devoted to the Patterson-Gimlin film mention Greg Long's 2004 book "The Making of Bigfoot". It seems to be a reasonably thorough investigation of the origins of that film. The focus of the book is Patterson's history as a con-man, and the alleged confession of Bob Hieronimus (an acquaintance of Gimlin) to being the one that wore the bigfoot suit in the famous footage. Long attempts to corroborate Hieronimus ' confession, although the success of his attempt is open to debate. The book also includes an interview with costume manufacturer Phillip Morris - Ed.</p>

<dd>I agree that the taxobox should not be used. This makes it appear as though Bigfoot's existence is scientifically accepted when it is not -- in an ideal world, readers would not draw conclusions that were not supported by the article, but we do not live in such a world and the presence of the taxobox implies that the bigfoot's classification is generally agreed upon, when its very existence is debated. The article text should make it clear how cryptozoologists classify Bigfoot, but not with a taxobox, which is used on thousands of articles for organisms the reality of which (present or former) is not seriously questioned. A parallel subject has come up concerning presenting the template used in countries like <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronations</a> and such, and these tables were eventually dropped (as were most of the articles on micronations). <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 19:57, Jan 10, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>TUF-KAT, The artist rendering is appropriate. It is roughly the same structurally and it is a detailed picture of the creature unlike the incredibly grainy and poorly focused Patterson-Gimlin Bigfoot picture. It goes with the subject of bigfoot and it furthers one's understanding of what the creature would look like. - <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScifiterX_690f.html" title="User:ScifiterX">ScifiterX</a></p>
<p>TUF-KAT, if you don't think the image is appropriate, state the rational justification of your position without deliberately insulting the artist who rendered it. Personally, I think the image is great. - <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Agent_64ec.html" title="User:The Agent">The_Agent</a></p>

<li>Encyclopedia articles generally don't include "artist's rendering" of any topic if there are photographs available, unless it is in the form of a diagram.</li>
<li>Our job as an encyclopedia is to summarize the views of those who are considered knowledgeable in various subject areas. Therefore, images of Bigfoot should only be used if they illustrate some encyclopedic interpretation of Bigfoot's appearance.</li>
<li>As a freely editable encyclopedia, we must be careful not to set a precedent whereby there is a link on an article which takes the user to a page where somebody has placed a sketch of the subject. That is the purpose of other web pages where amateur artists display their work; it is not the purpose of Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Since there is no agreed-upon description of exactly what Bigfoot looks like beyond some vague generalities, the sketch illustrates the view of a single Wikipedian about what Bigfoot looks like. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">This constitutes original research</a>.</li>
<li>An image of clear encyclopedic value is already present in the article. More images should only be added if they illustrate some point or facet that the photo does not. The photograph is not very clear but educates the reader that Bigfoot's detailed appearance is not known; placing a sketch indicates that Wikipedia is endorsing the view, unsupported by facts, that Bigfoot looks a certain way.</li>

<p>I really object to the taxonomic classification of bigfoot. You really can't classify an animal if you haven't got a specimen. Further, Gigantopithicus was essentially a giant Orangatan and from skeletal specimens we have they look nothing like eye witness accounts of big foot. If bigfoot existed it in the form of the creature in the photo it would more likely be a paranthropus (what was once classified as the robust australopithicine) of unusually large size. The size difference is relatively easy to account for as when the paranthropus travelled in his space ship to North America, or on his magic carpet or whatever, its representatives in the area may have gradually evolved the greater body mass for some logical reason. Sort of how the horses of today are descended from tiny prehistoric horses no larger than dogs. Gigantopithicus really couldn't be bigfoot.<a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizard_King_90fa.html" title="User:Lizard King">Lizard_King</a></p>
<p>There's an interesting discussion of all the difficulties that'd have been involved in faking the Patterson-Gimlin film, discussing muscle mass movement and the like at <a href="http://www.bfro.net/news/challenge/home.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.bfro.net/news/challenge/home.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bfro.net/news/challenge/home.asp</a> , and I'd like to suggest adding it to the links section. Having encountered at least one first-hand account which I regarded as credible in the Pacific Northwest, I do agree that treating a phenomenon as mythical on the basis of elusivity of evidence alone would not be NPOV, and the current version looked decently balanced on a first read. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Rodgers_82ba.html" title="User:Chris Rodgers">Chris Rodgers</a> 09:06, 25 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>A lot of people want to believe in bigfoot. Biologists, as a rule, dismiss the sasquatch as ludicrous nonsense on a par with yeti or Loch Ness monster.</p>
<p>The only evidence for their existence is tracks or grainy photographs, and the revelation that some photos were published as a prank just lowers the scientific reliability of the reports -- if there's a rung lower than "negligible" on that ladder.</p>
<p>So how should we write about this? Say that biologists dismiss the possibility of the creature's existence, same as astronomers dismiss the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_earth.html" title="Flat earth">flat earth</a> theory. But also identify people and groups that <b>do believe</b> and explain their reasoning.</p>
<p>Any child over eight years of age ought to be able to decide for themselves what they want to believe. Who knows? Maybe bigfoot is just shy and elusive. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 14:58, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the way we handle it now is appropriate, Ed. We say straight out that the creature is "probably mythical". (i.e., we report the standard, generally accepted view first.) We <i>don't</i> say "it <i>is</i> mythical" because - who knows? - maybe they <i>are</i> just shy and elusive. We have to keep open minds. And we don't say it actually exists or anything of that nature either, as the evidence just ain't there. The day the Smithsonian or the NPWS is ever persuaded to believe in Bigfoot, then we need to do a heavy re-write!</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The real problem with eyewitness reports</span></h2>
<p>I find the section "Problems with eyewitness reports" not strong enough. There <b>are</b> thousands of solid testimonies. Just saying that these may be confusions sounds very lame. The article must state that there are many more equally solid eyewitnesses of ghosts, flying saucers, and angels or fairies. Only this kind of comparison can explain why scientists customarily dismiss the "facts" gathered by huge groups of good-faith persons. If you omit it, the layman reader will think that explaining testimonies as confusion is bad-faith (and stupid).</p>

<p>New comment: 90% of the Bigfoot article is erroneous and written by someone with little real knowledge of the subject. There are no legit quotable sources since the editors of the related journals are very biased and take only one point of view, and reject any new info that disputes that POV. I tried to edit the piece, which begs for editing, and some j**k deleted all my edits even though I am a very seasoned researcher and former museum curator on this subject.</p>
<p>Therefore, consider 90% of the text as false or in error, because I know or did know, virtually all the authors and researchers. The best known writers have never seen a Bigfoot, and I have, 5x. The best known skeptics do no field work, except Bob Sheaffer of CSICOP, and he only four days.</p>
<p>This stuff about No Original Research is absurd... when someone who is just back from a research trip cannot post about it in an edit, by armchair writers can, something is wrong in Denmark. I have no peer review because only two or three researchers are my peers, in the true sense of the word. Peter Guttilla is one, Henry Franzoni is another, Brian Smith is another.</p>

<p>When a area reports a bigfoot/Sasquatch, the locals grab their guns, and if they see it themselves, they will shoot it, to kill it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bigfoot Sighting</span></h2>
<p>I was on my way to work one morning. There is a great deal of wooded areas on the route I take. I always watch for deer due to the large number of vehicle/deer accidents that take place in the area. On this particular morning I was driving along jamming on the radio and watching for deer. On the side of the road in the edge of the woods stood something about ten or twelve feet tall and it had long dark hair covering its body. It just stood there and watched me drive past. I believe the reason nobody finds dead bodies of a bigfoot is because the are dimensional travelers. I also believe they are shape-shifters and that is why we cannot see them unless it is an accident or they intend on somebody seeing them.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Smell</span></h2>
<p>Please add this to page.</p>
<p>Research shows that Bigfoot does not smell _per se_, but rather projects smells as a message or a deterrent. The smelles it sends out, can be skunk, dead animal, feces,urine, garbage,wet dog,etc. This writer has smelled three such smells in succession while finding himself unable to get out of a sleeping bag (paralysis) to check the source. Once the smells ended, he was able to get up. He has also smelled wet dog at the Lummi res., and dead animal on Mt Hood while discussing Bigfoot with a Kidnapee. When the smell itself was discussed, and it was decided to go in back of a building to look, the smell immediately ceased. In Daughtery,OK,at the home of a witness, every night at 7:30 a smell of "skunk" happened, usually during a discussion of Bigfoot. Skunks do not keep a schedule. The smell was then called "the skunk that is not a skunk". Bigfoot itself, does not stink.</p>

<p>" One researcher suggests that readers beware of any Bigfoot website that has no stated author with a real and checkable name. Many Bigfoot websites are set up by anonymous teenagers with no names and no experience. Anyone can publish on the net, and many websites have no validity. One very large forum are actually run by a foreigner who has never stepped foot in the American woods,and who caters to retrograde ideas about Bigfoot, and bans more advanced thinking.

<p>I am willing to see pro and con positions on say, Yeti, but you select illogical items by a mountaineer, who is NOT a zoologist.Messner is not very bright. Yeti tracks are found way,wayway UP from the gullys where bears find food, that have trees and soil, and you don't seem to get what any kid who goes to the zoo learns--- bears DO NOT, DO NOT walk on two legs for very far, as in NOT 30 feet, 50 ft, 100 ft, 200 ft,. or three miles, and Yeti tracks, all bipedal, are that long. I find your ignorance on such a simple subject, (look in ANY article on bears) amazing, and your use of Messner underscores your basic DEBUNKING attitude. What do I do to get beyond your obvious arrogance (I am a scholar, etc) and your self-pride? Do I have to QUOTE A ZOOLOGICAL TEXT ON BEAR ETHOLOGY? (JEEZ!!) And I am pretty sure Yeti does not mean bear in Sherpa language. There is no reason on God;s Green Earth for a Himalayan bear to be up at 20,000 feet! And the tracks left show a foot longer than a bear's and with humanoid toes, and huge BIG TOE, and that is NOT what a bear tracks looks like! You ever see bear tracks in the wild? I doubt it, and I have seen them.</p>
<p>Self-promotion -- I simply know a great deal on this, that others do not know, and it is hard to avoid using my name and exp[ertise to correct your amateur skeptical ramblings, without seeming to honk my own horn. I dare you to (egads!) talk to me on the phone on this. All this anonymous junk on Wiki is absurd -- you can't edit an encyclopedia AND BE UNKNOWN. No wonder the NY Times has no respect for Wiki. In fact, WHO ARE YOU? Call me 415-289-2277 and be a real person. I eat skeptics for lunch all the time, ask <a href="../../../c/s/i/CSICOP_c20d.html" title="CSICOP">CSICOP</a>.</p>
<p>Your edits for the Bigfoot/Yeti page show an obvious slant and bias. You edit out any info that mitigates the negative info you put in. You do not have NPOV and you are doing vandalism.</p>

<dd>Your version of events here is highly skewed. You were not blocked just for 3RR and 1RR (though you originally were for those quite often -- breaking all records by all accounts), arbcom stepped in and blocked you for an extended period for edit warring, POV-pushing, personal attacks and frequent use of sockpuppets to try to get around the rules.

Wikipedia <i>unintentionally</i> provides people a place to find and use paranormal oriented websites, data sites to report their encounters.

I was in the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fouke%2C_Arkansas_a1cf.html" title="Fouke, Arkansas">Fouke, Arkansas</a> area, looking into this matter when some guy accused ME of being a "Skeptic" and threatened to shoot me, saying some people who say they were skeptics had ridiculed and abused the locals, calling them idiots and worse.</p>

<p>I am one. There are hardly any others. Most of the books are passe', except for The Bigfoot Files, by Peter Guttilla, who has five sightings. I have 5/6 sightings dependingm on how you define them. The field is in flux, and virtually no reliable sources exist. You can quote my book in progress. This is not engfineering, or Chinese pottery. This is a paranormal subject. And that mere fact bothers people like DreamGuy and others. To them, it is messy.</p>

<p>Quoting a skeptic who does no research is an empty quote, with no basis. Saying Bob Sheaffer believes there is no Bigfoot, is worthless, since Bob does not do field work.

<p>The answer is that the skeptics, I know them, in person, DO NO RESEARCH. The supporters do. What the skeptics say often has no merit, except for noting lack of a body, while the supporters often based thier comments on field work. Hence, skeptical imput has LITTLE VALUE. Do you expect NO RESEARCH to be of equal value to ACTUAL RESEARCH? Get real, Guy.</p>

<p>DNA is supposed to be some kind of "miracle technology", used to get innocent people OUT of jail, OFF of DEATH ROW, put other people IN jail, ON Death Row. All one has to do is obtain some of the creature's DNA/RNA, have it compared to known DNA, such as human, ape, gorrilla, and the like.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 02:44, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>3. It is LARGE.</p>
<p>4. It has fur all over it.</p>
<p>5. It makes bizarre noises.</p>
<p>6. Fur color varies, most statements indicate a brown,black, white fur color.</p>
<p>7. It is extremely STRONG.</p>
<p>8. Known disposition varies, mostly, they do NOT seek confrontation with humans.</p>
<p>9. Civilian weapons either have no effect or the creature continues walking until it dies from the inflicted gunfire. I have NOT heard any military accounts. Some military bases encompass several thousand kilo-hectares of land. A Bernudi Shotgun slug can go <i>through</i> several automotive engine blocks. The military <i>doesn't</i> like <b>any</b> intruders of <i>any</i> sort.</p>
<p>Does not die. Shooting has no effect. Often the shooter is paralyzed and cannot shoot.</p>
<p>10. It is some kind of omnivore, and will raid farms, gardens and ranches,trash cans, compost piles, etc. to obtain food, if there is not enough food in the natural environment, as reports on several websites indicate. Note: there is not enough food in environment to support a 16,000 calorie per day need, and still allow BF never to be seen grzing as bears do. Hence, paranormal.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NOTE FOR DreamGuy re FIRST AID IN WIKIPEDIA AND WHAT TO DO</span></h2>
<p>Here, in Wikipedia, we have INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHOM TO CALL:</p>
<p>"Call for emergency services The next step is to activate emergency medical services by calling for help using a local emergency telephone number, such as 911 in Canada or the United States, 999 in the UK, 112 in most of continential Europe, 000 in Australia and 111 in New Zealand. Operators will generally require the caller's name and location and some information on person that is being called about (level of consciousness, injuries, name if known, chronic medical illnessess if known).</p>
<p>If you ask bystanders to call an ambulance for you, make sure they report back to you once released by the emergency operator to confirm that the call has been made. See Call for help.</p>
<p>Also note that in some circumstances, such as in remote areas or on the battlefield, outside help may be unavailable. The skill of wilderness first aid covers other measures including evacuation, but is no substitute for a medical professional if one can be located."</p>
<p>ALSO- Wiki article on BIOLOGICAL WARFARE:</p>
<p>"{Protective measures The primary civil defense against biological weaponry is to wash one's hands whenever one moves to a different building or set of people, and avoid touching door knobs, walls, the ground and one's mouth and nose. Washing literally sends the germs down the drain.</p>
<p>More exotic methods include decontamination, usually done with household chlorine bleach (5% solution of sodium hypochlorite). One useful decontamination is to leave shoes in an entranceway and make people wade and handwash in a footbath of bleach. Another useful technique is to periodically decontaminate floors and door knobs.</p>
<p>Medical methods of civil defense include stockpiles of antibiotics and vaccines, and training for quick, accurate diagnoses and treatment. Many weaponized diseases are unfamiliar to general practitioners.</p>
<p>Positive pressure shelters are possible but not cost-effective except for the most important installations. This is because in most attacks, the agent will disperse in a long narrow ellipse downwind from the release point. Persons outside the ellipse will not be affected except by secondary infection. Persons within the release ellipse cannot be helped by civil defense measures. They need medical diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible."</p>
<p>THIS GIVES ADVICE. Why can't we give advice on trauma due to a possible (alleged) Bigfoot sighting? Also UFO sightings? WHY NOT?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Note: Bigfoot witnesses can be traumatized and require someone to talk to. Contacting a Bigfoot org. can help them.</p>

For better or for worse, Wikipedia does not operate on personal credentials; it operates on quality of source material provided.

DreamGuy may be a skeptic, but the article needs to reflect a balanced view of Bigfoot – both that of skeptics and believers.</p>
<p>Wrongggggg-no,no,no, and no.</p>
<p>You, and DG seem to assume that "balance" is 50/50. Half skeptical, half pro. This is a major error. If someone knows just 5% of a subject, they cannot be given a 50% share with someone or group that knows 90% of the subject. Like a non-engineer being skepticval of a engineer who makes lathes. 50/50 balance is flat wrong here.</p>
<p>That is why I need to know your credentials, seeing you make this kind of basic error. Who are you, and what is your education,etc?</p>

<p>Beckjord, you need to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">CITE</a> the claims you make, and I see in the article that you misunderstand what it mean to "cite sources" for a claim. Example: you write, "Daegling also, in his book, reveals a basic failure to understand that weight distributed on a plate, plank or faked foot, does not make any significant penetration into the soil". For this statement, you cite ...Daegling! No, Daegling does not claim that Daegling reveals a basic failure to understand stuff. <b>You</b> claim it. You can't use Daegling as a source for it, and you can't use yourself either (Wikipedia does not allow <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>). You must offer a reputable, published source for the claim that Daegling fails to understand. You see? This is merely one small example, but a good one, of how NPOV and citing sources are supposed to work. Please ponder it, and please stop edit warring to re-insert those kinds of uncited arguments. Edit wars are considered harmful, and they're the quickest way to ruin your own reputation as a reasonable editor.

<dd>Formatting tips: Please don't give every sentence its own heading in extra large capitals, it uses up a lot of space and makes the page harder to use.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Oh boy, quite made my day, it has!</span></h2>
<p>I happened on the shenanigans on this article by chance, and it's the best laugh I've had for the whole holiday period. Mr Beckford is correct, where he says "Wiki (is) more shockingly bad every day". Quite so, especially since a couple of self-proclaimed experts joined us in recent times. I read the article thoroughly, and was particularly amused by the bit under the <b>Visual evidence</b> heading so I amended it. The entry basically claimed it would be impossible to fake the Patterson-Gimlin film. Codswallop. I tried to make the point that King Kong was extremely convincing, and yet it was a fake, with no ape or human involved. It can be done, and it has been done since long before Patterson-Gimlin produced their masterpiece. OK, so maybe the connection is a bit nebulous for some, so I won't be putting it back in. It seems to me that the claim that the film couldn't be faked supports the case for a Bigfoot, when in fact the film most definitely could easily have been faked, and in the eyes of many people, most certainly was. If we are not going to balance that unsupportable <i>impossible to fake</i> claim with something along the lines of what I submitted, then the paragraph under "Visual" should be canned IMMHO. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 23:22, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, be fair -- there's a big difference in the technology available in 2005 and when the Patterson film was made.

<dd>Hey Bunchy, technology is not the point, the ability to produce a fake film is the point. Under the heading <b>Audio and visual evidence</b> , the article quotes a pro Bigfoot person as saying it would be physically impossible to fake such a film. It wasn't impossible, or even difficult -- Hollywood had been doing it for decades before then. There needs to be information in this paragraph to say so, to balance such a spurious POV . I'll give it a day or so, and if the paragraph isn't amended to balance the existing POV, I will be bold and delete the whole paragraph. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 01:12, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Un-3RR is now in effect. While un-3RR is in effect, Wikipedia users reverting Beckjord's cabals' edits can not themselves violate the 3RR rule. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 03:10, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is a clearly <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">unacceptale</a> and underhanded tactic; and it will carry consequences. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 03:56, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Forgive my naivete: Is there really such a thing as Un-3RR being in effect? Who gets to declare it? —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 04:15, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, Un-3RR goes into effect for "good" users when a "call to arms" has been declared on an external website directing <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat_puppet.html" title="Meat puppet">meat puppets</a> to vandalize a Wikipedia article. I am not the one who declared Un-3RR in this case; Beckjord did with his actions. I was just noting that it is now in effect in case anyone didn't realize (as presumably you didn't). --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 04:19, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One editor not getting his way is not a war, especially if that editor continues to ignore basic Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 06:11, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The basic policy being violated is vandalism. DreamGuy and others are preserving GROSSLY WRONG INFO. Deliberate distortions of data.</p>
<p>Hear me?</p>
<p>I am fighting for truth. DG is fighting for erors. Zoe and Cyde should drop out. DG is teh Dark Side.</p>
<p>Call me and discuss 510-633-2526. Nobody has b*lls to do so.</p>

<dd>First off, when you do make new sections (you don't need to most of the time) use two = symbolds before and after the title... when you do it with only one it screws the formatting up. Secondly, before you accuse people of vandalism, you should read and follow the <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> policy, in this case specifically <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#What_vandalism_is_not" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism#What vandalism is not</a>. While you are at it, also try <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">Wikipedia:Civility</a> and all the various other policies already pointed out to you. If you don't follow the rules here it's no wonder there is a long list of editors undoing your edits on sight. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 07:58, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
