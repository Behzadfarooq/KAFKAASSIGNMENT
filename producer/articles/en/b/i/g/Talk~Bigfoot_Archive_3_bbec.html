<h2><span class="mw-headline">REQUEST TO BUNCHOFGRAPES AND MORITORI</span></h2>
<p>As respected Wikians, please add to the intro statement that the alleged Bigfoot has many regional names, and that the alleged Bigfoot is seen and reported (allegedly) in China,,Russia, Australia and South America. (Ref. Green, --146,147) this book is in the sources list below in article.</p>
<p>Your goal,I think, is to improve the article and not just be a "reverter".</p>
<p>Bunchofraisins</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I've added:
<dl>
<dd>Some believe the same creature may be found around the world, under different regional names — proponents of this theory would argue that Bigfoot and the <a href="../../../y/e/t/Yeti.html" title="Yeti">yeti</a> are one and the same. Sightings have allegedly occurred in China, Russia, Australia and South America. (Green 146,147.)</dd>

<p>Thanks for putting together something cogent. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 19:18, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed. Just <i>stay</i> civil, and keep the <b>hard <i>evidence</i></b> <i>comming. You have to</i> not <i>let your own paranormal experiences get to you at all. I too have seen some socially unacceptable things myself, but I examine</i> everything <i>as a police officer or a doctor would, so that I can effortlessly follow Wikipedian protocol. It also helps if you ask questions as well. Like that old Radio Shack ad says,"You Got Questions, We got Answers", so is Wikipedia. You got questions, Wikipedia has answers. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 00:17, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</i>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">hard evidence</span></h2>
<p>There is very little. No bones, no body. Just tracks, hairs, human contacts. I can add paranormal accounts, but wiki opponents should NOT take these as proof, since they are not offered as proof. It must be remembered that this is a SOFT SUBJECT, and unproven, and we investigators are trying to make sense of it, such as <a href="http://www.beckjord.com/wormholesinuse" class="external text" title="http://www.beckjord.com/wormholesinuse" rel="nofollow">theory on Bigfoot</a> People with NO knowledge of this topic,keep your sticky hands off the page.</p>

When someone makes that many mistakes and bad contributions all at once, the only thing to do is to revert it all and then go through and add back anything worth saving... which wasn't much. Trying to go back and edit it piece by piece is just a waste of time. The totally disputed tag got lost in the revert, and with that section the way it is after reverting Beckjord's edits, I didn;t think the tag was necessary anymore.

<p><big>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No,no, no.... Sliders and a current series that has people jumping thru a round circle of water like material, (forgot name) are fiction that is based on the wormhole THEORY.(Transverse wormholes) (not proven fact.)

<p><big>..&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no, since it is not, since Bigfoot does not stand around waiting for instrumentrs to be set up.

<dd><big>Kaku's hypothesis about wormholes lends no credence to your own theory about Bigfoot; you can stop dropping his name as though it means something. (Indeed, Wikipedia's own article on <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wormholes.html" title="Wormholes">wormholes</a> contains a reference that theorizes that travel through wormholes of this type is <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/schww.html" class="external text" title="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/schww.html" rel="nofollow">impossible</a>.

<dd><big>I've read your Bigfoot page, Beckjord. It is exactly as I say above – hand-waving. Sure, you offer up the caveat that it's "just a theory", but a theory without any meaningful evidence to back it up is not very useful, and I don't need to "go back to college" to know this. This is the stuff of science fiction.</big></dd>

<dl>
<dd><big>Of course, even if it <i>were</i> a meaningful theory on the origin of Bigfoot, it's still simply <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> for you to point to your own website. If you want "equal time" for the Bigfoot-as-alien concept, we need some reputable sources that identify it as a valid theory discussed among mainstream researchers. If that's not possible, we could maybe include a section on fringe theories – but only if you provide some references that explain that a sufficiently large number of people believe it or are interested in it, and that it's been covered in relevant newsmedia or suchlike.</big></dd>
<dd><big>You complain about your edits getting reverted, when all you do yourself is revert to a version of the article you prefer.

<p><big>EB has evidence to support his theory. This is in the form of:</big></p>
<p><big>1) disappearances in front of witnesses, including separately, EB himself (reference,</big></p>
<p><big>Thom Powell in The Locals, listed in the sources area of the Bigfoot article.</big></p>
<p><big>2) Tracks that end in snow, as documented by researcher Brian Smith on video, as referenced by the on-agfain, off-again external link <a href="http://www.bigfoot.org" class="external text" title="http://www.bigfoot.org" rel="nofollow">disappearing tracks</a></big></p>
<p><big>(also witnessed in separate events by EB, and researcher Shelly Binkleley, and WASH State Highway Patrolman Mark Pittenger (retired).)</big></p>
<p><big>3) It is unfortunate that Android and Dreamguy are both non-readers and are knee-jerk skeptics. Their relentless persecution of this article is amazing, based on their total LACK of any reading on the topic. A major flaw in Wiki. The gross bias, (see above comments by Android) is remarkable. They could not be more biased and ignorant if they had tried. Perhaps a year of so in a Jr College? I wonder if they have even read ANY of EB's website, <a href="http://www.beckjord.com/bigfoot" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.beckjord.com/bigfoot" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which gets 1000 hits a day, one of the highest of all the Bigfoot websites not counting one run by a fraud artist and hoaxer who happens to be tops in I.T. Run a google search, Android, on Beckjord and you will find thousands of references, some critical, and some fraudulant but most favorable.</big></p>

<dd><big>Beckjord, can I politely ask you what exactly out of that comment has any place in the article itself? The articles in Wikipedia do not support the incorporation of opinions that have no basis in facts that cannot be cross referenced. It is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Wikipedia's policy of no original research</a>. This is a policy so if you have a problem with that policy then you can discuss ways it should be modified. All contributors to Wikipedia are required to follow policies if they want their information to be in the articles. If you believe that you cannot abide by the policies that everyone else is required to abide by, then that seems a bit unfair, don't you think? You can put whatever you want into pages on your website(s), but that doesn't mean you can put those things here. I'm still trying to help you understand this situation and sadly, it doesn't appear that I am succeeding.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 12:03, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</big></dd>

If someone else had put the site there before Beckjord showed up thinking it was noteworthy and had valuable info, that'd be another story, but it didn't happen, because his site isn't considered valuable even by the pro-Bigfoot people who had control of this article for so long.

<dd><big><i>I guess I should explain this a bit more. A "Serious Researcher" to me is someone that is willing to look at both sides of the fence. Pro's and Con's of a given subject. Sometimes a researcher can get locked into a idea, theory, or whatever that they tend to lose sight of their original objective. If you let yourself get bogged down in the little details then you lose perspective of the larger picture. It is not about what they have done or seen but how objective they are in their research. Nothing is bad about toying around with a idea but it can only go so far. Does it sort make sense? Always remeber that a good researcher has perspective of what they are researching. Because sometimes you might find or miss a clue to what you are looking for. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusTCicero_a3a0.html" title="User:MarcusTCicero">MarcusTCicero</a> 16:20, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</i></big></dd>

<h2><big><span class="mw-headline">Let's talk NPOV and NOR and using experts on Wiki here</span></big></h2>
<p><big>I've finally read these items, and I find the so-called violations by me, are really minor errors on wording, such as how one must say (says NPOV)</big></p>
<p><big>"except to say, "So-and-so argues that ____________, and therefore, ___________." This can be done with a straight face, with no moral compunctions, because you are attributing the claim to "</big></p>
<p><big>So, I'll try it. (just one of many points I will raise)</big></p>
<p><big>I can say: "Beckjord (using 3rd person, as per NPOV) argues that the so-called Bigfoot may be a strange life-form and not a zoological species, and that therefore both skeptics and zoological adhereents may be incorrect as to what these creatures may be."</big></p>
<p><big>I can then quote from one of the publications or websites where this is published, as a source.</big></p>
<p><big>This is legit.</big></p>
<p><big>Further, since none of the editors who appear here are credible,and have no open names, nor degrees, none can decide what publications are reputable or credible, except experts like myself or others who may appear, with names and credibility and degrees.</big></p>
<p><big>Note from Wikipedia:encyclopedia</big></p>
<p><big>"However Wikipedia's articles are not necessarily peer reviewed and many of those articles are of a trivial nature. Legitimate concerns have been raised as to the (validity of the writing)."</big></p>
<p><big>Further, "Traditional encyclopedias are written by a number of employed text writers, usually people with an academic degree, "</big></p>

<p><big>IMHO, you people do not understand NPOV nor NOR. Maybe I did not either, but now I am rewriting my edits so they fit into NPOV. And yes, I CAN quote my own research, as long as I quote a spource where it was published, in print or on the web.</big></p>
<p><big>Once again, DreamGuy and Android79, get the H*ll out.</big></p>

<p><big>Wikipedia says:</big></p>
<p><big>QUOTE:</big></p>
<p><big>"Experts:</big></p>
<p><big>The role of expert editors "No original research" does not mean that experts on a specific topic cannot contribute to Wikipedia. On the contrary, Wikipedia welcomes experts.

This policy prohibits expert editors from drawing on their personal and direct knowledge if such knowledge is unverifiable. If an expert editor has published the results of his or her research elsewhere, in a reputable publication, the editor can cite that source while writing in the third person and complying with our NPOV policy. They must cite publications, and may not use their unpublished knowledge as a source of information (which would be impossible to verify). "</big></p>
<p><big>So, I, as an expert (30 yrs) CAN quote my work if it is "verifiable", which means written down somewhere in a journal, a newsletter, in private communication to another expert, or a website, INCLUDING MY OWN. All I need to do is use 3rd person.</big></p>

<p><big>I've begun adding {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} to statements that don't have sources (and, in some cases, to statements that <i>did</i> have sources, but were unclear).

<p><big>I did this up until the "Evidence" section. This section needs a major re-write, as does most of the rest of the article from that section on. It reads far too much like a point-counterpoint between skeptics and believers. Instead of offering "for" arguments and then countering them with "against" arguments for each separate concept, we should synthesize the arguments from both sides into a coherent paragraph or two.

<dd><big>My edit consisted of nothing more than removing redlinks, removing some internal links, editing the references section and correcting some spelling and grammatical mistakes per Wikipedia guidelines. I did not remove ANY information (until Android and I had to combine our edits). Even then, the little which was removed was not in any way vital to the article. However, I did spent some time polishing up the article and I’d hate to see it go to waste because some people here can’t get along.</big></dd>

<p><big>"Hyperlinking between conceptually related items is also a significant benefit. On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being (potentially) dynamic: new information can be presented almost immediately, rather than waiting for the next release of a static format (as with a disk- or paper-based publication)."</big></p>
<p><big>This means websites can be listed as references. As for a "mill", you have no expertise to decide that. Get a name, (and a life) first. Your statements and judgments have no merit. I do not accept you as an authority on anything."</big></p>

<dd><big>Since the sighting was by six men, readers are forced to take the soldiers’ word for it if we’re to believe it, but then again people imagine things and people lie. I’m aware that the article mentions thousands of Viet Cong and NVA soldiers allegedly sighted the creature, but this cannot be offered as evidence that Sasquatch lives in Vietnam.

<p><big>In summary, a blood sample taken from the Lummi Indian Res. was analyzed by Dr. Vincent Sarich, UC Berkeley, and found to be "unknown higher primate". Hairs found with blood were analyzed by Drs Rosen and Kerley, Univ. of Md. and found to be "unknown higher primate" and were further found to match three other sets of unknowns forom OR,CA,&amp;MD. These did not match any of the knowns in master set owned by Rosen, and were close to bear, gorilla and human, but were not either of those. These findings were also corroborated by forensic analyst Tom Moore of the Wyoming Fish and Game Lab. Similar work has continued with Dr. Henner Fahrenbach of the Oregon Regional Primate Center, Beaverton,OR.</big></p>

<p><big>Listen Beckjord, if you want to edit the article at least edit it correctly. For one thing, your referencing format is an ugly mess, and it isn’t even compatible or consistent with the rest of the article, not to mention with Wikipedia guidelines. And it’s hard to read. Here’s what you’ve added repeatedly before it’s been deleted…</big></p>

<dd><big>Sightings have allegedly occurred in China, Russia, Australia and South America [Reference John Green,pp46-47, for all locations.]Also, Hawaii has such reports.(Reference&#160;:P.147,"The Obake Files", Glen Grant,1996, Mutual Publishers,<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-56647-100-1</a>]</big></dd>

<p><big>Beckjord, seriously, can’t you at least even bother to put in spaces when needed and use the appropriate Harvard referencing format? Is that really too much to ask? Would using two parentheses on either side really kill you? Or are you just too lazy to do it yourself and expect others to clean up the formatting for you?</big></p>
<p><big>If that’s the way you think and behave Beckjord than frankly none of your “contributions” are really needed.</big></p>
<p><big>Anyway, this time I went ahead and kept what you wrote except formatted it correctly. Do us all a favor and go read <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> for next time, okay?</big></p>

<h2><big><span class="mw-headline">Findings on Rosen, Kerley and Sarich et al. according to Beckjord</span></big></h2>
<p><big>I haven't found much...but here is essentially what I have been able to dig up. Vincent Sarich was a Professor at UC Berkley...I can find no reference that he ever met Erik Beckjord aside from what Erik has told me. Beckjord claims that Sarich anaylized blood retrived from a</big></p>
<p><big>[piece of glass from an Indian house window on the Lummi Indian} (edit)</big></p>
<p><big><br /></big></p>
<p><big>reservation. According to Beckjord, Sarich identified the blood as being that from an "unknown higher primate". Beckjord then had a Dr. Stephen Rosen and a Dr. <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellis_R._Kerley_79cb.html" title="Ellis R. Kerley">Ellis R. Kerley</a> (both at the University of Maryland) examine hair samples associated with the same blood as well as unknown hair samples from at least 3 other locations and they, according to Beckjord, attributed them to "unknown primate". Tom Moore of the Wyoming Fish and Game lab also identified the hair samples as coming from an unknown primate. Without trying to, in any way, insult Beckjord, I need more than a link to Fate magazine..</big></p>
<p><big>{whatdo you expect after 20 years? Kerley is dead already.)</big></p>
<p><big><br /></big></p>
<dl>
<dd><big>what I need is for just one of these folks to publically state that these events did indeed happen</big></dd>
</dl>
<p><big><br />
[indeed happen?] I do not fabricate data.</big></p>
<p><big><br />
and that hopefully somehwere in a more mainstream source, the findings were published. I am looking into this as I studied under Dr. Kerley at the University of Maryland, and know that he is one of the founding fathers, per se, of modern forensic anthropology. Dr. Kerley is deceased and Tom Moore retired from the Wyoming job he held for 4 decades just last year...I am not sure of Sarich or Rosen, but Rosen did leave the University of Maryland in the mid 1970's. I am attempting to contact Tom Moore as he was apparently also going to present his findings at a sort of Bigfoot conference, but was "ordered" to not do so by his superiors with the state of Wyoming. In a nutshell, I see no reason that this may be a true series of events, though they do not in themselves prove of the existence of Bigfoot, or of anything. But we are talking about mainstream, reputable scientists that certainly have weight in their professions. Beckjord, would it be possible for you to scan into your computer and then email me the front cover and idex page of the copy of Fate magazine and the other one you mention, along with the text of the articles that you wrote? I will continue to try and track down more information on these events as they are noteworthy in article space I believe, but I need more evidence.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 06:45, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</big></p>

<p><big>I'm not lying. Sarich lives 10 miles from me now. He never put his findings into writing to keep HIS job, but he stated it to me, in his lab, in 1977. You had best learn now that these people __do not__ put such things on paper for fear of job loss.</big></p>
<p><big>But they said they wouid stand by it if anyone called them,etc. They never backed out.</big></p>
<p><big>Now, I can MAIL YOU, EGADS!!! Copies of the articles. Later, I can make jpgs of the pages. But hell, you can call up FATE MAG and ask them.</big></p>
<p><big>What is implied here is that you have to get more proof to see if I am lying. I do not lie about such things. I have my Eagle Scout rep. to uphold. Article has been on my site ten yrs. Send me a fax number and I will fax you the front pages. I see nothing sacred about the "privacy of the internet"... Re people have phone and fax. DO YOU?</big></p>

<p><big>Call me at 415-289-2277.</big></p>
<p><big>BTW.. there are no "mainstream" sources. The Mainstream is very careful to NOT TOUCH BIGFOOT WITH A 50 FT POLE. Dig? Ditto ufos. Dig??? Got it??? I was damn lucky to get those scientists to speak at all.</big></p>

<dd><big>Beckjord...I do not say you are lying...and I fully understand that mainstream scientists are not likely to publish their "opinions" without fear of reprosals from their peers in the academic circles...no doubt science moves at a glacial pace at times. Can you track down Tom Moore of the Wyoming Fish and Game Lab? He apparently retired last year or the year before. I am also interested in how the editors feel about this inclusion of a citation from Beckjord...it has nothing to do with wormholes or ufo related items and does apparently involve well known and reputable scientists.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 08:21, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</big></dd>

<dd><big>User:Beckjord is correct, I am dealing with a case in which a soldier is involved, and if this was reported, this soldier <i>will</i> be courts-martialled. The locus of what I'm dealing with is a crop circle located in woody weeds, and a bigfoot incident reported in 2000. Since I'm doing the investigation myself, I can't post any of it here due to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> protocol. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 08:28, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</big></dd>

<p><big>Even if we can verify what Beckjord says is true I wouldn't add it in. The only problem we'd have here is that other Wikipedia readers who try to verify the material would have a lot of trouble, and probably even remove it when they think it's bogus. I'm not saying Beckjord is lying, it's just that it's not good to write about stuff that hasn't been peer-reviewed and can't be verified by others independently. --<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvery1blowz_0fac.html" title="User:Every1blowz">Every1blowz</a> 09:58, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</big></p>
