<dd>It wouldn't hurt to put a spoiler warning, but I wouldn't say its needed really.

<dd>I think it is needed though. BBLB is on E4 and most people in this country don't have a digital service to watch E4.

<dd>While we're on the topic of E4, why is it that Big Brother Live's audio cuts out randomly? There doesn't seem to be any explanation of it on the C4 website or on the channel at all. Is the full audio only available on subscription or something or is there another reason? And while I'm asking, does anyone know what Pete is saying when his Tourettes kicks in and they bleep him out? They don't seem to bleep out the word 'w@nker' so I'm assuming that it must be a different word. <a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDiliff_29f1.html" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a> <small>| <a href="../../../d/i/l/User_talk%7EDiliff_39f9.html" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Diliff_8e9b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a></small></dd>

<dd>I remember an advert on last years BB which said something about, them blanking it out either because they are swearing, or because they are talking about things in the housemates private life, which BB thinks is not suitable for day-time programing.</dd>

<p>I'm pretty sure that the swear-word Pete says that gets blanked out would be 'C*nt', because C4 don't bleep out 'F*ck' after 9:00pm <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJake-helliwell_c3ca.html" title="User:Jake-helliwell">Jake</a> 09:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)<br />
Although, interestingly enough, while they don't bleep out 'f*ck' after 9:00pm, they DO bleep it out when used in the context of 'motherf*cker'. Odd, no?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, 'Motherf*cker' is a derogatry term, whereas 'f*ck' is mostly used, as an exclamation. I'm not sure if they would blank it out in 'F*ck off' though.. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJake-helliwell_c3ca.html" title="User:Jake-helliwell">Jake</a> 12:55, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We really have to be careful about how extensive this article becomes.

Should we split the articles into further subpages or leave it as it is?

<dd>True.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article naming</span></h2>
<p>Now, usually, I'd just <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">Be Bold</a> and do it, but seeing as this article seems to be quite contentious, lets discuss it here first.</p>
<p>Recently, I've noticed that the article naming is wrong. The name of the series is "Big Brother series 7", so that should be the title of the article. However, there are many different Big Brother series, many with articles on WP. So, <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">the naming conventions</a> call for a unique identifier in parenthesis. As such, I think that each series should be renamed to Big Brother series 7 (United Kingdom), Big Brother series 6 (United Kingdom) ...etc.</p>

<dd>In the U.S. it's clearly "Big Brother #", not "Big Brother". Only the first season is called simply "Big Brother". For instance <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/bigbrother6/" class="external text" title="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/bigbrother6/" rel="nofollow">Big Brother 6</a>. The DVDs are like <a href="../../../b/i/g/Image%7EBigbrother3dvd.jpg_895c.html" title="Image:Bigbrother3dvd.jpg">this</a>. But, regardless, I'm not sure its worth moving all these articles around. Essentially we know all the moving of the U.S. shows was a waste, that merely caused a bunch of redirects. I really think, that articles shouldn't be moved unless there's actually a signficant reason, and you plan on fixing the redirects. Also, I note, this article, and the official web site suggest "Big Brother UK" is an official name (see info box, and <a href="http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/housemates/housemate_news.jsp?id=23" class="external text" title="http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/housemates/housemate_news.jsp?id=23" rel="nofollow">Big Brother - the official Big Brother UK website from Channel 4</a>. See if you want to be "official", you'ld have to go with Big Brother UK (seasons 7). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 14:54, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Added: Also note, if we want to be really consistant, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28US_TV_series%29_c20a.html" title="Big Brother (US TV series)">Big Brother (US TV series)</a> uses "US" while the season articles use "USA". Originally both used "USA", but somebody moved the main article to "US". I spun-off all the seasons to use "USA" to be consistant with the original title. I didn't use parenthesis, so I could be consistant with the UK ones. My effort to be consistant, has now proven to be a waste. This is why article titles should be left alone, if all links go to the article directly, unless you think the new title is much superior and will be permanent. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 15:06, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I know theres a drive to have sources cited here, but Q102 are notoriously slow at updating their website (the morning show section barely mentions Sue Carter, who is the current holder of the ticket they found, as even presenting the show she has both worked on and produced for at least two years), but they -did- find one of the golden tickets among the &gt;10,000 tickets they purchased on a trip to the UK which was funded by Stena Line and a Dublin Peugeot dealers called Mongey Plunkett. As a regular listener to Q102, and on the basis that they will eventually mention it somewhere on their site, I'm willing to stake what little reputation I have on the Wikipedia that its true. There should be an Australian girl called Sue Carter amongst the hopefuls for the golden ticket place(s) in the house, and indeed, a Susan Carter who "purchased over 10,000 tickets" has appeared on the list released of known ticket holders. --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 03:38, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looking at the article, having the housemates listed alphabetically looked strange at first but having got used to it I think it was the right thing to do.

<dd>Hi m8 - Don't forget to tag the images u upload, as mentioned a few pointers up. This is important for the Wikipedia project to succeed. Best from <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShojo_5998.html" title="User:Shojo">luke</a> 17:23, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hello. I changed Sezers pic from the 'eviction face' to the previously used picture for a couple of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an encyclopedia, and as such any graphical representation of the subject should not be biased, as I believe the 'eviction face' image portrays Sezer Yurtseven negatively. The 'shock' picture is not complimentary. We are not looking to show housemates in the worst possible light.</li>
<li>The image does not 'fit' with the other images in the article. Yes, I was the one that uploaded nearly every other image in the article but my <i>opinion</i> is that consistancy should be paramount. The 'shock' pic is of a particular event in the house, whereas all the other images are of the housemates in a neutral pose.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't revert the image yet, but I would also like to repeat an earlier comment of mine that housemate images should be rotated semi-reguarly to 'freshen up' or avoid stagnation in the article.</p>
<p>I also feel that the objection to any change of the image to be against <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. Kind regards, <a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelardore_3570.html" title="User:Celardore">Celardore</a> 17:36, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's spelled Cela<b>R</b>dore by the way. My thoughts are: My intention was to contribute to the article in a positive manner, ie the screenshots of the housemates. I don't want to get into any fights right now, so I absolved myself from the issue. My main intention was to avoid conflict.
