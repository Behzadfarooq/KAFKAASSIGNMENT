	    <p><b>Bigg City Port</b> is a fictional <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harbour.html" title="Harbour">harbour</a>, the setting of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children%27s_television.html" title="Children's television">children's television</a> series <a href="../../../t/u/g/TUGS_7894.html" title="TUGS">TUGS</a>, produced by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_D._Cardona_0700.html" title="Robert D. Cardona">Robert D.

<p>In the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">fictional universe</a> of the series, Bigg City is "the biggest harbour in the world" in the 1920s, when the series is set. It is located at the mouth of an unnamed river. There are factories and warehouses for many different industries located there, as well as an <a href="../../../t/u/g/TUGS_Liner_Characters_0b42.html" title="TUGS Liner Characters">ocean liner</a> dock and the various facilities necessary to keep the port going (such as coal and oil depots, repair yards and the municipal dump). Most importantly for the purposes of the series, it is the home of the two <a href="../../../t/u/g/Tugboat.html" title="Tugboat">tugboat</a> fleets around which the series centres, the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Fleet_%28tugs%29_b4bb.html" title="Star Fleet (tugs)">the Star Tugs</a> and the Z-Stacks.</p>
<p>There are also several old and abandoned areas, which are the haunt of criminals in the series. There are a few locations outside of the port itself used in the series, such as Upriver and Demder Rocks (see below).</p>
<p>Among the ships using the harbour are <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tramp_steamer.html" title="Tramp steamer">tramp steamers</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car_float.html" title="Car float">car floats</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishing_boat.html" title="Fishing boat">fishing boats</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barge.html" title="Barge">barges</a> of all kinds.</p>
<p>A basic map of part of the port was produced for the Tugs <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_game.html" title="Board game">board game</a>, but it is uncertain whether this is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>.</p>

Its old headquarters were seen in the episode 'High Tide', in which they were moving to their new base across the harbour.

<p>The tugs are often seen docking <a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean_liner.html" title="Ocean liner">ocean liners</a>, and this is where they are moored. To win a liner contract is seen as a major coup for a tug fleet. The ocean liner Princess Alice is based here, although plenty of other vessels are seen being brought in.</p>

<p>There are several abandoned docks seen and mentioned in the series, although it is not clear whether they are always the same location or several different ones. In the episode 'Warrior', some of the older docks are being rebuilt, and in the episodes 'High Winds' and 'Pirate', criminals used them as a hideout.</p>

<p>This was seen in the episode 'Quarantine', although it has appeared in the background of other episodes. It is the embarkation point for the Fultan Ferry, a stern wheel paddle boat which, in the words of Captain Star, has "to ply back and forth, carrying vehicles and freight to a regular timetable." The ferry itself was once sunk by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stack_No._3_-_OJ_22a2.html" title="Stack No. 3 - OJ">OJ</a> when that tug suffered an engine malfunction, but was later refloated.</p>

<li><b>Melon Produce Co.</b> - A warehouse with a quayside, seen flooded in the episode 'High Tide'.</li>
<li><b>Munitions factory</b> - Seen in the episode 'Munitions', this was a place to be approached with caution.

<p>This is the point at which ships come in and out of the port, and therefore appears in several episodes. It is also the furthest the harbour tugs can go out to sea. <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lillie_Lightship_3542.html" title="Lillie Lightship">Lillie Lightship</a> is moored here, guarding vessels against running aground on the hazardous Demder Rocks. Old Rusty, the elderly <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tramp_steamer.html" title="Tramp steamer">tramp steamer</a>, has been anchored here for two years.</p>
<p>Ships in <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarantine.html" title="Quarantine">quarantine</a> have to wait here for medical inspection, and this is a popular place for tugs to hail vessels requiring a tow.</p>
<p>In the episode 'Bigg Freeze', the tugs managed to perform a turnaround on the SS Vienna out here. There is a small port here, seen in the same episode, which Captain Star makes his temporary headquarters.</p>
<p><a name="Upriver" id="Upriver"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigg_City_Port_8515.html" title="Edit section: Upriver">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Upriver</span></h3>
<p>Much of the tugs' traffic takes them up here. Timber and logging are the major industries up here, and Billy Shoepack, the alligator tug, works to supply them. There is also a ship's graveyard, which is mentioned but never seen. Some towns along the river include Uptown, Mittsville and Toptown. Several channels lead off the river.</p>
<p>A number of characters come from Upriver, most notably <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stack_No._7_-_Sunshine_41e6.html" title="Stack No. 7 - Sunshine">Sunshine</a> and Billy Shoepack. The acquitted pirate tug Sea Rogue and his uncle live up here, and the formerly jinxed tug Boomer was converted into a house boat and moored up here at a place marked "Dun Tuggin'".</p>
<p>Sunshine is probably the Star Tug most familiar with Upriver.</p>

<p>This unseen location was the home of the ill-fated tramp steamer Krakatoa, and presumably also of the officious Naval tug Bluenose. It is visited by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stack_No._6_-_Hercules_3f97.html" title="Stack No. 6 - Hercules">Hercules</a> in the episode 'Munitions', and in this episode it was described as being located "up the coast". In the episode 'Sunshine' it is noted that Hercules is "off up the coast, out of the way," but it is not clear whether he was at the base in this episode.</p>
<p>Despite being a Naval submarine, Grampus appears to live in the port rather than at the base.</p>

<p>Ships travel from Bigg City all over the world. However, other ports are rarely referred to. The only one that can be identified is the home port of the tramp steamer Izzy Gomez. The name on his stern gives "Puerto Grande" as his base. As this means "Big Port" in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, presumably this is a <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South American</a> equivalent of Bigg City Port. There is possibly a battle or war occurring nearby because in 4th of July Bluenose and a battleship came and used tried to use Grampus for shooting practice. Also there is mention of another port in Bigg City in which without the proper light the S.S. Vienna would go there instead of Bigg City.</p>
<p><a name="Location" id="Location"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigg_City_Port_8515.html" title="Edit section: Location">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Location</span></h2>
<p>It is never made explicitly clear where Bigg City Port actually was, and even the most devoted fans of the series disagree. Some of the confusion arises from the fact that, with a few exceptions, the characters have <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accent.html" title="Accent">accents</a>, yet the port itself appears very American. Further confusion arises from the beginning of the episode 'High Tide', in which Captain Star refers to "inland cities and towns", which some viewers misheard as "<a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> cities and towns".</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the architecture, the volume of traffic and the types of vehicles (both seagoing and land-based) all point to an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> location. The ultimate clue lies in the fact that the port holds an annual regatta for the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29_0192.html" title="Independence Day (United States)">July 4th</a> celebrations.</p>
<p>Beyond this, it is difficult where in the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a> Bigg City is supposed to be. The port is presumably quite far north, as it sometimes freezes up in the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winter.html" title="Winter">winter</a> and it is not unknown (though not common either) for <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceberg.html" title="Iceberg">icebergs</a> to drift into its waters. Like <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, the port suffers from fog. The surrounding countryside is heavily forested.</p>

<p>The producers were primarily inspired by <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and in many ways Bigg City resembles that location. The <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, with its mix of modern (for the 1920s) <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscraper.html" title="Skyscraper">skyscrapers</a> and more 18th and 19th century buildings is very reminiscent of San Francisco, as the large suspension bridge that crosses the harbour (as observed above, this is probably based on the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Gate_Bridge_e830.html" title="Golden Gate Bridge">Golden Gate Bridge</a>).</p>
<p>The series drew on the <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noir.html" title="Noir">noir</a> and crime <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">genres</a> for its stories and atmosphere, and Tugs crew member <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Tulloch_1b09.html" title="Chris Tulloch">Chris Tulloch</a> cited the 1954 film <i><a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Waterfront_10ec.html" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i> as another inspiration in terms of the atmosphere the producers were trying to create. Therefore, it may be assumed that Bigg City was in part based on <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hoboken.html" title="Hoboken">Hoboken</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> (where that movie was filmed) and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> (whose crime-infested docks formed the basis of the film's story).</p>
