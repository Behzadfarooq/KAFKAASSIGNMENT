<p>Hi, I assume you are Canadian from your topics; it's nice to have a North American writing some bird articles, so far they have been biased to Europe or Oz (the latter courtesy of <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a>). There are some public domain images on the USFWS website <a href="http://images.fws.gov/default.cfm?CFID=1813329&amp;CFTOKEN=63774106" class="external free" title="http://images.fws.gov/default.cfm?CFID=1813329&amp;CFTOKEN=63774106" rel="nofollow">http://images.fws.gov/default.cfm?CFID=1813329&amp;CFTOKEN=63774106</a>, but nothing suitable for Ring-necked or Redhead.</p>
<p>I've been to Canada a couple of times, Southern Ontario (esp Pelee) in 1999, and Nova Scotia last Oct, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 19:21 21 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>One thing I forgot to mention is that there is a policy that fauna names, if more than one word, have a lower case redirect to them. Thus <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring-necked_Duck_6490.html" title="Ring-necked Duck">Ring-necked Duck</a> has a redirect from <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring-necked_duck.html" title="Ring-necked duck">ring-necked duck</a>. I've fixed that one and the two teals. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 05:49 23 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Sorry, I jumped the gun a bit with the Wood Duck image. If you want to change them around or dump mine, that's fine with me.</p>
<p>On the general image point, an uploaded image replaces another with the same name without giving a warning, so I tend to put a number on the end of the name to make it less likely that this will happen by mistake. Probably a bit over the top, since people are unlikely to be queueing to upload duck pics. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 05:46 25 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi Big Iron. Nice work on the ducks. You seem to have taken to this Wikipedia thing like .. er ... a duck to water.&#160;:) <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>

<p>It's just Goldeneye on this side of the pond, and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Goldeneye_5989.html" title="Common Goldeneye">Common Goldeneye</a> in North Am. <i>Wildfowl</i> by Madge and Burn, which I take as my bible on swans geese and ducks lists it as Common Goldeneye, with Goldeneye as the only listed alternative. European isn't even accurate, so I wouldn't bother including that (I hope it wasn't me put it on the disamb page). <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 12:24 10 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Excuse me butting in here, Big iron, I saw your note on Jimfbleak's talk page. The classification of the egrets is all over the place like a dog's breakfast. So far as I can tell, the number of different "official" ways to assign the various egrets to particular genera is equal to the number of authorities consulted plus one! Jim and I discussed this briefly somewhere a while back (probably on our talk pages, or maybe the egret talk page), but I don't know that we got any further than scratching out heads. From the point of view of search-engine friendliness, we should try, somewhere in the text of each species account, to mention <i>all</i> the names - so that if you hit Google looking for a Great Egret (Great White, American, whatever) under <i>Ardea alba</i> or <i>Egretta alba</i> or <i>Casmerodius albus</i>, you still find it. Which doen't help with your question about rationalising them, of course .... <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>In Europe, it's <i>Egretta</i>, in N.Am, except Peterson (ie National Geographic and Sibley), it's <i>Ardea</i>, in Oz and New Zealand it's <i>Ardea</i>. Since it breeds in all three areas, there needs to be a rational main name. I can live with <i>Ardea</i>, so I suggest we go with that. I should say however that the similarly widespread <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle_Egret_a61b.html" title="Cattle Egret">Cattle Egret</a> is <i>Bubulcus</i> everywhere except Oz, so I'd prefer that as the main version for that species. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">Jim</a>

<hr />
<p>On the taxonomy issue, I don't know how closely you have been following the various discussions on this. At the order/family level, our effective working scheme, unless you strongly disagree, is that at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_birds.html" title="List of birds">List of birds</a>, although the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passerine.html" title="Passerine">passerines</a> are not fully sorted yet. There is another scheme at <a href="../../../s/i/b/Sibley-Ahlquist_taxonomy_0401.html" title="Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy">Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy</a>.</p>
<p>Species list come from various sources, and don't always agree on scientific names at the genus/species level, although <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_White_Egret_9a60.html" title="Great White Egret">Great White Egret</a>, with three to chose from, is a particularly bad case. I would say that if a decision is purely North American, eg whether to have <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow-rumped_Warbler_f391.html" title="Yellow-rumped Warbler">Yellow-rumped Warbler</a> as one species or two, just decide yourself.</p>
<p>For the species which have a wider range, I imagine that we will have to discuss them as they arise to ensure a consistent approach. A similar problem could theoretically arise with a species pair; for example European <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Egret_cab8.html" title="Little Egret">Little Egret</a> and <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowy_Egret_49c3.html" title="Snowy Egret">Snowy Egret</a> must be in the same genus, whatever it is.</p>

<p>I'm sorry you are having to create so many links for you new articles. When I started, I put in links for common European and NAm birds (didn't know enough about S hemisphere to do Australian/NZ birds), but by the time I got to the waders, I'd given up hope on anyone doing any NAm, so I mainly linked European species. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a> 08:53, 9 Sep 2003 (EDT)</p>

<p>An anon user has added a bit to <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grouse.html" title="Grouse">Grouse</a> about <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ant.html" title="Ant">ants</a>. It's clearly intended to be a link to his specialist topic, since most of his/her contributions are in that field. I think this is pure speculation, because grouse don't occur in southern England where this Donisthorpe guy researched.</p>
<p>My inclination is to remove this bit, but I thought I'd check with you, since for all I know NAm grouse might munch ants like sweets (sorry, candy). I only got involved with NAm grouse, none of which I've ever seen, because I stumbled across a stub for <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heath_Hen_912e.html" title="Heath Hen">Heath Hen</a>, which then required <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Prairie-Chicken_1160.html" title="Greater Prairie-Chicken">Greater Prairie-Chicken</a> to make sense.</p>
<p>BTW, I might do <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glaucous_Gull_8002.html" title="Glaucous Gull">Glaucous Gull</a> and <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iceland_Gull_2f34.html" title="Iceland Gull">Iceland Gull</a> next, which overlap our continents. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">Jim</a></p>
<p>Only just saw your last message. I actually went out birding yesterday - saw the fourth <a href="../../../p/e/c/Pectoral_Sandpiper_8078.html" title="Pectoral Sandpiper">Pectoral Sandpiper</a> this month - it's been a bumper tear for this species in the UK. BCCorr seems to have systematically removed all the spurious references to Donisthorpe from other articles too, so it's up to you whether the ants go back in. As far as the UK <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grouse.html" title="Grouse">grouse</a> are concerned, I know they eat insects, which presumably include ants, but I've not checked in BWP yet. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">Jim</a></p>

<hr />
<p>I've added some species to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_North_American_birds_bc2f.html" title="List of North American birds">List of North American birds</a>. They are basically edited copies from <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_birds.html" title="British birds">British birds</a>, so I'd be grateful if you could check and delete anything I've incorrectly listed. This page is a bit of a mess at the moment, part listed by bird type, and part by scientific family. I don't have any preference, but it should be one or the other. I don't mind sorting it, but as the resident NAm birdperson, it's your decision which system you would prefer. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">Jim</a></p>
<hr />
<p>First off, thanks for the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark-eyed_Junco_5f15.html" title="Dark-eyed Junco">Dark-eyed Junco</a> article! I like that little bird.</p>
<p>Re: edits to <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yosemite_Valley_14c6.html" title="Yosemite Valley">Yosemite Valley</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sierra_Nevada_%28US%29_87af.html" title="Sierra Nevada (US)">Sierra Nevada (US)</a>. There is a general question&#160;: should Wikipedia articles about animals be specific down to the species, or just cover genus? Either way, edited links should point to likely articles.. Your edits imply that, for birds, the specific species deserves an article (i.e., dark-eyed juncos versus other kind of juncos). How about trees &amp; mammals? Does a white pine deserve its own article? I don´t think so (at least perhaps not yet). So, we might have an inconsistency between specificity of links to articles between birds and other living things.</p>
<p>I´m not a birder, so I really don´t know what the right thing for birds is... I just wanted to point out a possible inconsistency. What do you think? -- <a href="../../../h/i/k/User%7EHike395_91ce.html" title="User:Hike395">hike395</a> 11:32, 19 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

Re <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burrowing_Owl_ca70.html" title="Burrowing Owl">Burrowing Owl</a>, that's fine by me. I like owls, and that one in particular is something of a favourite, being both diurnal and approachable.

<p>re <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray-crowned_Rosy-Finch_e840.html" title="Gray-crowned Rosy-Finch">Gray-crowned Rosy-Finch</a>. Interestingly, I wrote <a href="../../../r/u/f/Rufous-tailed_Rock-Thrush_0c60.html" title="Rufous-tailed Rock-Thrush">Rufous-tailed Rock-Thrush</a> this am, which is obviously a similar case. In terms of redirects, it doesn't really matter what we put (I used <a href="../../../r/u/f/Rufous-tailed_rock-thrush.html" title="Rufous-tailed rock-thrush">Rufous-tailed rock-thrush</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Thrush_a2c7.html" title="Rock Thrush">Rock Thrush</a> for that one, but <b>Rufous-tailed Rock-thrush</b> could also be a possibility), so the the question is really what style is used for article names.</p>
<ul>
<li>The names used are, by default, those from HBW, from where I got the species list. However, I've changed some of the names where it suits me, especially if it seems likely that someone would search for a more familiar name.</li>
<li>I'm not very keen on HBW hypenated styles like <b>American Golden-Plover</b>, and I would personally prefer <b><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Golden_Plover_ce36.html" title="American Golden Plover">American Golden Plover</a></b>, which is what people would look for. However, since species names are capitalised in Wikipedia, the normal convention for the hyphenated group bit would be to capitalise both words, if the hyphen is in.</li>
<li>My preference would be to dump the hyphen and have <b>Gray-crowned Rosy Finch</b> rather than <b>Gray-crowned Rosy-finch</b> as the article title, and then the redirect is obvious.</li>
<li>What ever you decide, I'm sure it will be appropriate, I've read enough of your articles to know that</li>
</ul>

Its wings are much longer than the tail, the hind neck is dusky, not clean white, the bill looks heavy, and the white patch in front of the wings seems to be a feature too. Thanks for the help, Jim</p>
<p>Big iron, you and Jim amaze me with your productivity. Pretty soon there won't be any American or European birds left to do! But the reason I dropped by is to say that I just saw your <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Wren_ee2a.html" title="Rock Wren">Rock Wren</a> illustration and ... damnit! ... I'm jealous. That is as beautiful a little bird as one could hope to see. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></p>

<p>Hi there. I uploaded this image of an Orange-crowned Warbler from the USFWS, but then noticed you had a placeholder filename in the table already. Do you plan to upload your own image, or is the one I uploaded fine to add? <a href="../../../h/a/d/User%7EHadal_a4d0.html" title="User:Hadal">Hadal</a> 17:51, 1 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, could you take a look at the flight picture I have added to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red-tailed_Hawk_c129.html" title="Red-tailed Hawk">Red-tailed Hawk</a>, please? I am 99% sure of my identification but I never saw the bird's upper parts to confirm the red rump, so I am seeking a second opinion on principle.

<p>BigIron: I notice that you've been putting a number of pages associated with the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Action_Party_7e32.html" title="Canadian Action Party">Canadian Action Party</a> on the vfd site. While I won't make any claims as to the literary merit of most of these articles, my feeling is that this might be the wrong answer to the problem.</p>
<p>I would argue that the act of running for federal office in Canada is sufficient enough to make someone eligible for inclusion on Wikipedia. Most of the CAP articles are in need of a cleanup, but not (I think) deletion.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, I edited the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnus_Thompson_a544.html" title="Magnus Thompson">Magnus Thompson</a> page a while ago, though I apparently forgot to take down the cleanup notice. Thompson ran in both 2000 and 2004; as such, his page is useful as a link between the two separate results [albeit that the riding results for 2000 haven't been added yet].) <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 00:05, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>B.I.: I suppose there are bound to be differences of opinion on borderline cases like these. I'd still argue that having pages on individual minor-party candidates is useful, if not always necessary.</p>
<p>I don't suppose there's any way I could convince you to withdraw your request for the deletion of the Thompson article? (Or, since that's probably impossible, to withdraw your support for its deletion?) <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 01:47, 29 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Big Iron: I've been involved in a lengthy discussion with Jon Garrett on a possible compromise on the "fringe party bios" issue. You can check out our discussion pages if you want the full details. Here's one salient excerpt from one of my letters, forwarded for discussion:</p>
<p>&lt;start quote&gt;</p>
<p>Responses:</p>
<p>The general convention on the vfd page is that two-thirds support is required for a page to be deleted. I suspect that most people who've wanted to vote on the current round of fringe-candidate articles have already done so, and there isn't really a clear consensus on any of them (let alone a 67% consensus one way or the other). The closest to a consensus, at present, are the Dancey and Fernandez pages -- and the support for deletion here is only 58% (discounting The Recycling Troll) or 54% (including The Recylcing Troll). (I'm not completely certain that The Recycling Troll is a real troll, and every other contributor seems genuine enough).</p>
<p>I believe, for this reason, that the articles will probably survive the vfd page on at least technical grounds.</p>
<p>My concern, at the moment, is not so much with the technical deletion requests as with the broader principle. I think we can agree that there *is* a place on Wikipedia for some information on fringe candidates -- it's such a matter of determining the parameters and form that such information should take. I recognize that there are some advantages and disadvantages to *both* the "bio pages" and the "short bios on a central page" approaches (although I'm not sure if we should be determining Wikipedia policy based on the number of people likely to read any particular page ...), and I could very easily reconcile myself to the latter if it's the popular will. I'm just not certain that the latter course is necessary.</p>

<p>Big Iron: The idea of consolidating "fringe-candidate" information on a single page has its advantages, but it also creates some problems when the candidate has run in more than one election (although I suppose redirects could take care of this). I could live with either outcome, though I still don't think that the change is absolutely necessary. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 17:53, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
