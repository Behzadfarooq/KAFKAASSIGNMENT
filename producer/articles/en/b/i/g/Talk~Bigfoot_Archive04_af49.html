<h2><span class="mw-headline">Notices</span></h2>
<p>1) I archived the page. It was huge again, and most of the discussion was complaints by an editor and his sockpuppets who are now banned from Wikipedia for a year. All that should no longer be relevant to future work on the article.</p>
<p>2) Beckjord is banned, per the decision of ArbCom... That means if he or some anon IP or some new sockpuppet of his comes along, don't waste your time trying to improve it, remove it completely, because it's already been shown that he is POV-pushing and spamming, and trying to edit it to make it better means making the article worse. Reverting back to the last good version is the only reasonable option. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 17:35, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article revision</span></h2>
<p>DreamGuy, I think you prematurely reverted the Bigfoot article. The only problem is you didn't take the time to see the numerous good edits present that were also removed when you reverted to an earlier version, thus the article suffers a good deal of collateral damage that can be avoided. Many of the good edits are minor but are scattered throughout the article, so reinstating them would be a very tedious task.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think it’s best to just remove the blatant Beckjord advertising and nonesense from the current version rather than revert.</p>
<p>Secondly, a lot of the "Beckjord" stuff was written by MONGO, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bigfoot&amp;diff=38592904&amp;oldid=38590197" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bigfoot&amp;diff=38592904&amp;oldid=38590197" rel="nofollow">see edits</a>. You two should discuss whether or not to keep the material rather than you simply jumping the gun and just removing it. --<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvery1blowz_0fac.html" title="User:Every1blowz">Every1blowz</a> 18:24, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry... Frankly, not seeing these "good edits", but if they are "minor," as you say, then it's better to revert the MAJOR problems and have people go through and re-add the minor improvements instead of keeping the major, major problems for the sake of a few minor additions. I certainly am not "jumping the gun" but removing blatant POV-pushing... and if the POV-pushing was, in fact, written by MONGO (which I haven't checked), then it's still wrong. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 03:52, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think MONGO did filter a lot of Beckjord's, uh, information, in the current version - I've asked him to join this conversation. It would be good to work out a stable version we can all agree to here, now that we don't have Beckjord to deal with, yeah? I'll be happy to protect the page in the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wrong_version" class="extiw" title="m:Wrong_version">m:Wrong version</a>, if it comes to that. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 04:00, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't have a serious problem with this revert. Those are really Beckjord's edits that Mongo merely tried to clean up... they don't need to stay in any form. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 04:06, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The information I added was indeed in a published periodical and was cited...now that periodical is no longer in print it is harder to reference but I did reference it. All it was was an article written by Beckjord and published in 1977 or 78....it cannot be cross referenced, but the names mentioned are key players in forensic science and DNA...especially <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellis_R._Kerley_79cb.html" title="Ellis R. Kerley">Ellis R. Kerley</a> and Dr. Vincent Sarich. Though it cannot be cross referenced and I have searched for anything else related to these issues in vain, I also have no reason to doubt Beckjord's claim on this matter. Naturally I don't condone the personal attacks or buy into the wormhole/ufo nonsense. I don't really care if my edit stays or not...I may have trusted Beckjord based on his meeting (he claims to have met) with Kerley and I studied under Kerley and I do know that Kerley did do a lot of work on hair samples for forensic evidence.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:08, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not to beat a dead horse...but I am thinking this matter over at this time. I have attempted to make contact with Tom Moore who is now retired to see if anything else about the hair diagnosis was published. Bear in mind that nothing I put in the article offered proof of bigfoot...it was just a summary of events as detailed in the published work.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 03:18, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are not a Bigfoot phenomenon in any Latin American country folklore, as far I know. When Spanish-speakers talk about the Bigfoot of US, they called it also Bigfoot or its translation to Spanish, "Piegrande" (or "Pie Grande").--Menah the Great 23:36, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More pictures please</span></h2>
<p>Does anyone else think this article needs more pictures of a Bigfoot? I mean there's an awfull lot of text but only one photo. I'm worried this may keep some readers thoroughly bored, maybe even those interested in the subject. I think the epitome of a good article is one which is both well written (we've got that part nailed) but also a well illustarted article. We're obviously lacking in the latter department.</p>
<p>I have noticed that we've removed two other pictures so far. One from NIMBA creations (a model sasquatch or something) and another from Beckjord. That's good. The former was blatant advertising and the other wasn't even very good; basically what we already had except a blown-up, crappier, and gray-scaled version of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think if someone stumbles upon an excellent or noteworthy picture which we can use I don't see any problems with adding it to the current article.</p>

<dd>The most likely reason is that nobody has ever actually taken a picture of a real bigfoot. Most likely <i>that</i> is because bigfoot is ficton, folklore, and legend. Only blurry, out-of-focus images can be passed off as supposedly being bigfoot: if the same photo were taken but was in-focus and clear, you could clearly see that it was just a weird rock, tree, bush, bear, shadow, or whatever. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:35, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Back to blood and hair</span></h2>
<p>I recognize that the evidence that Beckjord provided me on blood and hair may be a conflict of interest for inclusion based on other actions by Beckjord. However, I feel they deserve mention. These hair samples were all reviewed by three known specialists and they all concluded that the hairs came from an unknown mammal with possible primate origins. Is there a NPOV way of incorporating this information in the article? I also believe that the blood sample analyized by Sarich is worth mentioning. None of the evidence provides facts that either support or deny the existence of bigfoot, but that well known specialists in their fields did look the evidence over is important...and at least makes Grover Krantz look less like a rogue anthropologist.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">hoax tracks</span></h2>
<p>This seems to be incredibly, well, wrong. The article describes tracks, but the tracks being described are clearly the hoaxed tracks created by Ray Wallace. Actual tracks do not have this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enormous human-like footprints attributed to this creature gave rise to the name "Bigfoot". Ecologist Robert Michael Pyle describes them as follows: "Tracks commonly measure fifteen to twenty inches or more in length. They have five toes, a double-muscle ball, and a wide arch" (Pyle, 3).</p>
</blockquote>

With this in mind, it seems like it would be very bad to leave this in the article.</p>

<dd>Wikipedia mirrors: if the site is a mirror of Wikipedia, using part or all of its info from Wikipedia, the new info you're finding is most likely just things that were originally edited out of the old Wikipedia article, for one reason or another. Since there were reasons behind these edits, it's probably not best to return these to the current Wikipedia article. Therefore, a good rule of thumb is if you see a site that mirrors Wikipedia, don't bother bringing it up here: it's already been edited out.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV problems yet again</span></h2>
<p>MONGO went ahead and readded a lot of details on various old hair "tests" mentioned in old pro-Bigfoot sources that I believe originally came from the now banned editor. The problem here is that devoting a lot of space to meaningless opinions of what people claim to have found with tests before DNA testing were used (and I note that that very important fact that they were not DNA tests was removed in the edit) only to have much later a section saying some DNA tests showed Bison hair and other known animals give undue weight to less reliable claims. This happens both by leaving out important info, dedicating much more space to pro-Bigfoot claims, and then not even getting the negative claims in until much later. I am once again reverting back to the older version for more balance.</p>
<p>The mere claim statment that "it is cited information, do not remove it" alone does not say anything about whether it fits within the NPOV policy. Adding lots of cited facts from old outdated publications with clear agendas on one side of the debate while removing an important note and not balancing the section simply in unacceptable.</p>
<p><br />
Now, if you would like to shorten that (the article is too long as it is) and try for real balance, and include the info that it was NOT at all DNA testing and thus much more subjective (looking at hair samples and guessing) and also expland the skeptical section about it, then maybe it can be used, but really we need a good neutral summary.</p>
<p>And furthermore the entire structure of the article -- giving whole sections of one side arguing one way and then later having another side argue -- is highly problematic, as it makes the pro and con difficult to follow and for most people gives a distorted view by focusing on the first (pro) section. There should not be separate sections, it should all be incorporated together, so that when we talk about hair evidence, for example, all the relevant info is in one place, and not so that DNA testing shows real animals is hidden further down in the article. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 21:54, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We can work on making it more neutral, but just because the cited source doesn't exist anymore is weak argumment for expulsion. The facts are that there is no prove offered by anything I added, and I don't believe the creature exists...but it would be unscientific to deny the possibility of it's existence solely just because DNA hasn't been performed. At the time of the hair inspection by the anthropologists I cited, DNA was costly, essentially not mainstream and extremely expensive, so it seems silly to mention that. Sarich blood analysis was the best readily available at the time...I can add that.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 06:13, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This doesn't say much, as there are many ways hairs can be compared. To simply say they didn't "match" with no reference to the comparison criteria makes kind of an empty statement. Animal/nonanimal is kinda poor. For all we know, he may have just smelled them and went by what Granny Hawkins' told him when he was nine about the difference between the smell of a boy and a puppydog tail.

<p>How the hell can they even say this if they don't have a DNA comparison? At the very least, it's not introduction material (IMHO).

<p>Apparently people did not even read my comments above, because the replies did not even address the main points and we had some people put the highly slanted info back in. NPOV is about BALANCE and OBJRCTIVITY. Adding more pro-Bigfoot hair claims back in from highly biased, outdated and unscientific sources while conspicuously not devoting the same or more space to the science side is a major violation of NPOV. Could you people at least read the policy and the points brought up instead of ignoring them and putting bad, slanted info back in? <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 06:39, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article is a hopelessly unbalanced excuse of an article anyway...none of it is really neutral. I added the fact that DNA wasn't performed...nothing I added proves or disproves Bigfoot. There is much to still explain by the tens of thousands of footprints that have been identified and the hundreds of eyewitness reports. It would be biased to assume that every single one of these situations was the result of some massive hallucination. Again, I see almost zero evidence that BIgfoot exists and I don't personally believe it does, but we can't just find arguments to support our own biases...we have to also demonstrate our ability to look at the other side of the coin if we are really supportive of NPOV.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 06:44, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, there are simply some cases where views need to be presented, but it needs to be done with care. Too much pro-BF material, especially that which is unscientific, is overdoing it. There should be a solid unbiased intro telling the facts and the current scientific opinion on the matter, and the other views should be kept penned into a section to ppl don't confuse things. A solid, unquestionable definition in the introduction, unmarred by opinions or speculation (aside from the scientific community's view and a <i>simple</i> "others disagree and support BF for various reasons"), is needed to provide the ground to stand on to view the rest of the article. Otherwise it's a quagmire.</dd>

<dd>The fact that such reports exist should be enough, with perhaps very minimal embellishment. Covering them exhaustively would be ridiculous. We should see the "other side of the coin", but keep in mind that "other side of the coin" can be overdone just like anything else. I can see some of DreamGuy's frustration. Sometimes people can become crusaders for keeping balance to such an extreme that they lose sight of the bigger picture and start <i>overcorrecting</i>. Just take a step back and see if the bigger picture doesn't clarify things a bit.

<p>This edit war is becoming ridiculous. My God...</p>
<p>For the record, I support MONGO’s version of the article. Just because someone found a little more evidence "for" the existence of Bigfoot doesn’t mean we need to remove it because now the "sides" are unbalanced. That’s defeating the point. Most of us here agree Bigfoot does not exist, including myself, and with time then more evidence will pile up making the existence of Bigfoot less and less plausible, correct? Will we deny that evidence because we want the article to be "neutral"? Of course not, but the Bigfoot supporters will argue the article isn’t balanced since more space is dedicated to the conservative view. You see how ridiculous this argument is?</p>
<p>This hair evidence really proves nothing and can be taken both ways by an unbiased reader. You'll either believe it supports Bigfoot or it will prove to you that a majority of pro-Bigfoot research is BS.</p>
<p>The simple truth is, an article like this will NEVER be balanced. There are two sides with credible scientists supporting either. If we don’t keep this hair "evidence" in the article, someone down the line will eventually reinstate it because in their minds it is valid research and there is no reason to remove it. If you really feel so deeply about balance DreamGuy, then you shouldn’t have any trouble finding something to rebalance the article. Most scholarly work flat-out rejects the possibility of the creature's existence, right?</p>
<p>Secondly, there’s no point in "shortening" the article. Like I argued a while back, this article WILL need to be split up eventually as more Wikipedians contribute. Why are you holding back that fact, DreamGuy? --<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvery1blowz_0fac.html" title="User:Every1blowz">Every1blowz</a> 02:27, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's the deal...one thing I can say for sure as a person that has a degree in anthropology is that there is NO PROOF that Bigfoot exists. I am not even one who cares if he exists or not, so I am most certainly neutral on the issue. I think it would be "neat" if Bigfoot existed, but that doesn't cloud my judgement on this issue. I can also say that if a DNA test is run on an unknown hair or blood sample and it comes back as no match, then all that measn is if MAY be an unidentified animal....however, not all mammals have been DNA tested so it is difficult to crossreference if you have no known matches available in that lab. A test in India will probably not have a DNA result for the Black Footed Ferret, which is an extremely rare mammal found in the wild in only a few of the U.S. states now.

<dd>What I'm understanding from the India Times article is that they retrieved a hair from Indonesia, which was sent back to the UK for testing. Scientists <i>were</i> able to extract DNA, although so far they haven't been able to match it to any known animal. Since the tests were done at Oxford, I think they have a pretty significant DNA database, probably even the Black Footed Ferret. All this means is that there may be another animal living in Indonesia which hasn't been discovered yet. That is totally easy to believe. Like just two years ago they discovered a new species of ape living in Africa. If there really are undiscovered monkeys living in Indonesia, I think it's pretty self-explanatory that this may account for a good majority of Bigfoot sightings. Does anyone else think this should be mentioned in our Wikipedia article? I mean, this “evidence” is more convincing than the other hair analysis which hasn’t been DNA tested. Wasn’t that one of the things DreamGuy was complaining about? --<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvery1blowz_0fac.html" title="User:Every1blowz">Every1blowz</a> 20:14, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Newsflash: you can't vote to ignore a policy that's the foundation of this encyclopedia. This "trying to estabish" thing just means "reverting back to his bad version and ignoring the clear explanation of why it's bad" -- there's no attempt to even follow policy or listen to the reasons, simply declaring himself right.

<dd>DreamGuy, you convinced me to go and reread the entire <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> page just to refresh my memory. As I suspected, there’s nothing about using dated sources. All it says it that you should use <i>the best sources whenever possible</i>. In terms of good research Ellis R. Kerley and Vincent Sarich are both more notable than Roy Pinker. That’s a fact. It’s also a fact that DNA-based evidence has confirmed what Kerley and Sarich had already discovered for themselves. You also make a statement about using "biased sources quite extensively". However, even though the article was written by Beckjord, who’s undeniably pro-Bigfoot, we’re not here to listen to him. Beckjord simply wrote what two notable and independent scientists had discovered, which coincidently <i>could</i> be interpreted as being pro-Bigfoot. However, I think we can assume the two scientists were not biased and were as surprised by the results as any of us. NPOV also does not state anything about using equal space for all points of view. The fact that the vast majority of scientists do not support the notion of Bigfoot will entirely convince most readers, no matter how much pro-Bigfoot information you put in. It’s also true that sometimes there’s more information on one POV than there is on another. We can’t sacrifice one POV when it can be expanded and documented justly, since this in itself does not make anything inherently NPOV; it just makes a poorly-written article. You mention your belief that Roy Pinker’s work is far more important than the work of two other scientists. How so? Is it still more important even after Bryan Sykes conducted DNA-based studies (although on a differant sample) and came to pretty much the same conclusion? We could accuse you of being biased. --<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvery1blowz_0fac.html" title="User:Every1blowz">Every1blowz</a> 18:34, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But I might suggest a rewrite or redoing of the sections. If you can get a really firm intro that solidly states the mainstream opinion, it would allow for a lot of extra pro stuff later in the article. I'm sorry MONGO took my criticism the wrong way.

<p>I've placed a cleanup tag on this as it is quite below standard. There is simply too much garbage flowing into it. When you are not conservative with articles like this, they become garbage quickly, because people read it, and question claims like "smells are associated with bigfoot" and wonder if we know WTF we are talking about. Then they don't trust anything written in the article and just move on. Wish-washy stuff needs to stick to <i><b>firm</b></i> material and facts with the scientific commuity's outlook providing a grounding to work from. It's not perfect, but nothing you can find will be better. If we are liberal with it, it becomes just another Internet cesspool of speculation packaged as factual info. Readers sense this kind of deception and immediately distrust the material and Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 21:40, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm assuming you are referring to a hypothetical situation where an actual body is found (or specimen captured) and, for some reason, people cover this fact up. We can only do our best, our part, and hope that what's possible as far as facts coming to light are not covered up. We can try to stop it if know about it, but if others do it, and we don't know, not much we can do but be vigilant. As for Wikipedia, of course no one will cover up scientifically documented evidence of that kind. I don't see a motive anywhere strong enough to have people cover up such a discovery as a complete specimen anyway. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 18:07, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The "Giggle Factor" is when the media has a paranormal matter in the news, the news personnel make crude jokes about the matter, like this one(polite):"If that is a Bigfoot, I'm the King of the United States", and they're dealing with a Bigfoot incident, like the one that happened in Malaysia recently. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 10:24, 5 March 2006 (UTC) <b>:)</b></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sections</span></h2>
<p>I redid some of the section headers to make (what I feel is) a firmer outline. The "Conclusion" section is kind of disorganized and needs sorting.</p>
<p>The article is very big, but there's nothing wrong with that. If old sources are used, just make it plain to the reader that this is coming from a source that is old/dated or whatever, and say why you are using it. (Why are we citing dated material? Are we?).</p>
<p>Just to recap: Organization and "prettifying" the article can allow for more info to be added without ppl getting upetty (pretty = more forgiving). Just make sure that the organization stays firm. Perhaps someone can improve on what I've done there with the outline. ..? --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 02:53, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I'm pretty sure the MOS says you shouldn't have first level headings in an article, but I confess I took them out before I read the talk page, so now I feel a little bad. Still, I doubt that a more intricate and hierarchical TOC is really what the article needs. If you want to restore it, though, you should deepen the lower headers, not throw a level-1 around them. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 03:57, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As you all know, Roger Patterson died in 1972, but Long was able to track down his confederates and eventually obtained a complete confession. The monkey suit turns out to have been a hand modified version of a commmercially available gorilla suit. Long also obtained much information on the possible motivation of the "ringleader" of the hoax, Roger Patterson.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 19:41, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, no less than three people have confessed to making the suit, and no less than four have confessed to being inside it! Case solved - Hoax X 3. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:30, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please rewrite!</span></h2>
<p>The article is much too lengthy, fails to take proper account of the Long book (which I think any unbiased reader will regard as definitively debunking the Patterson hoax), and reports too credulously unverified claims, e.g. Krantz said he gave casts to <i>40 experts</i> and they mostly said they thought <i>gotta be real</i>, but apparently we only have Krantz's word for this. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 20:57, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article is fine, but could be reduced if some material was moved to linked sub-articles. For example, the lengthy evidence-section might be moved to a new article linked from this article, and replaced with a concise section summarizing the evidence and criticism of it --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielos2_f01c.html" title="User:Danielos2">Danielos2</a> 22:19, 24 March 2006 (UTC) .</p>
<p>Long deserves a mention, but his work is <i>not</i> the final word on the subject.

<dd>It CAN'T be stated, it's completely unencyclopedic. The First Aid article is about aiding, so of course it would make sense to do some of that.

<p>User:Gabeshaughnessy added the following to the article -- <b>"It is possible the bigfoot is not a physical being but rather a forest spirit, Banjankri, unavailable to the rational mind and only accessible through intuitive pursuit."</b>. It lasted half an hour before being skittled. It was probably a windup by Gabeshaughnessy who hadn't made any previous edits. But boy oh boy, did it ever demonstrate one of the serious problems of Wikipedia. This article is stock full of absolute nonsense. But yet, when someone adds something similar it gets axed and the screed of existing nonsense remains. Move over Lucky69, and RickK and all the other seasoned editors who left Wikipedia in disgust, I'm getting closer to joining you every day. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 08:18, 27 April 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>Is the famous cryptozoologist himself here on Wikipedia? Anyway, this Wikipedians "contributions" so far seems to be shameless self-promotion, sensationalism and a greedy desire to sell books.
