<p>Yeah, lots of people that don't have accounts have been updating the store list. I found the store list, and lots of other stuff at the auction at #216 Chillicothe. I bought the big neon bear that hung in the glass atrium and put it on the side of my barn in Irwin, Ohio. Its sad that very little was saved from a once great company. JaredCMH 13:23, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've mostly been updating this list. I'm trying to make a database of all the former Big Bear Stores with info about each one. If you have any more, let me know. (datrain021)</p>

<dd>Are you guys just former customers, or former employees? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 03:41, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Im a former employee of store 212 (datrain021)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was a front manager (and other positions before that) at #29; my main job through most of undergrad. I need to dig up some 1990s photos I have somewhere of that store's exterior; <a href="http://postdlf.tripod.com/nonsense/photo.html" class="external text" title="http://postdlf.tripod.com/nonsense/photo.html" rel="nofollow">these were fun</a>, but the mid-remodeling shots aren't very relevant to the topic. I also worked as a cashier for a several months at the Clintonville location on N. High St. Are we sure that was #69? For some reason I was thinking it was a three-digit number. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 06:36, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I too was a front end manager at westerville, although my main department was the service desk/C.O. How long did it take to remodel #29 and for how long was it shut down? Also I'm pretty sure Clintonville is a two diget number, I worked there for a few months when it became a Giant Eagle, and I heard it opened in 1986, which is before Penn Traffic took over. After they took over is when they went to numbers in the 200's. Let me know if you have any more pics of stores, I'm trying to make a collection of photos of all the big bear stores I can get. (Datrain021)</p>
<p>I just checked the list and #69 was 2801 N. High Street.. I can scan this 2 page document store list (it has manager and store director names on it! for anyone that wants it... Did you guys use the NCR 7000 POS/Checkout System? We used the one from #260 in my resale store I had for awhile in Dublin, and it worked great. JaredCMH 21:47, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure which NCR we used at #212, but I know it was an older system (older than the store itsel) from the 1980's. On average we had one register broken every few weeks. Althoug from my perspective, the system improved greatly when they added the 'you could have saved' part to the receipt, as I no longer had to spend 10 minutes going through the ad and figuring out how much we owed the customer. Also, I'll take a copy of that store list, with any other big bear stuff you might have. Mackey.81@osu.edu (please erase after sending) (datrain021)</p>

Was the Harts location in Ashland, KY ever a Big Bear or Big Bear Plus store? I noticed Ashland was listed as a Big Bear location, but now it's been taken off the list! Thanks. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Punk_8b71.html" title="User:The Punk">The Punk</a> 15:24, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure, i know it was a Harts location, and wasnt a Big Bear in the 2000's. It probably wasnt ever a Big Bear, but it could have been. Its currently a Krogers store. (See harts on wiki)</p>
<p>Store 270 in Newark wan't a Big Bear Plus. It also wasn't technically in Newark, but was in Heath, but that's just quibbling.</p>
<p>It was a mini plus. I tried to delete the mini pluses from the list but another guy put them back on. In terms of calling it Newark, I think it was just marketing- going with the lager maket, but if you have info saying it was called Heath Big Bear Id change it to that.</p>
<p>Is there anyone out there that used to work at a Big Bear Plus? I was wondering what the division of sales was in each dept, especially in furniture, garden center, and other things not found in a normal big bear store.</p>
