If the page you want to move to has never been edited, any user can do it. If it has, or there is content there you have two choices:</p>

<p>Go to the admin page and see who is online now, then hit one up. Or an admin you already know. It is ten to 100 times faster than putting it on "Requested moves" I have seen pages stay on there over a month.</p>
<p>Once the page has been moved, go to and click <i><b>"What links here"</b></i> in the toolbox on the left pane. Then you can begin your link fixes, fix the "re-directs" (I recommend looking at this list before the move). I wouldn't worry to much about the "user" pages, if any, that are linked to that particular page, those users can fixs the re-directs if they want to. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDon_41bb.html" title="User:WikiDon">WikiDon</a> 03:46, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>(i.e. 8 conference games in which 5 are intra-division, 1 permanent inter-division rival, and 2 inter-division games rotating among the remaining teams)</p>
<p>If so, could someone add that info to the article, to be consistent with the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_Conference_3deb.html" title="Southeastern Conference">SEC</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Coast_Conference_a463.html" title="Atlantic Coast Conference">ACC</a> articles.</p>

<p>In sports where there is a "regular season" champion and a "tournament" champion, I think we need to determine which one we're going to put in the conference champions table, and then probably note that on the tables so that there's no confusion/edit conflicts. Currently it seems like the de facto method is regular season champions (see 2005 men's baseball and basketball, where there were co-champions). We also have the option of listing BOTH sets of champions, but this sets up the possibility of having 3 different teams in a single box (e.g.- 2005 men's basketball, where Oklahoma State won the tourney). Obviously JUST listing the tourney champion would always yield only one team. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_Esperanza_9829.html" title="User:EWS23/Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>E</b></font></a><a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23">WS23</a> | <a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">(Leave me a message!)</a> 05:54, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Big 12's website seems to indicate that the conference tournament champion is THE conference champion, regardless of who the regular season champion was. Indications of this are at <a href="http://www.big12sports.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.big12sports.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, where the upcoming basketball tournament is called the 'championship' (as opposed to the 'Conference Tournament' or something else), and at <a href="http://www.big12sports.com/championships/big12-championships.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.big12sports.com/championships/big12-championships.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, where OSU is listed as the 2005 Men's Basketball champion (the 2005 regular season champions are currently in the article) and Texas is listed as the 2005 softball champion (where Texas A&amp;M actually won the regular season). I'm not going to make the change until I can find a Big 12 site that has all former champions listed, so this will give some time for any dissenting views to be voiced. -- <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdisonLBM_9463.html" title="User:EdisonLBM">EdisonLBM</a> 19:59, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is the site of the former Big 12 champions <a href="http://www.big12sports.com/championships/big12-championships-0506.html" class="external text" title="http://www.big12sports.com/championships/big12-championships-0506.html" rel="nofollow">2004-2006 Big 12 Champions</a> They list the winners of the conference tournament or meet. For example in 2005-2006 Kansas is listed as the Conference Champ in Men's Basketball because they won the conference tournament even though Texas won the "regular season title." The regular season is used to seed the postseason conference tournament in sports like, but not limited to, Baseball, Basketball, Soccer and Softball. Some sports like Swimming and Golf need postseason tournaments to determine a conference champion. Also, in Basketball the postseason tournament champion gets the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament as the conference champion. In football, the winner of the championship game gets the bid to a BCS bowl as the conference champion. The best record in the regular season rarely if ever has anything to do with who is regognized as the conference champion. If a school publicizes regular season champions, they are doing so only for marketing and recruiting purposes. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneral125_d899.html" title="User:General125">General125</a> 15:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Most schools hang "Big 12 Championship" banners for regular-season championships only. If they also hang banners for tournament championships, they are typically called "Big 12 Tournament Champions" in those. I would prefer to stick with regular-season championships.

<dd>True, the regular season champs do tend to be advertised more - would it be ok if I added something to make it clear what the table actually is? Something to the effect of "Big XII Men's\Women's Regular Season Champions?" -- <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdisonLBM_9463.html" title="User:EdisonLBM">EdisonLBM</a> 00:30, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On the suggestion of another user, I added the links to all the record books on the Big 12's website. I'm still not sure if they are organized in the best manner (splitting them up into men's and women's sublists might be a good idea, for example). However, this leads to an interesting solution to this problem: the record books contain all the conference standing data for both the regular season and the tournament for all the years of the Big 12's existence. With these lists added to this page, does this argument become moot? A reader could very easily access any information on championships that they desired directly from the Big 12, and this would allow us to remove the championship tables altogether. - <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdisonLBM_9463.html" title="User:EdisonLBM">EdisonLBM</a> 05:06, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>The only problem/inconsistency with calling the charts "regular season champions" is that the charts list the winner of the football confernce championship game. I think everyone agrees that the regular season champ is generally <i>the</i> champ in most sports - like basketball - but the championship game winner is <i>the</i> champ in football. Not sure how to capture all that in a header. <a href="../../../k/g/w/User%7EKgwo1972_3caf.html" title="User:Kgwo1972">Kgwo1972</a> 21:11, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>FYI, wherever the Big 12 lists "All Time Championships" it lists <b>regular season champions</b> for all sports except football, just as we have here. I have finally knocked out the last of the inaccuracies in the chart.

I'm <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> about the new informaiton for now. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 18:18, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have restored the team logos to the page. Fair use images are usable when there is no free alterantive to the image. By definition, there is no free alterantive to a logo. However, I think the logos would be better here if alongside additional commentary about the team they represent. Can we expand the article to make a brief mention of each team? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:27, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ed, you are acting unilaterally in your interpretation of policy yet again. There is no consensus in support of the actions you are taking.

<dd>This issue was discussed and decided at Wikimania. This usage is NOT acceptable. Anyone who reverts my last edit removing the gallery, or otherwise recreates the gallery, will be blocked.

<dd>I wasn't aware Wikimania was a discussion forum for establishing Wikipedia policy. I bet a lot more people would have attended. =) If it's policy, I assume you'll direct us to the relevant policy page? <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 14:23, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just an FYI the specific policy says "Sports team logos may be used in articles or aticle sections where the team is discussed", so it is ok, as long as the individual team is discussed, which they appear to be in this article. Logos are ok. (<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardsplayer4life_41e9.html" title="User:Cardsplayer4life">Cardsplayer4life</a> 22:48, 8 August 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>There is now a new page showing the current big 12 men's tourney in brackets. Should we just expand it and provide a link to it rather than posting the tourney on this page? Also, are there other tournaments in the past that could be linked to? <a href="../../../w/r/a/User%7EWrad_81c2.html" title="User:Wrad">Wrad</a> 20:12, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here is the link to the new <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_12_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament_8428.html" title="Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament">Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament</a> page. I'm just wondering if there is any information we may want to merge, or how we want this page to link with the Big 12 page. <a href="../../../w/r/a/User%7EWrad_81c2.html" title="User:Wrad">Wrad</a> 02:53, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think Texas and Oklahoma should be filled with a color other than gray on the map. The map would look clearer that way when the image size is reduced, as it is in the infobox. Thoughts anyone? --<span style="font-family: Arial"><a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueag9_1eef.html" title="User:Blueag9"><font color="blue"><b>Blueag9</b></font></a>|<a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBlueag9_1c0e.html" title="User talk:Blueag9"><font color="maroon"><sup><b>Talk</b></sup></font></a>|</span> 22:27, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
