<dd>I don't think so. Since the US version uses different rules, and the housemates (houseguests) do not nominate, why call it a nomination table? The houseguests vote, and that's why it's called voting history. Hope that helps! <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoking66_2d58.html" title="User:Geoking66">Geoking66</a> 19:52, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I noticed <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">User:Dancter</a> revised the table to reflect only 9 weeks, plus a results column. He based this calculation on the fact that the winner will be revealed on September 12th. However, when I do the math, this is what I get... We are currently in Week 7, which ends on Tuesday 8/22 (as they entered the house on a Tuesday). Week 8 is 8/22-8/29, Week 9 is 8/29-9/5, and week 10 is 9/5-9/12. Due to the number of people left in the house, there can no longer be any double evictions (unless they bring somebody back). Also, if we look at previous Voting Histories (<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_voting_history_%28USA_season_6%29_d315.html" title="Big Brother voting history (USA season 6)">Big Brother voting history (USA season 6)</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_voting_history_%28USA_season_5%29_dfaa.html" title="Big Brother voting history (USA season 5)">Big Brother voting history (USA season 5)</a>), a week 10 column is necessary to show the final eviction.</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong. --<a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbrown_535f.html" title="User:Mrbrown">Mr. Brown</a> 05:28, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's a little tricky. It seems the convention here is to mark the week's end with the regular eviction, which is why the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_voting_history_%28USA_season_4%29_2b84.html" title="Big Brother voting history (USA season 4)">BB4 table</a> indicates that Robert was evicted Week 10, when he was technically voted out in the eleventh week. So, for this season, even if they entered the house on a Tuesday, for the purposes of this table Week 1 ended on a Thursday, after Alison was evicted. I was basing the nine-week span mostly on the past few seasons, in which nothing gamewise would happen in the last week except for the final jury vote. The final week would be represented by the "Results" column. For this season, that would be Week 10.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It certainly is possible for there to be an eviction in the last week, like in BB3, but with the whole jury process in sequester, I don't think it's likely. Following convention, week 7 would be 8/17-8/24, week 8 would be 8/24–8/31, week 9 would be 8/31–9/7, and week 10 would be 9/7–9/12. If there is an eviction in the final week, one eviction per week would make it four evictions by the finale. With seven people currently in the house, it still isn't enough to pare the numbers down to the final two. I was thinking that weeks 8 and 9 would probably be double eviction weeks, but if there is a week 10 eviction, only one more double eviction week would be needed. At least, I think that's right. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 10:36, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why has the twist/notes row been taken out and replaced with small numbers? Look at the UK nominations tables, they use a twist row. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoking66_2d58.html" title="User:Geoking66">Geoking66</a> 01:19, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I find it incredibly funny that you complain the summary table on the main page is too cluttered, and when I add footnotes to the voting history to make it less cluttered, you <b>add clutter</b>! You would think that less clutter, i.e. end notes, would be better than a "See Note 1", "See Note 2", etc. Just an observation! However, you're right, and they do use a twist row, perhaps I should've checked it before making the voting history table <b>less cluttered</b>. --<a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbrown_535f.html" title="User:Mrbrown">Mr. Brown</a> 21:51, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This isn't clutter. It's a way of making notes a little more obvious. In the table in the article, according to WP:BIGBRO, information should be restricted and not cluttered. This is a detailed table - its own article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoking66_2d58.html" title="User:Geoking66">Geoking66</a> 01:37, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Currently, Note 4 says "During the sixth week, the houseguests could win the Coup d'Etat power - a right to overthrow the Head of Household on a moments notice on eviction night, and nominate two other houseguests. Mike 'Boogie' won this power, and on Day 48, Mike 'Boogie' lost his Coup d'Etat power by discussing its function with other houseguests." The televised show mentioned none of this, and given how big of a deal this "big twist" was, I think they would have if it had actually happened. In the show itself, though, Mike said that the Cd'E power expired when he became HOH for the third of the three evictions it was planned to last for.</p>
<p>So, what really happened? Did people see this on the live feeds, but CBS covered it up? Or was this a joke entry that never got reverted? --<a href="../../../p/s/i/User%7EPsiphiorg_3dff.html" title="User:Psiphiorg">Psiphiorg</a> 15:05, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I saw him discuss it with Danielle on the feeds after he won HoH. They went to flames as she asked if he was allowed to talk about it now, but he'd already let the basics out of the bag. Later conversations about it were not flamed, as he'd been informed the power was gone. Other details you only saw on the feeds: the power could not have been used to put up the existing HoH or Veto winner. Also if used, the existing HoH becomes eligible to compete the next week and Boogie would become ineligible. So there was a price to pay for its use. In truth, being HoH he had 95% of the power anyway for the third week, missing only the last-second shock and awe aspect. And for the first two weeks it was a great safety net.</p>

<p>Is it just me, or has this table become very complicated an ugly? I know that all of the other Big Brother voting tables (with the exception of seasons 6 and 1) and formatted this way, sans "Jury Status" column. Can we just get rid of the "Nominated" boxes for evicted houseguests? Its obvious that they were nominated, because they were evicted, hence its a moot point. --<a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrbrown_535f.html" title="User:Mrbrown">Mr. Brown</a> 05:12, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
