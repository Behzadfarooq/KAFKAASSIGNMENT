<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Deal_%28game_show%29_19aa.html" title="Edit section: Format">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Format</span></h2>
<p>The show's format followed that of <i><a href="../../../l/e/t/Let%27s_Make_a_Deal_f202.html" title="Let's Make a Deal">Let's Make a Deal</a></i>; however, stunts similar to those featured on <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth_or_Consequences_53c3.html" title="Truth or Consequences">Truth or Consequences</a></i> were also added to give the show its own personality. Some of these stunts were played in order to earn a smaller prize, which could then be gambled for an unknown behind a curtain or a box a la <i>LMAD</i>; other stunts awarded different prizes based on how well (or how poorly) the contestant performed.</p>
<p><a name="In-Studio_Stunts" id="In-Studio_Stunts"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Deal_%28game_show%29_19aa.html" title="Edit section: In-Studio Stunts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In-Studio Stunts</span></h2>
<p>Some of the games played involved the contestants participating in the studio itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>A contestant was hooked to a giant "skill crane" and given the appropriate oversized grabbers, with which he had to retrieve large <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_bear.html" title="Teddy bear">teddy bears</a> while being raised and lowered by his partner. Each bear represented a money amount or a prize, and the contestant could retrieve as many or as few of the bears as he or she wanted. However, one bear had a human inside of it, and attempting to grab this bear would "scare" it, the bear would run away, and the couple received nothing.</li>
<li>Contestants had to listen to a popular song being sung by a <a href="../../../i/t/_/It_ain%27t_over_%27til_the_fat_lady_sings.html" title="It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings">fat lady</a> (and thus butchered from its original form); guessing the song correctly won a prize.</li>
<li>A contestant was positioned on top of a small "building', and a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chimpanzee.html" title="Chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a> was placed on an identical "building" in a "man vs. monkey" game. In a tribute to <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Kong_03dd.html" title="King Kong">King Kong</a>, the man raced the chimp to swat toy <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airplanes.html" title="Airplanes">airplanes</a> out of the "sky" (actually suspended from modified <a href="../../../c/e/i/Ceiling_fan.html" title="Ceiling fan">ceiling fans</a> that rotated). Beating the monkey won the prize.</li>
<li>Couples raced to launch small <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_bear.html" title="Teddy bear">teddy bears</a> at a spiked wall with a <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slingshot.html" title="Slingshot">slingshot</a>; the couple "killing" the most bears won a prize.</li>
<li>DeCarlo once asked if anyone in the studio audience wanted to "kill" the show's enormous frog mascot (actually a large prop built onstage in the stunt area). Then he selected someone from the audience, who had 30 seconds to shovel pennies onto a scale. After the time ran out, the player had the option of either taking a bribe or seeing if he had shoveled at least 200 pounds of pennies onto the scale. Success meant that the player won a grand prize, plus as much money as shoveled onto the scale. Whether the player took the bribe or played for the grand prize, if there was at least 200 pounds of pennies on the scale, a giant <a href="../../../a/n/v/Anvil.html" title="Anvil">anvil</a> was dropped onto the frog.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Demolition_Stunts" id="Demolition_Stunts"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Deal_%28game_show%29_19aa.html" title="Edit section: Demolition Stunts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Demolition Stunts</span></h2>
<p>Notable to many of these stunts was the overt destruction by the contestant to his own property in an attempt to win a better prize. Examples of such stunts included:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Throwing <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseballs</a> at the windows of one's house in order to win new furnishings (and new windows) for the home;</li>
<li>Destroying one's own <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobile</a> with a <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sledgehammer.html" title="Sledgehammer">sledgehammer</a> - if the car was judged by an <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insurance.html" title="Insurance">insurance</a> agent to be totaled, the contestant won a brand new car;</li>
<li>Dropping one's own possessions (such as TV's, golf clubs, etc.) off of a crane onto a giant <a href="../../../t/i/c/Tic-tac-toe.html" title="Tic-tac-toe">tic-tac-toe</a> board; getting three in a row won a larger prize package.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>While DeCarlo played up the fact that losing one of these games resulted in nothing more than a tragic loss, a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disclaimer.html" title="Disclaimer">disclaimer</a> at the end of every episode stated that contestants who damaged their own possessions would be reimbursed money according to the value of their belongings before they were destroyed.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Deal_%28game_show%29_19aa.html" title="Edit section: The Big Deal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Big Deal</span></h2>
<p>The Big Deal of the evening was played exactly like that of <i><a href="../../../l/e/t/Let%27s_Make_a_Deal_f202.html" title="Let's Make a Deal">Let's Make a Deal</a></i>. DeCarlo would go back into the audience and invite contestants who had won something to trade their prize(s) in for a shot at the Big Deal, starting with the top winner and working downward. After two players were selected, they were presented with three large screens (the only variant from <i>LMAD</i>, as actual doors were used in that series). One of these screens contained the Big Deal, a prize package usually worth more than any other prize offered that day. The top winner got first selection, and the contents of each of the three screens were revealed, usually in ascending order. The contestants kept whatever was "behind" their screen.</p>

<ul>
<li>The in-house band appearing on every show and playing the theme music was the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swing_%28genre%29.html" title="Swing (genre)">swing</a> band <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bad_Voodoo_Daddy_19ef.html" title="Big Bad Voodoo Daddy">Big Bad Voodoo Daddy</a></i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There were six episodes. Only west coast viewers saw all six while the EST/CST viewers had three complete episodes and three joined in progress (due to NFL doubleheaders).</li>
