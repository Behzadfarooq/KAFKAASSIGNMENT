Also, if we are out-voted you will still have to wait two years (as of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>) until it can fully be merged becuase Channel 4 has deals with local councils etc to keep it running 'til <a href="../../../2/0/0/2008.html" title="2008">2008</a>.<a href="http://www.bigbrotheronline.co.uk/bigbrother6/faqs.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bigbrotheronline.co.uk/bigbrother6/faqs.htm" rel="nofollow">Read here, at question #2</a> Thanks 14:30, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm reinstating Kinga's status as ejected. I agree with VampWillow that the term is normally associated with wrongdoing, the previous ejectees have been "Nasty" Nick in BB1 and Kitten in BB5 but Channel 4 are officially using the term ejected and we should too. <a href="../../../d/m/_/User%7EDM_Andy_6aba.html" title="User:DM Andy">DM Andy</a> 2 July 2005 19:22 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just bringing it to the attention of those who have an interest in this article: the article <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlaith_McAllister_9889.html" title="Orlaith McAllister">Orlaith McAllister</a> has been listed on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>, with people opinions currently split between deleting the article, and merging it into the main Big Brother article. See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Orlaith_McAllister_897b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Orlaith McAllister">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Orlaith McAllister</a> for the discussion.</p>
<p>Given that there have been some ugly scenes regarding issues like this before (see <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Apprentice_2_d2b5.html" title="Talk:The Apprentice 2">Talk:The Apprentice 2</a>..), I thought I'd come and float the idea of merging of the contestant articles into this one. The great majority of them are only a single paragraph, and it seems to me that they'd fit quite nicely as subsections of this page, that this would put all information of interest to people interested in Big Brother 6 into one place, and that the article would not be unreasonably long even after doing this.</p>
<p>What does anyone else think? —<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 11:09, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I often wonder if it's appropriate to have articles about individual contestants in an encyclopedia such as this. Some of them won't ever have any other claim to fame than appearing on the show. Others, like <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Phillips_65b0.html" title="Craig Phillips">Craig Phillips</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Goody_d2c9.html" title="Jade Goody">Jade Goody</a>, have become celebrities in their own right, and so it could be argued such entries are worthy. We had this situation before with several articles such as those about Michelle Bass and Stuart Wilson from BB5, and they were eventually slotted into the article about <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_UK_series_5_6b74.html" title="Big Brother UK series 5">Big Brother 5</a>. -<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyW_ecc1.html" title="User:TonyW">TonyW</a> 14:45, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that the winner of a series should have their own entry, as well as any notable contestants (such as <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Goody_d2c9.html" title="Jade Goody">Jade Goody</a> from BB UK Series 3). For this series, I think that it should be the winner, plus Derek if he does not win - as he has more of a 'public' history. All other contestants should just be merged into this page. If any of them become 'famous' in their own right after the series has ended, a new article for them can always be created. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantomsteve_c679.html" title="User:Phantomsteve">Phantomsteve</a> 20:09, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, I have made all of the individual contestants redirects to this article except for <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Laud_5133.html" title="Derek Laud">Derek Laud</a> (another batch of them went through VFD last week with a consensus to merge &amp; redirect), and I have reworked the list into a set of subheadings to make it clearer that if anyone wants to add any detail, they should do so. —<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStormie_b829.html" title="User:Stormie">Stormie</a> 21:56, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Still waiting for comments here on the BB6 publicity pics, and have been waiting for <b>over a month</b>. Is there any reason why the pics should not be included in the main article. They were uploaded a while ago, and I was waiting for User:Ross-1989 - but he seems to have gone. They are tagged for fair use as I tried to explain to Ross on his <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERoss-1989_5ef6.html" title="User talk:Ross-1989">talk page</a>. J-P calls them "those dammed photos," but why shouldn't they be included please? Maybe you think it will make the article worse, or there are other reasons. Please let us know quickly--14:26, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The issue of 'publicity photos' is a very complicated one. I know it sounds odd, but just becasue it's a photo publicising the show doesn't make it a publicty photo in the legal 'fair use' sense. <b>See <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublicity_photos_4459.html" title="Wikipedia:Publicity photos">Wikipedia:Publicity photos</a></b>. There are simple guidelines, specifically that fair use promo photos should come from only a press kit. "Most photos that are found on the Internet are not publicity photos."</dd>
<dd>The pictures that are being uploaded/deleted/uploaded/deleted etc. are not publicity photos in this sense. They are not part of a press kit. They are simply found on the website. Regardless of whether we think it will make the article look beter, they are <b>owned</b> by Channel 4/Endemol, and it is not up to us to use them wherever we want.</dd>
<dd>I called them 'those dammed photos' because it takes a lot of time to go through them all and tag them for deletion and notify the uploader. Then an admin has to go through them all again and delete them (which involves checking the history, etc). I've resorted to using those system messages to try to stop yet another newbie uploading them again and wasting yet more time. The message, though, could be revised to something like "Please do not upload copyrighted images from Channel 4's website: see talk page".</dd>
<dd>I suspect no-one replied sooner because we have already been through this issue in the last few months. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 15:01, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi, It seems that you are only concerned about copyright. Now I noticed that you say "we have already been through this issue in the last few months" - to me this means that the copyright issue has been debated, but this is obviously not true. And the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> claim was left unanswered for over a month.</p>
<p>In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> the factors to be considered shall include—</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;</li>
<li>the nature of the copyrighted work;</li>
<li>the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and</li>
<li>the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems overwhelmingly likely that these photos (or their originals) were intended (whether explicitly or implicitly) to be reproduced to publicize the programme. Suppose eg that a CD of the pictures was received from Endemol by the News of the World just before Big Brother 6 was starting, but without any explicit statement of their purpose or copyright status. If they were then to be included in the paper on the Sunday before BB6 started, any claim as to copyright would surely be laughed out of court.</p>
<p>I asked you to look at the source identified for each of the pics uploaded. You should have seen something like—</p>
<dl>
<dd>pic is from <a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/showbiz/showbiz2_bb.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/showbiz/showbiz2_bb.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/showbiz/showbiz2_bb.shtml</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This publicity image of Mary in Big Brother 6 was widely disseminated in both electronic and print media (many national newspapers carried the picture) by Endemol/Channel 4 in May 2005 to advertise the TV programme</dd>
</dl>
<p>13 of the 16 pics uploaded were taken from that News of the World link. The other 3 were from Channel4's BB website, but were similarly disseminated in June 2005 in print and electronically.</p>
<p>Now about the pics, you state that you <i>called them 'those dammed photos' because it takes a lot of time to go through them all and tag them for deletion and notify the uploader. Then an admin has to go through them all again and delete them (which involves checking the history, etc).</i> Yet, as you can see from Ross's <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERoss-1989_5ef6.html" title="User talk:Ross-1989">talk page</a>, the BB6 images which he uploaded were deleted without any notice whatsoever. They simply disappeared from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Taking all these matters into account, I think a claim of <b><a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a></b> can be reasonably sustained by the four-factor test--<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShojo_5998.html" title="User:Shojo">luke</a> 05:29, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So what do you make of the specific guidelines about Publicity Photos to which I've already linked? Although it is indeed best to notify the uploader (so they don't make further breaches), there is no strict need to do this. There was, and is, no need for a debate. There are guidelines laying out what can be classed as fair use publicity photos. These photos breach those guidelines.</dd>
<dd>The <i>News of the World</i> probably did get them from an electonic press kit -- that does not give Wikipedia the right to use them. The source must be a press kit with information on their copyright. No information = no use.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 09:08, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's clear that the guidelines to which you linked are a proposal, and not Wikipedia policy. It is strange then that you say there is no need for a debate, and that you don't condemn deletion of images without any warning, done simply on the basis of a proposal. The proposal is an attempt to put into effect <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>--<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShojo_5998.html" title="User:Shojo">luke</a> 19:11, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>J-P, I gave a counter-example (Endemol and News of the World) where reliance on explicit information given by the publicist seems to be foolish, since taking account of the surrounding circumstances can show the truth. So in my view the Publicity photos proposal should be more clearly worded so as to take account of a broader range of cases, and relying on reasoned judgement in each case.</p>
<p>The four-factor test seems to allow the use of the pictures I uploaded, do you not agree?--<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShojo_5998.html" title="User:Shojo">luke</a> 04:08, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I sympathise with your interpretation, which does invite your conclusion.

<p>During his time in the House, Derek often attacked other housemates as having low intelligence. When she entered the House he asked Orlaith if she was intelligent: She replied that she had been to university and Derek responded that this wasn't necessarily a sign of intelligence. He often dissed housemates in the Diary Room as well.</p>
<p>There were many examples of Derek's own lack of general knowledge and poor judgement during his time in the House, both in the quizzes he set and elsewhere. One example was his asking a question about a film (a figment of his imagination) supposedly starring John Wayne and called 'Hey Ho'. This fiction was compounded by his then asking Craig to spell 'Hey Ho' for an extra mark!</p>
<p>A reasonably high percentage of Derek's answers were incorrect, I estimate around 20%. Nevertheless his quizzes were appreciated by the housemates. His answers were nearly always accepted as being correct.</p>
<p>In Britain, a person's way of speaking still can have great impact as to how they are perceived, and it seems Derek has made use of this.</p>
<p>I hope the above lends weight to my addition, and that it should be restored</p>

<p>1 Derek was only one of three house mates acted as quizzes mast on BB6 House quizzes. Then other two quiz masts being Kemal and Eugene. All three housemates thought up the questions for the quiz</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So what? He organised the quizzes and was by far the main quizmaster.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Leaving out the fact that Derek was not the only quiz master is a misconception of what really happened. The fact is that the all the quiz masters organised the quizzes and there was never a main quizmaster. If there were two quizmasters</b></p>
<p>If there were two quizmasters, Derek was always one of them.</p>
<p><b>As Eugene did not enterer the house until halfway through serious and Kemal was evicted a week before what do you expect</b></p>
<p>2. Only a small percentage of Derek, Kemals and Eugene’s answers were incorrect, I estimate around 20%. This is a very good considering that they had no reference books to refer to and had to depend solely on their own general knowledge</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>20% is a substantial percentage to get wrong. If you are not <u>certain</u> of an answer you should not pose the question in a quiz.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Why do you believe that Derek accents prestigious?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The word describing Derek's accent was first incorporated into this article on 1 September 2005 by a sociolinguistics lecturer.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>All the houses mates’ accent could be said to be very unusual to some one depending on in what part of Britain you. So why refer to Derek’s accent and not to any of the housemate’s accents</b>.</p>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue">Derek's was the ONLY accent that was principally class-based, rather than regionally based.</font></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Firstly your statement about Derek’s accent being principally class-based, rather than regionally based is not only a class stereotype but it is also in correct as most millionaires in Britain do not have Derek’s accent.</b></p>
<p>'<i><b>Secondly why should it mater if his acct was class based or regional based''''</b></i></p>
<p><b>What has Derek’s accent got to do with his role as quiz master?</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Derek was the <u>only</u> housemate never to be subjected to quiz questions, but only to set them. Many people believe his accent and demeanour bamboozled the others (and some viewers) into thinking he was more intelligent and was in some way superior.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Anyone who makes assumption about some one on the ground of the way they speak is prejudice and you can’t blame Derek for they way some ignorant prejudice people think. Derek has never said he was more intelligent or that he was in any way superior. In fact when Kinga said she thought that Derek was intelligent he replied’ I’m not intelligent and then he Pointe over at Eugene and ‘said he is intelligent’.</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue">I don't think that associating a prestigious accent with intelligence would normally be described as prejudice. However, on one occasion - when the housemates were sitting around a table - Derek asked Craig for a chocolate and Makosi offered to pass one over to him, and Derek told Makosi to keep her filthy black hands off - <font color="red">that <font color="blue">is what most people would think of as being prejudiced.</font></font></font></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>To be prejudice is to have a preconceived preference or idea.So anyone who makes assumption about some one on the ground of the way they speak is prejudice</b></p>
<p><b>The occasion that you are referring was during the spy task - when the housemates were sitting around a table they where all PLAYING THE ROLE OF WW2 SPYS. What Derek, Craig and Makosi did or said when they where in character are what most people would think of as acting.</b></p>

I'd say she only became a BB6 Housemate on Day 66, so the reference to her earlier stay shouldn't be on the chart. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJess_Cully_1ad4.html" title="User:Jess Cully">Jess Cully</a> 18:49, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This bit has been added <i>Unfortunately the show surpassed the fourth series for receiving the lowest viewer ratings of all the Big Brother series due of having housemates who were considered unlikable.</i> as it was from the series 4 entry and isn't that latter bit true to reasons why series 6 was unpopular.</p>

<dd>IMHO they should be left in. If an article says "George" then there are thousands of George's in the world.

<p>Is it really necassary to have the positions in the name boxes? Saying who came 16th, 15th, 14th, etc. isn't really how you know the housemates, the only positions that are ever counted are 1st - 4th. Perhaps the final four positions could be written in the housemate's Week 11 boxes - see <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_5_nominations_table_ff26.html" title="Big Brother 5 nominations table">Big Brother 5 nominations table</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_4_nominations_table_00ca.html" title="Big Brother 4 nominations table">Big Brother 4 nominations table</a> to get the idea of what I'm suggesting.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I get what you mean. The only problem with this is that Week 11 is actually being used for the mid-week eviction on Wednesday. If we were to follow the same pattern as BB5 and BB4, a new final column would have to be created. (This cannot be named Week 12 because there isn't one. Possibly week 11, second half. These are only ideas but I think that putting final positions in <b>Week 11</b> as it is, would not work very well. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><font color="#0000FF">Fire</font><font color="#FF0000">Fox</font></b></font></a> 17:36, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
