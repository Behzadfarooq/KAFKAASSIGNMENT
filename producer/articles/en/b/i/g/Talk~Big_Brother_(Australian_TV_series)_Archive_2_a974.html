<li>insidebigbrother.com also offers a big brother tipping competition which I believe to be great content and fun for big brother fans. Perhaps a link should be added to this section of the site instead of the overall fan site, as other Australian big brother fan sites do not operate such a service.

<li>Perhaps it is wrong to call the site a "fan site", as insidebigbrother.com is more of a site with news and current information (and tipping, etc) - its not so much a "fan site". <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDavid_5754.html" title="User:WikiDavid">WikiDavid</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiDavid_ab86.html" title="User talk:WikiDavid">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WikiDavid_1c6d.html" title="Special:Contributions/WikiDavid">contribs</a>) 23:52, 3 January 2006.</small></li>
<li>It is impossible for anyone to say for sure that any site is "better" than another. This comes down to POV. Being around longer does not make a site "better". If one link stays, then I do not think you can remove all other links.

<p>Please make your cases for or against including a directory as opposed to a single link. I would appreciate it if you kept your comments to your own section.

<li>A link to a directory of fan sites (and related sites) could offer users of wikipedia more choice and consequently more information. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDavid_5754.html" title="User:WikiDavid">Dave</a> 00:28, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Big Brother is Australia's most popular reality television programme. It is followed closely on the internet by millions of viewers, therefore I believe the viewers should have an accessible list of fan sites, information sites and related. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDavid_5754.html" title="User:WikiDavid">Dave</a> 00:32, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>A directory such as the Google directory (DMOZ) is human-edited and therefore a quality list of sites will make it to the list. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDavid_5754.html" title="User:WikiDavid">Dave</a> 00:32, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>We are going to have this same problem everytime someone tries to put a link up to an external site. There are 100's of Australian Big Brother sites, so this problem is going to occur quite frequently unless either everyone is allowed to add an external link (not just 1 site) or if we create a directory to link to. 00:36, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>A link to a directory would only be justified if there were a number of notable competing fan sites. This is not the case here. The major fansite behindbigbrother.com is miles ahead of anyone else. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 06:10, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>A directory would be a great idea and stop disputes like this one.

<li>A link to a directory can actually diminish the usefulness of this article as an information resource because the directory will not be an immediately useful resource. Readers will need to wade through a list of sites, possibily without knowing the significance of each one.

<dd>My reasoning was that the policy states a link to the most popular site is what should be there, or in extreme cases, a link to a directory. Now, we have some people on the <i>single link</i> side of the debate and some people on the <i>directory</i> side of the dispute. A synthesis of these two sides yields what is in my opinion a reasonable compromise. People can see the most popular fan site immediately and if they want a list they can visit the directory. This isn't my choice to make though, you guys have to reach the consensus, not me&#160;:) I'm just trying to help things along&#160;:) - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 00:59, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think there should be a directory OR everyone can list their websites. It is not fair that only one website can be listed.

<dd>Hi, you clearly haven't read Wikipedia policy very carefully. Wikipedia is not <i>fair</i>, there is a specific set of guidelines and rules as to what external links should be present. The only external link that <i>should</i> be present is behindbigbrother.com. Allowing a directory is being <i>nice</i>, making a <i>compromise</i>, trying to build <i>consensus</i>.
