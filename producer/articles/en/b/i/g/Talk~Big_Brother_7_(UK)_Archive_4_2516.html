<dd>Have a look at this page: Deal or No Deal, Series 2 (UK). Isn't including the entrance songs to each housemate not akin to the academic nature of the detail listed on this page?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Houseplan</span></h2>
<p>I replaced the image Image:C4BBhouseplan.jpg which is claimed fairuse with freely licenced Image:BB7Houseplan.svg. Whilst not identical to the original the layout of the house was similar (if less stylish than in the offical fair use image). The image has since been reverted with reason given as the freely licenced image didn't look as good. I feel this is not the point. Provided the freely licenced image conveys the right information, then it should remain. Fair usage guidelines on Wikipedia state fair use images should only be used if "No free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information. If unfree material can be transformed into free material, it should be done instead of using a "fair use" defense.". The screenshot of the house plan from the Channel 4 broadcast would not appear to fall under this guideline. What are others thought on this, I don't want to revert back to the freely licenced image for fear of starting a reversion war, but feel the image that has been reverted to does not qualify as fair use. Could someone improve on the freely licenced image? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexj2002_245b.html" title="User:Alexj2002">Alexj2002</a> 14:43, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It would seem likely that the Channel4 screenshot is stylized to make it look nicer. The fact it looks nicer isn't justification for using it over a freely licenced alternative, although factual errors in the recreation might (although I feel that the possibility alone of creating a freely licenced alternative results in a breach of the fair use guidelines).

<p>Chantelle wasn't a <i>Big Brother</i> housemate, she was a <i>Celebrity Big Brother</i> housemate. If they counted Chantelle, then Michael would have been the 101st housemate because of Gaetano. But if they counted Chantelle, then Kinga would have been the 100th housemate, because if Chantelle counts, then so do all the other celebrity housemates. In fact not even Kinga, because all the teen housemates would also count.

<dd>One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments <b>that have already been published by reputable publishers</b>.

<dd>"Verifiability" in this context does not mean that editors are expected to verify whether, for example, the contents of a <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> article are true. In fact, editors are strongly discouraged from conducting this kind of research, because <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> may not be published in Wikipedia.

<dd>9cds can answer that one. Anyway, photos from the Channel 4 website are not publicity photos, so they cannot be used, why are you prolonging this discussion? --<b><a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELorian_2fa4.html" title="User:Lorian">Lorian</a></b><sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELorian_96ed.html" title="User talk:Lorian">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lorian_3679.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lorian">C</a></sub> 21:57, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"We got em from the C4 website" doesn't show we <b>know</b> they are press pack images.

<dd>Yes, the discussion did come up last year, because <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> images were being deleted with hardly a moments thought - and sometimes without giving any notice whatsoever of intention to delete - a position which was explicitly approved by one of the discussants. The justification given then was a <i>proposed</i> guideline on publicity photos, but what was then a proposed guideline isn't even a proposal now - it's an <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essay.html" title="Essay">essay</a>, not a policy or guideline (probably partly as a result of those discussions)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course the images are publicity images - everything about them says so, including the fact that they are widely distributed in the press and electronic media as soon as Big Brother starts.

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>But whether we need to know the exact status of the images or not is a complete red herring, as I tried to show above "I'm asking for comments on the template used, say, for this image of Ivette in American Big Brother, as we don't seem to know whether or not the images in dispute form part of a press kit"</dd>

<dd>I haven't heard one peep about that template, simply because it shows in clarity how to treat these contestants images - simply as Fair Use images whose provenance or copyright status may not be precisely known, but for which of course a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationale.html" title="Rationale">rationale</a> still needs to be given.</dd>

<dd>Hi, I'm not an expert, so I'd still like to hear from any wikipedians (see the 'specific differences' request made earlier) on the underlying copyright differences (if any) relating to logos. As to treatment on wikipedia, I think <b>all</b> fair use claims should be supported with a rationale to justify the claim. In that respect I note that none of the UK Big Brother eye logos on wikipedia, going right back to the first Big Brother (and including BB7) have any such rationale given--<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShojo_5998.html" title="User:Shojo">luke</a> 12:45, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>People are beginning to care more about rationales. If people can 'be bothered' to upload images, then they should also be bothered to act responsibly by adding rationales, although in some cases (such as logos) it is pretty much covered in the tag. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 14:34, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, Surely one of the important things about the rationale is that it gives the fair use claim <i>substance</i>, in that it contextualises the claim in terms of the image, the article(s) it relates to and the precise nature of the fair use claim being made for the image in those articles. Without the rationale, the tag is more of a <i>gesture</i>. This is one of the reasons I was asking for any underlying differences in copyright relating to logos. Do you know of any?

<p>Some pertinent points (quoted from above):</p>
<p>"You are permitted to use the Big Brother name or Official Site content ONLY IF:</p>
<p>1) NO COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY</p>
<p>Your site must be a pure non-commercial fan site. This means that no commercial material or commercial activity of any kind, in particular, no advertising, whether paid or in kind, no sponsorship and no other revenue generation will be allowed.</p>
<p>2) REFER TO OFFICIAL SITE ON YOUR HOME PAGE</p>
<p>Your site must clearly state in a prominent position on the home page that it is not the official site and has no connection with Channel 4, its licensors (including Endemol Entertainment International B.V.), the Big Brother programme or the Official Site and provide a link to the home page of the Official Site.</p>
<p>You must also clearly state that Channel 4 and its licensors do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for any content, products, services or information available on your site.</p>
<p>3) USE OF CONTENT, IMAGES OR VIDEO STREAMING</p>
<p>Eye Branding</p>
<p>Your site may not use any 'Big Brother Eye' branding at any time or under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Text or Images</p>
<p>If any page in your site uses any Big Brother text or images or grabs from the Official Site, you must credit them as coming from the Official Site and provide links to the Official Site.</p>
<p>Video Streaming</p>
<p>If you wish to link to Big Brother video streams, you must do so via the live video page on the Official Site and make clear to your users that you are doing so by providing a link.</p>
<p>Links</p>
<p>Any links from your site to the Official Site must be direct to home page of the Official Site at all appropriate points in your site.</p>
<p>No Modification</p>
<p>Under no circumstances are you allowed to modify images, text or video streams or attempt to claim the Big Brother name or logo as your own.</p>
<p>(4) YOUR CONTENT</p>
<p>Your site must not contain anything illegal, libellous, defamatory, obscene or have any adverse impact on the brand, image or name of Big Brother, the Big Brother programme, Channel 4 or its licensors."</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>So a few things to consider. Going back to the pictures, I don't have the time to argue about them, but (notwithstanding the above) I do believe they fit as comfortably within "promotional" and "press pack or a similar source" as can be, and have far more FU concerns about using a large number of unlicenced screen captures on one page. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 22:21, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1) Wikipedia does not accept conditional permission. It's content may be used, at some point, for commercial activity. Also, this, contrary to what some believe, is not a a fan site.</dd>
<dd>2) Are we going to put that statment on our home page? What do you reckon Jimmy would say about that?</dd>
<dd>3) We could probably justify using the eye in our context (since we are not attempting to associate ourselves with the show).
<p>I agree that the quantity of screengrabs can be a problem (one of the same problems as using those 'promo' images). I wish there wasn't so much emphasis on images. We don't need them nearly as much as people think.

Or the Survivor shows - they're more commonly referred to as Survivor, but they all longer, much longer names. Plus, they get their full names in their article titles - bracket-free.

<p>An anonymous user keeps changing the current nominations and evictions table to split the evictions row into evictions, walkers and ejectees. I would like to see who thinks the current one is better or should be split it. I think we should keep it as it is because it is less clutterred and has unnecessary detail.</p>

<dd>The second table offers a more in depth detail of how people left the house and under which circumstances. Saying that "All But Jayne" were nominated doesn't tell anything. Does that mean that Grace was nominated too? Of course not, because she wasn't in the house at that time. Having it say every Housemate's name lets the reader know EXACTLY who was nominated. And the table also shows as clear as crystal what happened to George, Shabaz and Dawn. I'm the creator of the BB06 Australia table and it is very efficient at showing the weekly events in the Big Brother house and nobody seems to have a problem with it. It's very informative and I feel it should be used on the Big Brother UK (Series 7) page. --24.224.246.18 18:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)Daniel</dd>

<p>Sorry, I thought it might be common sense to give the phonetic pronunciation of Aisleyne's name - after all someone who knows nothing about BB might want to look at the article some time. Or is the article simply being written by a single group of BB fans <i>for</i> BB fans? I'm not going to bother changing it back, plenty of other articles to work on.

<dd>Actually, I know Irish (and she admitted her name is Irish) and Ais in Irish is pronounced Ash, so there is a little confusion. When I first saw her name I didn't know that it was pronounced Ashleen.

<p>OK, I'm a little confused on how we should mark weeks. Do we mark them as the time that one person and the next person were evicted or based on 7's? Since the evictions are two days after the beginning of the next week, should they be counted as the week that just ended or a new one (like Bonnie being evicted week 2 not week 1)?

<dd>For a few reasons, which are as follows:
<ol>
<li>A "week" is an artificial length of time, as is any length of time. We shouldn't be bound by it.</li>
<li>Since my rewrite and cutting back, individual weeks are simply too small to be treated separately. There's not enough to write about (that's of note) each week - since each section should be at least 2 paragraphs.</li>
<li>That many (14 or so?) just clutters the TOC unnecessarily.</li>

<dd>That's a very serious accusation. Please do not make it, unless you're willing to back it up. Plus, the switch to individual weeks wasn't discussed at all, either. And yes, while I won't be surprised, I'll be dissappointed when edit wars start up - that's against policy, and certainly bad Wikiquette. —<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_Esperanza_1a4d.html" title="User:Celestianpower/Esperanza"><font color="green">es</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">tianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 22:34, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>first, I made no accusation, I offered a POV based on recent experience. Second, you really should have discussed your radical change back to 2 weeks and it was bad Wikiquette not to do so. Third, you've caused avoidable disruption by your failure to do so (fact). Fourth, as has been pointed out, the chrono. was apparently originally weekly. Finally, as predicted someone else has reverted your changes back to weekly. (your edits were good by the way but the change to bi-weekly was always going to cause serious issues for some people and with consultation was wholly avoidable) <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaky_caldron_cd06.html" title="User:Leaky caldron">leaky_caldron</a> 00:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's exactly what you did - accused FireFox of abusing his Admin Powers on a previous occasion.</dd>
<dd>I don't understand where the "radical" is coming from. It's a change in the names of a few headings: the "radical", if at all, comes in my rewrite. But, yes, perhaps I should have discussed it first, though I thought that as part of an extensive rewrite, people would see how tiny the sections were now, and fail to see a reason to continue to split them.</dd>
<dd>No, that isn't a fact. I wouldn't call it disruption to anyone but me (who kept trying to do big rewrites and kept being edit conflicted on people changing the sections).</dd>
<dd>That doesn't matter as much as you might think - <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_6%29_dd08.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 6)">Big Brother (UK series 6)</a> has fortnightly sections and the article has popped back and forth between these two ideas for ages. If the article originally said "Nikki is such a cow!", we wouldn't be campaigning to put that back in, would we?</dd>
<dd>I only reverted once. The other reverts came because I was doing complicated big edits and was bei8ng edit conflicted. If someone had have changed the sections after I was done, I would have left it.</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict x2) Er, I'm not finished... A week is a period of seven consecutive days. That's hardly an artificial length of time. And when people are writing about weeks, who writes about them in two-week sections? Seriously, who? It doesn't matter how short or long a section will be after information from them is removed; a week will always be a seven day period. —<font face="tahoma"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 22:23, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why seven? What's the significance? Perhaps this is being a bit obtuse, I don't know.</dd>
<dd>As to the length of sections, it's of critical importance. The guideline/policy/common sense dictates that sections should be 2 paragraphs long each (at least). If they aren't (or even, in the case of week 6), just one sentence, they need to be merged. This is the best was of doing so, in my view. If you have better suggestions, I'd love to hear them! :).

<dd>Seven because a week is seven days; not 14. A fortnight is 14 days. The sections aren't named Fortnight 1, Fortnight 2, Fortnight 3, Fortnight 4, and Fortnight 5.

<dd>I didn't say the show stopped after an eviction; but this is how it's been done in other articles: evictions are the last thing in a single week section. Single week sections are manageable, and probably make the most sense. Having them in two week sections might give people the impression that the show is broken down into two week sections, or that something amazing happens every two weeks. It needs to be basic, and it needs to not in any way be the slightest bit misleading. —<font face="tahoma"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 10:57, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find that impossible to believe, personally - people aren't going to be confused by breaking it down into 2 weeks per section.</dd>
<dd>Let me try a different tack: ideally, we shouldn't have subsections at all, and we should just have a block of "plot". Since this plot summary is too long for that, we have decided to break it down further, solely because we want to reduce the section's size. Based on this, we break it up so the subsections are the right size - this is done by putting them in two week sections. This also has the advantage of a smaller TOC. It's a win-win situation, with the slightest of inconveniences coming from the evictions not neatly fitting in one per section. This is a price worth paying. —<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_Esperanza_1a4d.html" title="User:Celestianpower/Esperanza"><font color="green">es</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">tianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 11:14, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, and that's what any good Wikipedia editor does - looks carefully at the debate, and looks at the reasonings and rationales. Clearly I and FireFox have been on Wikipedia, actively involved in editing for much longer than people who have just arrived. We've had trust in our actions from the community, making us admins. But, not only this, we take the time and effort to <i>explain</i> our opinions fully - why we want something a certain way. "I like this one" is worthless in terms of Wikipedia - "I like this because..." is vastly more important and weighs plenty heavier as a result. —<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_Esperanza_1a4d.html" title="User:Celestianpower/Esperanza"><font color="green">es</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">tianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 13:27, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Being an administrator, and having "trust in your actions"; and <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox">FireFox</a> - when did he come into this!? - has absolutely nothing to do with this. If every decision you made was so good, you wouldn't be getting conflict right now. I think what the majority of people want is sometimes the better decision, but I've seen you ignore this every single time I've seen you make a decision. People have given good reasons for everything. For the chronology, one thing that was said a lot is that splitting the chronology would make the main article smaller; but instead you split the section that everybody thinks should stay. And for this, people have given good reasons for having the weeks in one-week sections; but again it's almost as if you're doing everything in your power to try and have it the way you want it. Thisi isn't about me having my way at all; this is about what's best for the article, and what everybody else thinks is best for the article. —<font face="tahoma"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 13:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've already made it clear that I believe the change back to double weeks should have been discussed first to avoid edit waring. The suggested content cutback if fine.

<dd>I strongly doubt anyone would argue for any other combination, personally.

<dd>I think what happened is 80.43.11.242 changed the houseplan from light to dark, then in another edit they added a {{fact}} tag to the bit about the returning housemate being eligible to win. JD then switched the houseplan back to light then, a minute later, Leaky caldron reverted the adding of the {{fact}} tag. By doing this they also reverted JD's edit (therefore putting the dark houseplan back). Assuming this was unintentional, I (Tra) put the light houseplan back. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 21:47, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Live Action on Freeview</span></h2>
<p>I've corrected the information about live action footage of Big Brother on Freeview. I've got a Freeview box and the red button icon vanished without notice several days prior to the launch of Film4 (also owned by Channel 4).</p>
<p>At the same time previews of forthcoming films started to be shown on Film4 and I believe that the bandwith that the live action was using was transfered over to Film4. Prior to the transmission of Big Brother, Freeview channel 31 carried More 4+1. This channel was shut down to make way for Film4 and, despite the fact that the live action was transmitted on Freeview channel 305, the two channels were never ever broadcasting pictures at the same time. I therefore think that Big Brother was 'borrowing' channel 31's bandwith until Film4 was turned on.</p>
<p>I didn't put any of this into the article as I don't think it is relevant, but if anyone contests my edit (for some strange reason) you can research what I have said here to see if you agree with me.</p>

<p>When there are two it is obvious how much the winner got, because the loser's % is stated, but in previous years when three or four people were up Channel4 used to give complete breakdowns, I was wondering if this information existed and if it did could someone add it?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gender Bias from Voting Public</span></h2>
<p>Should a discussion on the main page for Big Brother UK be added once this series finishes pointing out how in a Female vs Male eviction the odds are with the Male (the first and last eviction of Series 7 being examples, 78% for Bonnie vs 22% for Glyn shows how strongly the public is against the female contestants) and a discussion about how with the exceptions of Makosi, Nadia, Kate and Anna females don't usually place in the final three, and that even Sezer thought he could get away with murder and still not go out (his case is blurred by it being a three way with Richard and Lea). In some series the bias has been so strong that during BB4 6 females were evicted and only 3 males, leaving Steph to finish 4th with the top three being all male. And from Sam to Jayne there were nothing but female evictions this year, until the double eviction of Spiral and Michael (but even Mikey has gone back in after four days meaning Sezer, Spiral and Michael are the only males to have been evicted this year and still be out the house, and futhermore Michael and Spiral weren't even original housemates).

<p>The four place finish for all six previous series was female (Mel, Helen, Jade, Steph, Shell, Kinga). And if you look through the votes you can see 20 occasions when a female lost to a male or males, but only seven occasions when a female beat a male (Andy lost to Caroline BB1, Josh then Paul lost to Helen BB2, PJ lost to Kate BB3, Science then Kemal lost to Orlaith BB6 and Mikey lost to Susie, Imogen and Jennie BB7). I find it interesting because I think Imogen is destined to lose to Richard, the odds are not in her favour. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenhusted_5fa7.html" title="User:Darrenhusted">Darrenhusted</a> 14:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In the Radio Times they have BB down for 8pm to 9.30pm then 10pm to 11.05pm. With 2.5hrs and six housemates to bring out they probably won't re-interview Nikki in the studio, this leaves plenty of time for four full evictions and the winner's interview. Whether they do it outside like last year (leaving Aisleyne open to chants like Makosi) or take it inside I don't know. Last year was the first time that Davina didn't go it to the house to interview the winner, maybe they'll do that to speed up time.

<dd>As kingboyk said, the chronology could be split off and replaced by the main events of the series. I think this would probably be the golden tickets, the House Next Door and Nikki's re-entry - all major twists where there has been some controversy. These (more notable) aspects could then be covered in slightly more detail without seeming to be unnecessary <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 16:32, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now the article has been split, to Weekly summary of Big Brother (UK series 7), what defines as important, to include in a more basic summary? Evictions, tasks, punishments etc are some possibilities. Should it be weekly, or summarised differently? Also, should it be in a chronology style, as per older series, or should it be written in a new style, where everything is in a set format? Thanks. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex9891_424f.html" title="User:Alex9891">Alex</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex9891_0328.html" title="User talk:Alex9891">Talk</a>) 19:28, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think evictions are all that important. I don't think the tasks are too important either, but the one where the Intruders entered the House should be included. Nikki's re-entering the House, Susie's entering the House, and warnings and strikes I think should be included. I can't decide between having it like a chronology and having it in sections of whatever happened, but if only the Intruders task is included, I think having it written like a chronology might be better, as it would avoid having a tasks section with only one event. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">jd</a> || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 19:42, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You don't think that evictions, the main part of the show, what the housemates prepare themselves for all week, what defines the show's winner, are important? Explain yourself please! --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex9891_424f.html" title="User:Alex9891">Alex</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex9891_0328.html" title="User talk:Alex9891">Talk</a>) 19:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think evictions are important because the evictees didn't win. This is meant to be a summary, and last time I checked only important things were included in summaries. The evictees were evicted, and Pete was the winner. I don't see why anything more than that would need to be included in a summary. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">jd</a> || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 19:58, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There doesn't seem to be much difference between the summary here and the Weekly summary of Big Brother (UK series 7) that's just been split off, apart from the headings and word order. If it's going to be in a separate article, there should be significantly more information than in the section here, otherwise the article is redundant. I think we could either:
<ul>
<li>Trim down the summary section in this article</li>
<li>Expand the Weekly summary of Big Brother (UK series 7) article, perhaps to its size before it was trimmed down</li>
<li>Write the summary section in a significantly different way to the Weekly summary of Big Brother (UK series 7) article, e.g. organised by <s>themes</s> major events instead of weeks</li>
<li>Delete Weekly summary of Big Brother (UK series 7).</li>
</ul>

<dd>There is quite a lot of difference now. You contradict yourself - do you want the Weekly summary of Big Brother (UK series 7) article expanded or deleted? Also, how do you intend to summarise using themes? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex9891_424f.html" title="User:Alex9891">Alex</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex9891_0328.html" title="User talk:Alex9891">Talk</a>) 22:36, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To take your first point, I don't really mind either way, but having two places with the same information (the section and the article) is a bit redundant. I know there is some difference between the two, but to me, it just looks like the same information but trimmed down further and headings added.</dd>
<dd>To take your second point, I think it would probably be a good idea to give the major events in the series their own sections, and go into a bit more detail. I am thinking of maybe the golden tickets (which is a very unusual twist, and caused controversy with the way the competition was carried out), the House Next Door (another major twist) and Nikki's re-entry (which was also controversial). These are what distinguish the series from other series of Big Brother, so they are important. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 23:05, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Merged with what? Though it is unique as far as I know, I don't think it needs to have a section dedicated to it as most of it is about 1984, and there's nothing new there in terms of subtle, and the less subtle, references in the series. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">jd</a> || <a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a> || 14:57, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I found the Big Brother Online source before, but the way it's worded doesn't make it seem very accurate, ,and it makes me think that they may not actually know. I'm not looking for a figure so accurate that it includes every single person, but if I'm going to be including this in the article, I'd like something that appears to have been written with more certainty. If nothing else can be found, I'll just go with that though.
