They're all based on IGN script reviews, though... what do you think? Is that a bit much? For example, the Cameron script had an Electro-type guy as well as Sandman for the villains, and Koepp started out with Green Goblin and Doc Ock. Encyclopedic or not?

<dd>I think it's a good idea. It's technically part of the production process, those first scripts didn't get off the ground. It isn't like "the Donner cut", so it wouldn't serve best to have its own page, but its was still part of this film, because those people were contracted to write them. It's like including the info about Nic Cage, or anyone else that was interested or contracted to start in the film early on.

<p>OK, I've finally placed all the awards (minus a couple nominations that were out there. Now we can start cutting. I've striked out all the ones that didn't have pages, which probably means they are not that notable. Two had wins, one in best voice over and the other for best actress. The "best actress" one would be the only one I would think could be overturned, but I doubt it because I don't think "Empire Awards" are that notable, let along recognizable. Some of the ones with pages are just stubs. I think we should keep the "Motion Picture Sound Editors" nomination, the program has apparently been around for 50 years. Thoughts on the others. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 03:27, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">How to make webmaster Tobey Maguire look like he's crawling up a building? Director Sam Raimi had two demands: that Spidey's moves look like they were ripped from the pages of the comic and that the camera stay with him. "We came up with the idea that Spider-Man has his own stunt cameraman, much [like] if you watch a skydiving competition," says John Dykstra, the visual-effects designer. "We thought the camera should follow him up the wall." <b>BEFORE</b> With Raimi's edicts in mind, the Sony Pictures Imageworks team decided the shot should be completely unreal, so they created a CG character with moves Maguire couldn't pull off. The buildings and background had to be CG also, says Dykstra, "to have the [camera work] be as flexible as the character. We simply couldn't move the camera that way in the real world." <b>AFTER</b> A CG Spidey has been created, within a CG city--with Maguire's CG mug. "We had to make Tobey's face, which is tricky," says Dykstra. In other shots, Maguire's face is "pasted" onto a CG body. In this shot, the team scanned the actor's visage, recording his skin's texture and color. "We project the images of the face onto a three-dimensional model, and we stitch them together so they become seamless."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></td>

<p>I'm gearing up for an exam tonight at 8, so afterward, I'll have more flexibility in my schedule to make serious contributions to <i>Spider-Man</i> for a while. However, I might be focusing my work on <i>Ghost Rider</i> as well, since the film is coming out this February and thus is of more immediate priority. I know there's a lot of information available for it, so I want to develop the article. Also want to do <i>300</i> before March... but I'll definitely fit in <i>Spider-Man</i> edits in the time period.

<dd>That's cool. I have several exams coming up this week and next week. I'll see what I can do for Spider-Man while your working on those. 3RR backlash?? It technically didn't affect me, but I felt bad after that user and I had settled the dust over our argument, and then William blocks him for 8 hours. This has just not been my last couple of days. I had my truck belt snap, call a tow truck to come get it (1am), but the "professional parking towing" was there inside of 40 mins towing me away to their lot. Then I find out I have to replace the idler pulley. Then, after all is said and done, a day later they block a user for 3RR vio, when he probably wasn't aware of the rule in the first place, and after I withdrawal the report. I personally think a simple warning would have sufficed, but I'm not an admin (thank god). Anyway, good luck on your exam, and I'll see what I can find for Spider-Man in my free time. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 21:32, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't sure. I was mistaken. Originally I thought it was about the Wastelands, because I was wondering what the connection (other than the three words at the end) was to the Wastelands. Did the director say that was a theme? Anyway, I saw the edit that he made, and I thought maybe he was copying and pasting and accidentally picked up some vandalism (or misplaced inquisition) from the article page, but I couldn't find any. Then I thought maybe there was an edit conflict and the anonymous user just didn't register in the system. I'm not sure exactly what is going on, but since he (in the least) answered the question and isn't persisting in the identification of the individual, I wouldn't think too much about it.
