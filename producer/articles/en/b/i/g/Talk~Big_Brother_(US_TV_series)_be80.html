<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I think they're good. They give a simple explanation for the variations in timing and whatnot. I'm not sure if the 9-11 reference is completely necessary... but I suppose it was rather important to the show that they picked a very unfortunate week to plan the finish. (Man, I'm still surprised they continued the show after that. They scheduled the big finale for BB2, then happened upon the one week in which nobody really cared who won a reality show.) <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThirdreel_6377.html" title="User:Thirdreel">Thirdreel</a> 01:18, 15 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't forget, though, that 9-11 was very important to BB2's outcome because Monica, who was still a contestant at this time, had a cousin who was never found alive at the site. They broke the "no news to the houseguests" rule for her. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCustomOfLife_ae8d.html" title="User:TheCustomOfLife">Mike H</a> 02:05, Jul 18, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In retrospect, it might have been smarter for the producers to end the show after the 9-11 attacks because the outcome would be altered. But, the producers gave the option of halting to the contestants, which may not have been the most viable option considering a lot of events in that timeframe were either cancelled or rescheduled. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigPauly_b63c.html" title="User:BigPauly">Big Pauly</a> 23:59, 17 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I ask myself two questions whenever I make major revisions and additions to a Wikipedia article: "Who's going to be reading this?" and "What kind of information will they be looking for?" It helps me decide what kind of information to include. In this case, I think readers will be, for the most part, people who saw the show and already have opinions about it. They will come to the page if they've forgotten the name of a previous contestant, or if they have some reason to want a houseguest's full name. So I think some simple explanation is in order, but not too much on who voted how and why. Whether BB2 would have ended differently if not for 9-11 is definitely debatable.<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThirdreel_6377.html" title="User:Thirdreel">Thirdreel</a> 21:32, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I don't think Monica was voted out because of her loss. I think it was because Will and Nicole were selfish and wanted moneymoneymoney.

<p>Good idea to create a separate page for Big Brother USA. But why is the page on the BB USA contestants about to be deleted? Maybe we should move the list of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_contestants_0f53.html" title="Big Brother USA contestants">contestants</a> here...</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is Wikipedia policy on spoilers, but I'm going to request it anyway: Please don't post information that has not aired on the show. If you see something on the live feeds that you wish to discuss, you may discuss it on other webpages like Hamster Time <a href="http://p200.ezboard.com/fbb3livefeedsfrm23" class="external autonumber" title="http://p200.ezboard.com/fbb3livefeedsfrm23" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> or <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_Without_Pity_8468.html" title="Television Without Pity">Television Without Pity</a>: <a href="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>I agree with the spoiler warning. A lot of people TiVo or record the shows and watch them at later times or dates. They may "stumble" upon this page or come here looking for information. And, if someone post the contest or eviction result within 5 minutes of the show airing, the show will be spoiled for them.</p>
<p>Also, I think any talk about alliances is biased POV, at least until the whole thing plays out. Keep this as an encyclopedia article to report the facts about the show. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThirdreel_6377.html" title="User:Thirdreel">Thirdreel</a> 22:23, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It makes no sense to have moved this article to CBS TV series. Someone from another country looking for information on the American Big Brother won't necessarily know that the show airs on a network called CBS. They'll look for the Big Brother article related to USA, and the old name made it clear which BB were talking about. I suggest we move it back. 70.48.92.135 12:36, 20 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Having separate contestant articles has always been more appealing to me than cramming everything into one article. The main article, in my opinion, should only contain a general overview of the show. Other shows, such as <i><a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor_%28TV_series%29_7392.html" title="Survivor (TV series)">Survivor</a></i>, have articles on all the winners, as well as many of the "losers." The turnout of <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyW_ecc1.html" title="User:TonyW">TonyW</a>'s VfD polls seems to indicate that not many people object to the articles either. There's nothing unencyclopedic about people who were on a popular television show. The more information the better, I say. 20 years from now, when all the fan sites are gone, someone might find some use for pages of information on Big Brother contestants. So, I vote to expand, instead of merge. Heck, link all of the candidate names in this article and create a page for each one of them.

<p>Merging is a mistake. Each contestant has their own separate story, which should clutter this article. Also, to let people know, a vote on re-directing <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a> into here is being done now, as part of an ongoing effort to delete almost all contestants. Also, regardless of everybodies position on the subject, discussion of merge should occur here, not on each separate contestant's article (if it's a rehash of the same issue) --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 11:56, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur. I would happily support a split. I'll look it over more closely, and see how practical it would be (I'm not sure if I'm able to do it myself). Before doing the split, I think we should all see what kind of trivia can be taken out of completely (not relocated, but eliminated). A a good starting point might be the section called tat's actually called "Trivia" (a good hint it's not important enough to keep). Rather than figure out which article each trivial point goes with, it might be easier to just ditch the ones we don't need. Hopefully, now that times past, we can recognize some of this stuff just doesn't matter. But, I'm also not interested in a revert war if people want to keep everything. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:40, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I haven't watched this show, so when I became curious about it I came to Wikipedia first. Unfortunately, the article seems to have been written for someone who already has at least a passing familiarity with the show. If someone who knows the show could do somewhat of a rewrite for the ignorant among us (me, for example), I think it could be improved considerably. An description of how the show works, what the rules are, and so on should be the <em>first</em> thing, not buried near the bottom and explained poorly at that. Abbreviations such as "HoH" should be explained the first time they appear, not in subsequent sections.</p>
<p>Sorry if I sound cranky, but it's frustrating to find an article written for people who probably already know much of what's in it. I'd do the rewrite myself, but I don't know the subject matter well enough to attempt it, and am not interested enough to do the necessary research.</p>

<dd>Why do we need to keep changing it for no reason? It's been renamed multiple times. If it was already called "Big Brother (US)", with everything linking to it, I would be happy to leave it, at that. But, other than creating double-redirects, it's not clear what changing it to that, will accomplish. Now that the name is exactly what the naming convention guidelines say it should be, it seems time to leave it. It's annoying to fix redirects (paritcularly double-redirects), and then have that undone by another rename. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 16:42, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I thought I'd let people know here, so that there is no argument and so I don't get chased down the street by angry mobs with flaming pitchforks and whatnot. --<a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a> <sup><span><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></span></sup> <sub><span style="position: relative; left: -45px; margin-right: -45px;"><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email me</a></span></sub> 17:58, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>People, you can't add things to the article without explaining them. What's the Coup d'Etat thing? What does it mean?

<p>I'm removing a number of the "firsts" listed, because they refer to things that only happened once. <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThirdreel_6377.html" title="User:Thirdreel">Thirdreel</a> 22:37, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've removed this "first" from the Season 7 list&#160;:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This makes no sense. Technically, the first contestant to win the most was Mike Malin, from season two, who won the first HOH competition -- at that point he has won the most of anybody -- 1 to nothing. Somebody who leads a category doesn't get a "first" because they lead it. -- <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArglebargleIV_fb51.html" title="User:ArglebargleIV">ArglebargleIV</a> 00:18, 3 September 2006 (UTC) <a name="Public_Vote" id="Public_Vote"></a></p>

<p>I think the Nominations table should be removed as I don't see how it adds to the article.

<p>Quick question: do you think a section on cultural references in the show itself (such as the term Big Brother itself, or the fact one season the 'confessional room' was labled 101) and the influences it's had are warrented? As one of the first popular reality TV shows, it's been a tremendous influence on modern TV, along with the other 'first wave' RTV shows. Research might be an issue, but I'd be willing to try. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 02:24, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm thinking of shortening the article by making pages containing the content in specific sections of the artcle and only have short synopses, similar to the Power of Veto section. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoking66_2d58.html" title="User:Geoking66">Geoking66</a> 20:25, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
