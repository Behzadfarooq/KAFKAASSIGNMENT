<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deletion of Deportivo Football Club</span></h2>
<p>I think it was completey unnecessary to delete the club's page. It is not just a "minor club" and I was in the process of adding sources and completing the page when it was deleted. Can you please re-instate the page as I put it there as apart of the Wiki project for Australian football. I was also in the process of doing the rest of the teams in the league and eventually other leagues. I do not think you, or any other outside individuals realise how big this competition is in melbourne. I would appreciate a hasty response as I have most of the admins I have dealed with regarding this issue (yourself included) have provided no explanation and made decisions without consulting myself or any others.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I deleted the article because there was no verifiable evidence of its importance. The generally-accepted guideline is that teams playing at the highest level (in Australia that would be the A-League or the old NSL) are notable, but teams below that rank are not necessarily so. The addition of a "hangon" tag does not make a page immune from deletion, but rather signals that there are perhaps other factors to consider - those other factors were not sufficient to alter the decision I took. The fact that there is a WikiProject on a certain area does not mean that an article is immune either, a WikiProject is simply an attempt to standardise and generate information on the area in question. As this is (to my knowledge) our first dealing with each other, I'd appreciate not being tarred with the brush you're attempting to tar me with. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yeah fair enough mate, but i will endevour to find some more eveidence to back the article. But when it comes down to it, i think you are taking this whole website to seriously. Being"tarred" as you like to call, it means nothing in this world. I am voicing my opinion on your talk page.. woah! .. who cares. No one even looks at this talk page anyway. In the whole scheme of things, keeping an article on an albeit smaller football team in Australia, is not as bad as having snake high score champions in a list of notable alumini for famous schools. There is alot wrong with wikipedia, and most people are aware of this, maybe people like yourself should be trying to get rid of the big mistakes instead of articles that do not meet with your personal criteria. There are many other teams less "notable" than Deportivo, from leagues in Zimbabwe, Kenya etc. And regarding the highest level "guideline" are you telling me that the Foxtel Cup, New South Wales premier league and other statewide competitions will not be accepted to. Even though players like leijer, vargas and robinson have all come from this league last year and jsut won a premiership with Melbourne Victory. Surely wiki would like to now about these leagues. Don't mean to paint you haz, just stating the facts.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What I'm objecting to when I say "tarred with the brush" is the sentence <i>most of the admins I have dealed with regarding this issue (yourself included) have provided no explanation and made decisions without consulting myself or any others.</i> Given that you hadn't dealt with me at all on this or any other issue, it's a long bow to draw to say that I've provided no explanation. A message was placed on your Talk page when the article was tagged as a Speedy Deletion candidate, so it's not like you were not aware of the thought processes involved in deleting the article. Surely the assumption would be that the lack of notability which was identified when the article was originally tagged was still the case when it was deleted. Additionally, while you have every right to voice your opinion here, and I welcome it, I'd remind you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on my part.</dd>
<dd>In terms of the argument that <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">there are worse articles to keep than one on a minor-league football team</a>, I'd respond that you're welcome to tag them for Speedy deletion (or put them through another part of the deletion process) yourself - or to let me know about them and see if I do the same. I agree that on the face of it there's no point at all in having a snake high score champion in a list of notable alumni, so just let me know where this article is and I'll have a look at it right away.</dd>
<dd>I am aware there are flaws with Wikipedia, and I'm actively engaged in trying to improve the place. One way in which I'm doing this is by applying the consensus-based criteria for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, which are anything but "my personal criteria". Among these criteria are the ones which the article you wrote failed to meet.</dd>
<dd>Where the teams from Zimbabwe and Kenya are concerned, I stress again that it's hard to make a judgement without seeing the page in question. However, if the team fulfills the notability criteria, then there's nothing wrong with having it. If the teams are from the top league in their country, for example, that's a point in their favour. If you want me to look into the matter, I'd be more than happy to do so.</dd>
<dd>In terms of the lower leagues in Australia, the advice that I'd give you is that any team in any of these leagues would need to prove notability through reliable sources (Deportivo did not at the time it was deleted). The fact that Victory's roster hails from the lower leagues is neither here nor there since every player must have got a start <i>somewhere</i>. Again, write the article with reliable sources to back up the claims of notability, making certain that it meets the criteria involved, and you should be fine. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:21, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My own feeling would be that it couldn't hurt. The discussion about assuming good faith could come back to bite you, but even if nothing else you'd have a number of people (hopefully) providing constructive criticism (hopefully). I'm perhaps not the best person to have asked, in that I don't tend to remember names around here overmuch - but then again, I don't remember you doing anything <i>bad</i>&#160;:) <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 02:27, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Heh, me and my big mouth. This whole thing with Essjay and Jimbo's double standards just disgust me and I sent another civil, but negative comment on his talk page. Essjay betrayed us all and Jimbo seems to want to give the situation kid gloves, but meanwhile when it was clear that Yanksox was in some emotional distress a few weeks ago, he didn't show the same pity and just desysopped at will.</dd>
<dd>I have too much empathy to be an administrator I guess. At least in a crooked place like this anyway.

<dd>There's nothing intrinsically wrong in my book with having empathy and being an admin. I mean, yes we have an image as being some kind of evil unprincipled swine, but at least in theory we're meant to be out there helping the little guy as well as deleting the articles that he wrote that shouldn't be here.

<dd>You can count on at least a "moral support" vote from me if/when you do throw your name into the ring.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">DRV comment</span></h2>
<p>You commented at deletion review "When I write "non-notable", I see that as another way of saying "db-bio" (a practice I'm willing to change if it confuses things for people)". It is certainly clearer for others if you write either the speedy deletion tag ("db-bio") or the speeedy deletion criteria "[[<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a>]]". The educated editor will understand either. I prefer the latter formulation, because the uneducated editor (the usual creator of articles deserving speedy deletion) can just click on your deletion summary and see the criteria under which it was deleted. I can't prove that this helps, but I think that it does. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 04:35, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not a problem. It was my fault, I think, in that I'd updated DYK at the same time as someone else did last night (my time) and with at least one ineligible item, so ALoan and NishKid were left having to roll back my goofs - and they may just have rolled back too far. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 03:18, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, I've moved your question to the bottom of the page, as that's where new discussion is normally meant to go. I've also added your username as you hadn't signed it - just press the ~ key four times in future, and Robert will be the husband of your mother's sister, as they say.</dd>
<dd>Turning now to the article in question, when I came upon it there were two Speedy Deletion tags on it. The first said that it was "blatant advertising" (what we call "db-spam" in shorthand). The second said that it did not meet the criteria for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> as it related to websites and web-based things ("db-web", in Wikipediaspeak). While I marked the page as "spam" when I delivered it, I'd actually argue that it was more just a "db-web" case. There was no attempt made to back up the assertions of notability - such as they were - in the article. Additionally, and this is why I marked it as "spam" when I deleted it, the tone was very promotional. I'm sure it's a great initiative, but it felt as though it was an ad, rather than an article.</dd>
<dd>In terms of the other inputs you've cited, that really isn't a persuasive argument. Just because those two companies have articles doesn't mean that this particular one needs to have one. Indeed, it may well mean that those two articles shouldn't be here in the first place. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:54, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>regarding the tone, well sorry for that. I will change that asap, if reinstated.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is working well when people want to promote independent content online, without the use of YouTube in Australia, Its really the first and only Online TV website out there.</p>
<p>This gave a run down on the technologies, the limitations, the contract and legal challenges.</p>
<p>Regarding notability what more can i use, i would be happy to add these. I guess this was a living article and it was intended to grow. The intiative also is different as it has multiple relegious, non relgious, sports, computers, and other content for users..</p>

<dd>Therein lies my point, you're trying to "promote" the topic. Wikipedia, being an encyclopedia, is not about the promotion of things which will develop into more successful things, but rather the documentation of things which already are successful. What we'd need is multiple, non-trivial, independent mentions of the service. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:15, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have any extra tools to do it that I can see. Probably the solution would be to create Category: NewName, add all the articles in Cat: OldName to it (let's hope there aren't zillions of them!) and then put Cat: OldName up for deletion (either empty, having removed everything from it, or as being superseded by NewName).

<dd>I'd suggest that you'd be well-advised to run it by me (and maybe another admin as well, just for another opinion). That way we can see what we're dealing with and go from there. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How do I run it by you first without creating another article? Email you the Word document? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaleopold_ef11.html" title="User:Maleopold">Maleopold</a> 20:21, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
