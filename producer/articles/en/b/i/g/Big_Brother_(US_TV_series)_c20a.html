<p><i><b>Big Brother</b></i> is a <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality_television.html" title="Reality television">reality show</a> in which a number of strangers live in an isolated house and compete to win a cash prize. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> version of <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28TV_series%29_c8a7.html" title="Big Brother (TV series)">Big Brother</a></i> has aired on <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> every summer since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_in_television.html" title="2000 in television">2000</a>. The series is taken from <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol.html" title="Endemol">Endemol</a>'s popular <i>Big Brother</i> format, and is produced by <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol.html" title="Endemol">Endemol</a> USA. The show is executively-produced by Alison Grodner &amp; Rich Meehan. <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Shapiro_f0f5.html" title="Arnold Shapiro">Arnold Shapiro</a> (who formerly produced <i><a href="../../../r/e/s/Rescue_911.html" title="Rescue 911">Rescue 911</a></i>) stepped down as executive producer following <i>All-Stars</i> and now serves as executive consultant.</p>
<p>Since its <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_2_d734.html" title="Big Brother USA season 2">second season</a>, the American <i>Big Brother</i> continues to use different rules from other countries' versions of the show. In the U.S. version, viewers do not vote for eviction; all voting is done by houseguests. There have been seven complete seasons of the U.S. version of the show; all have been broadcast on <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>.</p>
<p>For all seasons, the eviction-night is hosted by <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie_Chen_0105.html" title="Julie Chen">Julie Chen</a>, wife of <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> President <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Moonves_6ecd.html" title="Les Moonves">Les Moonves</a> and co-host of the network's <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Early_Show_5f3a.html" title="The Early Show">The Early Show</a></i>. In the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_1_3e05.html" title="Big Brother USA season 1">first season</a> (2000), Chen was widely ridiculed in the media for her wooden delivery, stilted interaction with the studio audience, weak interviews with evictees on the live programs, and her overuse of the phrase <i>"But first..."</i> This led fans to affectionately dub her "the Chenbot", a moniker which Chen is aware of and readily accepts. The continuity announcer for the first five seasons was <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Proctor_f8bf.html" title="Phil Proctor">Phil Proctor</a>. He played an active role in the first season introducing every scene, but with the major changes to the program after the initial series, he was relegated to the opening and closing of each episode. For <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_6_b6fb.html" title="Big Brother USA season 6">season six</a>, Proctor was replaced by Clayton Halsey. This decision was made so late that Proctor had already toured the new set.</p>
<p>The weekly live show was substantially changed after the first season. Originally, the live show featured a studio audience along with guest commentators Dr. <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Pinsky_c4bc.html" title="Drew Pinsky">Drew Pinsky</a>, best known for <i><a href="../../../l/o/v/Loveline.html" title="Loveline">Loveline</a></i> on <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>, and (sponsor) <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_Online_d3b0.html" title="America Online">America Online</a> "Internet Advisor" Regina Lewis. Julie Chen now presents the live eviction show from an empty studio overlooking the entrance to the house.</p>

<p>Ever since the show began, Big Brother has had a central twist every season. Here they are:</p>
<p>-<b>Season 1</b>: The whole premise of the show (America watching in on a group of people).</p>
<p>-<b>Season 2</b>: HOH (See Below) nominates 2 houseguests. Houseguests vote for eviction.</p>
<p>-<b>Season 3</b>: The Power of Veto (See Below).</p>
<p>-<b>Season 4</b>: <i>The X-Factor</i> - 5 houseguests are joined by their ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends.</p>
<p>-<b>Season 5</b>: <i>Project DNA: Do Not Assume</i> - Set of twins in the house and two other houseguests find out that they are related.</p>
<p>-<b>Season 6</b>: <i>The Summer of Secrets</i> - Each houseguest has a secret partner. If a set of partners makes it to the Final 2, the winner gets $1,000,000 and the runner up gets $250,000.</p>
<p>-<b>Season 7</b>: <i>All Stars</i> - 14 former houseguests get to play the game again.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28US_TV_series%29_c20a.html" title="Edit section: Competitions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Competitions</span></h2>
<p>Competitions have been part of the show since every season, and the houseguests must compete together, against each other, or in teams to win them. The competitions in American <i>Big Brother</i> are:</p>
<p><a name="HoH_.28Head_of_Household.29" id="HoH_.28Head_of_Household.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28US_TV_series%29_c20a.html" title="Edit section: HoH (Head of Household)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">HoH (Head of Household)</span></h3>
<p>Every week, after the live eviction (except when the first HoH is crowned) the houseguests compete in the Head of Household competition. The HoH gets to nominate two people for eviction, and also gets their own private bedroom, things from home, and laundry service. The current HoH is not eligible to compete in the following HoH competition except for the final HoH competition when there are only three houseguests. In the first week of season seven, there were 2 HoHs. In this case, if both HoHs, when deciding for nominees to go up for eviction cannot come to a decision, both HoHs will become nominated, and there will be no HoH until the next live broadcast. This did not happen.</p>
<p>The HoH contests usually are one of three kinds of competitions. There are endurance contests to find which houseguests can last the longest doing a certain task, such holding a light switch in or hanging on to a key. These usually take place in the opening HoH competition, at some point during the midway point of a season, and in the first part of a three part competition to find the last HoH of a season.</p>
<p>There are also quiz contests, moderated by host Julie Chen, designed to find the new HoH before the end of the eviction show hour, and usually last a few minutes. The quizzes usually eliminate players after a wrong answer, unless everyone in a respective round answers incorrectly. Due to time restraints, there can also be a tiebreaker question after a certain amount of questions have been asked to find a winner. Quizzes are also usually held, at least once during the season, to find a person that can answer the most questions correctly, with a tiebreaker question breaking any equal scores.</p>
<p>Finally, there are competitions that usually require some kind of skill houseguests are allowed to practice in a given time period beforehand. For instance, there was a competition in season three that was a combination of bocce ball and golf to find someone getting a bocce ball closest to a large, golf-like hole without going in the hole or a gutter at the end of the green. Whoever did their skill the best would win HoH.</p>
<p>When the number of houseguests are reduced to three in a given season, the HoH competition is always a three part affair. The first part is usually an endurance competition, requiring a houseguest to hang on to their key in the face of some unusual circumstance (in season two, on a waterbed; season three, during a fake thunderstorm; season 4, during a "blizzard"; season 5, during an "earthquake"; season 6, a large safe's spinning dial; and season 7, on a volcano) with the last person to hang on winning that stage, and advancing to the final stage. The two people who lost move on to the second part, usually a contest requiring the houseguest to answer what occurred during the season.</p>
<p>The winner of those two parts move on to the third part, which usually is a guessing game as to what the departed houseguests thought of those remaining. Whoever wins the final part becomes the last HoH, and is the sole decider as to which of the two remaining houseguest leaves the game, and which moves on to the final vote to determine the season winner.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28US_TV_series%29_c20a.html" title="Edit section: Nominations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nominations</span></h3>
<p>One of the tasks of being the Head Of Household (HOH) is that they must selct two houseguests to put up on the nomination block. The two houseguests fight for the Power of Veto (POV) (as explained in the POV section) so they can remove themselves. After the POV ceremony is over, and the new houseguest is put on the block, the remaining houseguests (excluding the HOH and nominees) must vote to evict one nominee, with the HOH only voting to break a tie. Many houseguests have been nominated, some multiple times. However, there are the few who have managed to escape the nomination block. So far, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a> has been nominated the most times (over two seasons) with 9. Amy Crews has been nominated the most times in a single season, 6.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Guy_eb4e.html" title="Jason Guy">Jason Guy</a> remains the only houseguest to never be nominated or expelled.</p>
<p><a name="The_food_competition" id="The_food_competition"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28US_TV_series%29_c20a.html" title="Edit section: The food competition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The food competition</span></h3>
<p>In some weeks during the season (but not all weeks, the latter half of season six went without a food competition, and only had five total) the houseguests compete together (Or against each other) in the food competition. If a team or certain people win the competition, the houseguests win a variety of food for the week, or a given day. If they lose, they must live on Peanut Butter and Jelly, condiments, milk, and water for the week, or that given day, depending on the rules of that respective competition. In Big Brother All-Stars, the food the losing team must eat has been changed from peanut butter and jelly to "Big Brother slop" which is a thick, oatmeal-like substance. Due to his giving away food privileges for the rest of the season to win power of veto, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boswell_7d09.html" title="George Boswell">George Boswell</a> holds the record for most days on slop.</p>
<p>On occasion, the house is split up into teams for the food competition, however. Whichever team wins gets the food, whichever team loses lives on peanut butter and jelly for the week. Two exceptions to this rule have happened in season six were if a houseguest has a PB&amp;J Pass, which allows them to eat food regardless of the outcome of a competition, passes have been transferable, adding to game strategy. But in Big Brother All-Stars the losers of food competitions would have to eat Big Brother slop and not normally PB&amp;Js.</p>

<p>In Season 3, a new rule was introduced. Each week until the number of housguests was reduced to five (for the third season only), the houseguests would compete for the power of veto. If they won, they could save a nominee from nomination, forcing the HoH to nominate someone else (The Power of Veto winner was safe either way). Originally, if a nominee won the power of veto, they could not use it on themselves, but this changed in the last veto competition in season 3. From then onward, Big Brother USA has used "The Golden Power of Veto." It allows the holder to veto any single nomination including his/her own. One exception, the last veto competition in season 4 introduced the "Diamond Power of Veto." It allowed the holder to name his/her successor. It has not surfaced since. Starting in the fifth season, only six contestants could compete for the Power of Veto, which enabled a new strategy, the backdoor nomination. Season 7 limited this practice by adding a semi-random selection the competitors after the HoH and nominees. So far, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a> has won the most POV challenges with 7 and has been saved the most times with 6.</p>

<p>The Luxury Competitions have always been a special treat for the houseguests, and have always given them some kind of Luxury. Almost always, the first Luxury competition has been the chance to unlock the Hot Tub (The hot tub was unlocked by Rachel on <i>Big Brother 6</i> as a twist). In recent seasons, luxury competitions have almost entirely been eliminated except for the first one, in which the hot tub is rewarded. However, in Big Brother All-Stars, the houseguests were given the hot tub and did not need to compete to earn it.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28US_TV_series%29_c20a.html" title="Edit section: America's Choice">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">America's Choice</span></h3>
<p>America's Choice offers the viewing public to select a houseguest to receive a special opportunity not available to other houseguests; voting is done through the CBS website. Though houseguests do not actively compete for the reward, it is essentially a reward based on viewers' opinions of the houseguests. America's Choice contests typically begin midway through a season and new contests are repeated weekly through the end of the season. Previous contests have allowed houseguests to make a mobile phone call to family, to have a walk-on role for a CBS soap opera, and to conduct an internet chat with fans. In Season 6, the first America's Choice contest was to vote back into the house a previously evicted houseguest; voting for this contest was expanded to include text message voting. The America's Choice Question is not always a choice between contestants to earn a special opportunity. America's Choice Questions have also been a choice of what challenge would be played, and what kind of appliances would be given to the houseguests.</p>

<p>The following are some of the most notable events including records, for seasons one through seven.</p>
<ul>
<li>As of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_20.html" title="July 20">July 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_television.html" title="2006 in television">2006</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danielle_Reyes_2df8.html" title="Danielle Reyes">Danielle Reyes</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Kirby_f70e.html" title="Will Kirby">Will Kirby</a> attained one hundred days in the Big Brother house between their respective original seasons along with the All Star season. Since then, "Chicken" <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boswell_7d09.html" title="George Boswell">George Boswell</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Henry_5339.html" title="Diane Henry">Diane Henry</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcellas_Reynolds_c9d9.html" title="Marcellas Reynolds">Marcellas Reynolds</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erika_Landin_b9f5.html" title="Erika Landin">Erika Landin</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howie_Gordon_8bce.html" title="Howie Gordon">Howie Gordon</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Rhine_2728.html" title="James Rhine">James Rhine</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Malin_9405.html" title="Mike Malin">Mike Malin</a> have attained the 100-day mark as well. Fellow BB7 All Stars houseguests <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_Irwin_a53f.html" title="Alison Irwin">Alison Irwin</a> &amp; Jennifer "Nakomis" Dedmon barely missed the mark when Alison was evicted first in BB7 after just 11 days, and Jennifer 2nd after 18 days, bringing both their totals to 93 days. Should either of them have survived their respective evictions, they would have both obtained 100 days.</li>
<li>Will Kirby holds the most days playing the game with 147, followed by Janelle Pierzina with 143, Danielle Reyes with 142, Erika Landin with 140 and George Boswell with 138 days.</li>
<li>By the end of the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_7_3dc8.html" title="Big Brother USA season 7">seventh season</a> of <i>Big Brother</i>, there have been a total of 75 different houseguests to play the game, with no new houseguests in season seven. Of those 75, there will have been at least 74 evictions for 63 different houseguests. Seven occurred in the first season to reduce ten houseguests to a final three, the only season concluding with three finalists. In Season 2, twelve houseguests were reduced to a final two, a formula that has been used ever since. However, due to the expulsion of <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Sebik_69ce.html" title="Justin Sebik">Justin Sebik</a>, there were only nine evictions. In Season 3, twelve houseguests were reduced to two, but one houseguest, <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Crews_ca59.html" title="Amy Crews">Amy Crews</a>, was evicted on two occasions, making for a total of eleven evictions. In Season 4, thirteen houseguests began the game, but there were only ten evictions due to Scott Weintraub's expulsion. The fifth season of the series began with thirteen houseguests, and added a fourteenth, Natalie, with the "twin twist" playing itself out. That led to twelve evictions. In the sixth season, there were 13 evictions for 12 people, with Kaysar being evicted twice. The seventh season began with 14 houseguests, with only Danielle, Will, and Alison not having been evicted in their respective previous season. All three of them were evicted during the season.</li>
<li>As of the end of the seventh season, 10 finalists have made it to the end of the season without eviction. The five of the seven winners: Eddie McDee, Lisa Donaheu, Jun Sung, Drew Daniel, Maggie Ausburn and five of the eight runners-up (two from season one): Josh Suoza, Curtis Kin, Nicole Safforich-Nilson, Michael "Cowboy" Ellis, Ivette Corredero.</li>
<li>Only Amy Crews in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_3_310a.html" title="Big Brother USA season 3">season three</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kaysar_Ridha_9010.html" title="Kaysar Ridha">Kaysar Ridha</a> in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_6_b6fb.html" title="Big Brother USA season 6">season six</a> were allowed to re-enter the house with a second chance to win their season's contest. Unfortunately for both, neither one won their respective season, as Amy re-entered Week 6, and was evicted Week 10, and Kaysar re-entered Week 5, but was evicted Week 6. In the fifth week of season seven, Kaysar was evicted a third time, making him the only houseguest evicted three times, taking him two seasons to accomplish the feat.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Vasquez_cc38.html" title="Jennifer Vasquez">Jennifer Vasquez</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beau_Beasley_a164.html" title="Beau Beasley">Beau Beasley</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvin_Latimer_a647.html" title="Marvin Latimer">Marvin Latimer</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howie_Gordon_8bce.html" title="Howie Gordon">Howie Gordon</a> and Monica Bailey are the only five Big Brother contestants who were evicted during pre-taped episodes. Howie, Jennifer, Beau and Marvin all left the house during double eviction weeks, in which the eviction was pre-taped 24 hours in advance. As for Monica, the eviction scheduled to take place on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">September 13</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> was pre-empted by the terrorist attacks of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">September 11</a>. Her eviction instead took place on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_15.html" title="September 15">September 15</a> and was aired on television on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">September 18</a>. Howie was evicted live during season 6 and pre-taped during season 7.</li>
<li>When Michael Donnellan and Eric Littmann were evicted second and third, respectively, in the sixth season, it marked the first time in <i>Big Brother</i> that two men had been evicted so quickly. In previous years, the first three out always included at least two women.</li>
<li>The oldest houseguest in <i>Big Brother</i> history was Jack Owens, a retired FBI agent, who played in the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_4_dd5f.html" title="Big Brother USA season 4">fourth season</a> at age 58. The youngest was 19 year-old Michelle Maradie, the ex-girlfriend of fellow houseguest David Lane, also in the fourth season. Michelle will most likely hold this record, since the minimum age to become a houseguest has since been raised to 21.</li>
<li>The most times a player has been nominated at some point during the game is nine. Janelle Pierzina of seasons 6 and 7 was nominated by Eric, Maggie, Ivette, April and Jennifer during season 6 and by Mike (x2), Danielle, and Erika in season 7.</li>
<li>The most times a player has been nominated in the course of one season is Amy Crews, who was nominated six times (by Lisa, Roddy, Danielle, Marcellas, and twice by Jason) during season three.</li>
<li>The most times a player has won an eviction vote (in other words, nominated, not vetoed off, but not the one evicted) is currently five. Curtis Kin was the first to do this, going 5-0 in season one before finishing third. (Fellow housemate <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_McGee_4aef.html" title="Eddie McGee">Eddie McGee</a> went four straight weeks marked for banishment and won each vote, still a record mark.)</li>
<li>The mark for the most times a player has won an eviction vote in multiple seasons is seven, held by <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erika_Landin_b9f5.html" title="Erika Landin">Erika Landin</a>, her only loss coming in the round of four in season four.</li>
<li>The record for the most times a player has won the Power of Veto contest is currently held by Janelle Pierzina, of seasons 6 and 7, with 7. Janelle won the Veto twice in season 6 and five times in season seven.</li>
<li>The record for the most times that a houseguest has been saved by the Power of Veto is six. <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a> was saved by herself and by April Lewis during season 6. She saved herself four times during season seven.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a> holds the record for winning the most Head of Household (HoH) contests in the span of two seasons, and tying Drew Daniel with the most HoHs won in a single season. She won three HoH competitions in the sixth season. During the seventh season, she won four HoH competitions, for a grand total of seven. Janelle's first three HoH weeks of season 7 came within the season's first six weeks, making her the fastest houseguest to win not only two HoHs (in four weeks), but the fastest to three HoH wins (in six weeks).</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Daniel_8c67.html" title="Drew Daniel">Drew Daniel</a> (during season 5) and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a> (during season 7) tie the record for winning the most Head of Household (HoH) contests, with a total of four.</li>
<li>The record for most total individual contests (HoH, POV, and America's Choice; not including Luxury and Food Competitions, which are for the most part group efforts) won by one person is held by <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a> with eighteen. She won seven in season six (three HoHs, two POVs, and two America's Choices), and eleven more in season seven (one shared HoH, three solo HoH, five POVs, and two America's Choice). The eleven in season 7 and the eighteen overall are both the most won by any person.</li>
<li>The first Head Of Household in season seven wasn't one person, but two co-holders. Jase Wirey and Janelle Pierzina were the co-winners of the HoH title in the first round of the season, and had to agree on who to nominate. Had they failed, they both would have been nominated and stripped of their duties. Had a tie occurred in the voting to evict, Janelle would have been the tie-breaking vote due to her veto win.</li>
<li>In the sixth week of season seven, there were also two Head Of Households, but instead of the two sharing power, one merely replaced the other. It appeared to the CBS TV audience watching the Big Brother live show on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_10.html" title="August 10">August 10</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> that <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erika_Landin_b9f5.html" title="Erika Landin">Erika Landin</a> had won Head Of Household, but during the contest, Howie Gordon had openly complained that there was a technical glitch with his signaling device that didn't allow his answer to be shown. The contest continued, with Landin outlasting <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Rhine_2728.html" title="James Rhine">James Rhine</a>. Later that night, the producers decided to strip Landin due to the technical glitches, and another contest was held, won by <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a>.</li>
<li>With houseguests being brought back into the house, many marks were set in the opening weeks of the all-star season for feats in multiple seasons. <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a> became, along with Jase Wirey, the first HoHs of multiple seasons. Janelle also became the first POV holder and multi-time HoH holder in multiple seasons, completing all of these feats within the first 25 days of season seven. <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_Irwin_a53f.html" title="Alison Irwin">Alison Irwin</a> was the first houseguest nominated in different seasons, but it wasn't until Jennifer "Nakomis" Dedmon, the season's second eviction, until someone had been evicted in two different seasons. With the third eviction of season seven, Jase Wirey holds the dubious mark of missing the jury or being a finalist (by making the final nine) in his first season, season five, and missing the jury again in season seven. With his 12th and 10th place finishes, respectively, Jase is also the first player in show history to score double-digit finishes (tenth or worse) in two different seasons. In week four, <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Henry_5339.html" title="Diane Henry">Diane Henry</a> was nominated for a second time, making her the first houseguest to be nominated more than once in multiple seasons. In week five, Janelle Pierzina added to her long list of feats in Big Brother USA by winning the Power Of Veto a second time, making her the first multi-holder of the POV in two seasons. At the end of the week, <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kaysar_Ridha_9010.html" title="Kaysar Ridha">Kaysar Ridha</a> duplicated Wirey's feat of missing the jury in both their respective season and the all-star season. Ridha was also the first houseguest to miss the jury by one spot in both seasons, the first houseguest to finish in the same position each season (tenth in season six and seven), and the first houseguest in season seven who didn't finish worse than their respective original season. On Day 47, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howie_Gordon_8bce.html" title="Howie Gordon">Howie Gordon</a> was evicted, making him the first sequestered juror in multiple seasons.</li>
<li>As well as houseguests doing things in two different seasons, houseguests have also done things in the all-star season seven that they didn't do in the previous season they had appeared in. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danielle_Reyes_2df8.html" title="Danielle Reyes">Danielle Reyes</a> was formally nominated in the first week, something she didn't officially face in her season, season three. <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_Irwin_a53f.html" title="Alison Irwin">Alison Irwin</a> not only faced the possibility of being evicted for the first time (having been vetoed off the three times she was "on the block"), but was evicted, two things that didn't happen to her in season four. "Chicken" George Boswell and Mike "Boogie" Malin have each won Power Of Veto contests, something they couldn't have done in their seasons because such competitions didn't start taking place until season three. Then, on Day 46, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boswell_7d09.html" title="George Boswell">George Boswell</a> won Head of Household, something Boswell couldn't have done in season one there was no Head of Household - the Head of Household did not debut until season two. Also on that night, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcellas_Reynolds_c9d9.html" title="Marcellas Reynolds">Marcellas Reynolds</a> became the first member of season seven's sequestered jury. Reynolds had a vote into who won the third season, but the sequestering of juries didn't begin until season four. <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Kirby_f70e.html" title="Will Kirby">Will Kirby</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danielle_Reyes_2df8.html" title="Danielle Reyes">Danielle Reyes</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Boswell_7d09.html" title="George Boswell">George Boswell</a> will also be serving on the Big Brother jury for the first time, with Danielle and Will getting their first evictions ever on Days 60 and 65 respectively. <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Kirby_f70e.html" title="Will Kirby">Will Kirby</a> has also lost the game for the first time ever.</li>
<li>In the All-Star season, the 3 players who did not do better or worse were Janelle, George and James. Kaysar also shares this feat, but he was evicted twice in season 6.</li>
<li>Mike "Boogie" Malin was the first ever winner of two different contests. In the very first week of season two, he captured the first ever Head Of Household. In week six of season seven, the Coup D'Etat was introduced, also won by Malin, a returning houseguest for the all-star season.</li>
<li>The most lopsided eviction occurred during the first week of the fifth season. In that round, Jennifer Dedmon and Mike Lubinski were nominated for eviction, with Mike being voted out, 10-0. The fourth season could have tied this record, but because contestant Scott was expelled before voting day, houseguest Amanda was evicted 9-0. Lubinski is also the only player to be the oldest in his or her season to be evicted first in the game's seven seasons.</li>
<li>The most lopsided final vote occurred during the third season between finalists <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danielle_Reyes_2df8.html" title="Danielle Reyes">Danielle Reyes</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Donahue_671a.html" title="Lisa Donahue">Lisa Donahue</a>. With all evicted houseguests able to compete in the final vote, Lisa won the one-sided final vote 9-1, with only Jason Guy voting Danielle to win the third season. The most lopsided vote with the jury format occurred during the fourth season between Alison Irwin and Jun Song. Jun won the game 6-1, with only Nathan Marlow voting for Alison to win.</li>
<li>The closest final vote was a one vote margin, which has occurred twice. Drew Daniel was the first to win by a one-vote margin when he defeated Michael "Cowboy" Ellis 4-3 to end Season 5. One season later, Maggie Ausburn defeated <a href="../../../i/v/e/Ivette_Corredero_0791.html" title="Ivette Corredero">Ivette Corredero</a> by the same 4-3 vote to win season six.</li>
<li>Only Danielle Reyes and <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Guy_eb4e.html" title="Jason Guy">Jason Guy</a>, each from Season 3, went the entire season without being nominated in a nomination ceremony. But neither Danielle nor Jason won season three, finishing second and third, respectively, to winner Lisa Donahue. However, when Danielle re-entered the house for season seven, she was placed up as a nominee in the very first round of nominations, leaving Jason as the only houseguest in the show's history never to have been nominated or marked for banishment (as it was called in the first season). Danielle eventually finished sixth, being evicted on Day 60 of season seven.</li>
<li>Only <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_Irwin_a53f.html" title="Alison Irwin">Alison Irwin</a> of Season 4 and Drew Daniel of Season 5 have gone their entire season without facing the possibility of eviction after nominations and Veto were done. However, when Alison re-entered the house for the seventh season, she was nominated, not saved by the Power of Veto, and was evicted, making Drew the only person to not face the possibility of eviction after nominations and Veto.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Kirby_f70e.html" title="Will Kirby">Will Kirby</a>, the season two winner, holds the distinction of being the only winner that has never won any Head of Households or Vetos. Michael Ellis also made it to the last day of season five without being HoH (he won a Veto, though), but lost the final vote to Drew Daniel.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_6_b6fb.html" title="Big Brother USA season 6">Big Brother 6</a> holds the record for going longest without a double Head of Household win by any of the contestants with nine consecutive times, starting at the beginning of the game. Rachel Plencner, Eric Littman, Kaysar Ridha, Maggie Ausburn, Howie Gordon, Jennifer Vasquez, Janelle Pierzina, Beau Beasley, and <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Lewis_74c8.html" title="April Lewis">April Lewis</a> all won HoH before Howie became a repeat winner.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_6_b6fb.html" title="Big Brother USA season 6">Big Brother 6</a> also holds the record for having the most number of different contestants who became HoH at some point, with a total of ten. Those ten are the nine HoH mentioned above (Rachel, Eric, Kaysar, Maggie, Howie, Jennifer, Janelle, Beau, and April), as well as <a href="../../../i/v/e/Ivette_Corredero_0791.html" title="Ivette Corredero">Ivette Corredero</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Rhine_2728.html" title="James Rhine">James Rhine</a> was not one of them, but he would eventually become HoH for the first time in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_7_3dc8.html" title="Big Brother USA season 7">Big Brother All-Stars</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_5_8cb9.html" title="Big Brother USA season 5">Big Brother 5</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_2_d734.html" title="Big Brother USA season 2">Big Brother 2</a> on the other hand, had the least number of unique Heads of Household. Only Jase, Marvin, Drew, Diane, Nakomis and Adria served as the Head of Household throughout season 5, and only Mike, Krista, Hardy, Kent, Nicole and Monica throughout season 2.</li>
<li>The most people on the block in any one round in <i>Big Brother</i> history was six. In the fourth round of the first season of <i>Big Brother</i>, <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_McGee_4aef.html" title="Eddie McGee">Eddie McGee</a>, Josh Souza, Curtis Kin, Cassandra Waldon, George Boswell, and Brittany Petros were all nominated, with Petros being evicted. Since the rules changed when <i>Big Brother 2</i> began in 2001, this is unlikely to be duplicated.</li>
<li>Season 6 was the first to have four females in the final four. After Howie Gordon's eviction, four females remained in the game: <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a>, <a href="../../../i/v/e/Ivette_Corredero_0791.html" title="Ivette Corredero">Ivette Corredero</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_Lewis_74c8.html" title="April Lewis">April Lewis</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/g/Maggie_Ausburn_d4d9.html" title="Maggie Ausburn">Maggie Ausburn</a>. It was also the first time that there had been an all same sex final four in Big Brother America history. The first season of the series was also the first one have an all same sex final three, which was three males.</li>
<li>In each complete season since the format change, six houseguests per season were evicted in a unanimous decision. Autumn, Shannon, Kent, Krista, Hardy and Monica in season 2, Amy (twice), Josh, Gerry, Roddy, and Jason in season 3, Amanda, Dana, Nathan, Jee, Erika and Robert in season 4, Mike, Adria, Marvin, Karen, Nakomis and Diane in season 5, and Kaysar, Rachel, James, Beau, April and Janelle in season 6 were all evicted without opposition. Season 7 continued this pattern. Jase, Marcellas, Danielle, George, Will and Janelle have been unanimously evicted.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Donahue_671a.html" title="Lisa Donahue">Lisa Donahue</a> of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_3_310a.html" title="Big Brother USA season 3">season 3</a> is the only houseguest to win the first HoH Competition and be the winner of the season. All other first HoH'S (Mike, Nathan, Jase, and Rachel, Janelle), were all evicted at some point or another.</li>
<li>Going into season seven, none of the original group of nominees up for eviction has ever won their season. Nicole Saffarich-Nilson came the closest to winning after defeating Sheryl Braxton in the opening vote to stay in the house, and stayed in until the final night, losing the final vote to Will Kirby.</li>
<li>The CBS broadcast on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_21.html" title="June 21">June 21</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_television.html" title="2006 in television">2006</a> to introduce the 20 houseguests the audience voted for in six of the twelve positions was notable for two reasons. It was the first time a <i>Big Brother</i> show had aired on the network in June, and that it was the first time in <i>Big Brother USA</i> history that an episode didn't have houseguests in the <i>Big Brother</i> house in some form.</li>
<li>Currently, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a> is in the lead in every category. She has won the most HOH challenges with 7, the most POV challenges with 7, and the most America's Choices with 5. She has also been saved the most amount of times with the POV with a total of 6, five of which were by herself.</li>
<li>During season 7, there have been three separate occasions in which three Heads of Household reigned over a period of less than 6 hours. The first occasion occurred when Janelle and Jase finished their co-HoH reign on day 11, with Kaysar assuming the role thereafter. The second occasion was on day 39. Danielle finished her HoH reign on this day, handing over the key to Erika after she won the HoH competition. However, when the competition was deemed to be faulty, Janelle took the reins. Finally, on day 60, Erika finished her reign as HoH, after which Janelle assumed the reins. However, Janelle's reign was extremely brief as it was a double eviction night. Later that evening, Mike took the reins as the third HoH of the day.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/n/Janelle_Pierzina_a458.html" title="Janelle Pierzina">Janelle Pierzina</a> and Nicole Nilson-Schaffrich are the only houseguests who have ever hosted a Head of Household competition.</li>
<li>On two occasions did a house guest win HoH twice in a row. The first being <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Daniel_8c67.html" title="Drew Daniel">Drew Daniel</a> in Season Five, and the second being <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Malin_9405.html" title="Mike Malin">Mike Malin</a> in Season Seven. Both occurred in the Final Three, the only occasion where the previous HoH can compete for the power.</li>
<li>Since the current final HoH format debuted (in season 2), <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Malin_9405.html" title="Mike Malin">Mike Malin</a> is the first person to have not won part 1 of the final HoH Competition, but won the competition overall. Past final HoHs (Lisa, Alison, Drew and Ivette) all won part one of the competition.</li>
<li>The most times the Power of Veto has been used in one season is 9 times during season 7. It was used by Janelle on four occasions, and once each by George, Mike, Danielle, James and Erika. All of these uses of the Veto were to save themselves, marking the first season since the PoV debut that the Veto has not been used by one person to save another.</li>
<li>Janelle Pierzina and April Lewis are the only HoHs who have changed their own nominations through the use of the Power of Veto. Janelle initially nominated Maggie and Jennifer for eviction in season 6, won the Power of Veto, saved Maggie, and nominated Ivette in her place. April initially nominated Janelle and Howie for eviction, won the Power of Veto, saved Janelle, and nominated James in her place.</li>
<li>A number of seasons have had tags go along with the title, such as "Big Brother 4: The X Factor", "Big Brother 5: Do Not Assume", "Big Brother 6: Summer of Secrets" and most notably "Big Brother 7: All-Stars".</li>

<p>A 9-disc set from the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_USA_season_3_310a.html" title="Big Brother USA season 3">third season</a> of the show, in its entirety as well as edits, have been released on Region 1 DVD. A supplementary included is the house guests' original casting tapes. These casting tapes are taken from preliminary interviews rather than the tapes that the house guests sent in.</p>
<p>A 2-disc Highlights set from the fourth season has also been released.</p>
<p>On the third season discs, the episodes were taken from tapes aired on CBS, and not from unedited versions, meaning that curse words spoken on the show, and nudity seen, was still beeped and blurred out, respectively. With the release of the fourth season highlights, it was announced that the clips would show unaired footage, ostensibly racier than what CBS would allow to air.</p>
<p>It doesn't appear that any other seasons of the show will be released on DVD. It has been reported that Jase from season 5 appeared on "House Calls" and said that CBS doesn't want to release the sets because there are too many episodes in each season.</p>

<p>The first season of <i>Big Brother</i> had such a completely different format it cannot be considered the same show as the seasons that would follow it. In the first season, similar to the international formats of the show, the format was more of a social experiment meant for viewers at home to observe. The contestants had little power over each other since the home audience decided their fate, so it was up to them to create drama on their own. Ironically, the two most controversial contestants on the season, Will and Jordan, were the first two to be eliminated. This meant that the remaining players, for the most part, got along with each other, leaving little conflict to be witnessed by viewers.</p>
<p>Producers did their best to spice up the show with gimmicks such as a huge domino set for the players to fiddle with as well as adding barnyard animals to the house's backyard. These tactics seem downright mundane compared to the overly dramatic antics that would befall later seasons (including, but not limited to, a contestant nearly slicing the throat of another contestant) and did little to improve the show's <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nielsen_Ratings_70fa.html" title="Nielsen Ratings">ratings</a>. Initially hyped as the perfect companion series to the surging <i><a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor_%28TV_series%29_7392.html" title="Survivor (TV series)">Survivor</a></i>, which had premiered just a few weeks before, viewers soon tired of the boring antics of the show. However ratings perked up enough by the finale, especially among younger viewers, that the show was renewed the following summer. Beginning with <i>Big Brother 2</i>, CBS completely replaced the creative team behind the show and turned it into the <i>Survivor</i>-esque game that is played today.</p>
