<p>Big Boss' original backstory establishes him as a professional mercenary whose military career dates back to his service with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Special_Forces_a603.html" title="United States Army Special Forces">Green Berets</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Range_Reconnaissance_Patrol_6e5c.html" title="Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol">LRRP</a> during the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. Following this, he served under the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Operations_Group_8aae.html" title="Special Operations Group">SOG</a> and the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_Geese_299f.html" title="Wild Geese">Wild Geese</a>, as well as the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Air_Service_a80c.html" title="Special Air Service">SAS</a> and the <a href="../../../g/s/g/GSG9_7db8.html" title="GSG9">GSG9</a>. He first became a mercenary during the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, participating in regional conflicts and race liberation wars, earning his fame as a legendary war hero among the press. He was later re-appointed as commander-in-chief of High-Tech Special Forces Unit <a href="../../../f/o/x/FOXHOUND_912d.html" title="FOXHOUND">FOXHOUND</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Big Boss first appears in the original <i><a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_%28video_game%29_d47d.html" title="Metal Gear (video game)">Metal Gear</a></i> as Solid Snake's commanding officer, and initially acts as a radio contact during his infiltration of <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_Heaven_0ee0.html" title="Outer Heaven">Outer Heaven</a>, providing Snake with information about mission objectives, as well as the usage of weapons and equipment.</p>
<p>However, near the end of the game, as Snake approaches the final base where <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_%28weapon%29_c96f.html" title="Metal Gear (weapon)">Metal Gear</a> is stored, Big Boss begins to give false advice, leading Snake into death traps instead. After finally destroying <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_%28weapon%29_c96f.html#Metal_Gear_TX-55" title="Metal Gear (weapon)">Metal Gear TX-55</a>, Big Boss confronts Snake on the escape route of the base, exposing himself as the leader of <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outer_Heaven_0ee0.html" title="Outer Heaven">Outer Heaven</a>. He reveals that Outer Heaven is actually a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_military_contractor.html" title="Private military contractor">private military contractor</a> which he established with the funds he amassed during his work as a mercenary, and that he was attempting to gain military superiority over the Western powers with the development of Metal Gear. Big Boss chose Solid Snake for the mission because, as his most inexperienced soldier, he believed that Snake would fail. His underestimation of Snake causes him to have to fight him himself, as the self-destruct mechanism of Outer Heaven is activated. Snake defeats Big Boss and leaves him for dead as the base is destroyed. After the ending credits, a message from Big Boss is displayed swearing revenge against Snake.</p>

<p>Big Boss returns in <i><a href="../../../s/o/l/Metal_Gear_2%7E_Solid_Snake_d3e5.html" title="Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></i>. He is revealed to have survived his battle with Snake in Outer Heaven, and has since taken control of another fortified nation in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a> - Zanzibar Land. This time, he establishes a military force along with his trusted lieutenant, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray_Fox_%28Metal_Gear%29_4bc0.html" title="Gray Fox (Metal Gear)">Gray Fox</a>, and commissions the development of a new Metal Gear model, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_%28weapon%29_c96f.html#Metal_Gear_D" title="Metal Gear (weapon)">Metal Gear D</a>. Big Boss' ambition is to create a world full of war where soldiers are always in demand.</p>
<p>After Solid Snake destroys Metal Gear and defeats Gray Fox, he confronts Big Boss once again while escaping from the Zanzibar Land detention camp. Having lost all of his weapons in his earlier battle with Fox, Snake is forced to improvise and create a makeshift flamethrower from an <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosol_can.html" title="Aerosol can">aerosol can</a> and a <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lighter.html" title="Lighter">lighter</a>. Ultimately, Big Boss is defeated and burned to death. As he dies, he gives an intruiging epitaph: "Whoever wins, our battle does not end. The loser is freed from the battlefield, but the winner must remain there. And the survivor must live his life as a warrior until he dies."</p>

<p>Though dead by the time <i><a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_Solid_5e39.html" title="Metal Gear Solid">Metal Gear Solid</a></i> takes place, Big Boss' legacy plays a major role in the over-arching plot of each subsequent game. His relationship with Solid Snake is <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retroactive_continuity.html" title="Retroactive continuity">retconned</a>: Big Boss is not just Solid Snake's biological father, but a DNA template from which Snake was cloned.</p>
<p>Both Solid Snake and his nemesis, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recurring_Metal_Gear_characters_1eee.html#Liquid_Snake" title="List of recurring Metal Gear characters">Liquid Snake</a>, are actually clones of Big Boss created in the 70s from a secret government experiement known as the <b>Les Enfants Terribles</b> project (<a href="../../../f/r/e/French_%28language%29.html" title="French (language)">French</a> for <i>The Terrible Children</i>, and a frequent nickname for particularly iconoclastic film directors). While recovering from a war injury, Big Boss' cell samples were extracted and then reproduced through <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloning.html" title="Cloning">analog cloning</a> and the <i>Super Baby</i> method. The cells were fertilized into an <a href="../../../o/v/u/Ovum.html" title="Ovum">ovum</a>, resulting in eight clone babies, and then planted into a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrogate_mother.html" title="Surrogate mother">surrogate mother</a>. Six of the babies (later revealed to had only been five) were then intentionally aborted to encourage strong fetal growth with the remaining two (Later found out to be three) clones: Solid and Liquid. Solid Snake was raised in the United States, while Liquid was adopted by the British government.</p>
<p>Following Big Boss' death, his body was recovered and used for <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_therapy.html" title="Gene therapy">gene therapy</a> experiments. Superior genetic traits known as "soldier <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene.html" title="Gene">genes</a>" were isolated from his cells and then planted into the members of the Next Generation Special Forces, <b>Genome Soldiers</b> which serve as Snake's most common foe in MGS1. The Genome Soldiers have augmented senses and reflexes, but suffer from genetic defects from flaws in their makeup. In order to cure the Genome Army from their defects, Liquid demanded Big Boss' remains as part of his ransom. Liquid and the Genome take over the Shadow Moses island base, establishing themselves as the <b>Sons of Big Boss</b>.</p>

Solidus Snake in <i>MGS2</i>, his appearance bears a striking resemblance to the aged Big Boss</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>By the end of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, it turned out that Solid and Liquid were not the only survivors of the Les Enfants Terribles project; A third clone, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Metal_Gear_Solid_2_characters_eeab.html#Solidus_Snake" title="List of Metal Gear Solid 2 characters">Solidus Snake</a>, lives on and had orchestrated the Shadow Moses incident behind the scenes. It is also revealed that Solidus was the President of the United States during the events of the original <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> (under the alias of George Sears), but had been disgraced in the aftermath of Shadow Moses and had since gone underground.</p>
<p>Solidus was later introduced as the main antagonist of <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Metal_Gear_Solid_2%7E_Sons_of_Liberty_a32c.html" title="Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></i>. Since he suffers from advanced cellular degeneration, Solidus looks much older than Solid and Liquid Snake and already resembles the aged Big Boss with his white hair and beard (there are several signs that Snake, too, is beginning to suffer from degeration, but at a slower rate). Solidus lost an eye during the course of the game and wore an eyepatch to conceal it soon afterward. However, unlike Big Boss, he lost his left eye rather than his right. As part of the <a href="../../../s/3/_/S3_Plan_424e.html" title="S3 Plan">S3 Plan</a>, Solidus Snake's relationship with the protagonist, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raiden_%28Metal_Gear%29_ce3a.html" title="Raiden (Metal Gear)">Raiden</a>, is meant to parallel the relationship between Solid Snake and Big Boss, as Raiden is Solidus Snake's foster son and mortal enemy<sup id="_ref-sol_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sol" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

Following up on the revelation that Big Boss is Solid Snake's father, the game reintroduces Big Boss as a young patriotic soldier codenamed <b>Jack</b>, a former Green Beret and the first field operative for the newly established FOX unit. In his youth, Jack was visually identical to Solid Snake, and was trained by a legendary soldier, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Metal_Gear_Solid_3_characters_34d4.html#The_Boss" title="List of Metal Gear Solid 3 characters">The Boss</a>, who taught him survival skills. The Boss also collaborated with Jack to invent <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_Quarters_Combat_e3e2.html" title="Close Quarters Combat">Close Quarters Combat</a>. In his inaugural mission as a FOX agent, the Virtuous Mission (August 24), Jack was assigned the codename of <b>Naked Snake</b> (echoing his relationship to the Boss, who once led a special forces team known as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Metal_Gear_Solid_3_characters_34d4.html" title="List of Metal Gear Solid 3 characters"><b>The Cobra Unit</b></a>). Snake's solo mission was to infiltrate the fictional Soviet region of <b>Tselinoyarsk</b> and extract a defecting Soviet scientist named <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Metal_Gear_Solid_3_characters_34d4.html#Nikolai_Stephanovich_Sokolov" title="List of Metal Gear Solid 3 characters">Sokolov</a>, who is being forced to design a new weapon called the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_%28weapon%29_c96f.html#Shagohod" title="Metal Gear (weapon)">Shagohod</a>. The mission went relatively smoothly until The Boss appeared and announced her defection, providing her new benefactor <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Metal_Gear_Solid_3_characters_34d4.html#Yevgeny_Borisovitch_Volgin" title="List of Metal Gear Solid 3 characters">Colonel Volgin</a> with two miniature nuclear shells ("Davy Crockett"). Sokolov was captured by the reformed Cobra Unit, and Snake was heavily injured in combat with The Boss.</p>
<p>A week after the failure of Virtuous Mission, Snake was sent out on a follow-up mission, "Operation Snake Eater." This time, his mission objectives were to infiltrate <a href="../../../s/n/a/Metal_Gear_Solid_3%7E_Snake_Eater_4db9.html" title="Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater">Groznyj Grad</a>, assassinate The Boss, Colonel Volgin, and destroy the "<a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_%28weapon%29_c96f.html" title="Metal Gear (weapon)">Shagohod</a>". To this end, he teamed up with a <a href="../../../k/g/b/KGB_8668.html" title="KGB">KGB</a> spy named <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Metal_Gear_Solid_3_characters_34d4.html#EVA" title="List of Metal Gear Solid 3 characters">EVA</a>, who has infiltrated the GRU ranks as Tatyana. In addition to confronting <a href="../../../g/r/u/GRU_d449.html" title="GRU">GRU</a> forces, Snake also was instructed to assassinate each member of the Cobras (The Boss' former unit). Snake experienced many hardships during his mission, including undergoing extreme torture by Volgin, and losing his right eye to <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver_Ocelot_9185.html" title="Revolver Ocelot">Ocelot</a>, but was ultimately successful in slaying the Cobras, destroying the Shagohod (along with Volgin) and then killing The Boss in combat. Before beginning their battle, The Boss gave Snake an ominous final speech: "One must die and one must live. No victory, no defeat. The survivor will carry on the fight. It is our destiny... The one who survives will inherit the title of Boss. And the one who inherits the title of Boss will face an existence of endless battle." Just before his own death three decades later, Big Boss would paraphrase a similar statement to his successor, Solid Snake.</p>
<p>However, after returning to his home country, EVA (who reveals herself to be a spy for the <a href="../../../p/e/o/Peoples%27_Republic_of_China_77c0.html" title="Peoples' Republic of China">Peoples' Republic of China</a>) informed Snake via a recording that his mission was a ruse; The Boss' defection was orchestrated by the United States government, and The Boss was merely used as a scapegoat for the destruction of OKB-754, caused by Volgin with the American-made shells provided by The Boss. The main purpose of the entire operation was the recovery of the <a href="../../../s/n/a/Metal_Gear_Solid_3%7E_Snake_Eater_4db9.html" title="Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater">Philosopher's Legacy</a>, with the destruction of the Shagohod as a side benefit. Upon arriving at <a href="../../../l/a/n/Langley%2C_VA_d07a.html" title="Langley, VA">Langley, VA</a>, Snake was awarded the title of <b>Big Boss</b> and a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Cross_%28United_States%29_b766.html" title="Distinguished Service Cross (United States)">Distinguished Service Cross</a> by <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Johnson_a119.html" title="Lyndon Johnson">President Johnson</a>, but displayed open resentment towards his superiors, especially with the <a href="../../../d/i/r/Director_of_Central_Intelligence_e766.html" title="Director of Central Intelligence">DCI</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCone_5193.html" title="John McCone">John McCone</a>,<sup id="_ref-dvd_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvd" title="">[5]</a></sup> who was the official who ordered the Boss's death in order to recover the Philosopher's Legacy. The game ended with Big Boss saluting The Boss's final resting place, an anonymous gravestone among acres of others.</p>

<p>Big Boss would return once again in <i><a href="../../../p/o/r/Metal_Gear_Solid%7E_Portable_Ops_0798.html" title="Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</a></i> (MPO), set six years after "Operation Snake Eater". Instead of a <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_dress_uniform.html" title="Battle dress uniform">battle dress uniform</a> with changeable camo patterns, Naked Snake wears a "Close Quarter Combative Enhancer" suit, which is a rough combination of Snake's battle dress uniform in <i>Snake Eater</i> with The Boss' sneaking suit and Volgin's red suit according to a conceptual sketch by Yoji Shinkawa. Though he is now officially titled "Big Boss," he refuses to accept this new title, since he does not feel like he has surpassed The Boss yet, and thus still goes by his old codename.</p>
<p>In <i>MPO</i>, Naked Snake was forced to clear his name when his former unit FOX revolts and takes over a former Soviet-owned base located at the fictional San Hieronymo peninsula in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombia.html" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>. The first Metal Gear prototype (codename RAXA) was being developed, threatening to ignite a nuclear war much like the Shagohod had years prior. Widely renowned as The Boss' greatest peer, Naked Snake's charismatic presence allows him to recruit several defecting solders as allies to "hunt" down the rogue FOX unit (laying the groundwork for FOXHOUND).</p>
<p>As the story progressed, Naked Snake was caught in a power struggle between the CIA and the DOD to obtain the missing half of the Philosopher's Legacy. Resenting his role as a pawn, Snake declared to his adversaries that his loyalty is with neither; the CIA nor the DOD, but to himself, and that he will not live his life like The Boss did. In the end, Snake defeats the new leader of FOX, Gene, and obtains from him a microfilm with the funds for "Army's Heaven", an ideal nation by Gene for soldiers.</p>
<p>After the ending credits, a short telephone conversation is played between Ocelot and an unknown third party. Ocelot agrees to help the mysterious person, but only on the condition he be allowed to invite Big Boss to join them in becoming the Patriots.</p>

During an interview with Hideo Kojima in Game Informer, when asked about Big Boss' presence in the promotional artwork, he said that it was Yoji Shinkawa's decision and not his to draw him in the image. It is unknown what role Big Boss will play in the upcoming game, if any.</p>

<p>Big Boss also appears as the second-to-last boss in the non-<a href="../../../c/a/n/Canonical.html" title="Canonical">canonical</a> sequel to the original <i>Metal Gear</i>, <i><a href="../../../s/n/a/Snake%27s_Revenge_9436.html" title="Snake's Revenge">Snake's Revenge</a></i>. He guards the final fortress where the Metal Gear 2 mecha is located. At first, he appears as a normal human armed with a gun. After being shot several times, Big Boss reveals that he survived his injuries from Outer Heaven through surgeries that turned him into a <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyborg.html" title="Cyborg">cyborg</a>; he then transforms into a tall <a href="../../../r/o/b/RoboCop_feae.html" title="RoboCop">RoboCop</a>-like creature and proceeds to chase Solid Snake around while spitting fireballs at him. The only way for Snake to defeat this form is to lure him out of his life-support room and place landmines on his path (his soles are his weakspots).</p>
<p>In <i>Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</i>, if the player calls George Kasler during the final battle, he mentions a rumor about Big Boss receiving cybernetic "snatcher" organs from Dr. Madnar after losing his limbs, right ear and right eye (which was already missing in the original game) in battle. While the conversation is actually a reference to Kojima's previous game, <i><a href="../../../s/n/a/Snatcher.html" title="Snatcher">Snatcher</a></i> (in which a character with Pettrovich Madnar's <a href="../../../n/a/m/Namesake.html" title="Namesake">namesake</a> appears as the founder of the snatcher project), some have interpreted the conversation as an in-joke to Big Boss' portrayal in <i>Snake's Revenge</i>.</p>

<p>When the first <i>Metal Gear</i> was ported to the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_Entertainment_System_c10f.html" title="Nintendo Entertainment System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, Big Boss' role remained unchanged within the actual game, from his initial introduction as Snake's commanding officer to the final revelation as the main villain. However, the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_%28language%29.html" title="English (language)">English</a>-language manual for the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North American</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/r/European.html" title="European">European</a> release of the game makes no attempt at keeping the main villain's identity a secret, nor does it mention Big Boss at all. Instead, the main villain is mentioned to be Vermon CaTaffy (a play on <a href="../../../m/u/a/Muammar_al-Gaddafi_489b.html" title="Muammar al-Gaddafi">Muammar al-Gaddafi</a>), who is described as a "once traquil shephard boy who turned to terrorism". Likewise, Snake's commanding officer is mentioned to be a man named "Commander South". Neither character are actually mentioned in-game.</p>
<p>In the apocryphal Snake's Revenge, which also features Big Boss as the main villain, does not mention him in the manual either. Instead, the manual makes mention of a "Higharolla Kockamamie" (a play on <a href="../../../r/u/h/Ruhollah_Khomeini_cf5c.html" title="Ruhollah Khomeini">Ayatollah Khomeini</a>), who got the plans for Metal Gear from CaTaffy himself.</p>
<p>This practice was not uncommon for many Konami games published in North America at the time, as the writers of Konami's manuals often took liberties with the game's plot, going against the game designers' original intentions, in an attempt to inject humor into their writing.</p>

Drawing of Big Boss from the Japanese instruction manual for <i>Metal Gear</i>. Note that his eye patch is over his left eye instead of his usual right.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>One big discrenpacy in the early <i>Metal Gear</i> games was Big Boss' missing eye. In Big Boss' character illustration for the Japanese instruction manual of the first <i>Metal Gear</i>, the <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyepatch.html" title="Eyepatch">eyepatch</a> is on Big Boss' left eye. However, Big Boss in-game sprite clearly depicts the eyepatch on his right side of his face. All subsequent depictions of Big Boss showed his eyepatch on his right eye. In the manual for <i>Metal Gear 2</i>, it is stated that Big Boss lost his right eye during the 1980s and was the cause of his retirement. However, an in-game radio call with George Kasler during the final battle states a rumor that Big Boss actually lost his right eye to Snake in Outer Heaven (only in the MSX2 and <i>Subsistence</i> versions however. The mobile phone version only states that Big Boss lost his right limbs). The backstory written in the <i>Metal Gear 2</i> manual would have been the most commonly accepted version of Big Boss' loss of his eye.</p>
<p><i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i>, however, changes this by depicting the loss of Big Boss's eye on-screen. Rather than losing his eye during the 80s, Big Boss has his right eye accidentally shot at by <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolver_Ocelot_9185.html" title="Revolver Ocelot">Ocelot</a> in 1964 while in captivity. The muzzle flash is what burned his eye, not the actual bullet. This is made clear according to the Hideo Kojima updated commentary to MGS3.<sup id="_ref-dvd_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dvd" title="">[5]</a></sup> This is now considered the true version, having Big Boss' eye lost in the 80's been <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retconned.html" title="Retconned">retconned</a>.</p>
