The Kings of Swing</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The name Big Bad Voodoo Daddy may seem odd or even vulgar in the least to some people in today’s society, but to aspiring guitarist Scotty Morris, this seemed to be the destined title for his new musical group. In 1989, the sparks of a developing retro swing group were being ignited into flames by leader Morris in his Ventura, southern California home. As the founder of the group, Scotty had the vision of creating a new group to enter the colorful California music scene; one with a conglomeration of jazz, swing, and blues influences. After attending a concert by legendary blues musician Albert Collins, Morris reveals that this meeting was clearly destined as he explains that “’He signed my poster 'To Scotty, the big bad voodoo daddy.’ I thought it was the coolest name I ever heard on one of the coolest musical nights I ever had. So when it came time to name this band, I didn’t really have a choice. I felt like it was handed down to me." ( Scotty Morris- Voodoo Daddy Scores a Gold). Thus, the name endured and the rest is history. Morris then went on to join with drummer Kurt Sodergren, the other founding member of the group. Eventually, the other members fell into place, including Dirk Shumaker on string bass, Andy Rowley on saxophone, Glen Marhevka on trumpet, Karl Hunter on saxophones and clarinet, and finally Joshua Levy on piano. Together, these California natives generated a sound described as 40’s and 50’s swing revival; a jazz influence resurfaced to a new age of punk rock.</p>
<p>Their first album was completed in 1994 as a self-titled independent swing revival record. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy launched their musical careers by performing at humble nightclubs in Ventura such as Nicholby’s and the Majestic Ventura Theatre. To paint of vivid picture of just how small scale these locations are, the Ventura Theatre is known for being the ideal Homecoming and Prom locations for local high- schools. This is a tremendously long way from one of their most accomplished feats; a performance at the Super Bowl Half-time show. But, every band must have its beginning and for jazz band BBVD, they began performing live in 1991 in a small Ventura theatres which they habitually packed with local loyal fans. These boys loved the comfort of playing locally and one member admitted that, “ It’s great to know that you’re playing in front of people you buy your groceries with and do your laundry with…”( City Fathers Grove with Voodoo Daddy). Furthermore, these seven members that comprised the group were all legitimately regular boys. For instance, Kurt Sodergren works as a pharmetucicalist in Thousand Oaks. Also, lead guitarist Scotty Morris has a very laid back job working owning and managing a surf-shop in Port Hueneme with his brother. He is characterized as one of the best guitarists in the area, without needing thorough practice. Their self-titled album was released in 1994 and produced major hits such as “You and Me and The Bottle Makes Three Tonight (Baby)”. These swing dance inspiring tunes escalated up the charts and became popularized even outside the small southern California county. One of their major accomplishments of their career includes a cameo appearance on the widely popular movie, Swingers, which was released in November of 1996. In the movie, they did a live performance of their hit “Go Daddy-O” at a local club in Los Angeles. Swingers starred blockbuster actors such as Vince Vaughn and proved to be a profoundly pivotal point in this young band’s career.</p>
<p>movie put them on the map as musical artists and they became nationally known for their outlandish uniforms consisting of pinstriped suits and brimmed hats. Always in costume for their live performances, their appearance brought forth a sense of realism to their jazz music, perpetually inspiring audiences to swing dance in the crowd. They were eventually signed by Capitol Records where they went on to release a total of three more albums. In May of 1998, their first single was played on the radio. To augment their increasing fame, Bid Bad Voodoo Daddy was featured as the soundtrack to gymnast Carly Patterson as she represented the United States in the 2004 Olympics. Competing Carly went on to capture the gold in style while performing her routine to the hit “ Mr. Pinstripe Suit”. The band members were astonished as they watched from their televisions at home in Ventura. The actual inspiration for this successful song came from a real New York man leader Morris met while on tour. He was blown away by this encounter and revealed that, “He was just the coolest guy, he took me to all the most insane old-school places, he always had a cocktail in his hand, and he smoked Export cigarettes. I literally wrote it in a hotel room of the Holiday Inn in Times Square. So it's pretty classic that it's gone from that to Carly winning the gold." (Voodoo Daddy Scores a Gold). Also occurring at this same point in time for this bustling band, was the release of their self titled album as a live CD and DVD. This live CD was well received by the public who adored the band for their notoriously amazing live performances. With respect to their live music, leader Scotty Morris describes that, “It’s always been a live thing. We have been selling out shows for 10 years and we feel the time is perfect for something like this. It’s what our fans have been begging us to put out for years. The energy of our live show was captured perfectly.” One of their proudest moments came at their live performance at the Derby in Hollywood. In addition, they made an appearance as the house band on the show “Last Call with Carson Daily” which proved to be a monumental step for this mounting band. Unarguably, the band’s most notorious performance came at the Super bowl in 1999 when they performed at the monumental half-time show with millions of Americans watching. In retrospect, leader Scotty Morris admits that, "To be recognized by your hometown is the coolest thing" Morris said before the 20-minute event. "I'm choked up by it."( City Fathers Grove with Voodoo Daddy). Even today, seventeen years later, the Big Bad Voodoo Daddy continue to amaze audience with their inspiring live performances, reviving an age of jazz and swing music.</p>
