<h2><span class="mw-headline">Refences to 1984</span></h2>
<p>I think there should be more mention to this. also in the latest season in the uk, "Big Brother" often repeated "And remeber Big Brother is always watching"Slayerx675 12:06, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Amongst several changes I made today, I removed this after failing to find any evidence for it:</p>
<p>"In the UK, part of the profits are split between three charities."</p>
<p>Note that <i>Celebrity</i> Big Brother does raise cash for charities, so I added:</p>
<p>"In the UK there have been several 'Celebrity Big Brother' series, which have drawn huge viewing figures and raised money for charity."</p>
<p>BTW, for this type of TV show, there's too much talk about the viewer's experience of the show and not enough about it as a remarkable business model for its inventors. The Big Brother phenomenon is more than just a matter for the TV critic. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0317/088_print.html" class="external text" title="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0317/088_print.html" rel="nofollow">Good info on John de Mol and his brainchild on Forbes site</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">American Big Brother and NPOV</span></h2>
<p>I've seen some edits to the section on American Big Brother that seem biased. If it is important to have an article on Big Brother, it should be an informational encyclopedia piece, and it should demonstrate the cultural relevance of the show. It should not be gossipy or opinionated.</p>
<p>I'm changing the recent edit to something more NPOV. I'm happy to discuss further changes. <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThirdreel_6377.html" title="User:Thirdreel">Thirdreel</a> 19:45, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
Several places in the article say that contestant are voted out by the TV audience, but this isn't the case everywhere, like the U.S. July 17 -Merick</p>
<p>This article does not have Mike Malin as winner of Big Brother 7 US. And US should be added to countries with most seasons with Spain &amp; UK.</p>

<dd>That is correct.

<p>The paragraph about Merlin's refugee protest was removed, see this edit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Big_Brother_television_program&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=4701292" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Big_Brother_television_program&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=4701292" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> . I think it deserves some mention, but I can see where the anon editor was coming from as it surely isn't the only notable event in the four season history of the show. I guess the whole Aussie section needs a bit more content. I was going to re-instate it but thought I would leave it up for discussion. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 04:58, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

I think this would be a good idea for the Big Brother shows, but it gets a bit crowded with all the various Big Brother's around the world. The Idol series have different names so they have a natural disambiguator - does anyone think this article should be split into articles <b>Big Brother (Australia)</b>, and so on, for each country? -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 12:32, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I thought about doing that when I recently beefed up the UK info (but laziness won out that time). It would also help categorisation, since each country's article could be placed in the appropriate TV-related categories for that country. Using articles named <b>Big Brother (<i>Country</i>)</b> seems a good plan. -- <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvaragado_c759.html" title="User:Avaragado">Avaragado</a> 15:32, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Emphatic agreement. I think this addresses a little of the "trivia/gossip" point I was making above. The main 'Big Brother television program' should explain what the show is, what the rules are, and some basic facts about the difference between countries' versions. I think having separate articles would allow a place for a little more trivia about who voted for whom and who said what when they were voted out, without overly cluttering the main article.<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThirdreel_6377.html" title="User:Thirdreel">Thirdreel</a> 20:42, 26 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>Sunita in Big Brother UK walked out in just 6 days. I'm sure there have been others - celebrities? guests? - who have lasted even less time.</p>
<p>The shortest stay as im aware was 3 days bb3 uk sunita</p>
<p>I also removed: Big Brother UK was the first and only country from which a Big Brother has flirted with housemate and has dated them. as it is not evidenced and I have no idea what it is referring</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to be a reference to the current series of Big Brother in the UK where a housemate won a "date" with Big Brother which amounted to eating a meal in the diary room while Big Brother flirted with him in a humorous way. Not sure if it's really relevant though.--<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlooK_398d.html" title="User:FlooK">FlooK</a> 20:51, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mercedes in GH5 Spain walked out after about 2 hours which is the shortest time for a voluntary abandonment. I beleive the shortest stay in a BB House for an actual Housemate was Klára in BB1 Czech Republic who entered the House with her sister, the viewers had to vote to evict a sister and Klára was evicted after about 1 hour of her entering the house.

<dd>Well could it be that something like this was done in several seasons of Grande Fratello too? I was curious since everytime the websites opens on a new seasons they already list one ex housemate when the first show is over - I know that in the last seasons the viewer had to decide between two guys entering the house however it would be interesting to know if they had been in the house already and one was forced to leave after he lost that first voting on the kick-off show.</dd>

<p>I don't know about you <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a>, but "Pinoy" does <i>not</i> mean "from the Philippines," by a colloquial word for "Filipino (man)." Just ask the man on the street. And it is always stressed that the name of the Philippine version is "Pinoy Big Brother." Why are you stressing that the Philippine version is just called "Big Brother"?</p>
<p>The official name of the Philippine version of the series is <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinoy_Big_Brother_4427.html" title="Pinoy Big Brother">Pinoy Big Brother</a>, and not <i>Big Brother</i> itself.

<dd>Can say for 100% that the official title is <i>Pinoy Big Brother</i>, as opposed to international versions. It is just as much as different title as "Loft Story". Bluejam 17:51, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, how should we define "local title"? Is it the mere translation of "Big Brother" into the local language? Or is it by how the locals themselves call the program? We need to have a consensus on the matter. <a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirca_1900_1222.html" title="User:Circa 1900">Circa 1900</a> 05:08, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good point. From what I've seen around the world, many non-English speaking countries still use "Big Brother" as the title. Then there's the Spanish speaking countries who use "Gran Hermano" and the French version "Loft Story". "Pinoy Big Brother" is used as the standard title of the programme in the Phillipines, which is why I think it goes alongside these others, I don't see why there's a column for "Local Name" if the proper name isn't put under it.

<p>I think we need to change the picture in the upper right hand corner. It is commonplace for TV series to have their logo's displayed in Wikipedia, and that map does not show anything. It says it highlights the countries that show Big Brother, but it doesn't denote what color it is for the country to have the show. Just looking at the map tells you nothing, plus it's too small to be useful where it is. Anybody else have an opinion? --134.124.63.228 05:02, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why is U.S. Big Brother in "Around the World" changed?</span></h2>
<p>I'm not exactly sure of why, but for some reason, every time I add "Upcoming Season" to the List of Winners, it is deleted. There are already several verifiable sources that could cite that there will be a BB season this summer. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireSpike_004b.html" title="User:FireSpike">FireSpike</a> 00:26, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Upcoming US season has been confirmed as an All Star season, and All Star Editions are not included on this page (Belgium All Stars as an example). There is a separate page for <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Other_Editions_ba0c.html" title="Big Brother Other Editions">Other special versions</a>. GrahamUK 22 April 2006.</p>
<p>There needs to be a note above that section that special seasons of Big Brother in a certain area (like All Stars) that it gets placed in the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Other_Editions_ba0c.html" title="Big Brother Other Editions">Big Brother Other Editions</a> article. Alucard_16 28 July 2006.</p>
<p>I think it's different with BB All Stars in the US since even the broadcast station (CBS) is revering to it as "Big Brother 7" and if there's going to be another season next year it's problaby going to get called "Big Brother 8" , you should think about to include it. shameless 17 August 2006</p>
<p>The number of the show is not the issue here it is the format of the show. All shows on the main page have the format of normal members of the public living together in the house. Other formats have separate pages. If All Stars seasons are included on the main page, then the All Stars seasons for Belgium and Denmark should also be added. I still believe the best option here is to merge the main page with the VIP and Other Editions pages and just have one Big Brother page that lists all editions. GrahamUK 22:19, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I give you that - would definetly be the best decision to escape future discussions. However I don't think we cannot compare the US all stars season to those in Belgium and Denmark (Sweden had one too btw) since it's obviously sheduled like a "real" season and got the officially title from the broadcast station BB#7 as I already pointed out.

<p>Do, or have in the past, more than one country use a similar theme for their own Big Brother series?

<dd>No. Big Brother's 5 and 6 Germany had 15 Housemates at that stage. In fact they still had 15 Housemates when they got past the 40 week stage. GrahamUK 7th July 2006.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Friday Night Live</span></h2>
<p>I added Big Brother Aus's Friday Night Live to the peculiarities section, and it has been removed a couple of times on the basis that it's also used in other series. I don't know that much about the non-Australian series of Big Brother, but checking around the other articles the only thing I can see that is similar is the USA's Head of Household, which still seems fairly different from FNL. In any case, I think it's individual enough to warrant a mention in the peculiarities section. <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclone49_674c.html" title="User:Cyclone49">Cyclone49</a> 14:05, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I stand by that these "facts" are pointless unecyclopedic trivia, and that they are unsourced. Your quote on sources actually proves my point - "<i>When to cite sources: If you <b>add any information to an article</b>, <b>particularly if it's contentious</b> or likely to be challenged, you should supply a source</i>". It's saying you should always add references, especially when the information is contentious (as those "facts" are).

<dd>The facts being 'pointless unecyclopedic' is just a personal appreciation. In fact, there are a lot of wikiarticles with trivia (as you called it) information. About adding sources for each and every information located in wikipedia, it's materially impossible to do. In fact, this does not become, and for that reason it remarks and makes it specific saying <i>particulary</i>, talking about controversial information. I do understand that kind of challenged information may need a source in order to center the debate, and that's what people use to do here. <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a> 3:01 CET 13-06-06</dd>

In this case in individual, we're not talking about opinions, but about facts. Real facts that, by a chronological matter or because it has a wide complexity meaning, many of them don't have alive references in Internet.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pete Bennett</span></h2>
<p>Why is a second form of Tourette syndrome there for Pete Bennett of Big Brother 7 UK? This all started because somebody thought he was the first Big Brother housemate to have had GTS, but when that was proven to be incorrect it was changed. Since then, people have fought over it, and somebody's tried to end this by branching it out into a second form. As far as I can see, this hasn't been done for any other fact or piece of pointless information that's there. Has it actually been said or proven that he has Coprolalia form of Tourette? Who are we to define more than one type of this, unless Pete himself, or a reputable source, has said this? Even if it is true, we can't define more than one type of GTS, because no type has been defined for John Bric of Big Brother 2006 Australia. Why can't this just be removed and forgotten about? —<font face="tahoma"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 17:52, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree to a certain extent.

<dd>I also agree. I would also argue that the John Bric tourettes fact should be removed as it was minor and did not have any significance to his stay in the house. I think that the facts should be Big Brother related (ie eviction percentages, numbers of housemates etc.) and things like illnesses should only be listed if it made an impact on their stay in the house or was promoted by the show (for example I would have no problem with Kenny from BB5 Belgium being listed as having HIV as it was part of the shows promotion).

<dd>OK. John's tourette's wasn't really a major part of him, but Pete's tourette's is a major part of him. He has coprolalia because in one of the first BBLB's, a guy from the tourette association or something was talking about pete's condition and mentioned that Pete hs coprolalia... <a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGodgoddingham333_e4a7.html" title="User:Godgoddingham333">godgoddingham333</a> 21:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, fair enough. But according to the Wikipedia article, coprrolalia isn't a form of GTS; it's only a characteristic.

<dd>The nominations process involves housemates nominating other housemates for eviction. To say that a housemate is nominated for eviction isn't very specific, as anybody who receives a nomination point from another housemate is nominated. If the fact refers to housemates that face eviction, changing the word <i>nominated</i> to <i>up</i> shows that the housemate had enough nomination points to have potentially been evicted for that particular week. —<font face="tahoma"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 18:16, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anastasia Yagaylova from BB Russia has not just been the youngest winner of this show ever, she also shares the record with Camilla Severini to get nominated by her fellow housemates the most times (10):
<dl>
<dd>Round 1 nominated: Vanessa (evicted), Georgiy (left), Anna, Anstasia,</dd>
<dd>Round 2: Galina, Dimitri, Arkady, Oleya P. (evicted), Anastasia</dd>
<dd>Round 3: Dimitri, Arkady, Anna (evicted), Anastasia</dd>
<dd>Round 5: Dimitri Donskov, Nadezhda, Galina (evicted), Dimitri Zadorozhny, Olesya, Eugeniya, Anastasia</dd>
<dd>Round 6: Dimitri D., Nadezhda (evicted), Dimitri Z., Olesya, Eugeniya, Anastasia</dd>
<dd>Round 7: Dimitri D., Sergej, Dimitri Z. (evicted), Olesya, Eugeniya, Anastasia</dd>
<dd>Round 9: Olesya, Vasily, Eugeniya, Ivan (evicted), Anastasia</dd>
<dd>Round 10: Dimitri D. (evicted), Sergej, Olesya, Anastasia</dd>
<dd>Round 11: Sergej, Olesya, Vasily (evicted), Eugeniya, Anastasia</dd>
<dd>Round 12 (even if there were just four people in the house by that time and it was the last round to nominate they made a pact and nominated each other so that everyone was up for eviction): Sergej, Olesya, Eugeniya (evicted), Anastasia</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok, i know what you mean, how she said she isnt evicting anyone, but obviously Camilla was evicted, as when she was told the final tally, they went, and with 47%, you were evicted...</p>
<p>Gretel only needed to say one more thing and that was announcing the winner, but technically she was up for eviction to be evicted. It said Final Sunday Eviction because it was the last sunday, but the next day was also an eviction as 1 person had to leave the house and leave the other by themselves.</p>

<p>Umm....that site is in complete Greek, i can't read that, how do i know your not lying to me?...but that isnt the case...i asked for proof wether they actually had 2 houses in that series as well.</p>
<p>Also, i think it is relevant to mention because you have in the 2005 facts section "Big Brother Village" - BB Germany....if 2 houses (which is before the village) is not allowed to be recognised as relevant information, then i dont think the Village should be recognised then.</p>

<dd>well it might be just with Celebrities but why shouldn't they change the rules a little bit for their own country? if there will never be an indian season with normal people will you never include this? the usa had changed the rules of BB and are still included, in most countries "Celebrity Big Brother" is a special season but it seems that in India they are going with this as their regular format - this will be their first and original season and so it should be included, deal with it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anastasia nominations</span></h2>
<p>About user Shameless introducing facts on Anastasia nominations &gt; First of all that's not a matter on to be a queen because there is no kingdom to have. I do not have any special interest in Nok nor in any other contestant of BB, but when you introduce a information, this one must be truthful and verified previously. If you know that well the Russian nominations, so why don't you respond my request? I particularly don't know the data about Anastasia's nomination and that's why ask you this. In which weeks and competing with who was Anastasia nominated? Here we had a soft controversy with Camilla and we showed the data on her nominations evolution. Please, do the same and then we will be able to correct the errors. I'm getting that data, and when I know it faithfully, I'll change the facts if it's necessary (me or any other person who can verify that information) If you are the person knowing all that thing that correctly, please, inform us about that in order to we be able to change it as soon as possible. Better than make suppositions on the things that I do or I do not do is to verify the information you want to introduce. I invite to you to do it. You shall understand that your word is not sufficient credit for me. <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a>, 21:03 CET 10-08-06</p>

<dd>I repeat, in which weeks and competing with who was nominated Anastasia? You already failed in round 8 so it's possible you are wrong in the others, too... for that reason I invite to you to respond here. Your word still is not a refuted source of information to me. Until you don't write here the evolution of the nominations of Anastasia, in order that I can resist and compare your data with mine, and thus verify it or not, I will keep on reverting this information. And my facts are correct, the one that introduced mistaken information was you, not me. By the way, Camilla was involved in 9 nominations, see information above. <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a>, 22:21 CET 11-08-06

<li>I think the annoying is the one that does not introduce the asked information and when he does it, does it <b>wrong</b>, like now. That information in inaccurate. You missed Anastasia Gluchenko and Arkady's evictions, also Vasily was not evicted but he left the house voluntarily after knowing Anastasia became pregnant, and you also missed Anton's departure. But with the (few) correct data you introduced I could test the information I had and finally we know that Anastasia was up for eviction ten times. And that is what I asked you to proof, so thanks!<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a>
<ul>
<li>why should I list either Anton's departure, Anastasia G.'s or Arkadys eviction? They weren't nominated with Anastasia Y. so there nominatios are not relevant to the subject we discussed. And if you know everything about that why didn't you included Anastasia's record earlier but let me list this all and delete it a thousand times before from the article page?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">First incorrect eviction</span></h2>
<p>It's listed that Klaudiusz Sevkowič instead of Alicja Walczak, BB1 Poland was the first incorrect eviction on BB but I am not sure if this is true. If I remeber right it was the case that they had such a little number of votes in difference but it has already been Klaudiusz who slightly lost this nomination and garnered like 10 votes more or so. Because it was that close he was sent back in the house and they let those two competite against each other for another time which he lost with a more obvious result. Like I said, I am not 100% sure if that was right but I think it happened like this - someone from Poland should make a research for this. If it's not this is the incorrect eviction of Bree (BB AU 4) the worlds first?

<dd>Hi! Camilla's there because there are two kind of facts: one when is about the first time, or <i>the firsts</i>, like <i>First incorrect eviction</i>, <i>First pregnant housemate</i> or <i>First twins competing</i>.

But when we talk about the other kind of facts, or <i>the -ests</i>, like <i>Most...</i>, <i>Lowest...</i>, <i>Shortest...</i>, <i>Highest...</i>, <i>Longest...</i> we will have more than one, as it can be reached several times.

Head Of Household (Big Brother) consists of descriptive content that would be better suited to the Format section here. <span style="background-color:#000000"><font color="white">(|--</font></span> <span style="background-color:#CCCCCC"><a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltimus_c12a.html" title="User talk:Ultimus"><font color="red"><b>UlT</b></font><b><font color="green">i</font><font color="blue">MuS</font></b></a></span> 01:39, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Strongly agree! It's confusing as two --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill.matthews_7111.html" title="User:Bill.matthews">Bill.matthews</a> 03:58, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Disagree. HoH is a format twist wich is not extended in all over the world's verions of the reality, just in a few. I think it's more correct to merge it with <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28US_TV_series%29_c20a.html" title="Big Brother (US TV series)">BB USA</a> as it's original from there. HoH has nothing to do with BB Africa, Argentina, Switzerland, Sweden, South Africa, Russia, etc etc etc... till 90% of BBs created.<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a>, 12.45 CET, 29-08-2006

<dd>I'm with Pabs on this, with a few small exceptions it's a concept only really relevant to BB USA. Bluejam 12:46, 29 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In addition, that HoH article is about HoH <i>IN THE USA</i>... and this BB article talks about Big Brother <i>AROUND THE WORLD</i> (yes, there is a world beyond USA boundaries), so it won't fit with this.<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a>, 16.56 CET, 29-08-2006</dd>

<p>Well, actually, if i am not mistaken, many countries around the world have a HoH format in their game.</p>
<p>BBAUS has one, the winner of FNL, gets a room, gets to allocate jobs and gets to effect nominations.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article was talking about HoH in USA. This article is about Big Brother around the world. Greetings&#160;:) <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a>, 15.15 CET 16-09-06</dd>
<dd>Friday Night Live is not Head of Household, nor are the prizes. Friday Night Live prizes are a luxury that the winner of the Friday Night Games gets for three days. If I understand correctly, Head of Household's powers go as far as evicting a houseguest. <sub><a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a></sup> 19:54, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The Head of House rarely has the power to evict a Housemate. In USA the HoH has the power to nominate both housemates. In Brazil the HoH has the power to nominate 1 of the housemates. In Spain the HoH has the power to save one of the nominees and in previous seasons had the power to deduct points from a nominee. Whilst the Friday Night Games winner is not refered to specifically as the Head of House, the powers that they obtain are similar to the powers of the HoH in other countries. GrahamUK 21:02, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If Head of Household is used in that many countries, I think it should stay on its own article, but say where it was originally used (was this conversation still discussing that?). The article focuses too much on Big Brother America though, could somebody fix that? <sub><a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a></sup> 21:13, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>well on N6 + N10, as you count it, people voted for their favorites and didn't evicted anyone so I don't think we should count this?</dd>

<dd>yes, there were eviction each and every round, but instead of voting in negative that was positive voting, something common in the last BB's around the world.<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a></dd>

<dd>I still say we shouldn't count automated nominations by BB since then Nicole2.0 from BB 5 Germany would had set the record with being up for eviction 11 times (was evitced on her 11th round). Out of those 11 times she was up 7 times automatically with all the other housemates. But since you have count it for Jessica this might be the same for Nicole too. Shameless</dd>

<dd>Hi! Since it was counted for Camilla, it should be too for Jessica, so now Nicole has the record. I think one of the housemates of BB5 and BB6 Germany should have that nominations record as that seasons last for a whole year, but I don't know who was the most nominated housemate in that two seasons. I'm collecting this information now. So I think we can say Nicole has the record, at least so far. <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a>, 18.27 CET 08-09-06</dd>

<dd>I am fairly certain that it was on 29th October 2000 when Masha &amp; Nadim were evicted from BB1 Switzerland. I have records of all BB's that took place before that with the exception of BB1 Sweden, so unless there was a double eviction in BB1 Sweden then Switzerland was the first.

<dd>Well, then it was sweden (when they choosed between three who is becoming Johans replacment) since Switzerland's wasn't a double eviction. Actually only Masha was evicted, Nadim decided to go with her. Of course he was her fellow-nominee but he didn't even got the 2nd most votes (that was Conny). I remember this season so well since I have barely missed any episode from it - Nadim was so popular and a favorite to win until wicked witch Masha entered the house and they became a couple - from that moment they were really hated.

<dd>The same thing that made their mother/daughter twist a world first.

<dd>Same can be said about German's BB organizers who hyped this girl from season two winning as the first woman who had ever done this - although three were ahead of her (counting Bianca from the Netherlands who won earlier that night). Later the host corrected himself but still got the wrong answer with saying Switzerland would had been the only country were a woman had won by that time. Shameless 11:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we have an addition into the main page for the new Big Brother India series? It's starting on 3rd November 2006 on Sony TV and it's going to be called "Bigg Boss". The website for that is www.biggboss.in</p>

<dd>They have removed the references to fansite now. Although I still don't think it is the official website as they talk about Sony as if they are separate to the site. There is also no copyright Sony or Endemol notices which I would expect on an official site or any links to it from the Sony TV site. I'm sure we will find out one way or the other when the show launches tomorrow. Grahamuk 00:02, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
