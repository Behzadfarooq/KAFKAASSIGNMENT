<h2><span class="mw-headline">The big bang, its proponents, and its critics</span></h2>
<p>So, JDR and I agree that there is a systematic bias within academia. This is obvious: if you polled those people throughout the world, a much smaller proportion would believe in the big bang than do scientists, or physicists, in the academy. I don't think this means we should list their objections, any more than we should list the layman's commonsense objection that "It just doesn't make sense!" on the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> pages, or the objection "I don't look anything like a monkey!" on <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> page. The opinion of experts, who are largely academics, needs to be given greater importance. There needs to be some critical standard applied to objections.</p>
<ul>
<li>While there is a systematic bias in academia, it is not nearly as bad as JDR might think. Careers are not made by dotting i's and crossing t's, they are made by branching out, poking holes in existing theories and suggesting new ones. Dark matter wouldn't exist if everybody had ignored the problems with BBN, structure formation and flat rotation curves. Dark energy wouldn't exist if people didn't realize there was a missing mass problem. Inflation wouldn't exist if nobody had the cojones to mention the horizon problem.</li>
<li>Of Eric Lerner's edits, two were highly subjective statements and three were immediately discredited by well known results in the literature. The remaining two comments are highly controversial, have not been peer-reviewed and appeared in the last two months. In an article about as mature a theory as the big bang, it seems like the only reasonable thing to delete them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I disagree with JDR's assertion that it is the business of Wikipedia to counter systematic bias in academia. It is the business of Wikipedia to report the scientific consensus, and any significant dissent within and outside the community, weighted according to its importance. That is the policy and I think this is discussed now in the article. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 17:32, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please don't misrepresent my view .... I will respond more later (about "branching out" within the "mainstream", etc.), but suffice to say right now .... it's the business of Wikipedia to remain neutral. That <i>means'</i> that wikipedia should not futher the systematic bias in academia and address the topic neutrally. This would mean including laymen and "expert" views. Sincerely, <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> (Btw, some careers are made by dotting i's and crossing t's ... =-) (PS. the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> arguement (in the QM, SR, and evolution parts) doesnt help your point.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, we disagree about what neutral means. I think it means presenting things as they are, and that trying to correct systematic biases is something that is invariably more subjective. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 17:48, 16 November 2005 (UTC) (Yes, some careers are made that way. Fortunately, not all of them, or the best of them.) (PS. It's not a strawman argument. I'm just trying to represent that there is a continuum of views, and some criterion needs to be applied to make Wikipedia a useful resource.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You don't disagree with me .... you disagree about what neutral means as Wikipedia states it.</dd>
<dd>It's not "correcting" systematic biases ... it avoiding the furtherance of such bias (a POV) in Wikipedia ... that is why the NPOV policy is there, to wit "<b>Wikipedia policy is that articles should be written from a neutral point of view, representing all majority and <u>significant-minority views fairly and without bias</u></b>"</dd>

<dd>(PS., It's was a strawman argument, eg. "create a position that is easy to refute" (and <i>implicitly</i> "attributing that position" to the other side from where you are arguing from). Criteria can applied and this is delineated in the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> policy. The criteria you espouse is, at best, according to a <a href="../../../s/c/i/Wikipedia%7EScientific_point_of_view_66f8.html" title="Wikipedia:Scientific point of view">Wikipedia:Scientific point of view</a>, this is UNACCEPTABLE to wikipedia's mission. SPOV exclusion violates the policy of including all knowledge and SPOV <i>prioritising</i> (eg., _subjectively_ bringing to the fore) violates the NPOV. The criteria you espouse is, in the worse case, an academic POV ... and as I discussed before that is not a NPOV.)</dd>

<dd>Please stop attributing novel statements to me. I was suggesting just the opposite, that the views about quantum mechanics, special relativity and evolution were views that everybody could agree shouldn't be included. I was not implicitly attributing them to you, nor was I suggesting that your position logically requires their inclusion. I was merely making a trivial example that I thought we could easily agree upon.</dd>

<dd>I have not espoused <i>any</i> scientific point of view. I am merely stating that, in the particular case of the big bang, given that it is such an old and well developed theory, a critic ought to be quite authoritative to merit inclusion. I am perfectly aware of your quote from the NPOV policy, and I agree with it. I disagree with your interpretation, and I do not think the correct interpretation is at all obvious. Lawyers are familiar with this problem: if it were so easy to interpret rules, the United States would not have such a ruckus every time a justice retires from the Supreme Court. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 20:34, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whereas it wouldn't come as surprise for <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">User:Reddi</a>, I want to state it for all bystanders: I fully agree with the line of reasoning of <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">User:Joke137</a>. If something is the subject of study of academic science, it isn't Wikipedia's business to outsmart the scientists. We shouldn't appeal to the lynch mob, to delete <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banach-Tarski_paradox_d710.html" title="Banach-Tarski paradox">Banach-Tarski paradox</a> because it is against all common sense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABell%27s_theorem&amp;diff=9711818&amp;oldid=9710768" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABell%27s_theorem&amp;diff=9711818&amp;oldid=9710768" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
<dd>Reddi knows that hard core dogmatists like myself have a hard time with articles like <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testatika.html" title="Testatika">Testatika</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motionless_Electrical_Generator_576f.html" title="Motionless Electrical Generator">Motionless Electrical Generator</a>, but we can accept that this stuff should be documented in Wikipedia.

<dd>It does not come as a surprise that you Pjacobi agree that wikipedia should take a "academic POV". (As a side note, are you saying that you are a "hard core dogmatist"? I would have gave more of a benefit of the doubt than that .... but I'll let you label yourself =-])</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia's mission isn't to "outsmart the scientists", it's "business" is to <b>remain neutral'</b> ... a "prime directive" as someone stated in another discussion. Wikipedia shouldn't appeal to the "lynch mob" view. Also, Wikipedia shouldn't appeal to a "academic POV". Wikipedia should appeal to a NPOV. "Stuff should be documented in Wikipedia". "Mainstream" articles should include <u><i>significant</i> critics</u> (be that "experts" (do these come a dim a dozen?) or from non-academic sources (ie., "laymen"); eg., people that have point based on "real" studies), not "amateurish" (more precisely, arguement from a unlearned position or with non-pertinent information, not someone having an expertise or skill in a field without pay) critics.</dd>
<dd>I do take exception to your point of excluding so-called "fringe" critics. As discussed earlier .... it is not NPOV to exclude <i>scientific inquiry</i> in an established field that departs significantly from mainstream or orthodox theories (and thier criticism). Much of the <i>significant "minority"</i> could be labeled as such by "scientific fundementalist". As I stated above, excluding <i>"significant" minority views</i> from this article is not a NPOV.

<p>Who, praytell, decides what qualifies as a significant critic? Right now the page lists the fact that critics exist and points us to them. If you think this isn't enough, start an RfC. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 20:33, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you would apply some <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critical_thinking.html" title="Critical thinking">critical thinking</a>, Joshua, and think about what qualifies as a significant <a href="../../../c/r/i/Critic.html" title="Critic">critic</a>, it woulod be kinda easy to find out. These are people that offers skillful interpretation with valid and well-reasoned opinions and analysis involving negative (and positive) observations. The policy of NPOV gives some damn indication. "<i>To avoid endless edit wars, we can agree to present each of the significant views fairly, and not assert any one of them as correct.</i> [...] <i>If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents</i>".</dd>
<dd>Just listing the fact that some critics exist "somewhere" and points to another article ... and not <b>listing thier issues with the Big bang theory</b> (a way of brushing thier concerns aside ... ) is not NPOV. Also to claim items solely for the BB (such as the 'Cosmic microwave background radiation'; "Big Bang theory predicted the existence of ..." bull, the BB myth was as <a href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/spr/2000-01/msg0021150.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/spr/2000-01/msg0021150.html" rel="nofollow">wrong as the others</a> .... you can read all of this thread <a href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/spr/2000-01/msg0020774.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/spr/2000-01/msg0020774.html" rel="nofollow">Cosmic Background Radiation (Not Very Speculative, Honestly)</a>) ...is not NPOV, if there are contentions with other theories.</dd>
<dd>If I (or others) don't think there isn't enough, I'll edit the page to include them. What may happen is if you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Bang&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">keep editing them out (as the history has shown)</a>, a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">RfC may be needed</a>.</dd>

<p>Reddi, pointing to forum postings just makes your point more absurd. The areas of academic research in physics and mathematics will have to be presented from the "academic POV" in Wikipedia, as in any encyclopedia. Yes, there is a -- rather unrelated -- place for <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">notable</a> crackpottery, but that POV explicitely is forbidden to invade the main articles. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 16:35, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Academic POV" is <i>not</i> a NPOV. A "POV explicitely is forbidden to invade the main articles"</dd>
<dd>Wlnk'ing to "Aetherometry" and "Time Cube" does not help your point ... nor are the 'group of critic' (of the BB) insignificant nor as "fringe" as such a wlnk implies.</dd>

<dd>The "academic POV" is a so called POV. Academia is not monolithic and encompasses multiple POVs. The scientific process is an established process to falsify or add support to old theories and create new theories. Your suggestion to go outside academia for other POVs on topics in mathematics and physics is strange and unencyclopedic. It is nowadays very, very uncommon that input outside academia advances mathematics and physics. And the few exceptions are noted by academia and integrated in the usual process. There is no <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_energy_suppression.html" title="Free energy suppression">cabal</a>.</dd>

<dd>A "one academic's POV" is a POV. The generic "academic POV" is a fiction. Our primary goal is an to write an encyclopedia, and this limits the range of POVs to be represented in articles. And yes, there are some POV explicitely forbidden (by precedent, community consensus, or ArbCom ruling) to invade main articles. E.g. it is settled that the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> theory will not be presented in the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time.html" title="Time">time</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/y/Day.html" title="Day">day</a> articles.

<dd>That is true. It is impossible to predict the actual temperature of the CMB without precise knowledge of the expansion history of the universe and the physics of decoupling. I don't see that as relevant – the successful prediction that it is thermal was clearly borne out. Should we, on the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> page, maintain a litany of all the ongoing failures of plasma cosmology to predict anything? –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 14:39, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There prediction for the temperature of the CMB was dead on for the assumptions they made (which turned out to be measured to be incorrect). A detail history of the prediction of the temperature of the CMB is rightly included on the CMB page. What is important is that the CMB is a fundamental characteristic of the Big Bang theory that had to be postdicted by the steady-state proponents. That's why the CMB is important from a historical perspective. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 17:41, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Change: Critics of the theory, however, point out that there is no experimental evidence for any process that produces an asymmetry between matter and antimatter. In particle accelerators, matter and antimatter are always produced in exactly equal amounts. If such equal amounts of matter and antimatter existed at high density, they would have annihilated each other during the expansion, leaving behind a very dilute universe. Thus, critics contend, the big bang theory, combined with observed physical laws, produces a universe that is billions of times less dense than that observed.</p>
<p>Joke: (re: baryogenesis) Fitch and Cronin discovered CP asymmetry in 1962</p>
<p>Reply: Any physicist will explain that CP violation is a necessary but NOT sufficient condition for baryon number non-conservation. Baryon number non-conservation has never been observed in nature, not even a teensy bit. Nor has the decay of the proton ever been observed.</p>

<p>change: In addition, in 2005 Richard Lieu and colleagues presented a study of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect of 31 clusters of galaxies. In this effect, CBR from behind the clusters is slightly “shadowed” by hot electrons in the clusters. Lieu showed that the effect for these clusters was at most one quarter of that predicted, strongly implying that most of the CBR radiation originated closer to us than the clusters, as predicted by the plasma model, but in sharp contraction to the big bang model, which assumes that all the CBR originates at extreme distances.</p>

<p>change: in section on light elements- replacing factually inaccurate statement that there is agreement between BB predictions and observations: However, increasingly accurate measurements of these abundances point to values that are in contradiction with the values predicted by the big bang.

Critics have pointed to this contradiction as another failure of the theory.</p>
<p>Joke: (re: BBN) There is a problem with lithium abundances. They are a little less than 50% low, not 75% as you state. See Steigman. This may be due to astrophysics. There are still large experimental uncertainties. (You may be familiar with the physics joke that 95% of 2σ results are wrong.)</p>
