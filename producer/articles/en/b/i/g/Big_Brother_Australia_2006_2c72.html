<p>In the auditions, which had been held in November and December 2005, producers asked for contestants who were "smart, strong, and looking for a fight". <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Launch" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Launch</i></a> was aired on the evening of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_23.html" title="April 23">April 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (a 24 hour delay).

<p>In previous series of Big Brother Australia, viewers could only vote to <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Eviction" title="Big Brother Australia">evict</a></i> the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Nominations" title="Big Brother Australia">nominated</a> housemates they wanted to leave the house. <i>Big Brother 2006</i> added the <i>save</i> vote. Any viewer may cast as many <i>evict</i> or <i>save</i> votes as they choose. Prior to eviction each housemates' save votes were merged with their evict votes; the housemate with the highest number of evict votes - or as occurred in one case, the lowest number of <i>save</i> votes - remaining after the merge is evicted.</p>

<p>As with some previous seasons of <i>Big Brother</i> Australia, a new house with an original layout was constructed for this series. A new feature was the addition of a <i>Punishment Room</i> to which rule-breaking housemates would be consigned by Big Brother. Housemates in the <i>Punishment Room</i> were required to perform tedious, difficult, embarrassing, or mildly painful tasks and jobs, such as sorting white rice from brown rice, sanding a wooden cube into a sphere, or dancing around a Mexican hat for hours.</p>

<p>One of the twists of <i>Big Brother 2006</i>, promoted as "Australia's World First", was that housemates <a href="#Karen" title="">Karen</a> and <a href="#Krystal" title="">Krystal</a> are mother and daughter. This was not revealed to the other housemates until a week into the series. Because the other housemates failed to uncover their secret, Karen and Krystal were exempt from being <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Nominations" title="Big Brother Australia">nominated</a> by other housemates in the first round. Karen was later evicted from the House on Day 22.</p>
<p>Despite publicity using the term "World First", international seasons of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28TV_series%29_c8a7.html" title="Big Brother (TV series)"><i>Big Brother</i></a> have previously used similar concepts. The fourth Greek season had a series called <i>Big Mother</i> where nine houseguests participated in the game with their mothers, with whom they had to co-exist during the contest. The houseguests' mothers were not eligible to win the prize, but had to stay with their sons and daughters until their eviction. Another Big Brother series had housemates enter the House with their mothers, but the mothers did not stay.</p>
<p>Something similar to this has also been done on Big Brother Australia, where in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2005_ceb9.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2005"><i>Big Brother 2005</i></a>, twin brothers <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Mathew_5a43.html" title="Greg Mathew">Greg</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Mathew_c6d4.html" title="David Mathew">David Mathew</a> were, one at a time, put in the House, and were told to swap places at given times without being noticed by other housemates. They were given the mission to keep this a secret for the opportunity to be entered into the game as individual housemates each with the chance of winning <i>Big Brother 2005</i>.</p>

They were allowed to return to the rest of the House on Day 11. After returning from the <i>Revenge Room</i>, Anna seemed to form a tighter bond with the men in the House. She was the 4th evicted from the house on Day 29 with 25% of the merged vote. Her catchphrase whilst in the house was "Game on, <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole.html" title="Mole">moles</a>" She later admitted on <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#UpLate" title="Big Brother Australia">Big Brother <i>UpLate</i></a> that she forgot she had said the line.

He was often seen in the House talking about cars, a passion of his.

<p><b>Camilla Severi</b> (alias "Camilla Halliwell"), born <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_28.html" title="October 28">October 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, is a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student.html" title="Student">student</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nightclub.html" title="Nightclub">nightclub</a> host from <a href="../../../r/o/w/Rowville.html" title="Rowville">Rowville</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_%28Australia%29_71e6.html" title="Victoria (Australia)">Victoria</a> and was the runner-up of Big Brother 2006. She entered the House on Day 0 with the rest of the original housemates of the series. She was evicted from the house on Day 9 along with Anna when they received the most nominations in a special 'Most Annoying' vote by housemates. However, the eviction was false, and unbeknown to other housemates they never left the house and were secretly escorted to a hidden room -- accessible via the eviction exit passageway -- called the Revenge Room. Upon their arrival they were shown the nominations for 'most annoying' housemate. Camilla reacted particularly badly to Tilli's nomination in which Tilli described Camilla as "forced and fake". Big Brother gave the two housemates control on the house and allowed them to enact revenge on their housemates. After achieving success in their revenge, Camilla and Anna were returned to the house as a surprise <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthday.html" title="Birthday">Birthday</a> present for John on Day 11, with Camilla in one of Tilli's dresses, which they had stolen as part of their revenge. Camilla was very close to <a href="#David" title="">David</a> from the first day, and was upset when he came out as <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> on Day 4 because she had been romantically interested in him. Camilla and David later bonded with <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Intruder" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Intruder</i></a> <a href="#Rob" title="">Rob</a>, who dubbed the three of them "Team Faghag". Camilla and David remained close, but their friendship became somewhat strained over time, resulting in David nominating her in Week 10. As time passed, Camilla won many of the housemates over, but was often perceived by a few housemates to be confrontational, as she rarely backed down from an argument. As a result of this, she was consistently nominated for eviction, which resulted in a nickname of 'the Veteran' from her fellow housemates. She was up for eviction in Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 14. She was up for eviction every week she was eligible except for Week 8 and Week 11. (she was immune from nomination in Week 2 after her false eviction in Week 1.) On Day 70, Camilla was involved in an incident where she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Ashley and John<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> who were removed from the house as a result of their actions. During The Prize Fight, Big Brother told Camilla before a game that she was the worst performer in the history of Friday Night Live, being eliminated in the 1st round 8 times. However, she did come runner-up on the World Cup Night along with eventual winner David. In October 2006, Camilla relocated to Brisbane where she is now part of the breakfast team with <a href="../../../b/1/0/B105.html" title="B105">B105</a>.</p>

She was the youngest housemate of Big Brother 2006. Danielle became romantically involved with <a href="#Dino" title="">Dino</a> after <a href="#Katie" title="">Katie</a>'s 20th birthday party.

<p>Dani's 19th birthday was on Day 47. During her party, she was speaking without her microphone which was discarded when she changed clothes. Because of this, she spent the remainder of her birthday in the <i>Punishment Room</i> cleaning dirty <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dentures.html" title="Dentures">dentures</a>, themed by the Scream Week task and her Scream Week-themed birthday party.</p>
<p>Danielle was nominated for eviction with <a href="#Camilla" title="">Camilla</a> and <a href="#Rob" title="">Rob</a> and was the 8th person evicted from the House on Day 50, receiving 44% of the merged vote. The night after her eviction she was on the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Nominations" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Nominations</i></a> show, Dino was also on the show as a special guest.

David entered the house on Day 0 with the rest of the original housemates of the series. David <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coming_out.html" title="Coming out">came out</a> to the housemates and on Day 4 revealed he was <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>. David bonded immediately with Camilla (although she was upset when he and Tilli kissed as a joke soon after he revealed he was gay), and later Intruder Rob joined their group. David was happy to have another gay man in the house, and they remained close until Rob's eviction. He bonded with Michael, and was visibly upset after learning Michael had lied to the housemates repeatedly as the Insider. Michael and David were still close enough that the blurred lines of their friendship led David to ask Michael if he was gay. Soon after, Michael led other housemates to believe David had stolen their toothbrushes. This led to some heated arguments until after Michael's eviction, when Big Brother told them Michael was the culprit. David and Camilla also grew somewhat apart as time went on. Due to his feeling that Camilla was playing nice with other housemates to avoid being nominated by them, David nominated her in Week 10, a decision that caused him some anguish. David eventually became very good friends with Claire, in spite of some ideological differences (she was a vegetarian, he was a sheep farmer). David also had a strong attraction for Intruder Darren, but as Darren said he was heterosexual, they remained close friends only. David won Friday Night Live in Week 7, won a trip to <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and took Camilla to the rewards room; he took the 3 points off Ashley, even though he himself was up for nomination. He said only a "jerk" would take points from himself. David won again in Week 10, took Perry to the rewards room (she was runner-up in the game), and won a trip to <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thailand.html" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. David was up for eviction in Weeks 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13. He was originally nominated in Week 5, but Gaelan removed three points from him, clearing him from the eviction line-up. In Week 11 David again used his <i>Three Point Twist</i> on someone else (Darren) in spite of being up for nomination himself. This act successfully removed Darren from the eviction line-up.</p>
<p>David was evicted on Day 99 along with Max as part of a <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Eviction" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Double Eviction</i></a> the day before the <i>Finale</i>. David had more 'save' votes than eventual series winner Jamie, but was still evicted, as Jamie had less 'evict' votes than David, with the final tally coming out in Jamie's favour. As David was entering the auditorium, a male audience member ran towards David, but was tackled to the ground by <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreamworld.html" title="Dreamworld">Dreamworld</a> security officers. It was later revealed that the man was a friend of David's, and he was wanting to inform him that the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Demons_c2ab.html" title="Melbourne Demons">Melbourne Demons</a> had clinched an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Football_League_5a18.html" title="Australian Football League">AFL</a> Finals spot. During the eviction David was reunited with his boyfriend Sherif, whom he met four weeks before entering the house. The reunion was an emotional one, with David clearly overwhelmed by the audienceâ€™s positive response and the fact that his boyfriend of only four weeks had waited for him after three months of separation.</p>
<p>Some of David's photos had been stolen from his home, and somebody tried to sell one on <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a>. The auction was closed early by eBay, and police looked into the matter.</p>
<p>David was the winner of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia%27s_Brainiest_14c7.html#Australia.27s_Brainiest_BB06_Housemate" title="Australia's Brainiest"><i>Australia's Brainiest BB06 Housemate</i></a>.</p>

He was the 7th housemate to be evicted from the house on Day 43 along with Jade, attracting 5% of the merged vote.

After his eviction, Dino denied these allegations. After being evicted he was shown footage depicting the growing attraction between Danielle and John that developed simultaneous to his flirtatious relationship with her. Dino stated that he regretted never clarifying with Danielle that he did not see their relationship as serious, claiming that he felt John and Danielle made a good couple and that he did not wish to stand in their way. His closest friends in the house were John, Michael, and Jamie. Jamie was clearly distraught by Dino's departure from the house. His most memorable moment was spending half a day within 5 meters of Camilla as a dare, which created much distress and confusion for some housemates and amusement and laughter for the others. Dino was comically titled the "arrogant wanker" on Rove Live, a title which he seemed proud to carry. Since leaving the house, his relationship with Dani has ended.</p>

He entered the House on Day 0 along with the original housemates. He formed a relationship with <a href="#Krystal" title="">Krystal</a>. Gaelan was only ever up for eviction once, in Week 10. Before the week of his eviction, Gaelan had only ever received 1 nomination point. Gaelan's nomination came from only two housemates, Camilla and David, with Camilla suggesting Gaelan was going <a href="#Under_the_Radar" title=""><i>Under the Radar</i></a> and purposely avoiding conflict to win the game. While Gaelan was often perceived to be most popular with the public by his fellow housemates, he was in fact the least popular original housemate. While in the house, Gaelan frequently acted as a comedian, which is what led his housemates to believe that he was popular with the viewers. However, most of Gaelen's comedy and language was too racy for the show's 7pm timeslot, leading to him being perceived by viewers as something of a non-entity who rarely appeared on the daily show. He was evicted on Day 71<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> with 48% of the merged public vote. He also appeared on an episode of The Wedge as Lucy's new boyfriend.</p>

He entered the house on Day 0 with the other 14 original housemates. He formed a romantic relationship with fellow housemate <a href="#Katie" title="">Katie</a>. Jamie was up for eviction for the first time in Week 8, but Katie was evicted. He was then up for eviction the following week and again survived. Jamie was banned from nominating other housemates in Week 10 as a punishment for repeated rule-breaking including what Big Brother considered as Jamie discussing nominations (in particular, who nominated whom).

Although picked by Centrebet to be the runner-up, Jamie won <i>Big Brother 2006</i> with 53% of the merged vote. He received $426,000 as the winner of the series. He joked that he would spend the money on a solid gold house and a rocket car, as Chester Lampwick did in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> episode <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_the_Violence_Died_0b23.html" title="The Day the Violence Died">The Day the Violence Died</a></i>.

<p><b>Michael McCoy</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">June 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>) is a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_science.html" title="Political science">political science</a> <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student.html" title="Student">student</a> from <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a>.

Michael was the first housemate to enter the Big Brother House this year.</p>
<p>On Day 2, he was given the task of the Insider by Big Brother, having been chosen by the viewing public. If he succeeded in his tasks, he would be immune from being nominated, but if he failed he would automatically be put up for eviction.</p>
<p>He failed his first mission within minutes of being assigned the task, which was to secretly spill water on a bed that was occupied by two housemates. Michael opted to spill water on Gaelan's bed, which at the time was only used by Gaelan himself. Because of that, and because he also didn't empty the whole bottle, he was awarded his first strike. Soon after, he was given other missions, one of which was to be nominated by at least eight of his fellow housemates in the next round of nominations. To complete this mission he fabricated a story about a custody issue concerning his young son Reuben, claiming he wanted to leave the house to concentrate on this issue. After Big Brother revealed to the other housemates that Michael was the Insider, and that the Reuben story was pure fiction, Michael faced a strong backlash from several housemates angry at being duped in this way, especially from Anna, who had little contact with her father, and David, who was angry at the depth and complexity of the lies Michael had told. It was revealed on Michael's eviction night that Reuben is actually the name of one of Michael's real life friends.</p>
<p>Despite no longer being the Insider, Michael continued to cause conflict in Week 5, hiding cutlery as well as hiding the housemates' toothbrushes from them, never revealing their locations even after he had been evicted, attempting to create doubts as to whether or not there is another insider inside the house besides Michael. He was the 5th housemate to be evicted from the house on Day 36, with 20% of the merged vote.</p>
<p>The day after he was evicted, Michael appeared on the Nominations show and had a heated discussion with Gretel Killeen about the producers' editing regarding a scene where Michael and housemate David appeared to be kissing. The outfall resulted in media attention and the interview with Gretel was later labelled "The Gretel Incident" by some fans due to Gretel's allegedly hostile interviewing tactics during the scene.</p>
<p>The day after this incident Michael appeared on <i><a href="../../../r/o/v/Rove_Live_dfd2.html" title="Rove Live">Rove Live</a></i> and when host <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rove_McManus_ffb9.html" title="Rove McManus">Rove McManus</a> insulted Michael, the former housemate returned fire by bluntly telling Rove he wasn't as funny as the show's co-host <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Helliar_209e.html" title="Peter Helliar">Peter Helliar</a>. When asked about "The Gretel Incident", Michael suggested that <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Friday_Night_Live" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Friday Night Live</i></a> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#UpLate" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Big Brother UpLate</i></a> host <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Goldman_f98c.html" title="Mike Goldman">Mike Goldman</a>, or <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Friday_Night_Live" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Friday Night Live</i></a> co-host and former housemate <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Fitzgerald_4e92.html" title="Ryan Fitzgerald">Ryan Fitzgerald</a>, would be better hosts of Big Brother than <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gretel_Killeen_9bc5.html" title="Gretel Killeen">Gretel Killeen</a>.</p>
<p>Not long after being evicted, Michael was involved in a brawl with music student Tristan Bauer, allegedly punching him in the head at the Eastern Hotel in Bondi Junction, Sydney. Mr. Bauer claimed that the attack was unprovoked, although Michael's agency, Harry M. Miller, has stated that he only reacted after 'homophobic' comments had been made in his direction. Michael was never formally charged with any offence.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>As has become custom over the history of the show, Michael appeared along with all the other 2006 housemates on the Rove Live episode of the week of the final. Michael was asked if he had any regrets. His response was that he regretted that John and Ashley were not on the show and questioned Rove as to why he did not have them on the show.</p>

<p><b>Rob Rigley</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_18.html" title="July 18">July 18</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>) is a <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hairdresser.html" title="Hairdresser">hairdresser</a> from <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wollongong.html" title="Wollongong">Wollongong</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a>. He is of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Celtic_6222.html" title="Anglo-Celtic">Anglo-Celtic</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanese</a> descent. He entered the house on Day 24 as an Intruder, along with Danielle and Jade, and the fact that he was gay was quickly the topic of conversation between Camilla and David, creating friendships between them that lasted the entirety of his stay in the house. He christened them 'Team Faghag'. When new Intruders Perry, Darren and Lauren arrived in week 9, Rob quickly befriended Perry; after being evicted he tipped her to win. Rob was perceived by some in the house as bitchy, but others as warm and amusing. He had an increasingly tense relationship with Jamie until they made peace in Week 9. He was up for eviction in Week 7 and Week 9, where he was evicted on Day 64, and was the last of the first set of Intruders to leave the house.</p>
<p>On the Tuesday after his eviction, Rob appeared on <i><a href="../../../r/o/v/Rove_Live_dfd2.html" title="Rove Live">Rove Live</a></i> and after his interview, <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rove_McManus_ffb9.html" title="Rove McManus">Rove</a> asked if he could shave off Rob's <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullet_%28haircut%29.html" title="Mullet (haircut)">mullet</a>, which Rob agreed to do only if Rove in return donated $5,000 <a href="../../../a/u/d/AUD_bfab.html" title="AUD">AUD</a> to charity for <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> research because Rob is afterall, a gayfer and AIDS is "the gay cancer". Afterwards Rove decided to donate $10,000 to the <a href="http://www.bgf.org.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.bgf.org.au/" rel="nofollow">Bobby Goldsmith Foundation</a>. Rob is currently co-hosting <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Up-Late_Game_Show_83d2.html" title="The Up-Late Game Show">The Up-Late Game Show</a></i> with <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2005_ceb9.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2005">Big Brother 2005</a></i> housemate <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Deering_46fa.html" title="Simon Deering">Hotdogs</a>.

<p>(up to and including Sunday night)</p>
<ul>
<li>Soon after entering the House, housemate Michael was issued with, and accepted, the challenge by Big Brother to act as a secret saboteur in the House, known officially as the Insider. He was to play specific pranks at Big Brother's command, to work against and annoy other housemates, and to attempt to stymie the housemates' attempts to successfully complete assigned compulsory tasks. He had to remain undetected in these strategies and keep his role as the Insider a secret, or be automatically nominated for eviction.</li>
<li>Michael failed his first mission within minutes of receiving it, and received his first strike because of it.</li>
<li>Through his diary room discussions with Big Brother, viewers learned that David is gay but had not disclosed this to his fellow housemates. David <a href="../../../c/o/m/Coming_out.html" title="Coming out">came out</a> to them on Wednesday, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_26.html" title="April 26">April 26</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</li>
<li>Gaelan won the first <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Australia%29_4c63.html#Friday_Night_Live" title="Big Brother (Australia)"><i>Big Brother Friday Night Live 2006</i></a>, and chose runner-up Katie as his partner in the <i>Rewards Room</i>. The theme was Cavemen.</li>
<li>A new twist was revealed to the Housemates; a fourth prize would be awarded to the winner of <i>Friday Night Live</i>. Three sealed boxes would be presented to the winner, marked 1, 2 and 3. The winner would select one box only before being allowed to open the box of their choice. The three boxes would inevitably contain a major prize (an overseas holiday), a medium-sized prize, and a booby prize. The three prizes would follow a theme or be associated with each other in a homonymous manner (e.g. <i>Cam</i>bodia, <i>cam</i>era, <i>Cam</i>embert).</li>
<li>The three boxes were presented to Gaelan. They contained a trip to Thailand, a Thai banquet for all of the Housemates for the following night, and a large red bow tie. Gaelan chose the box containing the novelty bow tie.</li>
<li>Krystal revealed to the house that Karen was her mother.</li>
<li>On Day 8, Big Brother asked housemates to nominate which two they found 'Most Annoying'. The two who had the highest nominations were Anna and Camilla. They were both evicted from the house but unknown to the remaining housemates never left the compound and were sent to the Revenge Room. From there they could view the activities in the house and were given a task to enact revenge on their housemates for nominating them.</li>
<li>Prize money at the end of Week 1 was $820,000.</li>

<ul>
<li>Monday, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a> saw the first official nominations of series 6. Elise, Tilli, Claire and Dino were nominated. Michael was also up for nomination after failing his Insider task.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2.html" title="May 2">May 2</a>, the two isolated Housemates, Anna and Camilla, were returned to the House in <a href="#Revenge_Room_Return" title=""><i>Revenge Room Return</i></a>. Both were immune to nomination points received during <a href="#Week_3" title="">Week 3</a>'s <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Nominations" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Nominations</i></a>.</li>
<li>Dino wins the second <i>Friday Night Live</i> and takes runner-up Claire to the Rewards Room. The theme for the night is the Farmyard. The three boxes contain a trip to Cambodia, a digital camera, and some Camembert cheese. Dino chooses the box containing the Camembert cheese.</li>
<li>Tilli and Elise were evicted in a double eviction on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_7.html" title="May 7">May 7</a>.</li>
<li>Prize money at the end of Week 2 was $665,000.</li>

<ul>
<li>Karen, Krystal and Camilla were nominated.</li>
<li>Michael's 'Insider challenge' for the week was to ensure that he was nominated by eight Housemates in the next week's nominations. Success would mean immunity from eviction for the week. He spun a complex and fictitious tale of a son called Reuben and a paternity test supposedly taken shortly before he entered the House that revealed he was not (as he had believed for nearly nine years) Reuben's biological father, in a bid to make other Housemates think he wanted to leave the house.</li>
<li>Michael won <i>Friday Night Live</i>, choosing Ashley to join him in the Rewards Room. The theme for the night was Back To Work (an office theme). The three boxes contained a trip to China, complimentary Chinese laundry services for three Housemates for the week, and a Chinese fortune cookie. Michael chose the box containing the laundry services.</li>
<li>Housemates held a mock wedding for Jamie and Katie.</li>
<li>Karen was evicted on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_14.html" title="May 14">May 14</a>.</li>
<li>Prize money at the end of Week 3 was $610,000.</li>

<ul>
<li>Michael succeeded in his Insider task to get eight housemates to nominate him and therefore was safe from eviction. Michael used his <i>Three Point Twist</i> to save Dino from eviction. Camilla, Ashley, Anna, David and Krystal were up for eviction.</li>
<li>Michael's 'Insider' role was revealed to the house by Big Brother. Many housemates felt that Michael had betrayed them.</li>
<li>All three Intruders, Rob, Jade and Danielle, went into the house at different times during the night during Day 24.</li>
<li>Michael and David nearly shared a kiss in the bathroom. It was later revealed by Michael on <a href="../../../r/o/v/Rove_Live_dfd2.html" title="Rove Live">Rove Live</a>, and also during "The Gretel Incident" that it was a joke.</li>
<li>Gaelan won the rockstar-themed <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Friday_Night_Live" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Friday Night Live</i></a>, his second <i>Friday Night Live</i> win. He invited Krystal to the <i>Rewards Room</i>. They received a special prize: a dinner at Tiger Island (situated inside <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreamworld.html" title="Dreamworld">Dreamworld</a>, but outside the Big Brother House). This prize was hailed as another of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Australia%29_4c63.html" title="Big Brother (Australia)"><i>Big Brother Australia</i></a>'s "<i>World First</i>"s, due to the notion that these two Housemates left the confines of the House as part of the game, and were returned an hour later.</li>
<li>Anna was evicted on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_21.html" title="May 21">May 21</a>.</li>
<li>Jade was voted as the new Insider by the public and was notified that night.</li>
<li>Prize money at the end of Week 4 was $545,000.</li>

<ul>
<li>Originally, Michael, Camilla and David were nominated. Because he won <i>Friday Night Live</i>, Gaelan used his <i>Three Point Twist</i> on David, changing the final eviction line-up to Michael, Camilla, and John.</li>
<li>Katie gives Dino the challenge of having to remain within 5 metres of Camilla for half the day in exchange for Katie's bread rations. When Camilla found Dino spending most of the day with her she thought he might have been interested in her.</li>
<li>Katie celebrated her 20th birthday on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a>. Big Brother threw a surprise birthday party for her in the Rewards Room. The party had a Hawaiian beach theme where all the housemates dressed in Hawaiian costumes. Dino and Intruder Danielle pash at Katie's party. Camilla was upset because she thought Dino was interested in her.</li>
<li>Jade's first Insider mission was on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_23.html" title="May 23">May 23</a>, where she was only allowed to sing and not speak in her usual manner from sunrise to sunset. She spent the day in silence in an effort to complete her task, only having to resort to singing on a few occasions.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_24.html" title="May 24">May 24</a>, Michael stole a number of Housemates' toothbrushes and hid them in a sock under a bed in an effort to create conflict and entertainment within the House. The housemates have since located the toothbrushes after Michael informed them of their whereabouts in his farewell video. However, he did not say he was the one responsible for them being stolen, implicating that it was another housemate. Michael did all of this of his own accord, having been relieved of his Insider role the previous week.</li>
<li>Intruder Danielle won <i>Friday Night Live</i>, and chose John to join her in the Rewards Room. The theme for the night was Horror Night. The three boxes contained a trip to South Africa, a motor scooter, and a salad sandwich. Danielle chose the box containing the sandwich.</li>
<li>Michael was evicted from the House on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_28.html" title="May 28">May 28</a>. After his name was read out he jumped off the couch, threw the bowl on the coffee table to the roof and ran outside, where he was chased and tackled by John and Gaelan.</li>
<li>The housemates watched Michael's eviction message and found that he was still creating tension within the house after he his eviction.</li>
<li>Prize money at the end of Week 5 was $500,000.</li>

<ul>
<li>Originally in general nominations, Jade, Dino, Camilla and Krystal were nominated. Because Danielle won the Friday Night Games, Danielle used her <i>Three Point Twist</i> on Krystal, removed Krystal from the list of nominees.</li>
<li><a href="#Under_the_Radar" title=""><i>Under the Radar</i></a> nominations took place on Day 38 (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>). This allowed the public to nominate a housemate on the basis of whether they have been using the "under the radar" strategy. Big Brother chose Krystal, John, Gaelan, Clare, Ashley as the <i>"Under the Radar"</i> candidates and viewer votes resulted in Krystal and John being added to nominations.</li>
<li>During the Nominations show, evicted housemate Michael and host Gretel Killeen have a heated interview about whether <i>Big Brother</i> used editing techniques to misconstrue an incident where Michael appeared to kiss David. Killeen strongly defended the series, insisting that misleading editing techniques are not used. Michael claims the incident was a joke but that by cutting the shot too soon it appeared to be serious. Killeen clearly appeared uneasy and ambivalent about defending the actions of the <i>Big Brother</i> Program when later in the <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Australia%29_4c63.html#Nominations" title="Big Brother (Australia)">Nominations</a></i> show, she apologised to Michael and the 'full' footage is shown. This includes only a few seconds extra of footage, albeit from a different angle, which implies that the move by David and Michael to kiss each other may have been a joke.</li>
<li>Katie was the winner of <i>Friday Night Live</i>, and choose Jamie to join her in the rewards room. The theme was <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. The prizes in the three boxes were a dreadlock, a motor scooter, and a $1000 JeansWest gift voucher. Katie selected the box with the motor scooter. (She was the first housemate to pick the best prize in this series)</li>
<li>Jade succeeded in her Insider task which gave her a one week immunity from nominations in the next week if she survived eviction on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_3.html" title="June 3">June 3</a>.</li>
<li>Jade and Dino were evicted on Day 43, <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Rob, Danielle and Camilla were nominated for eviction. Katie used her 3-point twist from winning <i>Friday Night Live</i> to remove points from Camilla - even though she nominated her herself - and this did not affect the nominations.</li>

She was then told that she, and three friends in the house, would later that day dine with Big Brother. While the housemates had their meal with Big Brother, they were oblivious to the fact that one of each had a loved one in the house, leaving a gift for them.

<p><b>Truth, Lies, Eviction</b> was a live show used on Day 36. Big Brother felt that some housemates were lying or holding back on things about themselves, therefore flying <a href="#Under_the_Radar" title=""><i>Under the Radar</i></a>. On Day 35, each housemate went into the diary room and was asked some questions. A lie-risk detector, said to be 90% accurate, was used to determine from the frequency of their voice whether or not they were lying. They weren't informed that a lie detector was used, or what the information would be used for until during <i>Truth, Lies, Eviction</i> was broadcast. The show also featured <a href="#Michael" title="">Michael</a>'s eviction, and the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Daily_Show" title="Big Brother Australia">Daily Show</a> was broadcast as part of <i>Truth, Lies, Eviction</i>.</p>

<p><b>Under the Radar</b> was a show that aired during Day 38. Based on the results of Day 36's <a href="#Truth.2C_Lies.2C_Eviction" title=""><i>Truth, Lies, Eviction</i></a> show, Big Brother selected five housemates that he felt weren't contributing to the house, who were intentionally acting in a reserved manner to avoid conflict and thereby avoid being nominated, or flying <i>Under the Radar</i>. These housemates were up for a 24-hour public vote to decide which of them would be added to the list of housemates up for eviction that week. The public vote started on Day 37's <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Nominations" title="Big Brother Australia">Nominations</a></i> show. The housemates Big Brother felt were "flying under the radar" were Ashley, Claire, Gaelan, John, and Krystal.

On <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html#Eviction" title="Big Brother Australia"><i>Eviction</i></a> night, neither of them were evicted.</p>

In this special, Housemates were asked a series of questions previously submitted by viewers and were run through a Layered Voice Analysis device to determine how honest the housemates were with their answers.

<p>The incident sparked a high level of discussion on internet forums where commentators were split over whether the incident was playful fun or actual assault. In many forums there was overwhelming censure of the <i>Big Brother</i> series itself, with many calling for the show to be cancelled.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup> Subsequent to this controversy the program's ratings showed an increase,<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup> however this proved to be only a temporary boost; the show's regular ratings did not show a significant overall increase and the <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Australia%29_4c63.html#Daily_Show" title="Big Brother (Australia)">Daily Show</a></i> continued to rate significantly lower than its competitors on the other commercial networks.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup> Network Ten have indicated that they plan to continue producing the series despite the barrage of criticism.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup> In the wake of the controversy, several former housemates came forward with descriptions of audition processes that require potential housemates to parade nude, and the frequent occurrence of sexual acts in the house similar to the one that the two housemates were ejected for.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>Following the removal of the two offenders the show continued as normal, with housemate <a href="#Gaelan" title="">Gaelan</a> evicted via the usual procedure the following day. In an interview Gaelan claimed that the <i>Big Brother</i> producers had not advised housemates on how to deal with sexual tension.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[50]</a></sup> On the night of July 3, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Ten_7cd2.html" title="Network Ten">Network Ten</a> broadcast an interview with the ejected housemates John and Ashley speaking to <i>Big Brother</i> host <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gretel_Killeen_9bc5.html" title="Gretel Killeen">Gretel Killeen</a>.

<p>As a direct result of the incident a report by the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Communications_and_Media_Authority_4f12.html" title="Australian Communications and Media Authority">Australian Communications and Media Authority</a> was compiled a few days after the incident. The report concluded that loopholes in broadcasting rules should be closed, and internet content regulations tightened. It was found that <i>Big Brother</i> itself could not be penalised as the footage was never broadcast by Network Ten but was seen only via web streaming, and the internet falls outside ACMA's authority. Websites running the footage would not be penalised under other regulations governing web broadcasts as they had removed the footage when requested.<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup> Rival network current affairs programs <i><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Current_Affair_%28Australian_TV_series%29_55e6.html" title="A Current Affair (Australian TV series)">A Current Affair</a></i> on the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Network_03d3.html" title="Nine Network">Nine Network</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Network_cc4b.html" title="Seven Network">Seven Network</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/o/d/Today_Tonight_0b38.html" title="Today Tonight">Today Tonight</a></i>, both broadcast the footage in full.

<p>Presenting the ACMA report, Communications Minister <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Coonan_a50c.html" title="Helen Coonan">Helen Coonan</a> said that legislation to broaden the authority's regulatory powers to cover the internet and mobile phone broadcasts, would be introduced into Parliament as soon as possible.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
