<dd>I don't think you can directly ask for one (being currently blocked), but you could add a request for checkuser as a part of an unblock request, or you could also add a checkuser request anonymously and plea your case to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_3b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser">Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser</a>. <a href="../../../p/b/r/User%7EPbryan_b70a.html" title="User:Pbryan">pbryan</a> 22:14, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<p style="margin-left:2em;">Request reason: "First of all I wish for some one new to take up my case. I was blocked un-justly because pbryan had accused me of being a sock puppet. The story behind this that on February 11 2007 I was accused of being a Sock puppet for user Tony360X, his evidence was that we supported a certain issue and that we have had spelling errors. Ten days passed with no action and according to Wikipedia policy I could remove the banner that claimed I was a sock puppet and all charges brought up on me would be dropped. Now today on February 21 I am banned because Pomte brings up some last minute accusations against me and Tony360X. This reason I have been banned with out a certain limited placed on me. So I requested to be unblocked for I am not a sock puppet of Tony360X and that the evidence used aginst me was flawed and that during my time with Wikipedia I have contributed a good deal to different articles and helped out a lot. I also request a check user to prove my innocence. To who ever is reading this I would like to thank you for a moment of your time."</p>

<dd>First off I wanted a new guy to reviwe me and not another bias lacky of <a href="../../../p/b/r/User%7EPbryan_b70a.html" title="User:Pbryan">pbryan</a>. Second why sould I make a new profile? So <b>Mr.<a href="../../../p/b/r/User%7EPbryan_b70a.html" title="User:Pbryan">pbryan</a></b> could acuess me of being a puppet again. I think not. I want justice.

<dd>I don't know what constitutes justice in your view, but you can be reasonably assured that: a) I won't accuse anyone of being a sockpuppet without reasonable cause, and b) should you be accused again, nobody will block you without independently reviewing the evidence presented. <a href="../../../p/b/r/User%7EPbryan_b70a.html" title="User:Pbryan">pbryan</a> 21:56, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
