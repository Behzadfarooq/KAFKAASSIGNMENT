<p>I don't like the colour for the walked, it is too bright and i would expect it to be over powering. i realise that this is following previous series tables, but in previous cases there has not been such a section. I feel that it should be changed, what do people think to #ffccff (shown below)</p>

<p>There are clear differences between 'nomination boxes' and 'not in house boxes'. For a start, they're a different colour, and if you can't see that, the 'not in house boxes' are italicised as well so what's the problem? We're turning this table into a rainbow, which is unneccessary. The more colour that we have which stand out, the more confusing the table gets, and less people will stay and look at the table. Think about it for a second - people don't come to this page to look at the pretty colours, they come for the information contained in the table. So if they were actually interested in reading the table, they'd read every box individually, so colours are really not a necessity. The only reason we use colours is to make the table slightly easier to read, and slightly more pleasable to the eye, but there is a line regarding the amount of [bright] colour we use in this table, and we're crossing it. — <i><b>FireFox <sup><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><span style="color:black">user</span></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:black">talk</span></a></sub></b></i> 10:14, 01 June '06</p>

<dd>In my opinion, although the tag isn't perfect, the main gist is the text in boldface: "This article or section contains information about an in-progress television show(s)." This article does. It takes information from the website, so people who just watch the TV show will come here and find information about stuff that's not aired yet. Perhaps a {{<a href="../../../s/p/o/Template%7ESpoiler_6a46.html" title="Template:Spoiler">spoiler</a>}} tag is more appropriate. Plus, it's certainly a current event, that changes at the drop of a hat. --<a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">Cel</a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_Esperanza_1a4d.html" title="User:Celestianpower/Esperanza"><font color="green">es</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelestianpower_d90c.html" title="User:Celestianpower">tianpower</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelestianpower_18a6.html" title="User talk:Celestianpower">háblame</a></sup> 09:33, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm gonna have to agree with FireFox here - we don't really need a tag or spoiler tag. We shouldn't have the spoiler tag solely for the reason it's not a spoiler.

<dd>Nonsense, I'm afraid. If that were the case we wouldn't have a spoiler template at all on anything and <i>caveat emptor</i>.

The percentages could go in the main article, but (again imo) they are pieces of information which are too specific to belong there – and as they are figures I think they'd be perfect in the table.

<dd>We don't need this, so I've reverted. Let me explain. The number of times a housemate has been nominated is largely irrelevant. This is because if a housemate is evicted in the second week for example, it's going to look like they were more 'popular' than, quite possibly, the eventual winner. Secondly, we need to keep the table as small as possible - with an extra (wide) column, the 15-column table will not fit in most browser windows at the end of the series. — <i><b><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><span style="color:#62AC65">Fire</span></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:#62AC65">Fox</span></a></b></i> 09:50, 13 June '06

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Exempt</span></h2>
<p>Hi I did put this earlier but I think it got a bit lost. Basically I don't think the 'Exempt' boxes should be gold because looking the BB6 Nominations Table, the gold colour is used for the finalists' boxes. Therefore we should use gold for this year's finalists' boxes as well, and 'Exempt' should really be different?</p>

<dd>This nominations page is a nightmare, along with the table on the BB7 page. Too much overediting means that none of the information is clear. So, in my (lack of) wisdom, I suggested a while ago that the most useful, up-to-date, pertinent information was (somehow) highlighted to the reader. Please consider that besides all of you lot (and me) who visit and edit this page on an hourly basis, some new visitors may spot it and, believe you me, this page is a minefield of info, and it's pretty unclear what on earth is going on. Fine, it might not meet everyone's idea of how to present a page (and I've done a few years of this sort of thing, so I understand that EVERYONE has an opinion), but as it is, it takes ages (on first sight) to work out what is going on here. Bring back something (borders?) that points to the most relevant section of this page. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudgiekiller_c362.html" title="User:Budgiekiller">Budgiekiller</a> 20:41, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
