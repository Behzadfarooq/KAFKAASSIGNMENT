<h2><span class="mw-headline">Confused about galaxy formation</span></h2>
<p>I'm taking another guess. Current version (without links, sorry):</p>
<p>"The details of the distribution of galaxies and quasars both constrain and confirm current theory. The finite age of the universe at earlier times means that galaxy evolution is closely tied to cosmology. The types and distribution of galaxies appear to change markedly over time, evolving by means of the Boltzmann Equation. Observations reveal a time-dependent relationship of the galaxy and quasar distributions, star formation histories, and the type and size of the largest-scale structures in the universe (superclusters). These observations are in statistical agreement with simulations. They are well explained by the Big Bang theory and help constrain model parameters."</p>
<p>My suggestion:</p>
<p>"The details of the distribution of galaxies and quasars both constrain and confirm current theory. The changing conditions in the Big Bang universe mean that galaxy evolution is different at different epochs. (In contrast, the growth and death of organisms in a stable ecology are overall the same in different years.) In fact, the types and the distribution of galaxies appear to change markedly over time, evolving by means of the Boltzmann Equation. Observations reveal a time-dependent relationship among the galaxy and quasar distributions, star formation histories, and the type and size of the largest-scale structures in the universe (superclusters). These observations are in statistical agreement with Big Bang simulations and help constrain model parameters." â€”<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryFriedman_2245.html" title="User:JerryFriedman">JerryFriedman</a> 16:08, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm not entirely happy with this, because it talks about galaxy <i>evolution.</i> It makes it sound like a population of galaxies was around in the primordial universe, and has merely changed in character since then, when in fact the galaxies formed from an extraordinarily homogeneous background. Also, I'd take out the reference to the Boltzmann equation, which doesn't add anything. How about:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The details of the distribution of galaxies and quasars provides strong evidence for the Big Bang. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the big bang, and larger structures have been forming since then, such as <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groups_and_clusters_of_galaxies.html" title="Groups and clusters of galaxies">galaxy clusters</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercluster.html" title="Supercluster">superclusters</a>. Galaxy populations have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies observed in the early universe appear very different from nearby galaxies. Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently apear markedly different from galaxies formed shortly after the big bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions, and larger structures are helping to complete details of the big bang theory, and are in good agreement with simulations of the formation of structure in the universe. --<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 19:12, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's the GUT time, which corresponds to an energy scale of around 10<sup>14</sup> GeV (actually, the GUT scale is more like 10<sup>16</sup> GeV, but who's counting?), roughly the scale of inflation and perhaps baryogenesis, when our understanding of the particle physics gets hazy.

<dd>If you read the opening sentence it clearly states that the "Big Bang is the scientific theory that describes the early development and shape of the universe". No other idea from inside or outside the scientific establishment that has been put forward does that. The now discredited <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steady_state_model.html" title="Steady state model">steady state model</a> doesn't do it, and neither do the protestations of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halton_Arp_59b1.html" title="Halton Arp">Halton Arp</a>, et al. or the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> folks. The Big Bang is a paradigmatic formalism in cosmology, similar to the way in which <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maxwell%27s_Equations_bdbf.html" title="Maxwell's Equations">Maxwell's Equations</a> as "the set of four equations, attributed to James Clerk Maxwell, that describe the behavior of both the electric and magnetic fields, as well as their interactions with matter". Even though there are those people who think some parts of Maxwell's Equations are wrong (<a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_monopoles.html" title="Magnetic monopoles">magnetic monopoles</a> for example, may exist), we still use the definitive article because that is the way science works. You can peruse the science pages here on wikipedia for myriad more examples. True <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_theories.html" title="Scientific theories">scientific theories</a>, by definition, don't lend themselves to concessions of plurality because there can be only one theory available that describes the observations. In the case of the Big Bang, it (and nothing else) is the one theory available that describes the observations. This has nothing to do with being "neutral", it has to do with reporting the facts about a scientific theory and its applicability to the natural universe. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 14:00, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Accepted: The Big Bang theory is not the only theory describing the history of the universe. Many others have been proposed, believed, discredited, or left open to debate. Perhaps there are more to come. That does not matter. As this article is written today, it does not claim to be the only theory. It says (abbreviated) that the Big Bang is the theory that the universe started as an "explosion" of space. That is correct. It is the only theory that postulates that origin. (Or rather, it subsumes all such theories.) <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Mid_d3c6.html" title="User:Chris Mid">Chris Mid</a> 00:43, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Correction</span></h2>
<p>The big bang was not an explosion as we are used to think of it. It was not a normal explosion in space, it was an explosion <b>of</b> space. When the universe inflated, new space was created (see image. [<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/56200main_dark_expansion-lg.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/56200main_dark_expansion-lg.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. That's the way it was according to <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a>. See also the balloon analogy and <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_energy.html" title="Dark energy">dark energy</a>.</p>
<p>Take note that the big-bang model is based on two assumptions. The first is that Albert Einstein's <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_theory_of_relativity.html" title="General theory of relativity">general theory of relativity</a> correctly describes the gravitational interaction of all matter. The second assumption, called the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmological_principle.html" title="Cosmological principle">cosmological principle</a>, states that an observer's view of the universe depends neither on the direction in which he looks nor on his location. This principle applies only to the large-scale properties of the universe, but it does imply that the universe has no edge, so that the big-bang origin occurred not at a particular point in space but rather throughout space at the same time. These two assumptions make it possible to calculate the history of the cosmos after a certain epoch called the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planck_time.html" title="Planck time">Planck time</a>. Scientists have yet to determine what prevailed before Planck time. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 16:02, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Big Bang need not be described as an "explosion" at all. That's a holdover and a misnomer. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 16:02, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the problem with the "explosion" concept is that the less sophisticated reader tends to assume that an explosion exists in a small space within a larger (perhaps low density) one. The balloon analogy more or less handles that one, but suggests too strongly a positively curved space-section, and also implies, even when one is careful, that there are more dimensions in which the space being discussed is imbedded. Seems to me that there must be some good elementary/novice level discussions one could borrow from. I think Abell once used an expanding, leavened cake with raisins in it. Finally, I think one has to be open about open questions, such as what could have come before the big bang, and what was its "cause". We are all used to cause and effect in a limited context, and it may or may not be meaningful to treat these issues, but I doubt that they will be settled or very much clarified on these pages. Best to sum up in a very few pithy sentences that we are approaching the limits of present theories so it is a research area. <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 04:06, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, the Milne model still defines a universal edge. Apparent Expansion says there is no edge. Like in the illustration of a sphere whose side continues in all directions with no edge, or the premise that the universe leads to an infinite number of multiple universes, so if you traveled in one direction for long enough, you would apparently return to the same place (and the same time) you left from. The premise behind apparent expansion is the fact that there appears to be no center of expansion, but rather everything is expanding uniformly. Picture a galaxy at 5 million light years away. Now assume that beyond it there are five galaxies, say around 7-8 mln. light years away. And beyond that, at 10-12, twenty-five, and so on, to infinity. Let's assume the gravity of the more distant galaxies (and remember, we're assuming their amount is infinite) is always pulling the galaxy at 5 light years away farther away from us, we being the centre of the universe from our perspective (although threre can be no centre except relatively). We can follow the same example for those galaxies 7-8 million light years away, and so on. The farther the galaxy the fast it seems to be moving, but only relatively. It is obvious that in the galaxy 5 mln light years away, the further galaxies would seem to move at a slower rate than is apparent on earth. The whole model draws from the fact that according to quantum physics there is no universal edge or universal centre, things imperative for the big bang to make sense.--<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadThomson_0474.html" title="User:ChadThomson">ChadThomson</a> 03:36, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have never given a reference to "Apparent Expansion" and I have searched Wikipedia and do not find it. Your description is sketchy and it does not seem consistent to me - if distant galaxies are pulling intermediate ones "away", nevertheless our neighbors are pulling the intermediate ones towards, and in all homogeneous relativistic cosmologies that wins. The accelerated expansion is due to "dark energy" which is pumping up the universe and is not described as a pull of galaxies on each other.<a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 15:54, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Several of these statements are puzzling. In particular, as the universe's distribution is approximately uniform on large scales, the galaxy 5 million LY away wouldn't be pulled away from us by gravity, but would stay in the same position relative to us, if space itself were not expanding (it sees equal amounts of matter on all sides of it). If space _is_ uniformly expanding, per the big bang model, then there is nothing magical needed in order to explain that more distant galaxies are moving faster, relative to you, than nearby ones no matter where you stand, so I'm not seeing what you're trying to add. Secondly, I am reasonably familiar with "quantum physics", and I don't see how the claims you ascribe to it are drawn from it (it can deal with bounded systems just fine, and the idea that our place in the universe should _not_ be assumed to be special predates it by centuries). If you could cite a few papers that take the position you are trying to illustrate, that would perhaps be a better source to draw material from. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 04:42, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I guess my question would be this: to what degree is space expanding? Is the space between atoms' nuclei and electrons also expanding? We could never find out, because we, the observers, would be expanding at the same rate as everything else. Even so, the idea is ridiculous, as the atomic force keeps the atoms the way they are. And why are the galaxies moving away from each other, but the stars are not? Well, the logical answer is the force of gravity generated from the supermassive gynormous black holes in the center of the galaxies keeps them together. So then the question remains, why against all odds are the galaxies seemingly breaking the law of gravity, and spreading out from each other (not from an observable centre)? Even if there was a centre with a diameter of one Planck Length, what kind of impossible explosion would have had to have occured in order for the matter to spread out to such a degree, and what kind of momentum would have to be pushing the galaxies away at an ever-heightening speed, against all odds and laws. Either some force stronger than gravity and momentum, that we haven't discovered is stretching the galaxy, or the expansion is only apparent. The expansion isn't slowing down, and it isn't stemming from a centre (as far as is proveable), these are both requirements for the big bang.--<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadThomson_0474.html" title="User:ChadThomson">ChadThomson</a> 05:47, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This is explained in most texts on the subject. The short answer is that for the type of expansion generally assumed (one whose rate is not speeding up exponentially), bound systems stay bound (the fact that space is expanding just changes what the stable binding energy is slightly). Systems that aren't bound (anything larger than a supercluster) will fly into their disparate (bound) components. Really, really huge structures would have their binding energies tweaked enough that they might be impossible to bind, but the size required is large enough that this doesn't seem to be an issue for our universe. The exception is if you postulate that the _rate_ of expansion is increasing without bound. For any given size, such a system will eventually be expanding at a high enough rate to prevent systems of that size from remaining bound at any energy, which results in the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_rip.html" title="Big rip">big rip</a> scenario. We don't know enough about the nature of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_energy.html" title="Dark energy">dark energy</a> to say whether such a scenario is likely, but the simplest models don't result in it. None of these cases requires a new attractive force or a new repulsive force. Answers longer than this require me to write a screen or two of equations, which I'm assuming you aren't interested in. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 05:58, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You also appear to be misunderstanding what the big bang model proposes. It doesn't require the universe to have any "central point" within it, as _all_ points within it were once at the same location. Neither does the big bang model require that the expansion be slowing down (it sped up during <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_inflation.html" title="Cosmic inflation">inflation</a>, and appears to be speeding up now). How the rate of expansion changes depends on what the universe's contents are (normal matter makes it slow down, though not necessarily stop, and the properties of both <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_energy.html" title="Dark energy">dark energy</a> and the inflationary field cause it to speed up).--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 06:05, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, well, after reading about dark matter, you get the idea that the universe is surrounded by it, which is causing the outward pull. Very interesting. Another question I have, is this. Relative to what did the universe start expanding? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadThomson_0474.html" title="User:ChadThomson">ChadThomson</a> 09:01, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The short answer is "relative to itself". The analogy usually given is that of a balloon inflating - no point on the surface of the balloon is the "center" of the expansion, but everything on that surface keeps moving farther apart. This is slightly misleading, in that the balloon is embedded in 3D Euclidian space, while the universe doesn't have to be embedded in anything. As for dark matter, it more or less acts the same way as normal matter, collapsing into gravitationally bound discs and clumps on a small scale, while being more or less uniformly distributed on a large scale. The difference is that because of dark matter's properties, the smallest size of structure it forms is the size of a galaxy. Galaxies, and larger structures, are visible because normal matter is mixed in with and follows the dark matter as it clumps on these (relatively small) scales. When enough matter (normal and dark) is present in one place, you get star birth and a galaxy forming. Within galaxies, its distribution is different from that of normal matter, but on a larger scale, it's pretty much the same.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 14:58, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I suppose that's quite clear. Of course it requires a lot of assumptions, but on the other hand it answers lots of questions (though not all). The real challenge is discovering what exactly dark matter is. If it is indeed dark matter that is causing the expansion, then is it dark matter that caused the "bang"? If so, where did this dark matter come from. And does the big bang theory have any light to shed on why reality is expressed in matter and why matter is formed by the numerous elementary particles, and not in some other way? Why is energy present in the form of particles, and why does one of those particles (the photon) have no mass? Why are all the laws of nature present which made it possible for the quark-gluon plasma to form into matter as we now know it? Why is matter fixed in space-time, and stipulated by space-time? Perhaps we are too used to nature to understand that there can be no particular reason why everything is (or appears to be) the way it is. People cite the structure of the eye as proof for intelligent design. I cite the complexity of the big bang, and everything that had to be in place and prepared (by whom?) to act in a certain way.--<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadThomson_0474.html" title="User:ChadThomson">ChadThomson</a> 04:43, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It requires fewer assumptions than you think. The presence of dark matter was inferred from observations; it wasn't just pulled out of thin air. Our current conception of it is, more or less, the simplest explanation we can think of for a wide variety of phenomena. See <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_matter.html" title="Dark matter">dark matter</a> for a detailed discussion of this. As for the expansion of the universe, that's driven by <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_energy.html" title="Dark energy">dark energy</a>, which is a different beast (though it counts as "dark matter" in that it posesses energy/mass and so counts towards initial flatness, it differs in that it doesn't clump and isn't conserved the way normal matter is). As for the whether the big bang explains the nature of matter, it's the other way around - our current understanding of physics is what points towards possible explanations for the big bang. As for why the laws of physics are the way they are, this is suspected to partly be a reflection of deeper underlying symmetries (which <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersymmetry.html" title="Supersymmetry">supersymmetry</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a> take a crack at expressing), and partly just happenstance (as the universe's temperature dropped below the temperature at which <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking.html" title="Spontaneous symmetry breaking">symmetry was broken</a>, the final state that it ended up in after breaking was pretty arbitrarily selected from the set of valid possibilities). My best suggestion is to skim the web for FAQs on physics and particle physics, and then pick up a few first-year university texts on the aspects that interest you, because there's no way I can do it justice short of writing a book-length article on the subject. As for intelligent design, <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a> cautions against making that assumption for the time being, as the behavior of the universe stems from simple enough principles that it doesn't appear to be needed. Final summary would be, "It looks strange and confusing, but it's really a lot simpler and more elegant than it looks, for reasons that are only easy to explain if you have a decade or two of math under your belt.".--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 05:41, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Christopher Thomas' explanations are good descriptions of the state of theory, but I do want to point out that some of this is really just theory right now. Dark matter and dark energy are, at this point, almost just names for things we don't yet understand. In fact, these are some of the hot topics in cosmology. Nevertheless, Christopher's arguments are sound, since observations do seem to show that the effects implied by these concepts are real.<br /></dd>

If cornered, they will admit it's only a theory, but until then, they seem to deem any possible explanations for scientific phenomena (i.e. the <i>existence</i> of the universe) that they like as "fact". Good luck disproving <i>fact</i> all you pitiful creationists.</dd>

<p>Antiscientific attitudes such as yours, Chad, do not have a place in editting science articles, you will find. You may be able to add more over at <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a>. I might point out that you have a very poor understanding of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_theory.html" title="Scientific theory">scientific theory</a>.

<dd>The short version is to say that our current understanding of physical laws is compatible with a scenario where the primordial universe appears out of nothingness. The long version is out of scope here. If you're honestly interested in the subject, read some of the references I suggested earlier. If you're _not_ interested in the subject, and are instead just trying to promote your own view regardless of any arguments based on evidence, take it elsewhere. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 1 July 2005 04:59 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're not actually claiming there's "evidence" for the appearance of the universe out of nothingness? That's completely out of your jurisdiction as a scientist. Science could never explain "nothingness" and "its intrinsic qualites which allow for appearance of 'somethingness'." Of course speculation on the "qualities" of nothingness is rather (quite, extremely) absurd, and more absurd for a scientist, whose job it is to investigate the observable universe and make inferences. Sure, I'm not a scientist, but I'm an intelligent person, and anyone can see the preposterousness of what you're saying. "Our current understanding of physical laws is compatible with the primordial universe appearing" for any reason whatsoever. A true scientific attitude seeks origins, causes (even Mr. Schroeder can't deny that). So we can come to some conclusions:</dd>
<dd>1. Science makes inferences from observable reality about causes, origins, reasons, etc.</dd>
<dd>2. Science cannot observe or infer anything about "nothingness" (and neither can anything with a brain).</dd>
<dd>3. Therefore "science" which claims "nothingness" as a starting point is ridiculous.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please, believe in the big bang, if it answers questions, maybe I've joined you in your belief (the evidence is profound), but please, don't try to claim scientific evidence for "something from nothing." It's impossible, and in the end, when you have nothing left to say, the only thing you'll be able to do is wave some diploma at me, but you'll have missed the point. Enough of that, though. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadThomson_0474.html" title="User:ChadThomson">ChadThomson</a> 1 July 2005 05:41 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look up <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_particles.html" title="Virtual particles">virtual particles</a> for other situations where postulating something appearing from nothing not only makes sense, but explains a large number of other observations. Also, as others have requested, _please_ learn about the models before making blanket claims about whether or not they're sensible. They are incomplete, but are still the most plausible explanations of reality found to date. Understand them, whether you agree or disagree with them. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 1 July 2005 06:10 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"A virtual particle is a temporary elementary particle, used to describe an intermediate stage in the interaction." Can someone please give me a link to a site which seriously explains how a virtual particle can be any more than a "description". And on another note, a parallel cannot truly be drawn between virtual particles and reality. First of all, saying "virtual particles arise from nothing" and "real particles arise from nothing" and some connecting the two ideas is logically impossible. Secondly, the article, "A virtual particle is never the end result of such a process." Virtual particles are never directly observed because they seem to self-annihilate instantaneously (pay close attention to the word "never" in the above quote). Therefore, the parallel breaks down. We don't have nothing resulting in something, but rather nothing maybe resulting in something and consecutively in nothing once again. Sure it explains a lot, but try to isolate the virtual antiparticles and virtual particles created out of nothing using an electromagnetic field. Would it work?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Finally, the particles, if they were proved to be "real" as opposed to "virtual" are regardless the result of something, i.e. the reaction that needs them, they are propagators, a direct result of an action causing the reaction (of which a part could conceivably be these particles). In order for them to exist, the universe must <i>already</i> exist, i.e. they are not truly resulting from nothing. I would request an article on Wikipedia titled "the minus-first law of thermodynamics" it could describe the scientific fact that matter (and spacetime for that matter) does indeed sporadically generate itself out of nothing, along with the other four laws of thermodynamics (bibliography a must). I would be the first to request it as a featured article.</dd>
<dd>(By the way: we've found a [refuted] example of matter from nothing. How about an example of spacetime from nothing? It's impossible to picture, I know, but try to picture it. Oops, you just <i>pictured</i> nothing for two seconds.)<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadThomson_0474.html" title="User:ChadThomson">ChadThomson</a> 1 July 2005 07:09 (UTC)

<dd>If you consider your comments here a refutation, then I'm afraid there's no point in continuing this conversation, as you're misapplying philosophical arguments rather than making any attempt to learn the background behind the scientific ones. You can easily _directly_ demonstrate the existence of virtual particles by looking at the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casimir_effect.html" title="Casimir effect">Casimir effect</a>, and virtual particles can become real in the vicinity of black holes (producing <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawking_radiation.html" title="Hawking radiation">Hawking radiation</a>). The universe, like virtual particles, could appear out of nothing (in many of the Big Bang model variants) because it had zero net energy at the time of creation (a flat universe exactly balances gravitational potential energy (negative) and mass (positive), though the universe evolved away from flatness afterwards). As for "creating space from nothing", what exactly do you think <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hubble_expansion.html" title="Hubble expansion">Hubble expansion</a> is? The amount of space present is changing as we watch. Lastly, rather than complain about the lack of references, how about looking up some of the ones I've given you? They will give you a much clearer picture of the model of reality that the scientific community uses, which will a) reduce some of your confusion about what it's saying and b) let you debate meaningfully about it. Your objections so far seem to be based on misconceptions.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 1 July 2005 15:28 (UTC)</dd>
