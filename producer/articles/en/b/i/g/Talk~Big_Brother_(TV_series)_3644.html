<p>I'm suggesting that <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_VIP_bd5c.html" title="Big Brother VIP">Big Brother VIP</a> be merged with this article because the Big Brother VIP article doesn't actually have that much information in it, and it only exists because this exists. Plus I think it's a bit confusing having them separate, and it would stop all the adding of Celebrity editions to the table in this article. <sub><a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">JD</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a></sup> 18:33, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now that the pages have been merged, I think we should go a stage further and merge the 3 tables. So rather than having a table for main editions, a table for VIP and a table for Other editions there should be just 1 table that lists all editions. Also the facts sections should be merged into 1 as well. What do people think? Grahamuk 23:34, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think it's ok right now. If we merge the tables it will be confusing to know what kind of BB someone won. Also, some facts don't fit when you put it together with the others. <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a> 14.38, 25-11-06 CET

<dd>I was thinking about merging the tables before I proposed the article merges, but then I thought that it might be better to keep the tables where they are now. Having separate trivia sections that I think should go anyway and then having one big table I think would be a bit odd. <sub><a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">JD</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a></sup> 13:41, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with 206.47.141.21 about merging them all into one table - then we wouldn't have the arguments about were to put US BB #7 or BB India. Shameless

<dd>The thing about BB USA and India is clear for the ones who want to understand it. One is ALL STARS and the other one is VIP. That's all. I think it's OK as it is right now. <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a>.</dd>
<dd>How would this be done though? I can't think of any easy way to show which series each season is a part of without making the table look really bad. It also doesn't make much sense to have sections for Big Brother VIP and other Big Brother editions near the bottom, and the information about the seasons nearer the top. <sub><a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">JD</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a></sup> 15:32, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>well obviously the only one to understand that about BB India and US#7 are you since everyone who's browsing this site tries to add them since they think it might be missng. Just look to this polish website: <a href="http://www.reality-tv.pl/modules/content/index.php?id=6" class="external free" title="http://www.reality-tv.pl/modules/content/index.php?id=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.reality-tv.pl/modules/content/index.php?id=6</a>. He ranked all the seasons on their countries sections and it's still obvious to understand which had been regular, celebrity or special seasons. We could also indicate this with using different background colours for several kinds of seasons. Shameless 12:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't guide myself for what a polish site (sigh) says, but which is the format produced. And the format in India is VIP, and ALL STARS in the USA. C'est fini. And no, 'everyone' is not adding it. Is the same that we had here some weeks ago with Celeb Pinoy winner. But, hey, even if everyone would be adding it, if it's wrong, it's wrong. <a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPabs_389f.html" title="User:Pabs">Pabs</a>.</dd>
<dd>One of the main reasons for merging the 3 pages was to avoid the issue of having the wrong show on the wrong page. The current situation has not resolved that and I don't see the point in having merged the pages if the tables and facts are not also merged. It might as well go back to being on 3 separate pages. Grahamuk 12:15, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If they're going to be merged, the whole article needs to be rearranged. The table would need to be moved further down, and something would have to be done about the facts sections. I've just thought of a way that the tables could be merged without making things overcomplicated. <sub><a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">JD</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a></sup> 12:23, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>the difference is that even most local shows just use the name "Big Brother" as in Australia, Croatia and many, many more. If you look to their Idol shows they are called Australian, Singapore or Malaysian Idol but you can also see that in their shows logo.</dd>
<dd>I think if a show is officially called "Pinoy Big Brother" I agree with you, however as I already wrote, most of the other BBs don't give their adaption a special local name. Shameless 15:24, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>since there are a few special seasons which didn't followed the original BB rules of nominations and evictions of course no eviction took place on them. however the bulgarian vip season had (due to the high number of voluntary exits) only two evictions with nominations before.

<p>in fact there was only one evicted housemate, as the second one - lilana left the house because she had the least number of positive votes. here is what actually happened with the nominations in vip brother 1: the first nominations were on day 5 (friday). on monday (day 8) one of the two nominees left voluntarily. then the second nominations were on day 9. nominated housemates were raina and dim dukov (who is now hosting <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother%27s_Big_Mouth_c333.html" title="Big Brother's Big Mouth">Big Brother's Big Mouth</a>). the eviction should be on friday but on day 10 another housemate - galya litova decided to leave, so the eviction was sheduled for monday (day 15) and raina was evicted. on the next day - 16, were the new nominations. two of the three nominees decided to leave the house and they did it on day 19. the producers decided to start the positive voting for winner. on day 27, lilana had the least number of positive votes and she was evicted.</p>

<p>I added this fact as 18 in BB5 Germany, but it's been changed to 15. Which 3 on my list didn't exit the house voluntarily?

<dl>
<dd>sorry I made a mistake so I am going to change that to 17. Sandra R was taken out by BB after the press wrote some bad things about her (because she gave her babies away) and saw that as the only way to protect her. Jupp was forced to leave since someone in his family needed his help (which wasn't explained further in the TV Show) and BB thought it would be better if he's not staying in the house however due to these circumstanges he was allowed to return a few weeks later. That would make 16 but your list does not include Lisa (Elisabeth) who left the house voluntary after the majority of household gone mad with her. However she was just talking with enemy Franco (who left the house at the same time but had all the HMs on his side) and the BB-Psychologist, when they were outside in a special room and they decided to end this fight and both were allowed to return to the house a few hours after they left, of course it's actually against the rules but it remains as the only time it happened on german bb so far.

<p>I think that the whole racism controversy deserves its own separate article due to its international political ramifications. Although the section on this article is good, I don't think it is anywhere near describing <i>everything</i> that happened as a news event in itself. I would strongly support the creation of a separate article (for example, Big Brother racism controversy (2007) where the whole story can be described in full. As far as I am aware there is precedence for this in Wikipedia and it shouldn't be too hard for editors who are willing to put the work in.</p>
<p>I've been inserting, organising and maintaining the information at <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shilpa_Shetty_564b.html#Racism_controversy" title="Shilpa Shetty">Shilpa_Shetty#Racism_controversy</a> which is understandably far too large and will be significantly pruned once the controversy is over, but it's a shame to see all of that go to waste. There are plenty of references there for use and other developments haven't been discussed, for example, Cameron's and Livingstone's comments as well as comments from the Indian politicians.</p>
