<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Train_e620.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>Following in the tradition of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_f0e0.html" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a>, the comedy of <i>Big Train</i> is based on the subversion of ordinary situations by the surreal or macabre. For example, one <a href="../../../s/c/e/Scene.html" title="Scene">scene</a> features a bad-mannered man casually stabbed to death by his embarrassed wife at a <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinner_party.html" title="Dinner party">dinner party</a>. The series is probably most famous for a recurring sketch from the first series, a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stare-out.html" title="Stare-out">stare-out</a> competition accompanied by commentary from <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> commentator <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Davies_eb6f.html" title="Barry Davies">Barry Davies</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Cornwell_f11e.html" title="Phil Cornwell">Phil Cornwell</a>. The stare-out competition was based on a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a> by Paul Hatcher and was animated by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Shepherd_30ad.html" title="Chris Shepherd">Chris Shepherd</a>.</p>
<p>Despite running for two series, <i>Big Train</i> attracted only a limited audience. Even so, the first series was voted "Best 'Broken Comedy' Show" at the prestigious <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Comedy_Awards_dc6d.html" title="British Comedy Awards">British Comedy Awards</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Comedy_Awards_1999_7753.html" title="British Comedy Awards 1999">in 1999</a>. Both series were released on <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">25 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>.</p>
<p>Its stars included <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Eldon_c1b4.html" title="Kevin Eldon">Kevin Eldon</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Heap_3196.html" title="Mark Heap">Mark Heap</a>, and <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Pegg_771c.html" title="Simon Pegg">Simon Pegg</a> in both series one and two, with <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julia_Davis_756f.html" title="Julia Davis">Julia Davis</a>, and <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amelia_Bullmore_7312.html" title="Amelia Bullmore">Amelia Bullmore</a> in the first series, and <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebecca_Front_ae9d.html" title="Rebecca Front">Rebecca Front</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy-Ann_Oberman_0b58.html" title="Tracy-Ann Oberman">Tracy-Ann Oberman</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_Tate_b60a.html" title="Catherine Tate">Catherine Tate</a> in the second series. All its lead actors have starred in a variety of other comedy shows including <i><a href="../../../i/27/m/I%27m_Alan_Partridge_5855.html" title="I'm Alan Partridge">I'm Alan Partridge</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../l/o/o/Look_Around_You_8e86.html" title="Look Around You">Look Around You</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaced.html" title="Spaced">Spaced</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/m/a/Smack_the_Pony_0247.html" title="Smack the Pony">Smack the Pony</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/r/a/Brass_Eye_564d.html" title="Brass Eye">Brass Eye</a></i>. Catherine Tate went on to get her own show on the BBC, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Catherine_Tate_Show_af9a.html" title="The Catherine Tate Show">The Catherine Tate Show</a></i>. The first series was directed by Graham Linehan and other series contributors included <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Mitchell_%28actor%29_cca5.html" title="David Mitchell (actor)">David Mitchell</a>.</p>
<p>The pilot episode was directed by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Morris_%28satirist%29_42e5.html" title="Chris Morris (satirist)">Chris Morris</a> but was never broadcast in full. Some sketches from the pilot are scattered through the series.</p>
<p>Although a sketch about a train being pushed by a giant appeared in the first series, the actual title of the show is derived from the song run during the credits, of which the writers were fond enough to name the show after it. The song "Big Train" was recorded by Max Greger and his Orchestra. This has since been adopted for a commercial by <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Trains_b928.html" title="Virgin Trains">Virgin Trains</a>.</p>
<p>Both series were shot entirely on location (series one on <a href="../../../3/5/m/35mm_film.html" title="35mm film">35mm film</a> and series two on <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digibeta.html#Digital_Betacam" title="Digibeta">DigiBeta</a>) and later shown to a live audience so that a laugh track could be recorded.</p>

He asks, good-naturedly, "You do know I'm an <i>evil</i> hypnotist?", and then treats the person by sending them into a trance like sleep. When the person wakes up and proves to have been cured, he cackles "It worked, <i>it worked</i>, mwahahahahaha!!", and his colleagues thank him for his help, which he accepts mildly.</li>

<li>Two monks dupe another monk into thinking one of them has been killed. When the duped monk is theorizing in full flow ("Death stalks these relics...etc") the "dead" monk in the background and the other monk burst out laughing, revealing their practical joke. The duped monk reacts with surprise, embarrassment and very mild annoyance. This was repeated in the second series, when two scientists dupe a co-worker into thinking they haven't found a cure for a lethal virus. Just as he starts to go into full-blown melodramatics ("May God have mercy on our souls, we have created a bastard chimera...") one of the joking scientists says "It has worked, really!" Again, the duped man is amused but embarrassed, but this time visibly relieved.</li>
