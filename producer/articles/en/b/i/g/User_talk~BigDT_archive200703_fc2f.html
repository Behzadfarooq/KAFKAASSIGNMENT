<dd>This is a content dispute. It isn't vandalism and it isn't tricks. Would you like for me to protect the article so that it can be worked out on the talk page instead of just reverting back and forth? The other option would be <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>. You could open a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comment</a> regarding the page. But it isn't vandalism to remove that passage and honestly, it really needs to be sourced better than just that one somewhat doubtful book. If a judge made a ruling, is there a link to the case somewhere? Are there any news articles? Anything? --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 07:11, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I visited John Funder page again and saw the relentless editing this time -in fact I was surprised to see your comments there as I had assumed you felt it did deserve to be there.But there still seems to be a dispute whether book can be cited.I read your comments and feel it may be best working it out on the talk page-let's see what Delhite feels.But I am worried at the general tenor of these edits emanating form Monash University IP's.Quite a few pages have suffered.(Delhite 06:48, 2 March 2007 (UTC))</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Responding to a comment</span></h2>
<p>You left a note on my talk page that I thought warranted a response: "Please be careful when saying "rvv" - rvv means "revert vandalism" and any effort to improve the encyclopedia - even if ill-conceived (like the thing about the T next to the V) is not vandalism. Also, despite what you see on Sabre, VT hasn't been known as VPI in 35 years."</p>
<p>My response is that I interpreted the additions regarding the vandalism of UVA's facilities as being vandalism here because of the timing of the additions, the fact that it was done right after ESPN mentioned it, the fact that it was verbatim in two articles, and the fact that it was not put in any VPI-related articles (which, if it were such a big part of a rivalry, it would be). My use of "rvv" in that context was a good-faith summary of how I interpreted the intent of the edit given the totality of the circumstances. It didn't have anything to do with the act itself being childish and stupid so much as it did with the combination of things I just noted; I mean, the thing in Scott Stadium was in 2005 and someone suddenly decides to add it the day after it was shown on ESPN. Fishy timing, that's all.</p>
<p>Regarding VPI, the school's name is still "Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State (sic) University," so "VPI" remains fully appropriate even if their administration has tried to distance themselves from it. I'm not going to revert it because I recognize you as a serious editor who makes good contributions and because I don't have a problem with you doing it, but I felt that it bears mention that I don't feel that I'm bound by the fact that VPI's administration would prefer us to call it something else, that's all.</p>

<dd>I realize that you used "rvv" in good faith ... I was just making the suggestion that it's inappropriate except in the case of "simple" <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a>, eg, adding "BOBBY IS A MORON" or something. Any edit that might at all be reviewable should have an edit summary. As for VPI, Wikipedia generally refers to institutions, people, etc, by their own self-identified name. Tech has not self-identified as VPI in 35 years. You can't go into the store and buy a VPI hat. Nobody outside of the Commonwealth of Virginia would recognize the name VPI. I realize that on Sabre, it's common to refer to us by our old-school name, but Wikipedia isn't a message board. But regardless of that, anyone should be referred to by their self-identified name or the most commonly accepted name. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 18:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I could not agree more with your comment about the trivial subjects that are vehemently included in Wikipedia. The question I ask myself if this is not due to a systemic error, maybe we should have debates for inclusion instead of debates for deletion like any other publication.

<p>Hi <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a>, I am saddened to see one in a billion Wikipedians leave the project. I have came here to you, because I wanted to know if you, or another administrator could let him know by email, still at this point, that I wanted to award him the Tireless Contributor Barnstar for filling so many roles on Wikipedia.(<a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrator</a>, Election Official, <a href="../../../b/u/r/Wikipedia%7EBureaucrats_5503.html" title="Wikipedia:Bureaucrats">Bureaucrat</a>, <a href="../../../o/v/e/Wikipedia%7EOversight_b3cf.html" title="Wikipedia:Oversight">oversight</a>, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CheckUser_policy" class="extiw" title="m:CheckUser_policy">checkuser</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">arbitrator</a>). I did not modify his talk page. He seemed like one of the most dedicated wikipedians to the project, and that won't be forgotten by me.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 03:57, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a>, it means a lot to me that I could do that. Now, it will remain a mystery wether he finds out about, because he might never look at his talk page again. Well, I believe he knows in spirit.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 04:26, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you go to your "my preferences" link and add your email address, to your preferences, then click "confirm my email" (or something like that - I forget exactly what the button says), then you will be able to send email to other Wikipedians. In the "toolbox" on the left side of your screen, there will be a link "E-mail this user" any time you are on another user's user page or talk page. You can use that link to send email to Essjay (or anyone else who has it setup for people to email them). Admins don't have access to anyone's email address - I can only email him exactly the same way that you can - use the "E-mail this user" link. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:29, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I actually thought at this point it might not be approprite to email him, but since you recommened it to me, I tried to, but he apparently didn't have an email. So, I disabled my email.

<p>I shortly enabled my email, but then I disabled it. Meaning, I saved my preferences without the email, shortly after I saved my preferences with the email address.(And I also followed the confirmation code as well.) From this point, I won't receive any leginamate emails from Wikipeida, but a message on my talk page instead, right?--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 16:31, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a>, and the way I look at it, <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a>'s impact on Wikipedia, and his characteristics of being a frienldy and dedicated person are still with us, and therefore, he is still with us, I think. That's a conforting way to feel when someone leaves. Maybe the Wikipedia community can do something to do just to honor him, like have Marsh 4 be Essjay day. If the community is thinking of that, could you keep me posted?(I hope you don't think that's too mushy. The reason why I'm asking is that it seems like many Wikipedians and administrators as well are sad about his departure, like I am.)--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 00:54, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the work with the Kyle Eckel article. The reason I had put he was terminated from his service at the academy is because he was working for the Navy at a position at the Academy.

<p>the last message is not confirmation. The Navy Times is a privately distributed newspaper. The Navy has no affiliation with the newspaper other then the word Navy in the title. This paper covers the Navy due to their own decision.</p>
<p>Again, the Navy is not responsible for anything published in the Navy Times. The United States Navy does not produce this paper. It is a private paper which covers the Navy. Much like how Sports Illustrated is not the official word for the NBA, NFL, MLB, etc</p>

<dd>I started working with the issue in response to a page protection request. A user was requesting s-protection to stop IP vandalism. Well, as it turns out, the IP was correctly removing unsourced inflammatory content. I have tried to get both sides to talk. The material that is being added is now a toned down version that is sourced with a book. (Unfortunately, there is no web version of it.) It's obvious, though, that this is going nowhere ... I have opened a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Biographies_b5b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Biographies">RFC</a> on the issue. I would consider protecting the page ... but honestly, both the IP and the user are rather singular in their purpose and I think that protecting it would do nothing - the party whose version is protected just wouldn't participate, content to leave it like it is. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:46, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Goodness ... take a look at his contributions. He left a lot of mess to clean up. He inserted a bunch of photos at the beginning of articles where it didn't make sense to add them. Going back over his last 20 or so edits, I don't see much that's useful - just a big mess to clean up. Indefinitely blocked doesn't necessarilly mean forever banned. If he is willing to stop and discuss what he is doing and address the problems with it, he can always be unblocked at some future time ... but as it is, I would consider this an emergency block. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_sig_6810.html" title="User:BigDT/sig">BigDT</a> 00:30, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So uploading photos that don't add anything is blockable, that's what I want to know.

<dl>
<dd>Essentially, yes. It really depends on what they are uploading. If they are uploading useless images, but otherwise making good faith edits, I would discuss the issue with them, rather than blocking. Explain that Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not free webhosting</a> and they should upload the contents of their camera to flickr instead of Wikipedia. If someone is just uploading their porn collection, though, I would block on sight. In this case, the user was repeatedly uploading untagged images and adding them inline in articles where they didn't belong. Personally, I would have tried to have a conversation with the person rather than blocking ... and I'm not thrilled that the first action taken was a block ... but it's one of those things that I'm not going to jump up and down too loudly about. I would say that uploading unsourced photos is not the same as a nonsense edit because the photos were, unquestionably, uploaded in good faith ... probably this is a very young child who just doesn't know what they are doing ... but if they are going to ignore the warnings, something has to be done. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_sig_6810.html" title="User:BigDT/sig">BigDT</a> 03:16, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The prohibition against editing protected pages (or editing pages just prior to protecting them) is because protection shouldn't be used to gain advantage in a content dispute. This wasn't a content dispute, though. Editing the page to remove personal attacks or to add appropriate user block templates is fine. Really, there's nothing useful there - the whole page could be blanked and replaced with {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsertalk-vprotect_27a4.html" title="Template:Usertalk-vprotect">Usertalk-vprotect</a>}}. To answer your question, though, yes, full protection is fine, particularly in this case. This individual is a sock of a banned user who has created many sock puppets - there's nothing wrong with blocking them on sight. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 01:42, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I am interested in joining this project. I currently update the Women's Basketball Championship games (in progress). I was wondering if you accept NIT tournaments as well!

<p>Hi <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a>, I wanted to know if it would be okay if I reverted a revision, if it hasn't already been, on <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopedist_b147.html" title="User:Encyclopedist">Encyclopedist</a>'s user page? It appears to me to be trolling from this user, because the edit was made by a suspected sock of Encyclopedist, and I see the same word <b>fascism</b> on the page aswell.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 04:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
