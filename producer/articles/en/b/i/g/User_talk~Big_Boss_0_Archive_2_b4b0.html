<p>I haven't heard anything about the revived ECW tag titles, but personally I think that it is a horrible idea. All of the tag teams in ECW were used to job to the Hardy Boyz. None of them have any credibility left. Also, the FBI is no more after they fired that Tony guy. As far as the Cruiserweight title goes, I foresee it being used in a major storyline soon. Well, major for that title anyway. It looks like they want to push Gregory Helms or the Boogeyman as a US Title contender, which I agree with since Gregory has great heel charisma, and he has a very interesting mix of cruiserweight athleticism and heavyweight moves. The Boogeyman has gotten over tremendously, and I think that he would be a popular US Champion, though not as popular as Benoit. My money is on Gregory for the push, though I don't see Boogeyman being forced to job for him cleanly since he is getting the typical monster push. However, they know that none of the other cruiserweights have any credibility after Gregory wiped the floor with all of them during the post Royal Rumble storyline. In my opinion, this is why they are going to break up London and Kendrick. They will have the typical former tag team feud, but it will be over the cruiserweight title. That will restore some credibility to the title, as well as present a feud that people can get into. They will probably have the Boogeyman scare Gregory in a match with some random Cruiserweight and get rolled up to loose his title. Then they'll bring the just broken up London and Kendrick into the mix while Gregory feuds with the Boogeyman. I don't think that they would just abandon the title, especially since Raw has the Women's belt. This is what I think will happen.

<p>Big guys who aren't big because of muscle mass should be kept in OVW until they loose the weight in my opinion. This job requires cardiovascular health to keep their matches from being mostly rest holds and/or absurdly short, and they just don't have it. Like you said, most of his matches have been squashes, meaning that he can move at his own pace and end it whenever he wants. Like you said, he has done nothing to earn a title shot. Cheers, -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 01:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that it would be a cool, but very predictable match. Both guys are very predictable in the ring. I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing, but when you put 2 predictable guys against each other after about 5 minutes it is easy to tell who will win.

<p>I have no idea who will win that. I would say Batista because of him vs. Taker at WM, but he could win it back at No Way Out. I would say Kennedy because of his consistent mega push ever since his debut, but losing the title at No Way Out would make him look transitional. I don't think Kennedy will go to WM because he has already feuded with the Undertaker, but you have to admit that Kennedy vs. Taker for the World Heavyweight title, Hell in a Cell sounds awesome. Bottom line, I don't know.

<p>Taker, but we will know by the end of the night. His contract says that he can win the Rumble or WM, but not both. If he wins, Batista goes over. If he looses, he becomes a 5 time world champion. Cheers, -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 02:18, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is in his contract that if he wins the Royal Rumble, he will loose at WM. He cannot win both. That means that if he wins the rumble tonight, Batista or whoever is the champion will go over at WM. However, since we basically know that he will be competing at WM, we can tell that if he looses the Rumble he will probably win at WM.

<p>Batista vs. Taker will probably happen. Cena vs. Edge vs. Orton has a shot, but my money is on either Cena vs. HBK, Cena vs. HBK vs. Edge, or Cena vs. HBK vs. Edge vs. Orton. And this is on our user talk pages, so it isn't vandalism.

<p>HBK, Edge, and a slim chance of Taker. My money is on HBK.

<p>To reply to your pre-Colbert response, finally, I don't think Cena will be joining DX, as he and HBK will be feuding till WrestleMania while being tag champs together. Anyway, I believe that the US Title is equal to the IC title because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is the title defended on the Smackdown midcard like the IC title is defended on Raw's midcard</li>
<li>It is listed next to the IC title on WWE.com</li>
<li>Both the World Heavyweight and WWE Tag Team Championships are interchangeable in the TC Championship, so common sense says that the US Title would be as well</li>
<li>Both the Big Show and JBL have been called TC Champions.

<p>Moe is around. Ever since I started forcing everyone to obey me on the Triple Crown page, which I regret having to do, he hasn't been saying much. He did make some minor edits to the article, and archive the talk page. He's around, but there really isn't much to be said anymore. Anyway, Cena may join DX, but I doubt it. He and Michaels will be feuding for a minimum of 2 months, but at WM they may join forces. I don't know, but I would like Cena to switch to a different gimmick, and DX could do that for him. He has a lot of talent, but his gimmick is preventing him from getting over with the smarks like has with everyone else. If he adopts the classic DX gimmick, not only will he be able to show off some more of his moves, but he will have a great gimmick, and still sell T-shirts&#160;;).

<p>If you are looking for me to join, I must respectfully decline. You and your nWo friends seem to have a nasty habit of violating image policies, and this whole thing appears to be some sort of game-which is also frowned upon. I have a reputation to maintain, as I am a serious contender to make admin sometime in the near future, and it would be bad for me to be associated with a group known to violate policy unapologetically. Nothing personal, but becoming admin is very important to me, and what I've done on the TC Championship page will be hard enough for me to defend. I hope you understand.

<p>You moved the page to Carlito (wrestler), but the original page name was Carly Colón. This created 3 different pages, 2 of them redirects. What you do to revert page move vandalism is access the mover's logs, find the appropriate move, and click the revert link next to it. You can find a link to the logs on the user's contributions page. Now, the problem with what you did was a result of you bringing a third page into the mix. This made it where I couldn't revert his edits since you had caused the page log to change since his last page move. This made it where I couldn't get the page back to Carly Colon with the history in tact. Only an admin, who could delete one of the redirects and then use it as a middle man, would be able to pull this off. I discovered this as I was trying to fix it. From now on just revert rather than try to move it back.

<dd>Hello! Rather than posting on to an individual admin's Talk page, you might want to know that any editor can issue a warning - only admins and Bureaucrats can block. This is to prevent requests from sitting on a sleeping admin's Talk page, letting an editor continue unheeded. Also, the <a href="../../../r/p/p/WP%7ERPP_5127.html" title="WP:RPP">requests for page protection</a> page would be a better place to go to take your business case.

<p>I would discourage you from making sockpuppets and taking up an extra account, but since their name would have been too similar to yours for them to have kept the name anyway you didn't hurt anything. Just be careful, as you are beginning to press your luck with - weeeeeeeell, let's just say <i>them</i>.

<p>I think that Big Boss 1 looks cool, but the same purpose could have been served with a user sub-page. Also, I have been watching you remove orphaned fair-use image warnings from your talk page and not add them to the archive. This is blatantly against the rules, but I was letting it slide since the person giving you the warnings had to be aware of it. However, I will not allow you to remove actual warnings like the one that was posted below and not add it to the archive. If you want to keep warnings hidden, do what the rest of us do and copy them into your archives. Of course, if you can avoid getting them that's even better.

<p>Can you <i>please</i> go find something useful to do with your time? You're focusing on attacking Ockenbock in any way possible. You just got yourself blocked on Uncyclopedia for the crap you're pulling there. Do you realize that the stuff you do there can have repercussions here? All you're doing on Wikipedia is worrying about Ockenbock, gossiping about the WWE, and making changes to your user page that you have to tell other users about. You have so few encyclopedia edits and instead focus on user space stuff. Wikipedia is first, and foremost, an encyclopedia...not somewhere for you to gossip about who will win in next week's main event or to declare war on blocked users. So, stop it and stop it now. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 02:39, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dang it! Yes, all of the vandal fighters know about Uncyclopedia, and we make a point of not doing battle there. <i><b>We don't want war.</b></i> Don't you get that? The most effective vandal fighting tool we have is boredom. We make vandalizing boring. If it doesn't entertain them anymore, then they leave. That is how Bowser Koopa got taken down; that is how WoW got taken down, and that is the most effective method of taking down all vandals. Revert, warn, block, and move on. This is not a war, and this is not a game. If you can't enjoy vandal fighting in a manor that doesn't provoke them to war, then do something else. I'm sorry to have to say this, but if you continue to cause disruptions in the Wikipedia community, even if they are not on Wikipedia itself, then I will stop you. You have tried the patience of the Orphaned Fair Use Image Patrol unapologetically, and now you are provoking the vandals to war. If you continue down this path, as much as it will hurt me to do so, I will stop you myself, and I will not show you mercy.

<p>You are still missing my point. I did find it a little suspicious that he was on wiki when I had no school. I uploaded those cards to give visual representation on what they looked like. They were counterfeit too so they have no copyright to my understanding (prove me wrong if you can). As far as provoking him I can't say that I did that. It is just how I normally deal with things. You however seem to have lost your spirit along the way. You have no passion in what you do and your userpage is just flaunting awards. Add some personality man! You should incorporate personal information and real life acomplishments to your userpage. Even some personal interests. You lack these and I suggest you add some color. Just having a page of awards is asking to get hit. Not to mention you are on a little bit of a high horse and you need to step down a little. But that's just me. I see debating wrestling fun and exciting. Specualtion makes it all the more fun and you may not delete it from talk pages. What I am saying is take a wikibreak and find your spirit. Get passionate about what you do and then come back. And maybe just maybe I'll forgive you. And if you are having Ockenbock problems send him to me.

<p>Big Boss 0, tons of us prefer to keep our daily lives out of our user space. I am no different. The only time my personal life comes into play is when it is relevant to the situation. All I give info on is what I do on Wikipedia, who I do it with, and what I have earned doing it, and I like it that way. It is better to not give people ammo to shoot at us with IMO. He may do it for a different reason, but I do it for wiki-safety. Just because you don't conform to this style doesn’t mean it is wrong for us to. It is our user-space, and we can do whatever we want with it.

<p>Hybrid you could never make me mad. For you or Moe to make me mad you would have to do something really extreme. (at the moment I can't think of what you guys would have to do to upset me.) But why the hell can't I have my PDL information on wikipedia? Please tell me. And as far as you becoming an administrator you have my <b>full</b> support. You have been such a large help to me that there is nothing that I can do to repay you. That is my most sincere statement. And I need to test if my e-mail works. Could you help me with that?

<p>I have an idea to resolve the Triple Crown Champion dispute. A science teacher at my school (who I have had in the past) has written to Triple H and got a letter back from him. I could ask him to write a letter to HHH once again. Since he is so high up in the company we might be able to get an answer faster. What do you think? Big Boss 0 02:36, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have noticed that you have been on my and Hybrid's usertalk pages. Knock it off already. You do not seem to know how to carry on a conversation. Opinions about wrestling between fans makes it even better. Then again you aren't a WWE fan so you wouldn't know. Get your own life instead of trying to babysit other users who do not need your help. You are acting a little childish. Leave me alone! You are no longer welcome with me so I suggest you stear clear altogether.

<p>I'll respond to the other things in a minute.</p>
<ul>
<li>As far as asking your teacher to write HHH, go for it.</li>
<li>Metros232 and I share a mutual respect and many common goals, and if we choose to talk to each other that is our business, so don't be offended by it. It isn't uncommon for 2 respected users to communicate when there is a solution that needs to be found to a problem that affects both of them.</li>
<li>I'm glad that you aren't upset.</li>
<li>It is perfectly fine for us to "gossip" about wrestling on our talk pages as long as we do enough things to help out the project as well. You need to do more to help Wikipedia in order to balance out what we are doing.</li>
<li>I'm not sure this is what you were just talking about, but regardless leave Ockenbock alone. You do not need any answers from him. He is a vandal who attempted to go out with a bang like so many of them do, and Metros can handle the situation without your help. That is why he made admin.</li>
<li>Sorry, but I would have blocked you for a week had I been in Metros' position. The disruptions that you were causing on Uncyclopedia were having direct effects on the Wikipedia community, you admitted to causing them, and you had an extensive history of Fair Use Image vandalism with countless warnings about them. Metros was simply doing his job, and rather than hold it against him you should be thanking him for showing you mercy for as long has he did, and not giving you a longer block. You are being very rude to a user who has shown you so much grace in spite of your bratty personality towards him. He waited <i>forever</i> to block you. He could have indef-blocked you for your image vandalism long ago, and I probably would have.</li>
<li>I'll read over the user space policies again, but I'm pretty sure that you will not be allowed to keep your PDL info.

<p>Umaga, they are giving him a mega-push. He has gotten over as a monster heel, and he is able to make the power moves look really devastating. Vince also likes to push big guys. It has worked for him enough times in the past (Undertaker for one example) for him to keep trying it. Umaga also has a fair amount of experience as a member of 3 minute warning, so he knows how to handle himself fairly well.
