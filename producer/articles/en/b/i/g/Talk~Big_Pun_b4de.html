Big Pun even went as far as deriding 50 Cent on his song "My Turn" on his second album <i><a href="../../../y/e/e/Yeeeah_Baby_2b06.html" title="Yeeeah Baby">Yeeeah Baby</a></i>. The issues between Big Pun and <i>Fiddy</i> were said to have started when 50 Cent rapped about robbing Big Pun in his song "How To Rob" on his unreleased album <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_of_the_Dollar_3b42.html" title="Power of the Dollar">Power of the Dollar</a>. Big Pun responded to 50 Cent's lyrics on the final verse of his song "My Turn" by warning 50 Cent that he would "blow" Fiddy's "motherfuckin' head off".</p>
<p>There is also the feud, or "beef", between Big Pun and <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay-Z_fefb.html" title="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>. The story, though never verified, goes as follows: Jay-Z was performing drunk at a New York club (the name of which has never been confirmed) when Big Pun, Fat Joe, and <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuban_Link_8a73.html" title="Cuban Link">Cuban Link</a> got on stage and told Jay-Z to get off, so that <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terror_Squad_5d98.html" title="Terror Squad">Terror Squad</a> could perform their set. It was then said that a drunken and angered Jay-Z punched Fat Joe and was then knocked on the head with a bottle of champagne by Pun. After the altercation, Big Pun and Jay-Z were said to have shot several subliminal disses at each other before Pun's premature death. On Pun's hit single "100%" from his sophomore album <i>Yeeeah Baby</i>, Pun rapped:</p>

<p>which many <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_Hop_d47d.html" title="Hip Hop">Hip Hop</a> critics say not only was a dissent at Jay-Z, but also meant to clarify the whole New York-club-dispute rumor. Another part of the story is that Big Pun's debut album <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital_Punishment_%28album%29_6acb.html" title="Capital Punishment (album)">Capital Punishment</a></i> was nominated for a 1999 Best Rap Album <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy.html" title="Grammy">Grammy</a>, yet lost that award to Jay-Z's <a href="../../../h/a/r/Vol._2%7E_Hard_Knock_Life_f679.html" title="Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life">Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life</a> album, which could possibly have sparked Pun's initial dislike of Jay-Z.</p>

<dd>There's no reason to have a rivalry section. 50 Cent dissed countless artists on "how to rob", you mean to say that he has rivalries with Brian Mcknight, Puffy, Slick Rick, Rza, Heavy D and Kirk Franklin? He makes one reference to Pun out of a dozen people, and Pun makes one reference back, and that was the end of it. If it was a rivalry, Cuban Link (Pun's best friend) wouldn't have asked Game to be on his album when he was down with G-Unit (and when G-Unit thought about signing Link).</dd>

<p>The Jay-Z rumor is made up. The fact that that you start the paragraph off by saying that its a story that has never been verified is reason alone to leave it out. Its an old rumor. I know its not true, but feel free to try to find citations for it somewhere (you wont because there was no rivalry or incident). I'm going to continue removing the rivalry section if you add it, wikipedia isn't a rumor mill.</p>

Then his wife gets on a DVD talking about that he use to beat her up and try to damge his image.

<p>Sorry but that sounds like a conspiracy theory to me, I suppose if you isolated and looked at those circumstances together you might think theres foul play, but I honestly think that either A. shes just trying to get attention or maybe reparations from his family(?) or B. there could be some basis for his claims, im not saying Big Pun is a wifebeater but although he was a great rapper he was only human. To me there are too many 'what ifs' to start speculating if she had something to do with his death. -scass</p>

<p>"Big Pun is considered among the last real gangsta rappers and rappers in general, along with rappers such as DMX. before the Public attention turned to other rap genres such as hip-pop, dirty south rap, and the Eminem/50 Cent/G-Unit era."</p>
<p>This statement is heavily biased and is totally personal opinion. Big Pun and DMX are/were rap artists with plenty of popularity and acclaim but they are just 2 out of many, that they are the 'last real gangsta rappers and rappers in general' is an opinion, and has no place on the page. Also, what exactly is this 'Eminem/50 Cent/G-Unit era" ?? These artists have enjoyed popularity in mainstream culture, but I hardly think their fame represents an era of hip hop music.</p>
<p>Big Pun wasn't even a 'gangsta' rapper. He was known for his lyricism and flow, and though he did rap about the typical cliche's, he can't be considered a 'gangsta' rapper. Also, what the hell does DMX have to do anything here? He's a legend and one of the greatest for his lyrical compelexity, and so by talking about him being a 'gangsta' rapper, is just taking away from his legacy, and isn't the truth.</p>
<p>Big Pun was a gangsta rapper who ever says his not was clearly miss informed.. He settled hes beef through rap and if he had to get physical. He Lyrics were just explaining his person. I would expect him to fabricate his life. Cause if you listen to his track My turn he spoke on beef with 50 for talking shit on his track how to rob. there are rumors that Pun pressed him on it. Just like there rumors that Pun hit Jayz in the head with a bottle of Crystal. So to say he Ryhmes were a tending to the cliche is an insult to his person. He is the best lyrical gansta rapper. Hes technique still has no match. People just bite off his shit</p>

<p>Pun is my 2nd favorite Rapper of all time. I can only put Nas over him, and that's mainly cause he was in the game longer and has a lot more albums. Pun could destroy anyone lyrically.

<p>Theres Proof (and I don't mean the one from D12). November 9th (without the "TH" words, just trying to say it how I'm saying it now) is his birthday. They showed it after his video.</p>
<p>So? There's also 'proof' saying his birthday is November 10th. Look in the album book to "Yeeeah Baby".--<a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETainted_Drifter_beba.html" title="User:Tainted Drifter">Tainted Drifter</a> 19:59, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>can anyone confirm that another pun album is being considered?</p>
