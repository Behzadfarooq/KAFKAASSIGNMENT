<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Croatia_3_ca36.html" title="Edit section: Week 1">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Week 1</span></h2>
<p><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p>The houseguests entered the house in the following order: Yameisy, Mathias, Lea, Ante, Ana, Danijel, Romina, Zoran, Tanja, Niksa, Violeta and Simon. During the live show, host Antonija Blace revealed the season's first twist. In the first two seasons of Big Brother Croatia, the houseguests were divided into men's and women's bedrooms. This year, the bedrooms would have both sexes sleeping in the same bedroom. The houseguests were divided into two rooms: a brown room and a purple room. Yameisy, Mathia, Ana, Danijel, Zoran and Tanja are sleeping in the brown room. Lea, Ante, Romina, Niksa, Violeta and Simon are sleeping in the purple room. The second twist was added. Antonija announced that on Friday, two new houseguests will be joining them.</p>
<p><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p>Big Brother proved to be more evil this year, punishing the first houseguest on only day two. Niksa was caught with his microphone off, so Big Brother took 5,000 kunas away from the houseguests' weekly budget. The daily task was to wrestle with their bodies covered in oil. The two rooms would face each other and the room with the most victories wins. The prize would be important because the prize will judge what their role would be in the weekly task. Romina was later wearing her microphone incorrectly, so Big Brother punished her. Big Brother also informed the houseguest that in the storage room there was a Big Brother Store that's opened 24 hours a day. The houseguests' budget was put on a Visa credit card and they could buy whatever they want whenever they want, as long as they had the money. For their first week, the houseguests received 1,200 to spend on items. If the houseguests get something from the shop without paying, Big Brother will evict them from the house immediately. Once again, BB took away 5,000 kunas when he caught Yameisy with her microphone off.</p>
<p><b>Day 3</b></p>
<p>The houseguests received their first weekly task. The first weekly task is called " Summer Vacation". In the task, the houseguests could only make three mistakes all together. If they make more than three mistakes, then they fail the task. Also, the result of yesterday's task, "Battle of the Bedrooms" decided what roles the houseguests would have in this week's task. The winners would become tourists who will enjoy in all of the luxuries of a vacation, while the losers will be the servers who will grant every one of the tourists' wishes. The tourists were: Violeta, Romina, Lea, Niksa, Simon and Ante. The servers were: Yameisy, Ana, Tanja, Mathias, Danijel and Zoran. For the entire week, the only people who are allowed to cook and bring drinks are the servers. If one of the tourists makes his own meal, cleans the table after eating or prepares anything in the Big Brother House, it will count as a mistake. The servers should be the last people to go to sleep, after the last tourist goes to bed, so the tourists won't have to break any of the rules. If all of the servers are asleep and the tourists need something that only the servers could do, they need to wake one of the servers up and ask them to do it for them. Only the servers could buy things from the Big Brother Shop. Also, every morning there is aerobics time in the Big Brother House. The servers MUST take part in the aerobics, while the tourists could choose whether or not they want to do it. The houseguests decided to bi 30% of their weekly budget on this task. Lea was also given a secret mission from Big Brother. Big Brother told Lea that with her behavior, she has to try to get the housemates to nominate her. She can't give this task to anyone else and she can't tell any other houseguest about her secret mission or else she will be automatically nominated on Friday. If she succeeds in her mission, she wins immunity and she won't be nominated. Lea went right to work, yelling at Romina as soon as she got out of the Diary Room. Lea also continued her mission by begging to strip naked for Danijel, by which Zoran felt uncomforatable. Another 5000 kunas was taken away from the houseguests budget because Niksa didn't have his microphone on. Another new twist was introduced called The Parallel Weekly Task. Basically, the houseguests would have two weekly tasks in the same week. For this weekly task, BB made 9 men-women pairs for each day. On a certain sound signal, which would go off 9 times a day, the pair has to sit at the table. Then they would set the clock at three minutes. During those three minutes, each houseguest will have to ask their partner the questions on the table. After the six minutes are done, the houseguest has to say what he or she has learned about their partner.</p>
<p><b>Day 4</b></p>
<p>The houseguests were told that two new houseguests would enter on Friday. One would be a male, the other a female. Big Brother will show four profiles of possible candidates to enter the Big Brother House for the current houseguests. Every houseguest will choose one male houseguest and one female houseguest secretly in the Diary Room to enter the house. The two houseguests with the most votes become the new houseguests on Friday. It was also Ante's birthday, so the house had a big party that night. The party included Ante playing the guitar and the rest of the houseguests singing along.</p>
<p><b>Day 5</b></p>
<p>There was a fight in the house between Mathias and Violeta because Mathias got angry at Violeta for taking two pieces of meat to eat for dinner, instead of just one like everyone else.</p>
<p><b>Day 6</b></p>
<p>The daily task was to vote for Miss and Mister Big Brother 3. Yameisy was crowned Miss Big Brother 3, while Ante was crowned Mister Big Brother 3.</p>
<p><b>Day 7</b></p>
<p>The houseguests would vote for which houseguest they want to enter the house the next day. The voting was kept secret from the other houseguests. The houseguests aren't allowed to tell anyone which houseguest they voted in, even after the new houseguests enter the house.</p>
