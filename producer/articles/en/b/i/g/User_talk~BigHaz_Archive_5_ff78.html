<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fyra Bugg &amp; en Coca Cola</span></h2>
<p>Why did you moved the article "<a href="../../../f/y/r/Fyra_Bugg_%26_en_Coca_Cola_%28song%29_9053.html" title="Fyra Bugg &amp; en Coca Cola (song)">Fyra Bugg &amp; en Coca Cola</a>" to "<a href="../../../b/o/o/Boogaloo_%28song%29.html" title="Boogaloo (song)">Boogaloo</a>"? Have you ever heard it? If, which version? The title "Boogaloo" was only used in the 1987 Eurovision Song Contest. It had to do with advertising rules. The original song text ("Fyra Bugg &amp; en Coca Cola") was also used in Melodifestivalen, and played at Svensktoppen. Lotta Engberg performs the song "Fyra Bugg &amp; en Coca Cola" with the original name on albums and concerts. When played on the radio in the Nordic countries, the original version is used. The "Boogaloo text" is also in Swedish, as the original text. This text is in Eglish: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/fyra_bugg/text1.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/fyra_bugg/text1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/fyra_bugg/text1.htm</a> also exists, but I have never heard it. I am not sure many young people today know anything about the "Boogaloo" text. I mean, look at the article <a href="../../../9/_/t/9_to_5_%28Sheena_Easton_song%29_b15c.html" title="9 to 5 (Sheena Easton song)">9 to 5 (Sheena Easton song)</a> for example, which not is named "Morning Train" just because it's more known as "Morning Train" at one place outside it's home country. Also, the text "Fyra Bugg &amp; en Coca Cola" today is known and remembered for describing 1980s culture.</p>
<p><i>Fyra Bugg och en Coca Cola, spela freestyle med fräck musik</i></p>
<p>means:</p>

<dd>I know what it means and I'm aware of the history. I moved it because the song is officially (in ESC terms, if not anything else) known as "Boogaloo". It can be called whatever it wants in Swedish, or in any other language for that matter. When I get to the Swedish ESC entries, I'll tidy it all up.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As a comparison, was Albania's 2004 entry called "The Image Of You" or "Imazhi Yt"? The former title was performed for the world audience in Istanbul, yet the latter title won the Festivali I Kenges. I'll take the title more widely known any day of the week. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:56, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>

<dd>That Albanian song never had this background story. Many countries re-write the songs into English for the ESC so more people can understand what they sing, which was forbidden back in 1987 when all countries had to sing in their own languages. Lotta Engberg still sang in Swedish at the 1987 ESC, it was just a re-written text. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan1982_5dd8.html" title="User:Johan1982">Johan1982</a>) 20:10, 19 October 2006 (CET)
<dl>
<dd>No, the relevant facts are still the same. A song wins the national final under one title and is performed at ESC under another one. The fact that both titles were performed in the one language is immaterial. I've just recently done some work on the Luxembourgish entries, for example, and Vicky Leandros' "L'Amour Est Bleu" originally existed as an article under the title "Love Is Blue". This wasn't the title it was performed under on the ESC stage, and neither was "Boogaloo" called "Fyra Bugg &amp; en Coca-Cola" when performed. The article explains the title change adequately (and I'll look at it more carefully when I'm doing the Swedish entries to make sure that it says what it needs to say). This being the English-language Wikipedia, are people more likely to know the title under which it was performed at the ESC or the title under which it won the Melodifestivalen? As with all other songs with title changes, I'll take the ESC version. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 21:43, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The way you rewrote it, um, because of you are unfamiliar with the actual event, it's actually false in context and misleading in many parts.

<dd>I wasn't quite sure whether NPOV was the only problem when I posted that first comment. On a cursory look, it actually needed more than that, but in the event NPOV looks to have been the major point of contention. It looked a bit like a translation, which since it's from Chinese sources my hat goes off to you. I'll keep an eye on the page as well and see if there's anything which can be tweaked a bit, but I'll lay off any wholsale fixes unless you give me the go-ahead (or unless there are readily-available English sources I can consult to help with it). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:32, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. At the time my vote was cast, that wasn't the case.

<dd><b>Context Note:</b> As it turns out, TJ Spyke's claim was inaccurate. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">User:JoshuaZ</a> had marked the proposal as rejected, but other users (<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a> among them) have argued that the proposal remains very much live. Indeed, there appears to have been some creative number-crunching to argue that the proposal had been live for 2 years, rather than just over 2 months, which would've made it much deader than it actually is. Still, I believe that the proposal is flawed in that it allows for schools which are themselves probably less than notable but happen to have famous alumni (Girraween being one such) to get articles. I'm not and never will be a school-inclusionist for the simple reason that I think there are more constructive things to be, but I felt at the time that this one mightn't have got a fair hearing. The fact that proposal chicanery appears to have been used suggests that I may well have been justified in that assumption. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:26, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rugby League in Canada</span></h2>
<p>First, thanks for helping me with the wikipedia information on how to sort everything. Second, could you please read either the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_Canada_Super_League_e828.html" title="Rugby Canada Super League">Rugby Canada Super League</a> page on wikipedia or the link you sent me, as it is an entirely separate sport (rugby union) and therefore irrelevent to the debate. It would be like using the NFL Europe as proof that Canadian football's played in Germany. I know the name is confusing, but in Canada they only know one rugby and a Super League is a natural name for a sporting competition. I take it living in Brisbane you know the difference? Whether the article should stay for historical reasons, or in case rugby league refers to Canada, I do not know. But there is not a shred of evidence for a single rugby league match in Canada since 2003, and evidence that the competition has stopped.James Bowes 15:30, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Point taken. The link wasn't loading properly for me at the time I posted it, so I could only go on the evidence I had - which was that it had been used in a previous AfD as well as that it said "Canadian", "Rugby" and "League". I see now that you're quite right, that it's in fact a union competition rather than a league one. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:37, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can say that as much as you like, but usage patterns prove otherwise. You're yet to provide a shred of evidence that you're doing anything but vote-stacking, spamming and generally being disruptive. Just saying "there are other ways to take the evidence" is pointless without showing how they can be taken that way. Just saying "there are other users who use my computer" is pointless without an explanation of why these other users act exactly like you (do you have an evil twin? That's about the best alternative explanation I can think of). Just saying that this has been "blown way out of proportion" is also pointless, since the processes you've been involved in (AfD, RfA etc) are important around here, and disrupting them is serious in any way, particularly this one. I do hope you learn your lesson from this and decide to contribute within the rules, but I think you'll need to admit wrongdoing first and foremost. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:26, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Context Note:</b> Le Grand Roi is in fact now blocked for six weeks due to his activities. What I'd originally thought was simply a case of someone misunderstanding AfD etiquette turned out to be a case of widespread disruption, including to two RfAs. I was prepared to classify this as a case of overzealous inclusionism, but that simply wasn't the case. The lack of a viable alternative explanation or (more usefully) any sort of acceptance of wrongdoing in this case is of some concern. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 02:53, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's no category for that, actually. The idea is that if something was Speedied or Prod'ed and comes back, we're supposed to think "Oh, so someone <i>did</i> object to the deletion".

<dd>Okay, thanks fpr the clarifacation. Also, your userboxes seem to contradict your comprehension of Arabic. Just thought I'd give you a heads-up. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reaves_5821.html" title="User:John Reaves">John Reaves</a></dd>

<dd>Funnily enough, they don't. I can <i>read</i> the Arabic script (and tell you that this word says "zakat" or "Oman" or whatever) perfectly. In terms of being able to contribute at all in that language or use Arabic sources for my own articles, I have zilch comprehension. My vocabulary is so minute that when vowel marks are removed I can make an educated guess about maybe one word in a sentence. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:27, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>'s all good. In a way, you kind of touched on a bit of a raw nerve without realising it.
