<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html" title="Edit section: Secret Nominations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Secret Nominations</span></h3>
<p>A fundamental and strongly-enforced rule of <i>Big Brother Australia</i> is that <a href="#Nominations" title="">nominations, and the use the <i>Three Point Twist</i></a>, are not to be discussed at all. Specifically, all housemates are forbidden from disclosing who they have previously nominated, who they plan to nominate in the future, or who their <i>Three Point Twist</i> has been used on; and they must not engage in conjecture about who may attract nomination votes and why. These discussions are banned and are deemed collusion by Big Brother, as they may give housemates a competitive advantage. Breaking this rule incurs fines, punishment, or loss of the right to nominate in the following round.</p>

<p>Every series of <i>Big Brother Australia</i> has included "Intruders": new housemates added to the house by the show's producers as an on-going housemate after the series has started.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html" title="Edit section: Location">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Location</span></h3>
<p>The purpose-built Big Brother house/studio is located at <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreamworld.html" title="Dreamworld">Dreamworld</a>, a theme park attraction in Coomera - a suburb of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Coast%2C_Queensland_ffa7.html" title="Gold Coast, Queensland">Gold Coast</a>. The interior of the house is rebuilt between TV seasons (Jan-Apr). Filming runs from Apr-Aug. The House is open for inspection Aug-Dec each year. When not in use for filming, Dreamworld visitors can take self-guided tours through the House and the camera runs, and have a photo taken in the famous Diary Room chair. While the exterior of the House is nothing more than a white tin shed, the interior is a fully functional house that is home to over 20 contestants on the show for 14 weeks each year. The interior walls are lined with two-way mirrors allowing dozens of cameras to capture every angle of the house.</p>
<p>Only slight modifications were made to the house for the second season and the special <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_Big_Brother_Australia_c42b.html" title="Celebrity Big Brother Australia">Celebrity Big Brother Australia</a> series that were conducted in 2002. Subsequent to those seasons the House has either been rebuilt or extensively re-modeled for each new series. In some seasons the house has been re-configured mid-series revealing previously hidden additional function rooms or private areas. Two houses were built for <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2003_87f9.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2003">Big Brother 2003</a>, and they were merged 23 days into the season when previously hidden connecting rooms were revealed.</p>
<p>Footage from the house is monitored and edited in Dreamworld Studios 24/7, an open-air auditorium where live audience orientated shows such as Evictions and Nominations are staged. During the series, Dreamworld visitors can tour the stage and watch the production team, Southern Star Endemol at work and also view live footage from the house.</p>
<p>The auditorium that is now part of Big Brother Studios was an existing facility at Dreamworld a long time before Big Brother began, and was used for live stage shows. It is now leased to Endemol/Southern Star for the duration of the series each year. The current contract gives Endemol Southern Star use of the Studios and Big Brother House until 2009.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html" title="Edit section: Theme music">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theme music</span></h3>
<p>The theme is titled <i>Big Brother theme</i>, and was adapted from the original theme used in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Netherlands%29_d105.html" title="Big Brother (Netherlands)">the first ever series of Big Brother</a>, aired in the Netherlands. The theme for Big Brother Australia was written by Siew Ooi and 001 Productions in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. The track is an extended version of the main title theme used in the first two seasons of Big Brother Australia, and tracks heard throughout the seasons that followed are shorter, remixed versions of this track. The original track can sometimes be heard in the background when eviction votes, or the nomination tally in the <a href="#Nominations" title="">Nominations</a> show, are shown on screen, or when eviction phone numbers are announced during a show.</p>
<p>The title theme was initially released as a single. The track was an extended mix of the main title theme used in the first two seasons, and was released with an acoustic "Diary Room" mix and more trance influenced "Eviction" mix. It barely scraped in the top 50, but was re-released a few months later where it reached #12 on the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Recording_Industry_Association_b52a.html" title="Australian Recording Industry Association">ARIA</a> charts in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> with a B-Side of The Sirens' hit "Don't You Think That It's Strange", which was also co-written by <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2001_ac53.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2001"><i>Big Brother 2001</i></a> housemates; the <i>Diary Room</i> mix; and an extended version of the <a href="#Uncut_.2F_Adults_Only" title=""><i>Big Brother Uncut</i></a> theme.</p>

<p><i><b>Big Brother: UpLate</b></i> is a late-night show screened every weeknight throughout each <i>Big Brother</i> series.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html" title="Edit section: Nominations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nominations</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Big Brother Nominations</b></i> is aired on Monday evenings after the <i><a href="#Daily_Show" title="">Daily Show</a></i>. <i>Nominations</i> airs footage of the housemates as they each decide in the <i>Diary Room</i> who they would like to nominate for eviction. In the first series of Big Brother, there was no special show for nominations; they were simply shown as a part of the <i>Daily Show</i> on Tuesday evening. Housemates also did not have to give reasons for their nominations during the first season. Nominations were not live during <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2005_ceb9.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2005"><i>Big Brother 2005</i></a>, but the announcement of who would be up for eviction was.</p>
<p>Housemates each have three points to appoint to two other housemates. Their first nomination appoints two nomination points to a housemate, the second gives another housemate one point. If Big Brother feels a housemate's nomination is not clear and consise, he can give the nominating housemate one point. The three housemates with the highest number of points are revealed to the House. In the case of a third place tie, all those tying for third place would be eligible for eviction, on these occasions more than three housemates would be up for eviction.</p>
<p>An innovation introduced in <i>Big Brother 2005</i> was the <i>Three Point Twist</i> whereby the winner of <a href="#Friday_Night_Live" title=""><i>Friday Night Live</i></a> must subtract three nomination points from one of the nominated housemates. If they themselves are included in the original lineup of potential evictees they may opt to subtract the points from themself. This occurs after the initial nominations have been announced to all housemates, and while housemates may not discuss which housemate they remove points from, where the line-up changes it is often clear which housemate has had their nomination points deducted. The three housemates with the highest number of nomination points after the <i>Three Point Twist</i> will face eviction. Again in the case of a third place tie, more than three housemates may be up for eviction. The <i>Three Point Twist</i> got its name as part of a sponsorship deal with KFC.</p>

<p>Housemate evictions occur in a program titled <i><b>Big Brother Live Eviction</b></i>. The housemate who has attracted the most viewer votes to evict is evicted. The eviction shows are televisied each Sunday night at 7:30 p.m. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Eastern_Standard_Time_19f8.html" title="Australian Eastern Standard Time">Australian Eastern Standard Time</a>. Actual proceedings start a short time before 7:30 p.m. in front of a live audience at Dreamworld. These shows are hosted by Gretel Killeen and are broadcast live. In this show usually one housemate, but occasionally two, is evicted from the house, usually at around 8:00 p.m.. Shows that feature two evictions are called <i>Double Eviction</i>. The first Australian <i>Double Eviction</i>, described in advertising <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperbole.html" title="Hyperbole">hyperbole</a> as a world first, took place during <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2002_eafd.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2002"><i>Big Brother 2002</i></a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2006_2c72.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2006"><i>Big Brother 2006</i></a> added the <i>save</i> vote, allowing viewers to vote to <i>save</i> a housemate as well as <i>evict</i>; in the final tally housemates' save votes and evict votes are merged.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2004_c1f6.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2004"><i>Big Brother 2004</i></a>, after the eviction of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bree_Amer_f36c.html" title="Bree Amer">Bree Amer</a> due to a vote-counting error, a special eviction was held on the following Thursday evening.

<p>The winner of the overall games is rewarded with three prizes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two nights in the rewards room with a fellow housemate of their choice,</li>
<li>Assigning the chores for the week (eg. Shopper/Chef, Farmhand, Housekeeper, Gardener), and</li>

A fourth prize was added for the winner, they are presented with three boxes, each containing a prize, and may choose one box, not knowing what any of the boxes contains. The three boxes are themed on a specific country, and the three boxes featured a holiday to that country after the conclusion of the competition, a privlege that may be used within the house (such as laundry services or a special dinner), and a booby prize. Booby prizes have included a <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_tie.html" title="Bow tie">bow tie</a> and a chunk of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camembert_%28cheese%29.html" title="Camembert (cheese)">Camembert cheese</a>.</p>

They then had the entire park to themselves for a night. The winner on this occasion was Gaelan, who invited Krystal to share in his prize. On a second occasion, the winner of <i>Friday Night Live</i>, Jamie, was given the four usual prizes, and a fifth "mystery prize". The prize involved Jamie and the person he invited to the Rewards Room, Chris, leaving the House to get a first go on FlowRider, a new ride at Dreamworld.</p>

This mainly consisted of footage of the housemates showering, general risqué behaviour, and discussions about sexual matters. Each episode was one hour long. During the early seasons of <i>Big Brother</i> it aired at 9:30 p.m. on Thursday nights. It later switched to 9:30 p.m. Monday nights, and then 9:40 p.m. Monday nights. It was rated <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_rating_system.html#Australia" title="Television rating system">MA15+</a> (Mature Audiences - 15 Years or older), and hosted by <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gretel_Killeen_9bc5.html" title="Gretel Killeen">Gretel Killeen</a>.</p>
<p>The 2006 series of <i>Big Brother: Adults Only</i> ended early after politicians warned Network Ten that its screening of the show could harm its push for media reforms.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The last episode of <i>Adults Only</i> was aired on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_19.html" title="June 19">19 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>

The housemates' seemingly ingenuine positive reaction to the new show was aired during a <a href="#Daily_Show" title=""><i>Daily Show</i></a>.</li>
<li>During <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2003_87f9.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2003"><i>Big Brother 2003</i></a>, housemates were given a task to count a large bowl of <a href="../../../m/%26/m/M%26M%27s_a680.html" title="M&amp;M's">M&amp;M's</a>, a major sponsor for the series.</li>

<li>During <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2005_ceb9.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2005"><i>Big Brother 2005</i></a>, housemates were required to take Tango dancing lessons and were treated to a special viewing of the film <i><a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._%26_Mrs._Smith_%282005_film%29_6db8.html" title="Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</a></i>. Other <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_Fox_3a0c.html" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> tie ins included a "favourite fantastic four" housemates competition, linked to the <i><a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantastic_Four_%282005_film%29_43ae.html" title="Fantastic Four (2005 film)">Fantastic Four</a></i> film. In one episode, approximately ten minutes of the <a href="#UpLate" title=""><i>UpLate</i></a> show focused solely on the use of a mobile phone which had been provided by one of the show's major sponsors. Almost all food products in the house came from a food company with commercial agreements with the show production company. Any food that did not have a sponsorship agreement had its label removed.</li>
<li>The use of <a href="../../../3/_/%28/3_%28telecommunications%29.html" title="3 (telecommunications)">3</a> video phones was heavily emphasised during <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2006_2c72.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2006"><i>Big Brother 2006</i></a>, with housemates having short video calls with friends at their <a href="#Eviction" title=""><i>Eviction</i></a> with <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gretel_Killeen_9bc5.html" title="Gretel Killeen">Gretel</a>; housemates sometimes being given the opportunity to see something that's happened on the outside world from inside the <i>Diary Room</i>; and evicted housemates being given two video phones, as well as money and a holiday, as prizes for being in the Big Brother House. A winner of <a href="#Friday_Night_Live" title=""><i>Friday Night Live</i></a> and the person he invited to the <i>Rewards Room</i> were also provided with an EyeCam - a wireless mobile webcam that can be viewed from a 3 phone via a video call - so that two new replacement housemates that had entered the House near the end of the series could "have the <i>Rewards Room</i> experience" from the <i>Diary Room</i>. After this, EyeCams were given as an additional prize to evicted housemates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other criticisms are aimed at the program including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home viewer competitions not being open to the residents of <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Australia_b9ad.html" title="South Australia">South Australia</a>, the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Territory_b19a.html" title="Northern Territory">Northern Territory</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australia_84d0.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a> due to timezone differences. However this has been rectified with a new competition in the 2005 series called <i>Hammer Down</i> which enables all residents of Australia to enter.

<li>Telephone costs associated with housemate evictions.</li>
<li>The content of its <a href="#Uncut_.2F_Adults_Only" title=""><i>Uncut</i></a> shows, which during the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_2005_ceb9.html" title="Big Brother Australia 2005">2005 series</a> was said by some commentators to border on pornography, with graphic depictions of masturbation (the girls used a hose in the sauna to "get themselves off"), constant nudity, and mistaken allegations that one male housemate rubbed his penis in a female housemate's hair.

<p>The fifth (2005) series of <i>Big Brother</i> was heavily promoted with a "sexy" theme. This series emphasised young, good looking housemates who were willing to have relations in public. The actions of the housemates gave rise to complaints from politicians and conservative family groups.</p>
<p>The following instances of Uncut footage gained the most publicity during the 2005 series:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Day 4 during a birthday party for housemate Michelle, many of the housemates had a game of "<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spin_the_bottle.html" title="Spin the bottle">spin the bottle</a>" in the spa while drunk. The game featured same-sex kisses.</li>
<li>Many of the male housemates casually told racist jokes until viewers complained and producers put a strict ban on racist language.</li>
<li>Housemates Michelle and Glenn spent a night in an isolated room and bathed together naked. <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol_Southern_Star_7303.html" title="Endemol Southern Star">Endemol Southern Star</a> released a press statement suggesting the couple may have had sex. It was later revealed they did not.</li>
<li>Housemate Michael massaged housemate Gianna's shoulders while standing closely behind her and exposing his penis.</li>
<li>Some of the male housemates created a crude song about scat sexual fetishes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following complaints by the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Family_Association_818a.html" title="Australian Family Association">Australian Family Association</a>, parliament member <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trish_Draper_7c52.html" title="Trish Draper">Trish Draper</a> voiced her concerns over the show's influence on children.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> The story was quickly scooped up by mainstream media and rival commercial networks <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Network_cc4b.html" title="Seven Network">Seven</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Network_03d3.html" title="Nine Network">Nine</a>, who used the opportunity to launch attacks against their competition. Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Coonan_a50c.html" title="Helen Coonan">Helen Coonan</a> quickly followed the complaints with a formal letter to <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Ten_7cd2.html" title="Network Ten">Network Ten</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after show producers removed the "Uncut" section from the official Big Brother website, with a statement that the removal was to appeal to the show's broad audience. This part of the site is now only available to fee paying "Premium" members.</p>
<p>After the 2005 series concluded, further complaints prompted the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Communications_and_Media_Authority_4f12.html" title="Australian Communications and Media Authority">Australian Communications and Media Authority</a> to launch an investigation into <i>Big Brother: Uncut</i>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The main complaint was that Network Ten had breached the industry code of practice by broadcasting footage that went past the maximum <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_rating_system.html#Australia" title="Television rating system">MA15+</a> rating for Australian commercial television. The ACMA found Network Ten had breached the code on two occasions: the airing of housemate Michael massaging Gianna with his penis exposed, and the song about sexual fetishes.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> The ACMA did not impose any direct punishment on Network Ten, however outlined requirements for the 2006 series of <i>Uncut</i>. Included in those requirements is a commitment by Network Ten to compile show footage far enough in the future so that censors can edit it if necessary. Two censors were taken on by the network specifically for <i>Big Brother</i>, and crew were trained on the restrictions of the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_rating_system.html#Australia" title="Television rating system">MA15+</a> television rating. The show was renamed <i>Big Brother: Adults Only</i> for the 2006 season.</p>

<p>Though the 2006 series of <i>Adults Only</i> was toned down in comparison to the previous year, it still attracted some controversy. Following pressure from government backbenchers <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Ten_7cd2.html" title="Network Ten">Network Ten</a> ended the run of <i>Adults Only</i> several weeks early, announcing on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_23.html" title="June 23">23 June</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> that <i>Big Brother: Adults Only</i> had "completed its season run" <a href="http://www.thecouriermail.news.com.au/story/0,20797,19563555-5003402,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thecouriermail.news.com.au/story/0,20797,19563555-5003402,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Ten then made the <i>Adults Only</i> video packages that were going to be shown on televised broadcasts available on a new section of the <b>Big Brother 2006</b> website, named Adults Only, and available only to <i>Big Brother Premium</i> members.</p>
