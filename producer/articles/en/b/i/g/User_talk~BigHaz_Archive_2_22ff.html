<p>Off the top of my head...1) Has problems regarding scope. It is simply cultural assimilation or much more? 2) Proclaims some very disputed opinions/events as fact etc. 3) Integration or assimilation? Turkey often gets criticized for trying to "forcibly assimilate" non-Turks whereas people in other countries, say Pakistanis in the Uk, or Lebanese in Australia are often criticized for "not integrating".--<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilhan_1962.html" title="User:Kilhan">Kilhan</a> 04:12, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see. I can't say that I'll be much use - even in terms of negotiating a settlement while the page is still protected - but I'll give it a couple of reads when I get the chance and see what might be necessary. If the "disputed opinions/events" refer to the Armenians, though, that could prove very difficult. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 04:17, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thats really sad because it was obviously a n article tailor-made for Turk-bashing. I really wonder what the outcome would have been if it had involved a country other than Turkey. A merge with <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Turkey_da3b.html" title="Human rights in Turkey">Human rights in Turkey</a> seems to be the best solution to me.

<dd>The merge can (as far as I know), be done "manually" without an AfD or anything. It's just a matter of agreeing on where to merge what. A second AfD (or perhaps something faster) may then be required to delete the article itself once all the info is elsewhere. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 21:59, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

By the way, I think you should use edit summaries, because they are considered to be widespread courtesy and almost a pre-requisite for a successful <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFA_4c83.html" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a>, which you may be interested in the future, and shold do well with article contribs, some anti-vandalism and good discussion in AfDs.

<dd>About the cats thing, it is correct to remove <a href="../../../e/u/r/Category%7EEurovision_songs_b1b2.html" title="Category:Eurovision songs">Category:Eurovision songs</a> because they are already in the more refined subcat, Eurovision songs listed by their country and by year.

<p>Sorry for not replying yet, but it looks like someone already sorted it out for me&#160;:). I just thought the Eurovision songs category was too big, so I decided to subdivide it in a logical way. And I marked the category edits as minor because I thought they're not as important in the context of the article. --<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERain74_e81f.html" title="User:Rain74">Rain74</a> 09:42, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough as an answer. I was a bit hair-triggered about it, since it was mucking up my count of how many song articles existed (since two had been up for AfD and another one had been prodded without my realisation, it kind of made me a bit paranoid). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 10:05, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't saying that either. I was just trying to find a way to fend off possible reasons for "disqualification" of this DYK.

<dd>Fair enough (although I'm hardly the person to talk to about criticisms of DYK noms - that's an admin thing). As far as the illustrations go, I really don't know. I know there's a lot of hoops to jump through with copyright and so on, and even then someone might argue that it's a better shot for the article on Angelica herself, rather than the song.

<dd>PS. Quite against the sentence count increasing efforts, I was thinking whether the "was preceded by/was followed by" statements wouldn't be better expressed by succession tables...
<dl>
<dd>Succession tables are the long-term plan as I see it, but it strikes me as being a better course of action to do up the entire matrix of songs so that all the links will go to the right places first, then add tables where appropriate. My current leaning, though, is to do a succession for the country's entries (so "Run &amp; Hide" gets one to "No No Never" and so on), and leave the eventually-reorganised competition tables (which will eventually be in competition order rather than alphabetical) as a competition order thing. It's a big job, but there are 400+ entries already done, so we're close to half way already. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 12:48, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Damn it, you're right! I can't find any screen grab or any other pic for that matter other than the one from the Diggiloo Thrush, but it has been Thrushed and therefore can't be used&#160;:( Even the wondrous TV &amp; Radio Bits did not find Iemand Als Jij a highlight of the evening and chose to show some other folks... On the other hand, if you'd ask me, the dress is not inexplicably awful, it's just a quite poor choice for the occassion and completely forgettable (I myself keep forgetting how Dex looked like, mostly because she doesn't resemble herself from 1993 now). There are quite many bigger offenders I can think of, but I guess Barbara was chosen because "Barbara Dex Award" sounds so good (unlike "Sonja Lumme Award" for example).</p>
<p>OK now, there's still some time, perhaps some Eurovision magician can dig out a pic - I do not have any contacts in these circles, but perhaps you have, or our indespensible <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurosong_5f20.html" title="User:Eurosong">Chris</a>?

<dd>SBS broadcasts ESC delayed (it might actually broadcast it live at sort of 5:30 in the morning my time, but I watch it as a delayed telecast about 7:30 in the evening) here in Oz, which isn't the greatest since it means I need to avoid the internet all day before the semi and the final, but at least I get to see it. I intend to move to Europe one day, which will have the added benefit of getting me into the right timezone. Video-wise, I've just done another search on Youtube and still nothing. Oh well, if it doesn't get DYK'd it's not the end of the world I guess. Would be a nice one to see, but the fates may be against it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 10:37, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, and I was actually considering moving to Australia, so we might swap&#160;:D Anyway, waiting a whole day for the ESC is quite terrible. I wonder why does SBS actually bother - is it a big thing in the OZ? Do people have their favorite countries, are ESC stars popular? BTW, Iemand Als Jij is of course to be found on YouTube, thanks to the equally indispensible Sims. The problem is that, when uploading a bunch of songs from a given year, Sims sometimes doesn't bother with listing every contestant's stage name and song title, so you have to search for e.g. "Belgium 1993". Ok, here comes Barbara - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V87G-8m_k4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V87G-8m_k4" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (not that it would help, but you can link to the clip from the template&#160;:D ).

<dd>Brilliant! I thought I'd tried everything on Youtube, but it's amazing what can sneak in under the radar like that. I think the reason that SBS broadcasts ESC at all is that there are large numbers of expats and immigrants from the competing countries. You only need to look at our World Cup squad to count all the Croatian-Australians for one thing, then there are all the Greeks and Turks in Melbourne, Brits <i>everywhere</i>, Germans (such as yours truly going back a bit), Swiss, French and so on. As I understand SBS's mission, it exists purely to bring culture from the "old country" to Australia, wherever that old country may be. As for why the delay, I guess it's because they can't rely on all of their big programs to be broadcast live from Europe. The World Cup went down well at midnight at 5AM this year, but I think the ESC fan is usually a different beast. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 11:02, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

On the other hand, just at the beginning of the <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitchhiking.html" title="Hitchhiking">hitchhiking</a> article it mentions "autostop" as a common word for this practice, so if any of the readers is familiar with the word, he or she probably won't be overly surprised by the song's theme...

<dd>In retrospect, perhaps the Vissi-double-act would have been the more impressive fact, but I made the nomination in a hurry earlier this week and wasn't really thinking too clearly. That said, <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wir_Geben_%27Ne_Party_e3e6.html" title="Wir Geben 'Ne Party">Wir Geben 'Ne Party</a> got frontpaged because of the mention of hip-hop culture, so perhaps it's the sort of thing that someone might go for. And yes, I've changed the <a href="../../../%28/i/_/%28I_Would%29_Die_For_You_df4c.html" title="(I Would) Die For You">(I Would) Die For You</a> nomination per your suggestion on the talk page. That was another one where the wording was written in a hurry, and in the cold light of day it actually made loads more sense your way. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I found out what the problem was with your step 3 after some testing in my sandbox. In step 1 at the main article if you use {{subst:AfDx|second}}, it results in the page [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PageName (second nomination)]]. Using {{subst:AfDx|2nd}} results in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PageName (2nd nomination)]]. But in step 3, the guide says "If you used template {{subst:afdx}} instead of {{subst:afd1}}, use "PageName (2nd nomination)" instead of "PageName" for a second nomination". This is not correct. You must use "PageName (2nd nomination)" if you have used {{subst:AfDx|2nd}} and "PageName (second nomination)" if you have used {{subst:AfDx|second}} in step 1. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_Review_Aksi_great_4751.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor Review/Aksi great">review me</a>) 10:21, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know, it never hurts to know that it's the system causing you to make mistakes as against you messing up on your own.

<p>Happy to hear that! Though I've just found a bug after I suggested using it to you, and the instuctions on the talk page were incomplete - so this was a good occassion to brush it up&#160;:D I have also spiced up Sakis a bit to make for a better DYK(e?) Anyway, my suggestion is to slightly rearrange the pattern you use in describing songs, to avoid short, one-sentence parapagraph which then make the layout look rather jagged.</p>
<p>After the "definition sentence" ("Lalala was a song performed by the Diggiloo Thrush...") I would proceed to discuss the song itself, as the article is about it actually. Then some notes about the performance (still important), and only then technical details as to which song preceded it etc. etc. as this is not the core topic of the article, is it? Besides, this sections will probably be replaced by templates in due course, won't they?</p>
<p>As concerns you concerns&#160;:D regarding the fact that the factoid does not pertain to the song but to the singer, just look how some (successful) DYKes were constructed - they also were about some other topic, only mentioned in the highlighted article, but the thing is to generate and INTERESTING DYK, ain't it?

<dd>All very good ideas indeed and almost certain to be acted upon in my next update of songs (I did Austria a while back, I'm afraid - retrospectively there are at least three good DYKs in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boom_Boom_Boomerang_e3b0.html" title="Boom Boom Boomerang">Boom Boom Boomerang</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/_/Du_Bist_bd35.html" title="Du Bist">Du Bist</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/i/Weil_Der_Mensch_Z%C3%A4hlt_8711.html" title="Weil Der Mensch Zählt">Weil Der Mensch Zählt</a>, but I didn't know what the system was at the time and those articles are too old to qualify now). And you're right about Sakis VS his song, too. I've always tried to be a bit more scrupulous where those sorts of things are concerned, but I guess when it comes down to it, it's all about getting the thing on the front page! <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 12:25, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Greece in Eurovision</span></h2>
<p>BigHaz,</p>
<p>Firstly apologies for any bad feeling caused by my corrections to the Greek Eurovision page! I agree, diggiloo is a good source of information and translating from one alphabet to another often brings about differing opinions. However, I do think you should credit the singers in full e.g. M. Zorba did not compete in the Eurovision - Mariana Zorba did. Also, if you check with valid and long-standing Eurovision websites such as ESC Today, National Finals website or any of the OGAE sites, you will see that there is a standard form used for Greek titles in the Roman alphabet e.g. Olou tou kosmou i elpida. You can also check this out at the EBU's website. Hope this info is of use!<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlanche_Hunt_2306.html" title="User:Blanche Hunt">Blanche Hunt</a> 12:30, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as crediting the singers in full, I agree totally. When I get a spare moment, I'll fiddle their names around so that they're in full and (above all) accurate. If I could've reverted the edit <i>without</i> overriding the full names, I would've. Where the song titles are concerned, you may also be right. What I'm going on, though, is that particular site just for speed reasons (there are all kinds of alternate titles around - with question marks, without question marks, with brackets, without brackets, occasionally flat-out in other languages, the National Finals site is frequently inconsistent for a start). Ultimately, it's probably going to be worthwhile to get a native Greek-speaker to check the transliteration for Greece and Cyprus and move/copyedit pages accordingly - and probably the same will go for the Cyrillic-using countries. The thing is, though, that the articles already exist with the the particular spelling used on that page. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:25, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
