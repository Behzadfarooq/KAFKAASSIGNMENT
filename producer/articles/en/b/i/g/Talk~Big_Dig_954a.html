<p>I was under the impression a large part of the cost was due to massive embezzlement. Is this not so? If it's true, it should be mentioned. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivacissamamente_d5f6.html" title="User:Vivacissamamente">Vivacissamamente</a> 06:17, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if embezzlement is exactly the word; I think it comes under the more general category of legalized graft. There were a lot of kickbacks, especially on behalf of politicians in South Boston, which has a somewhat inflated level of influence in Boston government. There was a lot of payoffs to keep neighborhoods happy, and a lot of money just plain flushed down the drain by contractors. (I don't think Bechtel will ever get another major project in Massachusetts, at least not for the next couple of decades.) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 06:44, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cynicism is the heart of politics in Massachusetts, but despite numerous investigations by government and the press there has been no evidence of massive wrong doing. It is unlikely that this project could have been completed for less money given all its constraints. There were expensive design changes to mitigate various problems and community concerns, most resulting in a better project. Perhaps the biggest added cost factor (besides inflation) was keeping the existing Central Artery, subways and commuter rail functioning while the highway was constructed underneath. One small example: all the ground under the South Station approach yards had to be frozen solid to allow tunneling underneath without causing derailments. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 19:03, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I think it should be added since it was one of the reasons given for the over run of the cost and now seems to be the problem with the failures of the construction. --<a href="../../../n/a/p/User%7ENapnet_b87d.html" title="User:Napnet">Napnet</a> 22:06, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The link posted by Napnet is a website maintained by an organization of non-union contractors, who would benefit from any finger-pointing toward the unions. I don't see that as a neutral source, any more than I would an article posted on an IBEW or AFL-CIO (or other union) website. As pointed out by Dsjochrist below, the budget in 1991 was not $2.8 billion, but that is what the article states. We need a better source than that if we want to imply that union labor is responsible for a significant share of cost overruns. The same goes for blaming unions in general for the tunnel failure, even if it is determined that shoddy workmanship is to blame. Otherwise it sounds like we're saying "non-union would have done it better." It may be a fact that it was a union-only job, but actually blaming the union-only policy for the project's troubles would violate NPOV. Vorenus 14:50, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I cannot believe this article was written relying on the lack of knowledge contained by newspaper reporters. The cost of the Big Dig was not initially 2.5 billion escalating the 14.625 billion. The 2.5 was a cost arrived at inception by state level departments. This was a figure on the conceptual design that did not include mitigation, site assessment, or environmental impacts. Once B/PB were brought onboard the cost was estimated in the 7 billion dollar range. Keep in mind that this was in 1985 and the project did not commence until 1991. Federal guidelines did not allow for inflation costs to be included. Later, the scope of the project was changed to include the capping of Spectacle Island, the covering of additional tunnels and the redesign of both the Fort Point Channel Crossing and the Charles River Bridge, all at additional cost. Additionally, mitigation efforts are estimated to have been the source of almost one third the cost escalation.Dsjochrist 15:05, 5 August 2006 (UTC)dsjochrist</p>

<p>"Official"?? "The Big Dig" is the <i>official</i> name of the project?? Certainly it is the common colloquial name of the project, and the name used in the Boston Globe, but usually the official name is one that is known only to those who dig out legal documents --- acts of Congress and the like, and is not nearly so poetic. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 19:04 Jan 21, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>O.K., so the last para. of the lead now looks better, but is it more/less/the same in accuracy?

<dd>I've reverted the previous revisions referenced herein and added a citation for the reference "the Green Monster". This seems to be vernacular slang for the Central Artery. The article cited reinforces this theory as Boston mayor Thomas Menino used the term "Green Monster" publicly. However, Menino is not attributed as the creator of the term.--Deego1703 04:05, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've added substantial information on deep background on things like the Inner Belt, the Leverett Connector, Scheme Z, and the community activism that surrounded the project over the years. That said, much of it could stand for considerable enlargement and/or breaking out of this article into separate articles. I've also added a couple of web references (somehow this article doesn't seem complete without the MIT/Rotch Library website linked at least). Might be some POV to clean up, certainly some misdirected data. I hope I haven't made too much hash out of the article. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 06:44, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would agree that your background on the Inner Belt and the highway construction moratorium possesses substantial POV, as it implies the moratorium was a poor decision and that further construction would have solved the congestion problem in Boston (it may very well have worsened surface street congestion). Those of us in the area who support neo-urbanism regard the whole situation as a narrowly-avoided disaster; just last year there were fliers posted throughout Cambridgeport, along the 695 route, saying "look what almost happened." All this conflict belongs in a separate article, of course, but this one should be modified towards NPOV and make it clear that it was the express highway/freeway system specifically that was/is deficient. The Pike extension is a worthy mention (and should go into the separate article as well).

<dd>Actually to be perfectly honest I do think the moratorium was a good idea -- the design of the Master Plan was wrong to begin with, since it didn't take into account the neighborhood disruption it would create (and the environmental issues for parts of it were a little dicey as well) -- the Inner Belt in particular seems to have been very badly thought out, though the Northeast Expressway and Volpe's version of I-90 had some pretty bad issues as well (like gutting Cambridge in the case of Rt 2/3 and stopping several miles short of downtown for no obvious reason in the case of the Western Expressway). Feel free to make any changes you think are appropriate. Essentially what I was trying to get at was that there was a problem that needed solving, the solution on the table was rightly killed, but the problem still existed and had to be taken into account during the planning of the Dig. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 01:11, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why call the Big Dig highway a <i>freeway</i> if nobody in Massachusetts will ever refer to it as such. As is clear in the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeway.html" title="Freeway">article on freeways</a>, people from Massachusetts make no distinction between a freeway or expressway, and often use the term <i>highway</i> as a catch-all. There is no reason to assume that, since many other states make such a distinction, it should be exclusively employed in this article on a Massachusetts highway. There are no "official" definitions in English; we don't have the luxury of the <i>Academie française</i>, as the French do. Of course, this could be a blessing, since we're able to preserve important regional and cultural linguistic heritages.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, the term <i>freeway</i> is rarely, if ever, used. Making it the exclusive term in this article, which is on a Massachusetts highway, does not make sense.--AaronS 23:43, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, it is the case in many locales, especially major cities with many such routes, to use the terms interchangeably. But a generic term like <i>highway</i> does not convey the sense of a <i>multilane controlled access road</i> to everyone who will read the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is important to note that more than likely it will be <b>non-</b>Bostonians that are looking up information on the Big Dig, and will not have time to peruse the talk page to accomodate local terminologies. That being said, other options to maintain that extra meaning would be <i>interstate</i> (particularly for American readers), <i>expressway</i> (to a degree, but almost as generic as <i>highway</i>) or increasingly loosely <i>autoroute</i> or even <i>autobahn</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To maintain the flow of the article, Interstate is probably unacceptable, leaving <i>freeway</i> and perhaps <i>expressway</i> the only logical options.</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comments. <i>Expressway</i> certainly seems workable. I just see no reason to use a term that is foreign to many people. Otherwise, we might as well call it a <i>dual carriageway</i>, as many people in the British Commonwealth do.</p>

<p>I could have sworn the elevated Artery was only two through lanes in each direction, not three. Rather hard to check now, of course.

<dl>
<dd>It absolutely was six lanes. You may be confused because exit 26 was operated as an "exit only" in the last years of the old structure, so entering traffic from Leverett Circle did not need to merge. Even today, of course, there's a section of the Lower Deck that narrows to two general-purpose lanes, but there's still the HOV lane just over the barrier to the east. There was also a period where only two through lanes were available in the Dewey Square Tunnel due to construction sequencing. <a href="../../../1/2/1/User%7E121a0012.html" title="User:121a0012">121a0012</a> 21:28, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The I-695/I-93 interchange was planned as a complete interchange, so there were four stubs built. The 93S-695S and 695N-95N stubs were used to connect the Leverett Circle Connector. The 93N-695S and 695N-93S stubs remain unconnected (I don't understand why they weren't just demolished, which would have made the exit 26B interchange geometry somewhat better). The CANA ramps which would have provided the connections between 93S and 1N, and vice versa, had Scheme Z been built, are reflected in the closed-off extra lanes of the City Square tunnel. <a href="../../../1/2/1/User%7E121a0012.html" title="User:121a0012">121a0012</a> 03:15, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it will take time to really answer that question. Certainly all the roads go where they were supposed to go and the city kept functioning while the project was underway (a major concern). I don't commute into downtown Boston, but the general impression I get is that traffic is improved, though there are still traffic jam at rush hour, particularly south of the city, where there has been a lot of development. The rest of the day traffic moves; it didn't used to. Access to the airport is greatly improved. Boston may now have the most easily accessed airport of any major city; it's certainly up there. Development of the land above the project is only just beginning. The new bridge sure looks nice.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The real test, however, will be the long term impact on the region. The decline of the software industry here has hurt the area a lot. The high cost of living, particularly housing, was probably a bigger factor than traffic in keeping new business away, though it also indicates that people want to live here. There will always be second guessing about whether the problems could have been solved for less money or if investment in transit and affordable housing might have had a bigger impact. I'm not sure where a definitive answer will come from. --17:22, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The roadtraffic-technology.com article you cite says that the big dig increased north-sourth capacity from 75,000 to 245,000 per day. That's a pretty substantial improvement. I suspect that is about the capacity of the sections of I-93 that connect to the project from the north and south. Any more capacity and you simply move the eventual traffic jams to the other sections (which sometime happens now on the Southeast Expressway). Every urban freeway ends up being congested during rush hour. The big benefit of the Big Dig was to be removing east-west traffic from the north south road that caused traffic tie-ups all day long. That seemed to be working until the I-90 tunnel had to be closed. Every big project has problems. The leaks are being fixed on the contractor's nickel. I live in the area and in my opinion they did an excellent job keeping traffic moving during construction. We'll know soon enough what caused the ceiling collapse and it will be fixed. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 01:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>75,000 to 245,000 is a big improvement, but not enough. When the old artery was closed it carried 190,000 cars a day. We're already at almost 210,000. In four years we'll be at 250,000. When the big dig reaches capacity in 2010 it won't be the end of the world. It will, however, only get worse from there on. Yes, yes all roads eventually exceed capacity, but this one cost $15 billion and will reach capacity by 2010! Did they bother to crunch the numbers? After that it will quickly degenerate into what the old elevated artery was when they tore it down: 8 hour delays, bumper to bumper. And it will be like that by 2020. Then we'll have another Big Dig which will probably cost tens of billions.</dd>

There's almost 1,400 leaks as a result of poor construction and even worse design. Some have even suggested that the leaks may have contributed to the murderous tunnel collapse. As far as fixing the leaks: Bectel has said that repairing the leaks is now an ongoing maintenece project without end. And they haven't agreed to pay for it yet. Concrete slabs held up with glue and not pull tested, no breakdown lanes, Ted Williams Tunnel not deep enough, bad concrete, thousands of leaks, dead people, behind schedule, overbudget, the list goes on and on...How many "problems" is a "big project" allowed to have before we can get angry? Since 1999 these bolts have been failing and no one did anything about it until it killed someone. I hope they use a little forsight and try to fix problems <b>BEFORE</b> they kill people.</dd>

In order for a project to be deemed a success it is to be completed on time and on buget, given those parameters the project was and is not a success. Is the project going to be able to do what is what engineered to do, yes. B/PB is a joint venture composed to two of the industry's leading engineering companies and even with the media attention of the CA/T they have continued to be gainfully employed on various other projects. The ultimate failure ot the CA/T was the IPO. The management of the project was at the discretion of the MTA which was run by a politician who demanded the ability to approve designs and make all decisions as did his predessors. The complexities of the project and the IPO allowed the owner and the joint venture a close working relationship. But, in order for politicians to stay in office they must appease their constituents and large cost increases resulted. Many of the flaws that occured on the construction were contractor failures due to poor quality control which was to be the contractor's responsibility to maintain as part of the partnering agreement taken on contractually. B/PB was ultimately responsible for the design oversight and the assurance of the quality control efforts and as such are ultimately responsible. Leaks, widely reported throughout the media, are actually expected on all tunnels which employ pumping facilities underneath the roadway to rid the tunnel of seeping water. Additional seepage occurred as the tunnels are not sealed until nearly all other work is completed. Much of the water was the result of open manholes and areas not yet sealed. Remarks made to comments about dirt and debri not adequately removed from the concrete do not offer explanation that slurry walls cannot be removed of dirt and debri at construction by their design. Defects found later, at excavation, are to be repaired by the contractor as part of the contract. This work would be included in "quality control" which was not always done to standard. Slurry walls will continuously be prone to leaks as water that has been rerouted by sealing looks for other areas of access. Dealing with these issues will be part of routine tunnel maintenence and was expected. The use of slurry walls has been roven successful in tunnel applications throughout the United States and other countries, especially in Japan from where the technological advancements were imported for use on the CA/T.Dsjochrist 15:10, 5 August 2006 (UTC)dsjochrist</p>

<p>Would it be too much to ask for someone to include a map? Ideally, I would like a map with little detail (i.e., not a street map), but which shows what the major routes were before the Big Dig, and a second map showing how the Big Dig looks now. I mean, all this descriptive information is great, but is meaningless to those of us who live a thousand miles away and have never been to Boston (and yet still helped to pay for it). 68.154.210.100 15:55, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a section in the collapse discussion dealing with the Tunrpike Authoirty's secrecy and lack of disclosure with even government watchdogs, but it seems a bit tacked on there, because it's more of a general problem, not something having to do with the collapse itself. What are the thoughts of putting that in a separate section altogether? (I know I took it from a separate section back into the collapse section, but the entire section was based on one article, and the document request was made *after* the tunnel collapse (with one reference to Lynch's request last year), so I don't think it's sufficient to support the entire claim of secrecy. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff.green_338d.html" title="User:Geoff.green">Geoff.green</a> 11:16, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because things are slowing down somewhat, and more is known, perhaps someone (Seicer?) should reorganize the topic to be less chronological and more topical (e.g. incident, description of problem, proposed solutions, who's in charge, ongoing crim. investigation).

<p>A good portion of Boston is reclaimed sea. The best known area of reclamation is the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Back_Bay_69ff.html" title="Back Bay">Back Bay</a> section of the city, it was originally <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidal.html" title="Tidal">tidal</a> <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estuaries.html" title="Estuaries">estuaries</a> of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_River_5f89.html" title="Charles River">Charles River</a> Basin. From what I have read and seen over the years, the total area of reclamation in Boston and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts_da41.html" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge</a> is some where in the range of 50+%. The Boston waterfront is another area of major reclamation over the years: people would build <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wharves.html" title="Wharves">wharves</a> of wood, the wharves would get replaced with stone <a href="../../../j/e/t/Jetties.html" title="Jetties">jetties</a>, and finally the areas between the jetties would be filled in. The process has repeated it several times since the city's founding in 1630. If a ship had sunk in an area that was to be filled in, it would be covered over. The fill was whatever junk the engineers of the time could find.</p>
<p>This has also occurred in parts of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, where the coast line has moved out over 1/2 a mile since <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York</a>'s founding.</p>

<p>There were two identical paragraphs relating to the tunnel collapse. One was part of the "Current Status" section (now "Final Phases") and another was in its own section at the end. After trying to decide which should stay, I got rid of the current status one and left the other one, and renamed "Current status" section to "Final phases". Current status sounds too transient and temporary for a permanent article, and with the removal of the paragraph about the collapse, that section dealt more with wrapping up the project then with how it is at the moment therefore I renamed it to "Final phases". However I'm not sure this is the best name, maybe "Project completion" or something would be better. Anyway, hope everyone agrees with the removal of that paragraph. <a href="../../../r/m/k/User%7ERmkf1982_bb30.html" title="User:Rmkf1982">Rmkf1982</a> 23:55, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
