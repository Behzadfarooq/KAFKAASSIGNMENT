<p>Set in the fictional town of Charterville, three typical kids, Drew, Jo, and Roland, enter the suposedly haunted Hillhurst Manor after accepting a dare from rich snobs Van and Trip. The house is revealed to be the home of real monsters when the kids accidentally bump a <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_organ.html" title="Pipe organ">pipe organ</a>, releasing a <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phantom.html" title="Phantom">phantom</a> named Flabber. He proves to be friendly, and in return for releasing him, offers to grant them one wish. They wish to become their comic book heroes, The Big Bad Beetleborgs. However, this also brings the Beetleborgs' sworn enemies to life: the Magnavores, led by the evil Vexor.</p>
<p>In the final episode of the first season, the Magnavores steal a picture of a new villain named Nukus. They bring him to life to enlist his help in destroying the Beetleborgs. Nukus assists them by planning devastating attacks on the city and creating Borgslayer, a hybrid of all the Magnavore monsters. Unbeknownst to the Magnavores, Nukus was actually plotting to get rid of them. Nukus tells Van and Trip how to defeat Borgslayer, and orders them to take the information to the Beetleborgs. They succeed in destroying Borgslayer, causing the Magnavores to be swept back into the comics. Nukus challenged the kids to one last battle and despite Art Fortune's warning that he is too powerful, they face him anyway. Nukus quickly wipes them out, and destroys their armor, weapons, and powers.</p>
<p>These events lead directly into the second season, <i>Beetleborgs Metallix</i>. In it Nukus has replaced the Magnavores as the Beetleborgs arch-enemy. Nukus discovers that his creator, (the one who drew him), is actually Art Fortune's incarcerated brother, Les Fortunes. Nukus busts Les out of prison, Les now serves him by creating new villains and monsters for him. In turn, Art creates new powers, armor, and weapons for the kids, they rename themselves Beetleborgs Metallix.</p>
<p>They are later assisted by the Astralborgs, four Beetleborgs created by Art Fortunes as a child when he and Les worked together on they're only collaboration, the Lost Comic.</p>
<p>Nukus formed his own evil group, named the <i>Crustaceans</i>.</p>
<p>Nukus and Vilor eventually gained upgraded <i>Mega</i> forms, To conteract this, the Beetleborgs were given an upgrade by Roboborg, who fused their Metallix powers with their original powers, creating the Mega Spectra Beetleborgs.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Flabber</b> (Billy Forrester): As described above, Flabber is a <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phantom.html" title="Phantom">phantom</a> who was trapped inside a <a href="../../../p/i/p/Pipe_organ.html" title="Pipe organ">pipe organ</a>, and was freed by the kids. Out of gratitude he granted their wish to become they're comic book heroes, the Big Bad Beetleborgs. Flabber was released by playing 3 notes. He acts as an advisor and best friend, he offers needed magic to the kids when fighting the Magnvavores, and later the Crustaceans. Althought his magic doesn't always work the way he would hope for it to. He is the head of the Hillhurst Mansion and is usualy the one to keep the house monsters in check. The producers of the show said that he was based on <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, although he more closely resembles <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Leno_9d45.html" title="Jay Leno">Jay Leno</a> to some.</li>
<li><b>Arthur "Art" Fortunes</b> (<a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigg_Kennedy_068e.html" title="Rigg Kennedy">Rigg Kennedy</a>): Creator of the Beetleborgs comics, who shows up time and time again with new ways to help the kids.</li>
<li><b>"Nano" Williams</b> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivian_Smallwood_8081.html" title="Vivian Smallwood">Vivian Smallwood</a>): Roland's grandmother, Aaron's mother, and Abbie's mother-in-law, Nano is one hip granny and a trained <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_artist.html" title="Martial artist">martial artist</a>. When she's not running Zoom Comics, or practicing her moves, she's often seen riding her motorcycle. Nano often helps out the kids when they're in a jam. If nothing else, she enjoys teasing her son Aaron.</li>
<li><b>Aaron Williams</b> (Kim Delgado): Roland's father. He ran Zoom Comics full time and is often embarrassed by his mother's antics. Aaron was soon called away on business, leaving the shop in the hands of his wife.</li>
<li><b>Abbie Williams</b> (Channe Nolan): Roland's mother. She primarily works as a <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_estate.html" title="Real estate">real estate</a> agent. When her husband, Aaron, gone on business, she assumed running Zoom Comics. She and her mother in-law don't see eye to eye but she didn't really know how to run a comic book shop. With a little help from Flabber's magic, Abbie's heart opened up and rekindled fond childhood memories of a comic she once loved reading. She ran the shop for the remainder of the series.</li>
<li><b>Heather</b> (Elizabeth Z. Lund): Drew's crush. No matter what, Drew could never tell Heather what he really felt. She would sometimes help out at the comic shop, and she also enjoyed reading them. During the Shadowborg saga, she developed a crush on Josh.</li>
<li><b>Trip &amp; Van</b> (Todd Hurst &amp; Patrick Seaborn): the comic relief of the series, the brothers constantly pestered the kids daily lives by flaunting their wealth and self-accalaimed superiority. Trip was the smarter of the two, whereas Van was a bit slow. They often came up with get-rich-quick schemes, ways to humiliate the Beetleborgs, or simply to cause mischief; often dragging their unwitting chauffeur, Dudley, into their schemes. They were the one's who dared Jo, Roland, and Drew to enter Hillhurst, which led to them becoming Beetleborgs. During the Borgslayer fiasco, they skipped town, never to be heard from again.</li>
<li><b>Frankenbeans</b> (David Fletcher): Called "Frankie" for short, he is a strange, lumbering <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankenstein.html" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>-type monster. He was once kidnapped by the Magnavores, and held by ransom in exchange for the Beetleborgs' Beetle Bonders. <b>Dr. Baron von Frankenbeans</b>, his creator, showed up in a few episodes.</li>
<li><b>Mums</b> (Blake Torney): Mums is a 5,000 year-old Egyptian mummy, but he can unwrap his bandages to reveal a "Grim Reaper"-like form under his bandages. He has 703 brothers and sisters. In one episode, two archaeologists came to return Mums to the crypt in which they found him in order to get rid of a curse placed on them.</li>
<li><b>Count Fangula</b> (<a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Hackett_8f1f.html" title="Joe Hackett">Joe Hackett</a>): Loosely modeled after Count Dracula, Count Fangula is a vampire, a not so good one, but a vampire nonetheless.</li>
<li><b>Wolfgang "Wolfie" Smith</b> (Frank Tahoe, voiced by <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Page-Pagter_e3b2.html" title="Scott Page-Pagter">Scott Page-Pagter</a>): Wolfie is a werewolf and is treated more like a family dog than a monster at Hillhurst. Only Fangula can translate what Wolfie is saying most of the time. Probably the bravest and most cunning of the Hillhurst Monsters because he's the only one of the group who tangled with the bad guys at least once.</li>
<li><b>Little Ghoul</b> (Lina Godouse): A <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_races_%28F-J%29_49e7.html#Jawa" title="List of Star Wars races (F-J)">Jawa</a>-like addition to the Hillhurst group in season two, she lives in the basement and rarely comes out. A niece of the Grim Reaper, she is a grim reaper-in-training who loves collecting. She also has a short temper, which scares the other monsters even more than her true appearance under her hood. She has little to no respect for anyone; she does, however, have a great deal of respect for the Astralborgs.</li>
<li><b>The Pipettes</b> (Traci Bellusci): A multicolor spirit-like trio of ladies who live in the pipe organ. They act as Flabber's back-up singers. They stop appearing midway through the first series.</li>
<li><b>Ghoulum</b> (voiced by Dan Letlow for one episode only): A living stone statue type monster that resides in Hillhurst Mansion who often had little to say or do other than what statues do best, stand in place. While not the most active monster of Hillhurst Mansion on rare occasions he would join in on the other monsters' mischief. In one episode, he was accidentally exposed to a 'Bad Potion' turning him evil and causing him to grow into a giant under Noxic's control.

<li><b>Karato</b> (voiced by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Epcar_f050.html" title="Richard Epcar">Richard George</a>) and <b>Silver Ray</b>: Two other comic book superheroes that the kids are fans of. When the Magnavores released an army of monsters while trying to kidnap Art Fortunes from a comic book convention, the Beetleborgs were afraid of being unable to beat them all by themselves. Flabber agreed to use his magic on just that one occasion to summon other superheroes from the comics to help.</li>

The Magnavores</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Magnavores</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Vexor</b>: (first played by Rick Tane and later by Kisu; voiced by Joey Pal): The leader of the Magnavores.</li>
<li><b>Typhus</b>: (played by Kyle Jordan and voiced by Dave "Foots" Footman): Plant/Animal-like humanoid monster, prefers brawn over brain and his whale-like flattop is an extra mouth with which he eats.</li>
<li><b>Noxic</b>: (voiced by <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Stephen_Prince_8589.html" title="Derek Stephen Prince">Derek Stephen Prince</a>): Android with coils for hair and white jacket. Can control machinery and other objects by removing his head and attaching it to them. Prefers to eat donuts all day long instead of doing Vexor's bidding. He has a older brother named Super Noxic, though technically Noxic was created first.</li>
<li><b>Jara</b>: (played by Balinda English in U.S. Footage, and voiced by Rajia Baroudi): Female humanoid clad in red attire and white mask. She speaks with a Russian accent. Despite her face being remade 3-dimensional, she cannot consume junk food in the real world because the mouth on her mask could never open (she emphasizes this by saying that she has no mouth). She was bitten by Wolfgang in one episode and became a werewolf and enamored with Wolfgang, but by the end of the episode was returned to her normal form and retained none of her affection for Wolfgang.</li>
<li><b>Shadowborg</b> (voiced by Tom Papenbrook): Black evil Beetleborg created by Vexor from ionic DNA and insectite material stolen from the Blue Stinger Beetleborg. Not only is Shadowborg created from the basic materials as Blue Stinger, but he is enhanced with some of the powers of the other Beetleborgs. Shadowborg can run faster than the Green Hunter, jump higher than Red Striker, and remain underwater for 51 minutes. Shadowborg's architectual armor is modeled after a <a href="../../../l/o/n/Longhorn_beetle.html" title="Longhorn beetle">longicorn beetle</a>. With his Shadow Claw, Shadowborg can cut through any substance know to the planet. He was finally destroyed by the Blue Stinger Beetleborg in his "<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlizer.html" title="Battlizer">Battlizer</a>" form.
<ul>
<li><b>Magnavore Jet Fighters</b>: Air-borne, wasp-resembling machine jets. Summoned to attack the Beetleborgs on several occasions.</li>
<li><b>Scabs</b>: Yellow-black goon squad. Unlike in most Saban adaptations, these grunt soldiers were barely used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Crustaceans</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Nukus</b>: (Christopher Cho): A creation of Les Fortunes, the Triceratops-based Overlord of the 2nd Dimension. Hid away in Art Fortune's vault until the Magnavores took the picture and Vexor brought him to life. Nukus quickly set a plan to dispose the Magnavores and take over as the new villain. He broke Les out of jail to use the artist's skills to create deadly monsters that could be brought to life with the use of his sword. He had an advantage over the Beetleborgs as he destroyed both the paper he came out of and the copy Art Fortunes owned. Nukus also destroyed the Beetleborgs' original armor, weapons, and powers. He later gained a mega form, Mega Nukus, from touching Les Fortunes' transmographier device.</li>
<li><b>Horribelle</b>: (Claudine Barros): Second in command of the Crustaceans, an insect-based sword-toting fighter and Nukus' right-hand woman. Like Nukus, she can summon a face-mask in battle. She also wields two swords that resemble mantis arms. She once rebelled against the Crustaceans by having Les Fortunes create the Astral Axe, so she could control its' powers. She has no mega form, unlike the main male villains.</li>
<li><b>Vilor</b>: (played by Kyle Jordan and voiced by Dave "Foots" Footman): Third in command of the Crustaceans, a fish-based, trident-toting fighter. He briefly gains a second form, Super Vilor, when the Mantrons arrived, and later a brief mega form, Mega Vilor, after touching Les Fortunes' transmographier device, though he somehow reverted back to his normal state.</li>
<li><b>Lester "Les" Fortunes</b>: (Marshal Hilton): The black sheep in the Fortunes family, Art's younger brother. He was in jail when Nukus recruited him to his cause. Despite creating all the Crustacean monsters and their arsenal, Les never gets any respect or credit for it. At the end of the series, he goes back to jail for some peace and quiet.
<ul>
<li><b>Dregs</b>: Assorted monsters used as foot soldiers. Dregs came in two groups. One group was based off land animals and wore brown slacks and black boots (Spider Dreg, Stego Dreg). The other based off sea creatures and wore blue spandex pants and white boots (Fish Dreg, Jellyfish Dreg, Squid Dreg). Each group consisted of five different types of Dregs.</li>
<li><b>Worm Tanks</b>: Giant worm like vehicles summoned to attack the Beetleborgs on several occasions.</li>
<li><b>Crustacean Jet Fighters</b>: Air-borne machines based on the design of the Worm Tank summoned to attack the Beetleborgs on several occasions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Mantrons</b>: Evil counterparts of the Astralborgs. Created by Les Fortunes as a child to rival Art Fortunes' Astralborgs in their only collaboration, the Lost Comic. They were there to aid Nukus in his plans to get Roboborg, who ultimately made it to the good hands of the Beetleborgs. In 'Roboborg' (part 8 of the Lost Comic saga), the Mantrons were finally sent back to the Lost Comic for good by the combined attacks of the Beetleborgs, Astralborgs and Roboborg.

<ul>
<li><b>"Bugging out"</b> - in the first two episodes of Metallix (or the last two episodes of Big Bad BeetleBorgs), Drew and his teammates use Flabber's book of spells (or Phasm Handbook) to try and change him back to normal after Nukus traps him into a giant block of ice. One spell gives all three the power to change into somewhat larger versions of their respective insects (about the size of their fists), then revert back to human. By saying "Bug out!", they change into bugs. To become human again, they say "Bug back!" The trio are able to use this ability in either human or Beetleborg form, and will never lose it.</li>

It wields a weapon called Robo Sword, with which he can perform the <i>Robo Cyclone</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Boron</b> (voiced by Y.I. Otta): Les Fortunes created the Astral Ax, the evil counterpart to the Astral Sword, and with it Roboborg's evil counterpart, Boron. Used by Mega Nukus to summon Boron, simply by shouting out, “Boron, Arise!”. In the battle against Repgillian, the Beetleborgs tricked the Crustaceans into giving up the Astral Ax so it could fall into the hands of Titanium Silver Beetleborg. Boron then switched to the side of good.</li>

<p>It was not uncommon to see cardboard cut-outs and wall decorations of the Beetleborgs characters on the walls of Zoom Comics where the 3 kids worked. Other decorations used included the costume heads of King Sphinx of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the original head from the monster costume Kappa from <i><a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninja_Sentai_Kakuranger_ef6a.html" title="Ninja Sentai Kakuranger">Ninja Sentai Kakuranger</a></i> (The monster was used as "Parrot Top" in MMPR) which was used to create the costume Malevex. Toys from the Bandai Beetleborgs toyline could also be seen in various displays. Including the Special Edition Deluxe Shadowborg figure, in an episode which preceded Shadowborg's character ever appearing on the show.</p>
<p>Like other adaptations, some of the original source footage was altered for Beetleborgs. The Input Magnums, the original B-Fighter's guns, looked very realistic due to the black-and-silver coloring. In <i>Beetleborgs</i>, the gun's colors were changed to bright red and purple. However, the colors of the guns changed from time to time due to the blending in of the B-Fighter footage. Similarly, the American version of the toy was done in red and purple colors instead of the Input Mangum's black and silver coloring. In <i>Metallix</i>, the Input Cardgun colors remained unchanged (grey and black), but the toy line changed the weapons to a white-and-blue color scheme.</p>
<p><i>Big Bad Beetleborgs</i> and <i>Beetleborgs Metallix</i> ultimately ended because the Saban crew were left with no more <a href="../../../j/u/u/Juukou_B-Fighter_a979.html" title="Juukou B-Fighter">Juukou B-Fighter</a> and <a href="../../../b/-/f/B-Fighter_Kabuto_e46f.html" title="B-Fighter Kabuto">B-Fighter Kabuto</a> footage to adapt. Their predecessor, <i><a href="../../../v/r/_/VR_Troopers_e235.html" title="VR Troopers">VR Troopers</a></i> also ended for the same reason. Ironically, <i>B-Fighter Kabuto</i> was also the last series of the <i>Metal Hero</i> genre to air on Japanese television in Japan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Various monsters from both Beetleborgs seasons were re-used as enemy monsters in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mystic_Knights_of_Tir_Na_Nog_1c8f.html" title="The Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog">The Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog</a>. Some of them included Scorpix, Shellator, Emily the Seed of Evil, Fangula Bat Monster, and 3 monsters from B-Fighter Kabuto that were unused in this series (an ant monster, an anemone monster, and a porcupine/stingray monster).</li>
