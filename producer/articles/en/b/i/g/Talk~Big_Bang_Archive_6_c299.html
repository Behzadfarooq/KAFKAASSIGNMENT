<h2><span class="mw-headline">Big bang figure</span></h2>
<p>The first figure on the main page is really bad. The lines forming the sides are all straight. Assuming inflation, they should start out diverging exponentially. "Soon" their separation turns into sqrt(time) and later something more like linear again - fiddle with a 2/3 power after cold matter dominates and some acceleration rather "recently" if you like, but at least a caveat is needed. <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 23:06, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we could safely add a "diagram not to scale" logo. On a more serious note, I've usually seen the inflationary period depicted as something with the profile of a curly-bracket ({) leading into the (roughly) linear expansion. I've messaged the user maintaining the image to suggest this. In practice, I'm not sure it's a serious problem given the other approximations in the diagram.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 00:05, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This image was never intended to be to scale, only to illustrate the basic concept of an expanding universe. If a more detailed illustration can be created, go ahead. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrik_8a6d.html" title="User:Fredrik">Fredrik</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFredrik_61e6.html" title="User talk:Fredrik">talk</a> 11:32, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>People are too concerned with linear scales. If you use the appropriate <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logarithmic_scale.html" title="Logarithmic scale">logarithmic scale</a> the diagram is absolutely correct. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 29 June 2005 15:06 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This turns out not to be the case, as the inflationary period didn't follow a power law expansion, and (as <a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> noted) isn't shown in any form on the diagram. I personally don't see any point in changing the figure, but the fact remains that it is at best a stylized representation.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 29 June 2005 16:03 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is true that there has to be a disconnect between the "singularity" and the expansion for this to be correct, but that's hardly the point -- we make graphs like that all the time. To be a perfectly correct representation, you'd probably have to make the scale infinite (just as on a logarithmic scale there is an infinite distance between zero and one). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 29 June 2005 17:13 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've clarified some of the Hubble expansion phrasing to show more clearly how the expansion required a Big Bang (it's a time-reversal of the same scenario that forces matter to collapse to a singularity past a certain density).

<dd>Hi, Christopher. I've been noticing your posts near mine lately, cause I usually find them right-on. So, "Hail, and well met." But I'm going to disagree with your corrections to my corrections.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While I think your additions are correct, I think they are mostly covered elsewhere in the article, especially in Overview and Theoretical Underpinnings. This section is about evidence, and as it stood it only needed a little explanation of how this evidence fits in. Myself, I was trying hard to be a terse as possible. I almost deleted my own caveat about "excepting closer objects...", but the sentence would have been literally incorrect without it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Are your points necessary to make the connection? I believe that the Big Bang is self-evident without referencing Relativity, and I find the reference distracting from the simple idea that if things are flying apart they were once together.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Some of your good points here are not clearly explained within the other sections I mentioned. So, I would like your agreeement to revert this section to my edits, while you can clarify the theory sections. Then we can work from a clean slate on any remaining flaws in my text.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Remember our posts, above, where we say the opening diagram is appropriate <i>for it's purpose?</i> I believe this fits in that editorial philosophy.<br /></dd>

<dd>I've deleted the additions for most of the reason Chris Mid made. I also readded the doppler shift which is a physically correct explanation for the redshift. The doppler shift works because a Lorentz invariant fluid like spacetime carries Galilean relativity along with it and therefore the Doppler Effect for any wave that propogates through it, be it a photon, graviton, or anything else. While one can certainly model the redshift without appealing to the Doppler effect it is definitely the most simple and comprehensible conceptual explanation for the effect. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 30 June 2005 02:05 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I feel that it's important to note that GR _requires_ the expansion to have begun at a point. Otherwise, one can validly object that an extremely compact universe isn't necessarily an inevitable conclusion. By all means, phrase this more tersely, but I feel the distinction is vital. Re. us frequently editing similar articles, I think that's mainly just because of similar watchlists. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 30 June 2005 02:23 (UTC)

<dd>While the Friedmann Equations are only derivable in their full detail from GR considerations, that really doesn't belong in the evidencev section. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 30 June 2005 02:28 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not asking for equations to be added to that section. Merely some short statement that gives confidence the "inevitable" line isn't pulled out of thin air. I've spoken to enough people who don't understand science to know that this would otherwise set off their "scientists are talking out of their tails" flags (disturbingly common mindset). By all means, keep any further discussion later in the article.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 30 June 2005 02:40 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Ok, I've re-checked the diffs, and feel foolish now. If the whole paragraph is gone, the explanation of its last sentence isn't terribly relevant&#160;:). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 30 June 2005 02:49 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm a bit confused about what you really want here. Do you think that the Theoretical Underpinnings section doesn't spell out where the inevitability comes from well enough? The GR "inevitability" argument comes from postulating an invariant metric. The details of the different metric components and what dependencies they can have are boring indeed, but we can go through them all if you want. I think, though, that mentioning Weyl's postulate and the three fundamental assumptions gives the framework needed. We might make a statement in that section that makes it more explicit that you use these assumptions/postulates within the construct of general relativity, but in reality you get an expanding universe in Newtonian limits too so while the "correct" way to do it is to use Einstein's Equations and work from there, I'm not sure that harping on this point is informative from an encyclopedia point of view. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 30 June 2005 02:55 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The original paragraph that I'd modified had contained the sentence "this leads to the inevitable conclusion that the observable universe was once all in one place". I felt that the term "inevitable" required justification, so I added a brief explanation of _why_ it was felt to be inevitable. The paragraph containing this sentence was later removed, making my objections to its original phrasing moot point. I hadn't realized that the entire paragraph had been removed when making my original reply to your statement about removal (I'd thought it had been rolled back to its old phrasing; serves me right for not checking the diffs carefully). I hope this adequately explains my comments to date. While I feel, on re-reading the article, that there should be a short note in section 4.1 indicating _why_ the Hubble expansion was taken as evidence for the big bang (which could simply note that it matched one of the solutions mentioned in the "history" section), I don't feel strongly enough about that to argue further about article content. I apologize for the confusion caused by my not reading the change history carefully enough. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 30 June 2005 03:11 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>A brief question for those more knowledgable than me. Has there been any attempt to estimate where exactly the singularity was, relative to Sol? An explanation of my thinking in this matter: as I understand, we know the direction and velocity of various galaxies relative to us, thanks to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshift.html" title="Redshift">redshift</a>. Shouldn't it be possible, then, to mathematically estimate the vector of each galaxy, and project that back to the central location where the big bang happened? If my assumptions are in error with regards to current thinking, please feel free to correct me. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrasswatchman_8b03.html" title="User:Brasswatchman">Brasswatchman</a> 30 July 2005 03:16 EST.</p>

<dd>Fascinating. How exactly is that possible? I was under the impression that the Big Bang was a single explosion at one point in space and time. Thank you for answering my questions. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrasswatchman_8b03.html" title="User:Brasswatchman">Brasswatchman</a> July 30, 2005 4:15 PM EST.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This is a very common misconception. You're picturing the "bang" as everything moving away from a single point. Picture a rubber <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balloon.html" title="Balloon">balloon</a>, and consider the <i>surface</i> of the balloon (<i>not</i> the interior) to be analogous to "space". Draw spots on the surface of the balloon to represent galaxies. When you inflate the balloon, the dots will all move away from each other as space (the surface of the balloon) expands. There's no one point on the surface of the balloon that they're moving away from. The Big Bang was at a single point in space and time, but only because all of space and time <i>was</i> a single point. Hope that helps a little bit. —<span class="horsepunchkid"><a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family: monospace; font-variant: small-caps;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color: #070;">龜</span></a></span> 22:52, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gamow and "prediction"</span></h2>
<p>It's unclear why Gamow predicted "background radiation" as a "relic of the evolution of the universe". It's also unclear how this is a consequence of big bang. Radiation in the "background" implies matter beyond that, which tends to falsify big bang, not verify it. This reference to Gamow "predicting" background radiation is weak, no prediction of the "temperature" of this radiation is cited to Gamow, how do we know he just wasn't taking shots in the dark? All other guesses as to the temperature failed. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> 21:24, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The assumption that this radiation is "background" radiation implies that it is beyond all matter in the universe. So far as we know, the universe has no edge, which is another nail in the big bang myth's coffin. Every time we look farther, we see more matter. Assume Gamow's "prediction" was a consequence of big bang and that and "background" radiation should exist in a universe created by big bang. Then this entire article needs to be categorized as pseudoscience, since it is entirely a consequence of misunderstanding of science and even common English words like "background". <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> 21:29, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Plautus, just because you don't understand something doesn't mean it is wrong. Why don't you actually go and read Gamow's papers? Publishing in a peer reviewed journal is not taking "shots in the dark." Gamow predicted the CMB in 1948, but did not estimate its temperature. Alpher and Herman did, the same year, and calculated 5K.</dd>
<dd>The term "background" means the radiation was emitted before decoupling, when structures first began to form in the universe. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 22:24, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let me quote something I wrote last year in the original big bang talk page, which all new people to this article should read: "By 1965, Gamow was not predicting the correct value (please see non-standard talk for reference, Assis and Neves 95.) Gamow, in his 1961 revised edition of "The Creation of the Universe", which I believe was his last publication concerning the CBR before 1965, predicted a value of 50K for the CBR. After Penzias and Wilson, he changed his claim, saying that 50K was calculated as an upper limit. However, in his book no mention of an upper limit is found: Gamow never hinted that his prediction was an upper limit, but was instead the most likely value. Also, Gamows main collaborators (Alpher and Hermann, 1949) predicted a temp of around 5K, and Gamow claimed that there would be other effect in addition which would increase the temperature by around 2K more. So Gamows early 50's prediction for a lower limit was around 7K. In the early 50's, based on non-expanding models Finlay-Freundlich predicted a closer temperature (&lt;5K) than Gamow . Max Born, in analyzing the work of F-F, concluded around 1954 that these observations could be made using radio techniques. The distinction between CBR and CMB is never made completely explicit in the works of Gamow or others. But then I havent read all of his papers so I might obviously be missing the important one where he specifically predicts microwave radiation. Im trying to be as historically accurate as possible so I will continue to research this distinction between CBR and CMB before making any more outrageous claims. -Ionized 14:35, Feb 10, 2004 (UTC)" Notice how I wrote that on Feb 10th, 2004, yet the article is STILL not reflecting the historically accurate truth.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Opening Paragraph</span></h2>
<p>It's not a good idea to call big bang a scientific theory, especially "the" scientific theory. Big bang is essentially the Genesis myth from the bible without mentioning a deity. Big bang should be called a belief in the opening paragraph. It also needs to be made clear that space is a hypothetical coordinate system invented by human beings to describe reality, it is not in itself reality. It's unclear how space can expand. I checked the dictionary and there are no reasonable definitions of "space" in it that would even allow for this possibility. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> 21:34, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here is my proposed change to the opening paragraph of this article:</p>
<p><b>Big Bang is the idea that the universe was created by the explosion of an object with no volume containing the entire universe. Believers in big bang cite calculated redshifts of celestial objects as evidence that virtually everything in the universe is moving rapidly away from the Earth. Some proponents of big bang believe that space itself expands, but it is unclear what definition of space even allows for this possibility.</b></p>

<dd>The difference is that the Big Bang theory makes testable hypotheses, and (combined with other theories like <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_inflation.html" title="Cosmic inflation">inflation</a>) is largely confirmed by validation of these hypotheses. Also, the dictionary is not a good place to look for a proper treatment of the notion of "space" in the context of physics and mathematics. To understand what is meant by the <i>expansion of space</i>, you'll need to look in a physics textbook.

<p>There's a good test of big bang. Big bang predicts that the universe is finite. Where are the edges of it? <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlautus_satire_98f1.html" title="User:Plautus satire">Plautus satire</a> 02:20, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You bring up a common misconception. A circle is finite in length (along its circumference), but it does not have an "edge" in any sense relevant to this discussion. That is, there is no beginning and end to a circle. Go up a dimension, and the same thing applies to spheres. There's no "edge" unless you cut it somehow. Go up further dimensions to get into the kinds of spaces that modern physics deals with, and the analogy holds. Therefore, this is not a useful test in the way that you've phrased it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One way you may be able to determine if the Universe is finite is to go (or see) "around" it, in the sense that you can go around the Earth. If you can go in a straight line and eventually get back (or see forward) to where you started, you're living in a finite space. At the very limits of the visible universe, we haven't seen any copies of objects in the foreground, so it doesn't seem like light is going in circles through it (as you might circle the Earth). So even in this better-phrased test, it's inconclusive. That's why we have to look at more fundamental properties like the total mass in the Universe and how quickly it appears to be expanding in order to determine whether or not it's closed. Hope that helps! —<span class="horsepunchkid"><a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family: monospace; font-variant: small-caps;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color: #070;">龜</span></a></span> 02:41, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I think what he was trying to point out was that the dimensions of quantum particles are determined by fundamental constants which are thought to be stable over time. That is, a proton today has the same radius it had when it was created. I don't think the article's phrase <i>expansion of space and matter</i> intended to mean that these particles are a different size than they were previously, but it is unclear and could be construed that way. So a rephrase of that statement would be beneficial. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlainster_3d88.html" title="User:Blainster">Blainster</a> 19:44, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

In particular, it seems to me (though <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_slang.html#I" title="Internet slang">IANAP</a>) that it's not right to draw that sort of distinction between "space" (which to a layman is <i>empty</i>) and "matter" (the stuff that's "in" space) particularly in this context. But then at that level, is it even worth trying to mention matter? Perhaps saying that space expanded is sufficient. —<span class="horsepunchkid"><a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family: monospace; font-variant: small-caps;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color: #070;">龜</span></a></span> 22:41, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is absurd. If the gas in a baloon "expands", that doesn't imply that the atoms get bigger. Similarly, if the matter in the universe "expands" it doesn't in any way imply that fundamental particles get bigger. I have a hard time believing a reasonable person would come to that conclusion. The expansion of matter is an important image for conveying the big bang to the lay person, and this business about particles not expanding can be clarified elsewhere. --<a href="../../../p/3/d/User%7EP3d0_7b66.html" title="User:P3d0">P3d0</a> 23:14, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Under the assumption that Space and Matter are different constituents of the Universe, the article is pretty clear: according to the b.b. theory they both needed to "expand" from the same point-like entity, relative to itself. Matter moves outwards into an expanding Space, without any expansion/enlargement of the actual particles. If space is in fact also Matter (particles), as the single Universal substance, such "expansion" would have implied either (I) an enlargement of the actual particles (or the linkages between them) or (II) a constant supply of extra Matter through this point-like place from somewhere else. Although it may sound counter-intuitive, I don't think that (I) is out of the question since the "speed" of the enlargement could be undetectable. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucian_e7a4.html" title="User:Lucian">Lucian</a> 01:37, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I also love how the BB proponents go into the other cosmology articles and add so many disclaimers that those articles begin to be about the BB itself. Hence I added the appropriate disclaimer on top, the same one that is used on both the non-standard cosmology and plasma cosmology pages. Please go back to talk page archive 1 and read it all. OH, and I just noticed you have banned Plautus AGAIN, simply for bringing in points to get people thinking outside of their little BB box.. Seriously, you people make me sick.

This fact is now known as Hubble's law (see Edwin Hubble: Mariner of the Nebulae by Edward Christianson)."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Origin of premival atom</span></h2>
<p>I read the article on big bang theory. I am confused imagining the size of this atom. What was this atom sorrounded by? Are their any unknown things outside the universe. If universe is expanding in space then is their any limit of this space. I am not a science student but i am interested in space related things. I think we the humans have only a little knowledge about our universe.</p>
<p><a name="blah" id="blah"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">blah</span></h2>
<p>i don't think that before the big bang, everything was an atom because that would go against the theory that matter cannot be made (or destroyed). no one knows what the "thing" was surrounded by because nobody was there, but i think it may have been just an infinate amount of space with no light (probably wrong&#160;:P). some scientists think that someday a huge gravitational pull created from the most massive thing in the universe will pull everything back together into a compacted ball (the theory of the big crunch (opposite of the big bang)). (MCC)</p>
<p>Could it be that the Big Bang is what happens on the 'otherside/inside' of a Black Hole? That would contribute to the theory of Infinity and provide a starting event for the 'expansion' of this known Universe. It would also provide for the possibility of an 'infinity' of universes, the only constant being Change/Flux. (MJB)</p>

<p>I see that the game of musical chairs in the introduction has started again. I have revised it, although I do not pretend that my version is perfect. I tried to emphasize that the combination of Hubble's law and the cosmological principle must imply that <i>space itself</i> is expanding, which is also predicted by general relativity. I think this is the central point, as omitting the cosmological principle allows for models, such as Alfvén's ambiplasma model, which account for the observed redshifts by suggesting we are at the center of an explosion, with galaxies receding because they have been ejected from a central event with some large velocity... –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 21:16, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Just to say that I am not really an adherent of Plasma cosmology as Ionized is&#160;:), I am more of a Super stringist and MWT adherent. The problem in the talk page seems to be caused by a debate on wherever or not the Big bang happened, rather than a debate on the different positions and whom adhere to it in the Academic community.

<dd>You should evaluate more carefully what a scientific theory really means. It is method to describe current observatiosn and predict new ones. It should be falsifiable by future observations.
