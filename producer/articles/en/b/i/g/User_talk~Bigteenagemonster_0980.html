<p>You said: "First of all that thing i wrote above was not under the account verdict (i am done with that stupid account), secondly i was not lying, but when i saw you blocked me again without responding i figured you obviously didnt care about all that i wrote so i said to you that well then im bringing in friends. Just for the record i do not create all this accounts, its a friend of mine. I was just about to ask you how i can prevent from violating the fair use policy, since i dont know how it works or where to find out about it, but then as i was clicking on save page, i was blocked again, just when i thought we where on good terms i got blocked, when i had put effort in trying to explain to you and be friends instead but you just blocked me, of course i got mad. So that was not a lie, and that was the reason i threatend, now those things are worked out. And as far as vioalting the Wikipedia policy, well i was just about to ask how to prevent from doing that before you blocked me before. So i hope you understand that what i wrote was not a lie and i still want to be on good terms and i want to know how not to violate the policy, but when you blocked me without answering i figured you didnt want to. I hope you understand me now.</p>
<p>So what i was about to tell you before was that i am willing to go through whatever you put on me to learn the Wikipedia policy that you claim i am violating in order to stay clean because like i said i do not want to make any harm whatsover but you have to also understand that i am only here for a couple of articles and i really dont know anything about wikipedia´s policy´s but with your help i am sure i can stay clean here but with all these blockes and not trying to help me understand stuff around here, you have to understand it makes me frustraded and of course its going to make me write this stupid things. So i hope we can start over, and i hope you are willing to help me stay clean here on wikipedia instead of keeping me out of it."</p>

<dd>You say this but you have set up <b>yet another abusive sockpuppet account</b>. It is rather hard to believe you when you keep on deliberately violating Wikipedia's policies. But I tell you what, I'll let this one account stay unblocked so long as you only use it to communicate with me, respond on your user page, or pursue dispute resolution. Even one instance of image uploading or article editing, however, <i>permanently terminates this offer</i>. I will try to work out some form of dispute resolution in the next few days. You will have to be willing to accept that the results of this will be binding on you. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 23:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please do all of your responding right here, on this page. There's no reason for you to copy it over to my talk page. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 23:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok i will not upload any picture untill we are officially on good terms and i have learned the fair use policy. So how are you going to help me? And also as soon as we are officially on good terms, i will have an account of my real name and i will have that one and only that and i will let you know about, that way you can watch me and see how i behave and stuff like that and we can be friends rather than enemies, and if i do a mistake you let me just know about. Thats a pretty good solution i think can work out. And from now-on, dont worry about my attitude or any stuff like that, i am going to be all good from now-on. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bigteenagemonster (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bigteenagemonster_51c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bigteenagemonster">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I'm not sure yet. What will probably happen is that we will both plead our cases against a neutral third party. Note, though, that you <i>must</i> agree to leave willingly if this third party decides you have acted abusively and should not be unblocked. Similarly, I will agree not to block you for violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> if this third party decides you should be allowed to continue editing. I'm not quite sure the best venue for this. When I have some time, I will look around. Note that you will be presenting your case for unblocking and I will be presenting a case to keep you blocked/banned. Also note that if you create <b>any</b> more accounts or edit <b>any</b> Wikipedia article in the meanwhile, this offer is permanently withdrawn. Similarly, you must stop masquerading as me and stop violating my privacy. In principle, is this acceptable to you? --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 23:51, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And yes, we can change the name of this account if you are unblocked. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 23:51, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok great, it wasnt my choice of name either so good, and yes i accept, and i will tell my buddy Frank to stop making me accounts and fake ip address from now-on and i will be here on wikipedia only on your terms. Thanks buddy for being willing to do this despite me being such a vandal which i wish never had gone this way but now i am going to learn from my mistakes and as good of a guy as i can here on wikipedia. And from now-on i will respect the advanced and admins here. --Bigteenagemonster 00:58, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, good. I'll note that I'm really busy at work at the moment and also plan on taking my computer apart over the weekend. As such, it may not be long before you start thinking I am ignoring you. I <i>assure</i> you that this is not the case. If you start getting tired of waiting for me and you've tried leaving a message here, please prod me by leaving a message on my user talk page. I will try to keep you informed on what the options are. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 00:00, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok but i will be busy to, i have a training shedule to follow, aswell as school so i will be gone from the computer for about 2-3 weeks but when i come back i let you know buddy. --Bigteenagemonster 01:05, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
