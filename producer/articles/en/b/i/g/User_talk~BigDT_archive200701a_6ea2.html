<p>In lieu of spamming eveyone's talk page with a message of thanks, I would like to place this message here for everyone who participated in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_BigDT_2_c571.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/BigDT 2">my RFA</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you. The tremendous show of support was humbling and heart-warming. This week has been an interesting one. I will strive to earn the trust that the community has placed in me.</p>
<p>I am placing myself in <a href="../../../a/d/m/Category%7EAdministrators_open_to_recall_309a.html" title="Category:Administrators open to recall">Category:Administrators open to recall</a>. That means that if you feel I am ever using the administrative tools incorrectly, I want to hear about it, no matter how minor the concern is.</p>
<p>I will, as some have suggested I should, make sure that I spend more time on writing and on developing an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Thank you all for participating in this process. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:35, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ordinarily I don't get too involved in fair use image issues but the David Westerfield case <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Westerfield&amp;diff=98081934&amp;oldid=97468214" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Westerfield&amp;diff=98081934&amp;oldid=97468214" rel="nofollow">you mentioned</a> seems like a tough one.

<dd>I 100% agree that it's irreplaceable ... but news media photos don't qualify for fair use ... they never can unless the photo itself is newsworthy. It's one thing when we're talking about screenshots, logos, promophotos, whatever, even with a questionable rationale. But in the case of news media photos, the way the photographer puts food on his/her family's table is by selling the photo. By using the photo, we are directly competing with their intended market for the image. If it was legitimate to use these photos as fair use, why would a newspaper ever pay for an AP photo? Just use it and claim fair use. While Wikipedia could probably get away with it if sued, the commercial sites that use Wikipedia's content cannot. I don't have the heartache over promo photos that some people do ... but we really need to stay away from media photos. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 02:42, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I recently found that the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article on Wikipedia is the first item that comes up when you search for "Jesus" on the world’s most widely used search engine, Google.</p>
<p>Please edit the Jesus article to make it an accurate and excellent representation of Him.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article may be a person’s first impression of Jesus. It would be nice if their first impression was from a Christian or the Bible, but for so many in these new days it probably comes from the Internet. Watch the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> page to keep it focused on Him. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Also, watch out to follow Wikipedia's <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Policies and guidelines</a>.

<p>I would like to know why all of a suden you want to delete a large number of images from the articles about the Iraq war, some of them have been there for two months already and were not ever nominated for deletion and one that you want to delete the image of insurgents that are celebrating in the streets of Fallujah has been there for more than two years already. <a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETop_Gun_a8ab.html" title="User:Top Gun">Top Gun</a> 19:03, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>News media photos absolutely 100% cannot be used to illustrate the subject of the photo - they can only be used when the photo itself is iconic, eg <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raising_the_Flag_on_Iwo_Jima_30fb.html" title="Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima">Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Falling_Man_3a68.html" title="The Falling Man">The Falling Man</a>, or <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_State_shootings_f7ad.html" title="Kent State shootings">Kent State shootings</a>. If you couldn't potentially write an article about the <i>photo itself</i>, it is not acceptable for fair use. I nominate every news media photo I find for deletion. If you take a look back through my nominations, there have been plenty unrelated to Iraq. The reason there were multiple ones from Iraq last night is that there was a whole series of Iraq articles that all used the same set of photos. Every time I would go to an article page to add the image deletion warning tag, I'd find two more photos that also needed to be nominated. I have no particular bias with respect to Iraq (I'm generally conservative, though not a Bush supporter) and that I can recall, I've never made an edit to an Iraq article other than reverting vandalism or dealing with copyvio images. I recognize that everyone who uploads these photos is doing so in good faith and doesn't realize that they are forbidden under our fair use policy. I wish we would make news media photos a criterion for speedy deletion so that well-meaning users wouldn't waste so much time uploading them. I hope this explanation helps.

<dd>Just so you know you won't find much support in deleting the images as I have already seen many users have expresed their opinion to keep most of the images you have nominated for deletion from the Iraq section. And just so you know some of the images, even if not so famous in the whole world like the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raising_the_Flag_on_Iwo_Jima_30fb.html" title="Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima">Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima</a>, they are iconic representations of historic events like the image of insurgents celebrating in Fallujah their victory. Most users will agree with me. --<a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETop_Gun_a8ab.html" title="User:Top Gun">Top Gun</a> 01:52, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're 100% right about one thing - there are a lot who would agree with you. But the thing that we need to keep in mind is that it isn't a vote. Wikipedia is a free-content encyclopedia and cannot be a clearinghouse for copyrighted images. If this <i>photo itself</i> is an iconic image, can you find links or other references to it showing its status? In other words, has anyone written an article about it or has it been discussed, even on message boards? I offer as something analogous, this photo <a href="http://www.brinkleys.org/users/tsl/Files%2Fdroppedpass%2Ejpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brinkleys.org/users/tsl/Files%2Fdroppedpass%2Ejpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It was taken at a football game three years ago and quickly became almost an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_meme.html" title="Internet meme">internet meme</a>. There was a <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fark.com.html" title="Fark.com">fark.com</a> photoshop thread on it. The Virginia Tech message board posted it repeatedly. It was mentioned in plenty of news articles about the game. The <i>photo itself</i> - not just the game or the play it depicted - was significant. Obviously, a photo from a football game isn't going to have the same historical value 50 years from now as <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raising_the_Flag_on_Iwo_Jima_30fb.html" title="Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima">Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima</a>, but like the Iwo Jima photo, this football photo has a significance that transcends the event it depicts. Do any of these Iraq photos have that same significance? If someone has written an article about them or if they somehow demonstrably have an importance other than simply for illustrating the event they depict, then they are iconic. If not, then it would seem difficult to justify them. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 02:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Listen the Iraq war is an ongoing war and it is going to be realy hard to find images in places where they just say "here use this". Almost all of the images coming out of Iraq are coming from news agencies and they are the only source of things going on over there. The DoD also releases images yes but only from their point of view, and we can not use only their photos it would be in contrast to the Wikipedia POV policie. And the Fallujah image may not be iconic but represents a historic event. You try finding another image that represents the 1st of May 2004 situation in that city. But this is not just about that one image. The news agencies are almost the only source of images for the Iraq war. There are still no official public articles for that war in a whole. As far as I'm consorned the only one that bothered to start this debate is you. And I see no reason for your stance to delete these images. Listen I am telling you this politly the news agencies are almost the only source of images for the Iraq war. And also you said that this isn't a vote. Then why put it up for a disscusion. Why don't you just ignore the opinions of all the other editors and just delete the images. You can not delete images when the mayority of Wikipedia editors, some like me working here longer than you, do not agree with you. That is not a neutral point of view which is a more tougher Wikipedia rule than the one you are talking about. I already checked it's already for one image from Iraq 5 against 3 votes to keep, and for one more 3 against 1 to keep, that includes you by the way in both votes.--<a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETop_Gun_a8ab.html" title="User:Top Gun">Top Gun</a> 05:06, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What rationale could I write? I would have to lie - you believe that the image can be used, so you, in good faith, can write a rationale. I cannot. I don't have an anti-content attitude, I have an anti-copyvio attitude. The reason my mainspace edits are low relative to everything else is that if you nominate an image for deletion, that's 2-3 edits right there. (Warn user, WP:IFD, image itself.) Frequently, uploaders upload their entire porn collection or some such thing, so sometimes, it's 50 edits in a 5-minute window and it's less work than, say, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Wake_Forest_Demon_Deacons_football_team_da61.html" title="2006 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team">2006 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team</a>, which amounts to one edit. I have no qualms with images. I have no qualms with fair use images. What I have qualms with are images where Wikipedia can get into trouble. Media photos just plain are not acceptable. Usually, they are deleted without much fanfare. I'm sorry that there's so many hard feelings about them and that's one of the reasons we need to make it a CSD - if it's unambiguously on a list of things can be speedy deleted, there's no hard feelings a year after it is uploaded. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 06:58, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I do not doubt the fact that nominating each image for deletion takes many edits. But precisely your total concentration of policing instead of content creation is alarming. Now, the issue is not hard feelings. The issue is completeness of encyclopedic articles cannot be often ensured without fair use images. The issue is that certain users tend to take special enjoyment in policing instead of seeing it a necessary evil. Your calling this "anti-copyvio attitude" is misleading. Fair-use is not copyvio and fighting them is anti-encyclopedic. Encyclopedic would be to spend time searching for a free replacement and if none is available, spend time to find the non-free image to which you can provide a rationale. If I am mistaken and you can show the diffs that show significant content creation on your part, I will reconsider my opinion about your adminship nomination. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 07:31, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In some cases, there may <i>not</i> be an acceptable replacement. In the case of, say, promophotos, leaving them around unless or until a replacement is found may not be compatible with the new replaceability policy, but it probably isn't going to hurt anything. Media photos are different, though. There are commercial content providers like about.com and answers.com that use Wikipedia content for commercial purposes. So when we give them a media photo, we're supplanting the rights of the photographer or news agency to sell and collect royalties on it. With promo photos, that's not a huge problem - nobody is actually trying to sell the promo photo. But with media photos, that's how they make thier money. So media photos are in a special category of fair use problems. They can't just sit around and wait for a replacement. Couching it in terms of what is or isn't encyclopedic really doesn't change anything. As for significant contributions on my part? I'm not really interested in changing your mind or getting into an argument over it. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 07:47, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. This is what I just wrote on the Scouting project talk page: "That policy makes no sense at all. If there's only one known copy of a person/building, then it is not replaceable. What are people supposed to do, like in this case is to fly to Albania to get their own. This is expecting too much of people and another case of extremists getting control of wiki." What is the actual rationale (and I use that term loosely here) for this? Before long we won't have any photos useable on wiki and the articles will be boring text.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 13:14, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have replied on the <a href="../../../s/c/o/WP%7ESCOUT_0bed.html" title="WP:SCOUT">WP:SCOUT</a> talk page with a suggestion that we try to contact someone from the Albanian Wikipedia. As for the rationale for this policy, the biggest thing is downstream uses of Wikipedia content. Using one image from some guy's website may not really matter for Wikipedia (non-commercial, educational lets you get away with a lot of things), but it does matter for downstream uses. Also, Wikipedia's goal is to be as completely free-content as possible and allowing images like this to be used potentially discourages trying to find or create free replacements. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 15:21, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I can buy that. The downstream use from wiki is fallacious as there is also downstream use from the place wiki got it from, so no diff as far as I'm concerned. And since Fair Use is legal in the US, where the servers are, then there is no reason not to use FU images as log as the rationale is on the image upload. Wiki editors enforcing this are merely making it harder if not impossible to have pictures of lots of things on wiki. Too many image enforcers claim there is a replacement when there simply isn't, like this Albania image--can you find one? I can't. Wiki has lost a lot of editors over this and will lose more if they don't embracea more rational approach to this. At least with you, a rational discussion can take place on it--which is not possible with several image enforcers, most (in)notabley <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">User:Durin</a>. Attaining totally free content will never reach 100% unless you want some article with no pictures--like you couldn't upload an image of the Girl Scouts' award patches if it went to that extreme. Under this current train of wiki's are creative commons, GFDL, and public domain (just making sure), and whatever else still allowed? <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 15:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, there are some Wikipedias that user no non-free images at all. The Spanish one is an example ... so if you go to <a href="../../../../es/v/i/a/Viaje_a_las_Estrellas_680f.html" class="extiw" title="es:Viaje_a_las_Estrellas">Star Trek on the Spanish Wikipedia</a>, there are zero images. I've seen that suggested for en once or twice, but always loudly rejected. US fair use law is very permissive (in that it really has no restrictions at all - restrictions are determined on a case by case basis in court) so that isn't going to fly here - we'd just be shooting ourselves in the foot. It's one thing to argue about replaceable images, but with the Girl Scout patches you mentioned or with screenshots of movies, there is <i>no such thing</i> as a free version. No amount of time or money would ever create one because it would just be a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Derivative_works" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:Derivative_works">derivative work</a>. The thing about en's new policy is that it used to be that a fair use image could be used until a replacement was found. Now, it can only be used if no replacement could logically be created. What would have been a really good idea that should have been done and was done 1.5 years ago when Wikipedia stopped using "non-commercial" images is grandfather the old images temporarilly. That way, you don't have bot-assisted deletions en masse of these photos and they can be replaced over time on a case-by-case basis. The original though/hope when the policy was changed is that Wikipedia was high enough on the search rankings that we could ask for and receive GFDL images from most celebrities. In the short term, that's probably somewhat wishful thinking. In the long term, it may be realistic and it will be interesting to see. To answer your question, CC licenses (as long as they permit commercial use and derivatives), GFDL, and PD images are, of course, permitted. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 15:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You couldn't use a Girl Scout patch that happens to have a picture of a flower to illustrate <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flower.html" title="Flower">flower</a>, but as long as you are illustrating the patch itself, you're fine. Just tag it with {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>}} and give it a good rationale telling what purpose it serves. For Scout images, if they are scans of a 2-d object like a patch, it really doesn't matter how you tag them on flickr. Under <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp._c4bb.html" title="Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.">Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.</a>, scanning, photographing, or otherwise copying a 2-d work is not considered creative and no copyright is created. If they are photos from Scout meetings, I understand the concern. I wonder, if it were ever to be proposed, what the thought would be on allowing a no derivatives restriction for images that contain living people. If you use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGfdl-self_62d8.html" title="Template:Gfdl-self">gfdl-self</a>}}, the legalese is sufficiently complicated that most anyone who would want to use it for something less than nice would move on to something else. You can always multi-license them .... on flickr, license them as cc-nd-nc and on Wikipedia, license them under the GFDL. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:35, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. It's nice to have someone that knows Scouting and (what I consider hopelessly complicated) image tagging. Interestingly, I've already tagged my photos on flickr using cc-nd-nc (but so far I've only put up family ones, I was going to start the Scout ones this weekend--I have a PRO account). For our FAs on BSA (merit badge history and the Eagle Scout article) I actually talked to the BSA lawyer and got permission for BSA images (medals, patches, etc) on wiki and we use the "scout-logo" template along with a FU rationale that mentions this BSA permission. Any Scout stuff I'll GFDL on wiki and use cc-nd-nc on flickr (I didn't know you could do that).

<p>If you are so stick on to the thing that you want to delete all of the images on Wikipedia that are from media or news services then how should editors represent through images new articles about new events. For example the Israel-Lebanon war there you have many imagaes that were taken from some news services. Also one more thing some of the images from the Iraq war that you have nominated for deletion don't have an AP photo mark on them. Even if they were used in AP news articles that doesn't mean that they were made by AP newsguys, AP can be using those photos also under "fair use". I think this point was also pointed out by another user. Here is the question. HOW DO YOU THINK EDITORS CAN CREAT ARTICLES ABOUT CURENT EVENTS WITHOUT USING IMAGES THAT ARE ONLY COMING FROM NEWS SERVICES? ANSWER ME THAT.--<a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETop_Gun_a8ab.html" title="User:Top Gun">Top Gun</a> 23:57, 6 January 2007</p>

<dd>Well, first, please consider that some Wikipedias permit no fair use images at all. For example, the Spanish article on Star Trek - <a href="../../../../es/v/i/a/Viaje_a_las_Estrellas_680f.html" class="extiw" title="es:Viaje_a_las_Estrellas">es:Viaje a las Estrellas</a> - has no images because there's no such thing as a free Star Trek image. So one answer is that, in some cases, we may not have images in the short term. Another thing to consider is that we can sometimes find images from Wikipedias nearer those events, for example, the Hebrew Wikipedia. But using news media photos is not an acceptable solution. Yes, you are correct that if the AP is merely reprinting a promotional photo and doesn't actually own the copyright, we may be able to use it, but that needs to be demonstrated on the image description page. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well in that case why don't you put some effort in finding evidence that some of the images that you want to delete are actualy not AP images.

<p>HI BigDT, saw your response and wanted to run my original question by you to see if it changes your interpretation or not. I believe that the edit in question is a BLP problem because by posting the quote from the newspaper into the section talking about his problem with drug addiction and the deal with the prosecutor which dropped all the charges, creates a false comparison and implies that Limbaugh committed a criminal act and got off easy compared to what he said should happen to "drug offenders".</p>
<p>The edit in question "Reporters for the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> contrasted this deal to Limbaugh's previous statements regarding drug offenders' punishments. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_5.html" title="October 5">October 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, Limbaugh said on his television program, "Drug use, some might say, is destroying this country. And we have laws against selling drugs, pushing drugs, using drugs, importing drugs. ... And so if people are violating the law by doing drugs, they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up."</p>
<p>Limbaugh was not found guilty of any crime or of illegally using drugs, but the statement suggests that the two situations "Limbaugh's situation" and "other drug offenders who violated the law" are equivalent, suggesting Limbaugh is a lawbreaker. Again, he was never found guilty, in fact no case ever even went to trial. All charges were dropped. Two years into the case, and six months before all charges were dropped, the state attorney said "I have no idea if Mr. Limbaugh has completed the elements of any offense yet.". Limbaugh certainly developed a problem with the drugs he was taking, a condition not that uncommon with people who are prescribed heavy pain killers for dealing with constant pain, but he was also not found to have obtained any drugs illegally. So, no valid cites that limbaugh made illegal use of drugs exist.</p>
<p>But this quote again, by saying "Reporters for the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> contrasted this deal to Limbaugh's previous statements regarding drug offenders' punishments"...implies Limbaugh is a "Drug offender" and a lawbreaker and no where is it accurately sourced that he is.</p>
<p>It would be like, if we were writing an article on someone (who in the past said that "Horse thieves should be whipped" who was later himself investigated for horse thievery and had all charges dropped and never went to trial...and then we put into the article right after the part about dropping the charges "So and so contrasted this deal to Black Bart's previous statements about how horse thieves should be punished"...would we not be inferring that Black Bart should be considered the equivalent of a horse thief?</p>

<dd>It will all work automatically. Any image on Commons that does not have a corresponding Wikipedia image will be displayed as if it were a Wikipedia image.

If you go to that image page, the "image" and "discussion" links are both redlinks because the image is at Commons. But the image shows up anywhere that it is used on enwiki. If someone were to try to upload an image by the same name (in other words, try to block the commons image from coming through), they will get an error.

<dd>Yes. Commons only accepts free images (no fair use ones). Its purpose is to be a library of images that all Wikimedia projects can draw from. Commons has "articles" like <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/glasses" class="extiw" title="commons:glasses">Commons:glasses</a> or <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech" class="extiw" title="commons:Virginia_Tech">Commons:Virginia Tech</a> that are essentially just galleries.

It might be a good idea for us to create <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/camping" class="extiw" title="commons:camping">Commons:camping</a> or <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scout" class="extiw" title="commons:Boy_Scout">Commons:Boy Scout</a> or other similar articles at some point ... that kind of thing has been one of our goals at the college football project (<a href="../../../c/f/b/WP%7ECFB_6e26.html" title="WP:CFB">WP:CFB</a>). --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Dear BigDT,</p>
<p>As the user who left the most recent official warning on the above users talk page, i hope you don't mind me addressing this to you. In adittion to Patchbooks ever gorwing list of personal attacks, vandalism and other infractions, he recently left the following on the Article Watch list on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Law_Enforcement_No_vandalism%2C_no_conflict_7055.html#Article_Watch" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Law Enforcement/No vandalism, no conflict">Article Watch list</a>:</p>

<p>I personally find this unacceptable, as he has no right to use that space to continue his arguements as that space is for the members (particularly myself and other unofficial admin staff of the wikiproject) to list articles that are causing problems, not to further his own arguement.

<dd>That's a Commons image, as is the other one in that article. They are marked as PD images and there is a note that Wikimedia's permissions tracking system has a letter of permission releasing them into the public domain. Unfortunately, the way the description page is worded, I'm betting the permission is from the guy who scanned the images for his website ... while interesting, that doesn't mean the Scout Council released them into the public domain. I'm leaving a message with <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">User:Jkelly</a> on his commons talk page asking him to look into the OTRS system to see who the permission is from.

<p>Hi DT, I saw that you edited the Infobox WorldScouting to enable variable image sizes. Why?

<dd>Well, consistency is a good thing, I'll admit ... but sometimes flexibility is needed. For example, if the image is something like a council strip - what I put at <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidewater_Council_fca2.html" title="Tidewater Council">Tidewater Council</a> - 140px is too small. I would suggest, as a third alternative, leave the option in there, but edit the description page to say, "for consistency, the suggested size for logos is 140px" or something like that. I have no incredibly strong feelings about it ... I just added the option because the patch on <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidewater_Council_fca2.html" title="Tidewater Council">Tidewater Council</a> looked bad with the smaller size. Also, you could have something like a 150px or 130px logo, where resizing it to 140px would create awful scaling. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:43, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Problematic scaling is just a technicality, which should not be directive for design choices. For using a low/wide picture, it just needs a bit of creativity. What do you think of my current copyedit?

<p>Dear BigDT - Appreciate your input on the Two Witnesses - we are continuing the article (about 10 of us) until completion (as you can see) - now, however your technical ability on moving the links to more asthetic positioning is deeply appreciately - i.e., can you help us to do so? This article is highly linked--we do not wish to compromise its research; however, we do wish to secure a better "reading appearance" and, what you have done, technically, is something that we should do - so, HELP&#160;:) kriegerdwm</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes ... anything that is an internal Wikipedia link should not be linked with a URL. In other words, instead of this:</dd>
</dl>
<p>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology eschatological]</p>
<p>... do this:</p>
<p>[[Eschatology eschatological]]</p>
<p>I think that's a big part of the formatting issues in there. Also, things like "Additional links/content will be added within 24 hrs." are generally a bad idea - see <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>. Basically, you want to avoid references to Wikipedia itself.</p>
<p>Lastly, see {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}}. This template lets you cite a website and is better than linking everything inline. So what you can do is this:</p>
<p>&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somewhere.com/whatever|title=Name of website}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Then, at the bottom, add:</p>
<p>&lt;references /&gt;</p>
<p>Everything will neatly be displayed at the bottom. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 06:54, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>BigDT - I finally figured out how you do the links - thanks so very much for your keen interest and help - I got the messages and am moving through the Wikipedia fog now that I have you as my pilot! The Two Witnesses</p>

<p>BigDT - I'm still have difficult on these links for the TWO WITNESSES article. I received your message but I obviously did not understand it (although I thought I did); therefore, the Eschatology eschatological seems fairly clear - I simply cite the Wikipedia name as it is in the Wikipedia cite reference and then add my equivalent word next to it with a space in between for separation.</p>
<p>Next - this {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}} is what's troubling. Firstly, I can't find where the template is located - what are the steps to finding this template? Apparently, as you say, the template "lets you cite a website" - then, precisely, what are the steps in doing this? How does one go about placing the &lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporate this into the {{cite web|url, etc. I know this must sound really stupid, but when you're dealing with "dummies" it's not so easy . . . any help will, of course, be greatly appreciated.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kriegerdwm (<a href="../../../k/r/i/User_talk%7EKriegerdwm_cf54.html" title="User talk:Kriegerdwm">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kriegerdwm_1f48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kriegerdwm">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>If you click on {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}}, the template description page gives the syntax for using it, along with a number of examples. What I do every time is just copy and paste one of the examples and then edit the URL, title, date, etc, to be what I want it to be.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, using one of their examples, if you type this code ...</p>
<p>{{cite web | title=My Favorite Things Part II | url=http://www.example.org/ | accessdate=2005-07-06 }}</p>
<p>... then this will be generated:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.example.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.example.org/" rel="nofollow">My Favorite Things Part II</a>. Retrieved on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_6.html" title="July 6">07-06</a>.</p>
<p>Any time you put the "ref" tags around anything, the Wikipedia software will automatically display it at the bottom of the page in the references section and provide a little [1], [2], etc footnote tag. So if you do this:</p>
<p>&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=My Favorite Things Part II | url=http://www.example.org/ | accessdate=2005-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>... then, in the article, you will just see a [1] where you put that tag and down at the bottom, you will see the full citation. You can put anything inside of ref tags ... it could just be a note for clarification, like:</p>
<p>&lt;ref&gt;Some people think that "God helps those who help themselves" comes from the Bible, but actually, it comes from a book called Discourses Concerning Government&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>... or ...</p>
<p>&lt;ref&gt;John was also the author of three epistles and a gospel.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Does that help explain it? --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:16, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>O.K. - I'll give it a shot - the significance of this topic is so incredible that it deserves a "stand alone" for sure - and it involves Zechariah 4 and, of course, scores of apocalyptic texts throughout "The Book" - Indeed, we need the patience of Job to get through this one . . . and, you are right - shocking, isn't it, that something hasn't been written on this most crucial subject?--but it hasn't and it's implications are simply overwhelming, given the current interest amongst the end-time crowd/throng, let alone general public interest--researchers need to understand the ramifications of the dynamic involved in this subject and NOT to incorporate it into the Revelation - it's implications extend out beyond Revelation's imagery and/or give profound and immediate consequence regarding today's events leading up, as many contemplate, to the "end of days."</p>

<li>Sorry to but into this discussion, but while editing a section above, I happened to see this. Would you recommend to use this template for some (beautiful) pictures that I have of Japanese scouts attending the 1955 World Scout Jamboree, and no possibility to get permission of the original photographer (i have tried extensively)? <span style="color:#B03060;"><i><a href="../../../w/i/m/User%7EWimvandorst_0265.html" title="User:Wimvandorst">Wim van Dorst</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/m/User_talk%7EWimvandorst_3f33.html" title="User talk:Wimvandorst">Talk</a>)</i></span> 22:30, 10 January 2007 (UTC).

<li>Please see <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR</a> for Wikipedia's fair use policy. As long as it serves an important purpose in the article, it would likely be fine. The big key is whether or not the image is potentially replaceable for the purpose for which you want to use it. If you are looking to use them in an article when discussing previous Scout Jamborees or BSA history or something like that, I wouldn't see a problem at all. Just make sure that you write up a good rationale saying what you are using them for. I have created <a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_rationale_05b3.html" title="Template:Fair use rationale">Template:Fair use rationale</a>, which may be helpful in writing a rationale. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:38, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>When it deals with PDL I am all buisness. I need these images and I have recruited 2 members to wikipedia. I felt that I could inform them of upcoming events easier on their talk pages. I also am 100% devoted to make sure that they do not vandalize pages. I brought them in and I will keep a good eye on them. But seriously I need those images! <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Boss_0_5fda.html" title="User:Big Boss 0">Big Boss 0</a> 02:49, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok ... what is PDL? Do any of you guys plan to contribute to articles? I appreciate your willingness to bring in new users, but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> free webhosting. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 02:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well aware of that but PDL is a democracy. Every member has a voice meaning every member has a say in what shoul or shouldn't be on our user pages. I put a list of the rules on their pages for convience. If I edit anything I will edit it on their pages. And yes I will be taeching them how to properly edit and contribute but at the moment we need these pictures. PDL needs these pictures. And as far as the New World Organization, it is what all PDL members are contracted under. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Boss_0_5fda.html" title="User:Big Boss 0">Big Boss 0</a> 03:08, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With all due respect, what you are describing sounds like a game. As for the images, please see <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR</a> - this is Wikipedia's policy concerning "fair use" images. In order for Wikipedia to host a "fair use" image, it must be used in an article. If it isn't, it gets deleted. Please consider contributing to the encyclopedia rather than spending all of your energies on user pages. For example, there are a number of articles on video games. You could find one that interests you and improve it. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 03:14, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I take this as seriously as life or death! For PDL information checkout my userpage. But it is important to keep these images because they are being used in an small artical on my userpage.

<p>Hey, thanks so much for supporting my recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Budgiekiller_df91.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Budgiekiller">RFA</a>. A number of editors considered that I wasn't ready for the mop yet and unfortunately the RFA did not succeed (69/26/11). There are a number of areas which I will be working on (including changing my username) in the next few months in order to allay the fears of those who opposed my election to administrator.</p>
<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you sincerely for your support over the past week. I've been blown away by the level of interest taken in my RFA and appreciate the time and energy dedicated by all the editors who have contributed to it, support, oppose and neutral alike. I hope to bump into you again soon and look forward to serving you and Wikipedia in any way I can.

<p>Will you explain to me the appropriate use of the {{db|because}} tag for me?

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your question. That tag is most useful, to me anyway, when there is some other explanation that needs to be given. In other words, the administrator needs some technical knowledge or needs some background information in order to understand why this article meets a speedy deletion criterion. For example, criterion G4 refers to previously deleted articles. But suppose that the previously deleted article was called "Bob Smith" and this one is called "Robert Smith". Looking in the deletion log, I'm not going to see that there is a previously deleted article there, so if you just tag it as db-g4, it would get removed. But if you tag it as {{db|G4 - this article is a recreation of the deleted Robert Smith (see AFD)}}, then whatever administrator looks at it would quickly recognize it. Another time I would use it is on empty description pages for Commons images. If I just put db-noimage on there, then over half of the time, I get a message saying, "the image that you want to delete is at Commons, please see Commons:deletion requests if you would like to have it deleted." But really what I was asking about was the empty description page on Wikipedia that somebody accidentally created and which contains no meaningful GFDL history. So I started using db|explanation for that as well. At any rate, unless there is a speedy deletion criterion that fits, the article needs to go through another process. In this particular case, you made reference to it being a future film. We have plenty of articles about future films ... <a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Are_Marshall_edc0.html" title="We Are Marshall">We Are Marshall</a>, for example, was substantially complete well before the film was out.

<dd>That's much more clear. I was applying db-because in cases I thought were wp:snow but didn't have a clear category.</dd>

<p>On a separate note, how can a movie be notable while it's still in production? Yes, I see a few movies hitting this criteria - Star Wars sequels and Waterworld come to mind. However, I see nothing unusual about this movie. I've been working on-again, off-again on a documentary, but I wouldn't dream of creating an article about it here. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 20:03, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know ... that's an issue where people can disagree. I kinda draw the line at whether or not you can write an article about it that is more than message board speculation. If it's a real movie (not fan fiction or something) and there are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources of information, I don't see a problem with having the article. As I said to one other person above, though, it's fully possible that I'm wrong ... feel free to put the tag back and let another admin take a look at it. Having a flag set on my account just gives me an extra button - it doesn't make me smarter than anyone else.&#160;;) --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:11, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your kind words. I was thinking last night about something ... I saw one RFA thank you note for an RFA that passed unanimously that said something like, "your vote was not the deciding vote, but I thank you anyway".

<p>Congrats from me as well. Although I opposed, it wasn't for any lack of respect for the excellent work you've done so far, and I hope you keep it up. Nor do I think that a maintenance focus in any way guarantees problems as an admin. Do take care, though, to make the extra effort to put yourself in the shoes of the people you are dealing with, and remember the attachment that people have to the work they have contributed here. Administrating (particularly in contentious areas, some of which you are involved in) consists largely of long spells of tedium punctuated by people getting angry at you. It's crucial to remember that generally those people are angry because they care about and are invested in the project and the work they have done. So bear that in mind, react appropriately, and if it ever starts to get to you go do something more fun. All the best, and happy editing! --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 06:41, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Congratulations on your adminship! You know, when I first noticed you on IFD back in ... April? last year I was thinking about nominating you for adminship but it was too early at the time.

<p>"<i>Hello!</i></p>
<p>Your welcome to use any pictures I upload,if you can leave the watermark intact as there from the department of national defence were I have permission to re use.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your hard work. Unfortunately, his statement isn't sufficient, for two reasons. (1) He is given permission to reuse these images, but that doesn't necessarilly imply permission to sublicense them. In other words, if I lend you a hammer, I'm not necessarilly authorizing you to lend it out to your next door neighbor. So he would need to clarify that he has the right to sublicense the image. (2) Wikipedia's policy doesn't allow images where derivative works are prohibited. In other words, the restriction about removing the watermark wouldn't work because someone can just create a derivative work of it that doesn't include the watermark. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:25, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look at what he is doing with his fingers. It looks like that he is making the Devil's horns with them. Anyway the guy that uploaded them was just making a joke, and there is no longer any use for the image, as something like that is of course inappropriate on the article, where the fair use license can apply. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 21:33, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok ... I see what you're talking about ... someone with arthritis may have trouble bending their finger down so I didn't think anything of it.

<dd>Thank you for your message. There are three things that need to be tagged - the image itself (using {{<a href="../../../i/f/d/Template%7EIfd_53ca.html" title="Template:Ifd">ifd</a>}}), the uploaders' talk page (using {{<a href="../../../i/d/w/Template%7EIdw_52a0.html" title="Template:Idw">idw</a>}}), and the article where the image is used (using {{<a href="../../../i/f/d/Template%7EIfdc_0b4f.html" title="Template:Ifdc">ifdc</a>}}). (Alternatively, if leaving ifdc on the article is impractical because it is an icon or something, a suitable message could be left on a talk page.) As far as I could tell, the uploader was not warned and the article where the image is used was not marked. I took a look and it looks like every episode has a thumbnail ... so I would strongly suggest leaving this one in there until it can be replaced, at which time you could simply tag it with {{<a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">subst</a><tt>:</tt><a href="../../../o/r/f/Template%7EOrfud_2019.html" title="Template:Orfud">orfud</a>}}. Alternatively, if you would like to re-nominate it for deletion today, making sure to notify the uploader and tag the image where it is used in an article, that's fine too.
