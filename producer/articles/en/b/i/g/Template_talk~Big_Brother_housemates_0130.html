<p>From HCI 2e: <i>Alignment of lists is also very important. For users who read text from left to right, lists of text items should normally be aligned to the left. Numbers, however, should normally be aligned to the right (for integers) or at the decimal point. This is because the shape of the column then gives an indication of magnitude -- a sort of mini-histogram. Items like names are particularly difficult. Consider list (i) in Figure 3.21. It is clearly hard to look up someone if you only know their surname. To make it easy, such lists should be laid out in columns as in (ii), or have forename and surname reversed as in (iii). The dates in Figure 3.20 pose similar problems, as the years do not align, even when the folder is sorted by date.</i> So unless anyone has a good reason to centre-align the text, it should remain left-aligned. -- <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="green">9</font></a><a href="../../../9/c/d/User%7E9cds.html" title="User:9cds"><font color="blue">cds</font></a><sup><a href="../../../9/c/d/User_talk%7E9cds.html" title="User talk:9cds"><font color="blue">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:39, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good god. You are all arguing over 3 words in a template which affects 12 or so articles concerning a reality television show that in all liklihood won't exist in 2 years. Besides this I had stopped editing, but seeing you all bicker over something so mundane irritated me so much that I did something about it. Since the main problem seems to be that each show has a different way of running things, I introduce "legendevic" and "legendnom", two spanking new variables for your use. I bet you can guess what they do. --<b><a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeStranger_9931.html" title="User:SomeStranger"><font color="orange">SomeStrang</font></a><i><a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeStranger_Esperanza_826f.html" title="User:SomeStranger/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a></i><a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeStranger_9931.html" title="User:SomeStranger"><font color="orange">r</font></a></b><sup>(<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeStranger_f8cb.html" title="User talk:SomeStranger"><font color="green">t</font></a>)</sup> 17:26, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Add the colours. Or better yet, take one of my many other suggestions, one of them being having separate templates for different countries. Failing that, yeah, add the colours. Nobody's going to suffer from it. You can't say it only lists the housemates, because you removed the tables from most of the pages, that showed how the housemates left. If there isn't going to be anything else, the infobox should have the extra colour added, and they should be left there after the series ends. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 00:57, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That way, editors can experiment all they want without affecting all the Big Brother articles across Wikipedia, and without having editors create separate instances every time.

<dd>I noticed the same thing. It's not right. The US ones do not need a power of veto indicator. It is not that important. This is quite confusing. Can we revert back to how it was before. If we're going to do things like this, then a template sandbox should be in effect immediately. Why are people doing this? It ruins the infobox and many articles. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoking66_2d58.html" title="User:Geoking66">Geoking66</a> 16:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

And as for what's important, my understanding was that the whole point to the colors was to provide a way for readers to ascertain the current status of the houseguests at a glance. For the US series, I would think that includes indications of Head of Household and Power of Veto. Otherwise, I don't see why colors and the like should even be bothered with at all, as one might as well just scroll to the Game Table section. Just indicating nominations and evictions doesn't do it for me. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 17:12, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not really. Too many colors can get confusing. And like I had mentioned before, a fourth color wouldn't actually work for Power of Veto. What I would like is some decent communication amongst the editors here, instead of this act/react situation that seems to be the default. Hopefully this can be a start.

<dd>JD, not to be mean, but you can't just change the infobox on your own accord, it affects too many articles. I think it's better covering their names; more concise, more to the point. With the US infobox, I was putting the "stat" back into it's original form: hm1stat, not hm1-stat. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoking66_2d58.html" title="User:Geoking66">Geoking66</a> 20:00, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, I totally understand. I only did a small bit of the work on the new design, but I can try and put the hm-stat thing back to hmstat, if it's easier; or you could do it, if you know how. I put the colouring in a fourth column because the alternating colours was really making the table difficult for some people to read, especially with the current <a href="../../../b/b/7/BB7_UK_e555.html" title="BB7 UK">BB7 UK</a> Nominations, and <a href="../../../b/b/7/BB7_07cf.html" title="BB7">BB7</a> and <a href="../../../b/b/0/BB06_2ba7.html" title="BB06">BB06</a> Evictions all packed up in a group of alternating red, and random grey in the middle that could easily be mistaken for blue or red at times. It was also an opportunity to make the fourth column that the US article could use; the Power of Veto could be put in the fourth column now, can it not? (Seriously, I'm asking there, as I don't know). I was being bold by making a change that I felt benefitted all of the Big Brother articles, and I was prepared to tidy up any mess that I created along the way, which I have. As it stands now, some people like it, while others don't. That probably leaves two options; I had a third one, but I can't remember it now: fork the template now, and use separate templates for each article, or each country; or have a vote here to decide whether the template should be used on all Big Brother articles. I don't take offence at all to the fact that some people don't like the new design, but as there are some people that do like it, I think a well-informed decision should be made, either in the best interests of separate countries' Big Brother articles; or all Big Brother articles in general. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 20:12, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Isn't WP:BIGBRO supposed to be about making all articles uniform? Yes, the US version is different, but if the point is standarisation, then we have to use creative techniques and keep the same template. It's not fair to change the infobox without talking about it first. It's much easier to read the table with the colours covering the names. It's hard to even see the nominated blue colour. So let's revert it back to it's scheme before. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoking66_2d58.html" title="User:Geoking66">Geoking66</a> 23:05, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's standardisation, then there's this WikiProject. While it has good ideas, I think it's a long way from standardisation - if standardisation is what this project wants, then it should be re-worked, from scratch, with everybody's input. If this infobox is causing a dispute, it's a start, in my opinion. But not everything can be standardised just like that. There are quite a few things that just cannot be standardised to be in line with other articles of the Big Brother series, but what can be standardised, should be worked on by <i>everybody</i>, or at least supermajority vote. That's how I see it, anyway. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 23:12, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>After looking at it for a few seconds you can tell, but not immediately, especially when only two people are nominated. But when a bunch of people are, it's easier to tell.

<p>I've added the stuff so the fourth column can be used for Power of Veto as well as status colours now. You need to use <code>| hmnn-veto = [[Image:No_sign.svg|16px]]</code> on a separate line inside the table syntax, for it to work, where nn is the number of the housemate. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 20:19, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If we're doing the whole consistency thing, then green wouldn't be suitable. What is actually wrong with blue? If we can't see the colour or whatever so badly, then the old template would solve this problem.

<p>9cds has pointed something out to me. With alternating colours, people that are affected by certain types of colour-blindness see the table as loads of alternating colours <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v738/9cds/colours2.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v738/9cds/colours2.png" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. There's one solution I can think of that doesn't involve removing the colours completely. Two colours that look different with a monochrome view, and the standard colours for the rows, could be used to show the status of housemates; but with the problem of alternating colours and the rows that was discussed before, the only way this can really be done without that problem is by having single solid colours in the fourth column, and having the rest of the rows alternating grey. I would change it straight away, but with the response I'd get, I'm posting it here first so others can say what they need to; or in case somebody else has a better solution. —<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 20:01, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The only colours that alternate are the ones used to show housemates that are "evicted". Either all colours should alternate, which would take a while to do; my earlier idea of having colours in their own column at the end (which some people didn't like because it used too much space even though the table occupies the same amount of space now as it did when that was used) should be used again; or somebody needs to think up a new idea for the infobox. <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a> 22:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I just checked; it's a browser issue. FireFox handles the borders correctly for empty cells, but Internet Explorer turns them white. I think this problem can be fixed by making the template display &amp;nbsp; for when a parameter is not specified, instead of nothing (e.g. replace {{{hm2-enter}}} with {{{hm2-enter|&amp;nbsp;}}} ). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tra/Sandbox&amp;oldid=103700085" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tra/Sandbox&amp;oldid=103700085" rel="nofollow">This version</a> shows what it would look like if the workaround was applied. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_ceae.html" title="User:Tra">Tra</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETra_MyComments_dbb9.html" title="User:Tra/MyComments">(Talk)</a> 22:50, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
