<h2><span class="mw-headline">Macintosh Garden</span></h2>
<p>I noticed you deleted <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macintosh_Garden_c4a9.html" title="Macintosh Garden">Macintosh Garden</a> earlier this month. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Macintosh_Garden_3809.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Macintosh Garden">Afd discussion</a> occurred in 2005 and as you commented in the deletion log, the merge apparently never happened. Per <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, I am asking that you put the article back up and instead re-nominate it for deletion. This way a full and current discussion of the article as it presently appears can occur. --204.42.24.228 23:01, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see why that's a useful course of action. It was listed for Speedy Deletion as a db-web case, and the fact that it had previously been AfD'd confirmed that suspicion. The fact that it hadn't been merged simply demonstrates laziness on the part of those involved at the time. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:07, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Is it policy or in the guidelines to delete Afd articles that reached a consensus of merge but have not been merged after a period of time? It seems to me the (very weak) consensus was to delete after a merge. Since the merge did not occur, it does not seem proper to me to delete. The result of the Afd also seems dated. Things change. That is why I would propose an Afd in the present as a solution. Btw, what does db-web case mean? Also, could you point me to the Speedy Deletion listing? I can't seem to find it. --204.42.24.228 23:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Consensus was that the article should be merged and redirected etc. This didn't happen in more than 2 years, so whoever was meant to have done that was asleep at the wheel, thus suggesting that nobody cared enough about the article to do anything. The article was then - two years later - listed as <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">a speedy deletion case</a> with the "db-web" tag added to it. I agreed with that tagging and thus deleted the article. The fact that something should have happened to it years before is somewhat beside the point. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, it would be nice to have a real discussion about the article at the time it is deleted rather than two years earlier and with only two participants. The <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">Criteria for speedy deletion</a> policy also say at A7: "If ... there has been a previous AfD, the article should be nominated for AfD instead." I hope you will please reconsider your position and put back up the article so a proper AfD can take place. --204.42.24.228 00:19, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Contextual Postscript:</b> I was in the process of reviewing my actions when two different IPs (not this one with whom I have been in conversation) took it upon themselves to vandalise both my userpage and my Talk page. While I'm more than prepared to assume good faith on the part of the individual with whom I have had this conversation, the actions of others suggest that re-creating the article and listing it at AfD will only result in more disruption after a potentially time-consuming process. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 08:52, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey! A fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for NASA from the short article on me (<a href="../../../r/a/n/Randall_Munroe_92cd.html" title="Randall Munroe">Randall Munroe</a>), labeling it "patently made-up information". Understandable and taken in good humor, of course, and nothing on the page is sourced (it's more of a stub than anything). But I'm curious why you were so sure it was fabricated. &#160;:) --<a href="../../../x/k/c/User%7EXkcd_7823.html" title="User:Xkcd">Xkcd</a> 02:45, 19 March 2007 (UTC)xkcd</p>

<dd>I find it hard to believe that a 22-year-old could have been working full-time for NASA. Of course, you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that NASA would have been all over, but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I interned there during college and started working for them a bit before I graduated. I stayed for the better part of a year until late 2006. NASA is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects. It's not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, the information is taken from my published bio page<a href="http://xkcd.com/about/" class="external autonumber" title="http://xkcd.com/about/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, but you're right -- you have no way of knowing whether I'm lying or not. I guess it's probably safest to assume that I am.
<dl>
<dd>In that case, I'll admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place (I know very little about science, but anyone who got to work for NASA has <i>got</i> to be a smart cookie in that kind of area). Feel free to re-add the info, although the impression I got from the original version was more than you weren't just a contract worker. If that's not even a valid distinction in the States - it's increasingly less of one here in Oz - then my apologies there in advance. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly, they never really explained to me which one I was. I went to work every day in a building at NASA where I worked on NASA robots, and NASA paid me (through a government contractor). When I said "I work for NASA" no one argued.</dd>

<dd>It was a lot more Dilbert-esque than you would expect. Old, echoing tile hallways with quiet, gruff middle-aged men working at blueprint-covered desks, mild office politics, lots of presentations and buzzwords, and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way. I thought it sounded like the perfect place to work, and it was good in a lot of ways, but I was happy to leave. --<a href="../../../x/k/c/User%7EXkcd_7823.html" title="User:Xkcd">Xkcd</a> 14:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)xkcd</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Sure thing. The way it works is that your nomination which you made is called the "hook". That gets put onto the Suggestions page, which I'll move it to in a moment. Over the next few days, people will make various comments about it - if the "hook" is too long, if it needs sources, whatever else. If you're able to respond to those comments (if there are any made), then your article might get selected. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not easy to do that, since the suggestions are cleared from the page after they get onto the front page, so I really can't just point you to a page and say "here you are".

<dd>You don't have to. I'm just reflecting the general academic consensus, which you're welcome to doubt as much as you want. It's just that when comments are made on AfDs at considerable variance with that consensus, particularly in a rather contentious AfD, I get curious. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:05, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid you appear to be very misinformed. Academics such as <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Phillipe_Rushton_f9b1.html" title="J. Phillipe Rushton">J. Phillipe Rushton</a> define caucasoid race as <b>"A major racial division of mankind originally inhabiting Europe, North Africa, western Asia, and India. Hair in males is generally well developed on the face and body, and is mostly fine and wavy or straight. A narrow face, prominent narrow nose, and narrow lips are typical."</b> The <b>Caucasian race</b> (sometimes called the <b>Caucasoid race</b>) is defined by the <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> as, "relating to a broad division of humankind covering peoples from <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southwest_Asia_309e.html" title="Southwest Asia">western Asia</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Asia_cf77.html" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Africa_6a9e.html" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>" <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Note that caucasian/caucasoid is a racial group, not a linguistic one. It is thus defined by biogeographic ancestry, genetics, and physical traits, not language.

<dd>Not <i>everyone</i> from those locations is going to be Semitic, Caucasoid, Negroid or whatever we want to talk about. For example, if one wants to say that "Caucasoid" is another term for "Indo-European", which is a good enough definition, then we find that the Persians and their relatives are Caucasoid (and they live in the Middle East and South Asia). The Arabs, on the other hand, are not, and yet they live in the same place.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bio article in my sandbox</span></h2>
<p>It's not so much "socially responsible investing" that Marc has pioneered as SRI has been around for well over a hundred years. Rather, within the movement, he is the person who was really the first to empirically prove that SRI could be done in a way that provided investors with the ability to achieve competitive or better market returns vs. traditional asset management. Historically (as mentioned in my draft), SRI management has been marginalized due to the fact that it has lagged in performance compared to traditional money management approaches. This made SRI something which tended to appeal only to those who wanted to somehow salve their conscience, and were willing to take a hit financially at the same time. The Advocacy Investing approach, and why it was and is so notable within the movement, and why it got so much attention, was because it provided scientific research from an 8-year study showing how SRI can be done both "responsibly" AND profitably, which isn't such a small task. This has opened the doors to huge institutional investors (as well as individuals) who couldn't consider SRI approaches before because it's performance lag violated certain "prudent investor" and suitability guidelines. In addition to these things, the book laying out the research and argument came at the forefront of many articles which came out and are continuing to come out re: the fact that SRI and CSR issues are, indeed, quantifiable and can be profitiable, often more profitable, than the way corporations have been managed in the past. On a global scale, this is truly revelatory because the implications are that of a whole new way of running business enterprises like we have never seen before, at least not on the scale where it is the "prefered" method of management within the capital markets.</p>

<p>Hi BigHaz, artvaldez here. Greetings! I believe you deleted the image for the right reason. I am totally disoriented on the tag issue as I am a beginner contributor. I need your assistance in having the right tag on the emailed photo certificate sent by Mr. Abenojar through his email address that was published online by Monterosa Treks &amp; Expeditions, Nepal. I am contributing factual entries to his article with the help of the Philippine tri-media and other reliable sources about his pioneering adventures and other related bio-data. He says the image he sent to various tri-media in the Philippines (that all published his certificate) and to me is free to anyone to publicly publish it, research on it, cross-examine or use it for educational purposes and more especially for Wikipedia to post it as a reference to his article. You may reply to me on my talk page. Many thanks in advance.--Artvaldez 17:25, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Oriya Surnames</span></h2>
<p>Hey! Friend I guess we need a list of surnames of Oriya people. With the Oriya diaspora slowly growing across the world there will be an interest in tracing surnames. Cheers <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavitr_2380.html" title="User:Savitr">Savitr</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavitr_0520.html" title="User talk:Savitr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Savitr_702b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Savitr">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>I can see your point, however I'd argue the opposite. Firstly, a large number of lists of surnames from various languages (Spanish, Maltese, Russian etc) were recently transwiki'd to Wiktionary based on the argument that lists of surnames are not in themselves encyclopedic. As I see it, a list of surnames specific to a particular caste (or whatever the right term is, I'm not well-up on Indian culture these days) is a specific case of a list of surnames.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, even if the surnames are in fact encyclopedic, I don't see why we need them as a separate article. What makes a bare list of Oriya surnames need to be separated from an article on the Oriyas themselves? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:18, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey! BigHaz</p>
<p>I have taken your point onboard. Indian surnames are unique in-a-way since they also signify sub-ethnic group, each with their own history. I do see your point though- so maybe I would create a link to several 'oriya surnames' within the main oriya page.</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions.

<dd>I'd be tempted to go slightly further than that. List the names on the main Oriya page and give some details on what each one means etc on that page. If one name (or a couple of names) end up with too much information to be held on that page, then "spin the article off" into a separate one.
