<p>Hi Jim, thanks for your comments re: the communist articles i've been writing. I got my information from using google and the web pages of the parties themselves. I've done all of the communist/non social democrat socialist parties in the European parliament (<a href="../../../e/u/r/European_United_Left_-_Nordic_Green_Left_1fd8.html" title="European United Left - Nordic Green Left">European United Left - Nordic Green Left</a>) and am working on the List of communist parties and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comintern.html" title="Comintern">Comintern</a> article. I don't know if you want to collaborate on this - there's lots of stuff that needs doing. The <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_British_Socialism_dbf3.html" title="History of British Socialism">History of British Socialism</a> article has nothing on Scotland on it. Tommy Sheridan doesn't have an article etc. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 11:51, Nov 6, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not actually from the area, I just had a happy holiday in Glasgow last year, visited some of these places, and thought I'd fill in a couple of articles on it.

<p>Hallo; I was thinking, perhaps you'd like to take a look at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_requested_for_over_a_year_47e4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles requested for over a year">'articles requested for over a year'</a> page: there's a request there for an article about Scottish freedom movements that you might like to look into, but then again maybe not. I read your (übercool) name and the sort of articles you wrote in the recent changes list, and I thought you just might be interested. I had some trouble finding the page, and I'm not sure my link works: It may be found visiting Community Portal, following the link Create (in the Things you can do-box), and then Articles requested for over a year-link. <a href="../../../s/i/e/User%7ESietse_0e91.html" title="User:Sietse">Sietse</a> 12:42, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi - regarding your question about the <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hunter_6293.html" title="Edward Hunter">Edward Hunter</a> article. The article is certainly interesting, but I'm afraid I can't think of anywhere to put a link to it. There's almost nothing in Wikipedia about socialism in New Zealand, except for something I wrote about the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_New_Zealand_cec7.html" title="Communist Party of New Zealand">Communist Party of New Zealand</a> (which I don't think he had much to do with). Eventually, I hope to write something about the history of New Zealand socialism (it's highly confusing at present - so much splintering it's hard to keep track of the various factions). If/when that happens, Hunter will surely get a mention, but until then, I can't really think of anywhere to refer to him. Sorry about that - there are still a lot of gaps in the New Zealand politics pages. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 04:41, 21 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, you may already have seen it, but did you see the article about him in the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography? It's a government service, and is available online at www.dnzb.govt.nz - just select Find, click on H, and look for "Hunter, Edward". I don't think there's anything there you don't have already, but it might be worth a look if you haven't already seen it. I will, however, see if I can find some more information about him off-line - there are a few books I know of that he'd probably be mentioned in. I'm not sure how soon I'll be able to do that, but I'll get back to you when I've done it. - <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 13:21, 21 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Quick update - I haven't been able to get at the books yet, but I had a bit of free time, so I wrote something brief about <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism_in_New_Zealand_48cd.html" title="Socialism in New Zealand">Socialism in New Zealand</a>. I've mentioned Edward Hunter, and put a link to the new page in Hunter's article (hope you don't mind). The new article doesn't say very much about him yet, since I still need to collect my information. - <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 12:14, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I've had difficulty getting at the book I remembered. I'm not sure when I'll be able to track it down. I do know, however, that there's at least a chapter about him, so there should be plenty of information once I can get to it. But from what I can find, your article on him seems quite adequate. The book itself is called "On the Left: Essays on Socialism in New Zealand" - see <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1877276197/qid=1072502590/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_0_6/026-1845620-9024420" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1877276197/qid=1072502590/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_0_6/026-1845620-9024420" rel="nofollow">this Amazon.co.uk page</a> (hoping that the link works), or <a href="http://www.ialhi.org/news/i0212_2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ialhi.org/news/i0212_2.html" rel="nofollow">this IALHI page</a>.

<p>Could you tell me why a lot of the political party articles you have edited bear a striking resemblance to the entries in my book "Politico's Guide to the History of British Political Parties" (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1902301595</a>)? For example, your entry for the Campaign for Social Democracy says that Dick Taverne "formed the Campaign for Social Democracy as an attempt to build a radical non-doctrinaire <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_democratic.html" title="Social democratic">social democratic</a> movement" when my book says "The CSD sought to build a radical non-doctrinaire social democratic movement". On the Democratic Party your entry says "They were formed in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> by various people who felt there was scope for a party that placed <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> as its paramount political value. It asserts that its members come from across the political spectrum." My book says "The Democratic Party was formed in 1998 by several people who believed there was a role for a party placing democracy as its paramount belief. The party asserts that its members come from across the political spectrum."</p>
<p>I could produce stacks of other examples. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">Dbiv</a> 23:12, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hullo Big Jim. Saw your article on new Strathkelvin Party (name escapes me already).

<dd>Hi there Mattley. Got your comments about the article. Would love to add what you request, but that seems a bit unclear just now. They have only just announced their formation, so that might become clearer soon - so until then I cannot really add anything about what they want to contest.</dd>

That's how I know stuff about Shinwell and Glasgow. Planning on adding an article on Glasgow Harbour and docks development soon as well.

<p>I see you moved RESPECT into a section for parties represented in the UK Parliament. This is a moot point - Galloway does not describe himself as representing RESPECT in Parliament (instead using "Independent Labour" and has not stood for the party in any Parliamentary election. It is true that RESPECT - or at least the SWP - describe Galloway as their MP, but in most lists, such as our list of MPs elected in the 2001 election, he is under Independent Labour. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarofdreams_9458.html" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> 14:11, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Parliamentry" is properly spelled with the lowercase because its acting as an adjective modifying the noun "election" (just as "Scottish" is). If the title was Scottish Parliament election, XXXX, then "Parliament" would be properly capitalised because it's part of a proper noun.

<dd>Big Jim Fae, in this instance I think Neutrality got it wrong, in that the "p" should be capitalised as they are by-elections for the Scottish Parliament, as distinct from by-elections for the Westminster Parliament that happen to be for Scottish constituencies. If the article were about the latter, it would be more appropriate for the "p" not to be capitalised. But it's not, so the "p" should be capitalised.

<p>== Creating Articles == Good work creating new articles. When you create things, it helps tremendously to assign them to an accurate category (see <a href="../../../c/g/_/WP%7ECG_8b50.html" title="WP:CG">WP:CG</a> for info). If you're <i>really</i> not sure about categories, at least assign your new articles a stub category (see <a href="../../../s/c/_/WP%7ESC_5cc9.html" title="WP:SC">WP:SC</a> for info). By assigning a category, you help make sure your new articles don't get lost as 'orphans' that are not associated with related topics. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a> 19:46, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is an outside chance that you may not be able to help with this, which would be unfortunate (however, I can certainly see what I'm able to do otherwise), but how do you think separate sections for different countries' football (soccer) seasons would go down? I'm particularly thinking English soccer, but the American soccer leagues may be just as useful. So, where we have separate links for <b><a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_football_seasons.html" title="Scottish football seasons">Scottish football seasons</a></b>, do the same for <b><a href="../../../e/n/g/English_football_seasons.html" title="English football seasons">English football seasons</a></b> (down to the Division One table of season 1888/89) and <b>American football (soccer) seasons</b> (that one needs a snappier title, but).

<p>How on earth did you find that registration page for SJP? I had done a search of their website, and have just done it again, and absolutely no combination of search terms of their Registers brings up that page that you found. Of course I will withdraw AfD if they are registered, although I STILL suspect that they are a hoax... and a rather expensive one for the hoaxters it seems! Or, if as you say, they are our Monster Raving Looney Party then perhaps "joke" is a better word than "hoax". I certainly know that the guy that started all this on Politicalbetting.com has revealed himself to be very pro-monarchy, and yet the SJP professes to be republican.

<p>Jim, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind helping us out <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2007_March_6_5ed5.html#Jeanfield_Swifts_F.C." title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2007 March 6">here</a> when you get a chance. We're looking for explanation as to how far down the three or four tiers of Scottish junior football notability should stretch. I'm enquring with you because I saw you started the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Junior_Football_Association_800b.html" title="Scottish Junior Football Association">SJFA</a> article.

<dd>I thought Durie might be an odd choice in some people's eyes! I try to keep my XI selections to players I've seen during my lifetime, rather than the history-makers. There's probably a better choice than Jukebox, but he's all I could come up with at the time.</dd>

<dd>As for the junior club articles, I was happy to say goodbye to all the red links (in the Eastern Region, at least). I'll add to them when I can.

<p>I noticed your recent edit to the Whiteinch article, and whilst I would agree that it was part of the burgh of Partick I'm sure there is a school in Whiteinch which proclaims itself as having been a part of the Govan school board or suchlike, not sure how that came about. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFraslet_47a7.html" title="User:Fraslet">Fraslet</a> 15:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
