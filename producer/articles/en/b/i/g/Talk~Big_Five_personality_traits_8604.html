<p><b>Citation needed</b>&#160;: <i>A person's ratings on the five factors has been found to change with time, with Agreeableness and Conscientiousness increasing, while Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness generally decrease as a person ages.</i></p>
<p>I don't think its Costa et al. - so who is it? <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECached_8cf8.html" title="User:Cached">Cached</a> 07:30, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I am removing the following section for two reasons:</p>
<p>"Some anthropologists and sociologists are critical of the method because it measures personality traits on a basis of its synonymous adjectives in the English language, thus overlooking possible cultural construction of language. That English alone was used in factor analysis also arguably demonstrates an example of ethnocentrism. Furthermore, sociologists are critical that the theory only reinforces stereotypes and ignores social factors that might have lead to traits being present in certain groups of individuals. For instance, while women have a demonstrated tendency towards agreeableness, this is likely true of most subordinated individuals. Tying this trait to women at a psychological level then only reasserts inequalities by implying that differences exist as a matter of human nature rather than as a result of the social construction of gender."</p>
<p><br />
1. The information given there is incorrect. I've checked the scientific research to be sure, and English alone was *not* used in factor analysis, and the existence and nature of the Big Five factors has been validated in multiple continents. Here's an excerpt from McCrae &amp; Hofstede's fascinating paper, Personality and Culture Revisited: Linking Traits and Dimensions of Culture (2004):</p>
<p><br />
"Research in the English-speaking world using the NEO-PI-R established that individual differences in the factors are stable throughout most of the adult life span; that self-reports generally agree with observer ratings; and that the five factors, as well as the more specific traits that define them, are strongly heritable. In the 1990s, researchers around the world began to develop translations 2 of the instrument, making cross-cultural research possible. A series of studies showed that much the same factor structure was found in a wide variety of cultures (McCrae &amp; Costa, 1997), that developmental trends in the mean levels of personality traits between adolescence and later adulthood appeared to be universal (McCrae et al., 1999), and that similar gender differences were found among cultures (Costa, Terracciano, &amp; McCrae, 2001)."</p>
<p><br />
Here are the relevant citations from the above; if you can find them, I suggest taking a look:</p>
<p>McCrae, R. R., &amp; Costa, P. T., Jr. (1997). Personality trait structure as a human universal. American Psychologist, 52, 509-516.</p>
<p>McCrae, R. R., Costa, P. T., Jr., Lima, M. P., Simões, A., Ostendorf, F., Angleitner, A., et al. (1999). Age differences in personality across the adult life span: Parallels in five cultures. Developmental Psychology, 35, 466-477.</p>
<p>Costa, P. T., Jr., Terracciano, A., &amp;McCrae, R. R. (2001). Gender differences in personality traits across cultures: Robust and surprising findings. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, 322-331.</p>
<p><br />
As a further note in this regard, one group of subordinated individuals - prisoners - show personality profiles with low Agreeableness scores. Teenagers also show lower Agreeableness than adults. So I don't think it's "likely true of most subordinated individuals" that they have high Agreeableness. In point of fact, it appears that Extroversion actually has more to do with social dominance than Agreeableness does. (And men score higher in the Assertiveness sub-scale of Extroversion, incidentally, as given in the last study cited above.)</p>
<p><br />
2. Beyond being incorrect, I don't like the above statement because it demonstrates bias. The fact that psychometric research "reinforces stereotypes" does not show that the research is bad or wrong; instead, it supports the truth to these stereotypes. Whether women are Agreeable because of genetic or environmental reasons is irrelevant to the question of whether Agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct. And of course while sociologists and anthropologists may be unhappy about these research results, that doesn't change the facts.</p>
<p>Hopefully this explanation is thorough enough to obviate the necessity of future arguments.</p>
<p><br />

<dd>Clearly the point is biased in some direction; it is, after all, called criticism. However, it is appreciatable to rework claims rather than remove them entirely, as for example my move to redirect back the bias of your word "discovered", implying a factual truth of the matter, back to the more neutral term identified, and my return of your loaded attempt of beginning the criticism section with "While the general consensus favoring a five-factor model is strong, there is still dissention."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And how was the Big Five originally constructed if not through factor analysis of personality traits from the English dictionary? That's what I had read. If later attempts were made to see if other cultures and languages "fit" the pattern, that is not enough to convince me. That all the studies you listed came from the original proponents of this model also suggests to me some degree of bias in their perspective.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My use of the term "subordinated individuals" was admittedly very loose. I meant individuals of any subordinated master status. For instance, any minority groups, including women, and lower class individuals. I would imagine the scores of these groups would prove quite similar, but by this theory's limitation of analytical claims to biological groups there is the suggestion that this is because of some biopsychological component, and not because of some common social characteristic present in minorities and the less privileged in general.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your remark that it does represent stereotypes, I will not say it doesn't. Women are in all societies subordinate to men. But there is also sociological research to show this is because of a need for women in huntering and gathering societies to nurse, which means having to stay near the children, which eventually leads to a divide in terms of labor by sex, with men working exterior to the home and women within, which further precipitates the notion of women as domestic and men as worldly, and so on and on. That women are generally subordinate to men is without question, but to say that this is because of some localized psychology in women is to suggest that women are by nature different, and then any attempt at change would therefore be fallible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That the critical addendum of the sciences of sociology and anthropology needs to be reworked is certain, but the attitude that outward criticism from other disciplines is somehow null is at the very least off-putting, and your remark that your explanation is "thorough enough to obviate the necessity of future arguments" seems to suggest a general dismay at the idea of said criticism. That you approach the subject as a psychologist is clear, but as other sciences also examine the structure of personality, disregarding the views of those sciences consitutes a clear POV. When I get a chance, I will post another criticism section, and if you would like you can revise it, and we can attempt to reach some consensus through mututal cooperation rather than through the throrough deletion of large chunks of text that you are at odds with. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 23:59, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
&gt; However, it is appreciatable to rework claims rather than remove them entirely,</p>
<p>I agree, and this is what I did to the section on traits "beyond" the FFM. Unfortunately, the entirety of the text I deleted was simply unusable, for the reasons detailed above.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; as for example my move to redirect back the bias of your &gt; word "discovered", implying a factual truth of the matter, &gt; back to the more neutral term identified, and my return of &gt; your loaded attempt of beginning the criticism section with &gt; "While the general consensus favoring a five-factor model &gt; is strong, there is still dissention."</p>
<p>I didn't notice these changes, and I suppose I can agree with both.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; If later attempts were made to see if other cultures and languages "fit" the pattern, that is not enough to convince me.</p>
<p>Factor analysis in other languages found the same five constructs. (There were a few exceptions, of course; I recall that Openness didn't have the same character in a German sample, where it seemed more related to general "rebeliousness.") I'm sorry if this isn't enough to convince you, but studies were carried out specifically with the intention of seeing whether the Big Five traits existed as fundamental psychometric constructs or were merely an artifact of Western language and culture.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; For instance, any minority groups, including women, and lower class individuals. I would imagine the scores of these groups would prove quite similar</p>
<p>An interesting idea, to be sure! But there is simply no support for it; that doesn't make it false, but it renders it meaningless as an argument, because subordinate status could just as easily *depress* Agreeableness - in fact there is some evidence which is in line with this view; again, Agreeableness increases with age, and so does social and economic status.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; That women are generally subordinate to men is without question, but to say that this is because of some localized psychology in women is to suggest that women are by nature different, and then any attempt at change would therefore be fallible.</p>
<p>I don't think that Agreeableness has much to do with subordinate status; this is likely to have more to do with things like Extroversion, and with psychometric g (which lies outside the personality domain).</p>
<p><br />
&gt; That the critical addendum of the sciences of sociology and anthropology needs to be reworked is certain, but the attitude that outward criticism from other disciplines is somehow null is at the very least off-putting, and your remark that your explanation is "thorough enough to obviate the necessity of future arguments" seems to suggest a general dismay at the idea of said criticism.</p>
<p>This appears to be the central issue, so once more I'll try to be thorough in stating my position. Criticism from other disciplines is really of very limited importance in an encyclopedic article. After all, if we are to consult sociologists and anthropologists on psychometric matters, what about economists or biologists? What about politicians, philosophers, or theologians? These are not facetious questions - for instance, knowing that personality exists, and that it is to some degree heritable, and that it has important outcomes in religious behavior, raises interesting theological questions. We have been discussing Agreeableness, and it seems that those who are more Agreeable tend to be more religious, to be less prone to marital infidelity, and to have a more generous nature. Does God judge on a curve? And if not, is it religiously acceptible that virtue and sinfulness could be genetic, or should pious individuals of fundamentalist sects reject the findings of psychometrics as readily as they might the findings of physical anthropology? These are questions which personally interest me to a great degree, and perhaps they deserve to be discussed in a full length book dealing with these topics, but I really don't think they have a place in a brief encyclopedic article. The objectively relevant view here is the psychometric one.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; I will post another criticism section, and if you would like you can revise it, and we can attempt to reach some consensus through mututal cooperation rather than through the throrough deletion of large chunks of text that you are at odds with.</p>
<p>The trouble with this is that the FFM is approaching the level of "settled science." Criticisms of it are generally outdated and have been dealt with by research from dozens of psychologists. The most robust criticisms generally involve firstly the fact that the five factors aren't all-encompassing, though it isn't claimed that they are, merely that they exist, secondly that the five factors are not fully independent of one another but exhibit correlations amongst themselves (N &amp; E are notorious here with correlations approaching -.50), though this also doesn't dispell their existence, and thirdly that self report bias remains difficult to deal with. The latter criticism seems more important to me personally than the others, because it calls the utility of the measure into question and leads to speculations about a possible "Flynn Effect" (spurious increase in scores over the generations). But even here, the various instruments testing the FFM have shown good validity and reliability, so the criticism is merely a quibble over the accuracy of the instruments used.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while some of Costa &amp; McCrae's statements may be debatable (McCrae's interpretation of these traits as purely biological predispositions is indeed ludicrous) and while the instruments may be imperfect, it's extremely difficult to provide a meaningful and scientifically accurate criticism of the Big Five itself.</p>

Please, could anyone mention the name of O.P. John in this article. He IS a real father of Five-Factor Theory. However you can also correct the comment about the same factoring in other languages. There are different numbers of secondary level factors in different languages. (4 to 7(I think in japanese)) Im not too strong in English to write there, so please...</p>
<p>Martin Pírko, Czech Rep., 16 July 2005</p>
<p><br />
Two comments. First, awful beginning. The reader has to wade through a bunch of stilted history before getting to the actual five factors. Few people looking for a Wikipedia entry will care about the history: please put the five factors earlier in the article and make the "origins" stuff later. Second, the five factors are often presented as contrast classes (e.g., extroversion/introversion, etc): why not include this (even if you have to include a caveat that introversion is just a negative value of the extroversion dimension this should still be included). Such breadth would be more helpful than the origins and its talk of new-fangled computing machines.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I removed "even a bit eccentric" as a discription of how introverts might be perceived for two reasons. One - eccentricity, to my mind at least, doesn't imply invtroversion, albeit introversion in the extreem does imply eccentricity. Two - the sentence was discribing negative perceptions of introverts, eccentricity isn't universally regarded as a bad thing. I recgonise that there may have been an element of irony in the phrasing, but it annoyed me anyway. --86.11.167.138 21:20, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>OK, I tried to address most of the concerns I saw here (although I've never heard of O.P. John and am really not very interested in or knowledgable about the origins of the Big Five).</p>
<p>I've reinstated and expanded the description of the five factors which originally stood at the start of the article, and tried to at least imply the contrasting nature of high and low scores on these scales (which I think is better than inventing a series of terms for the low poles of these dimensions which often don't exist in the literature).</p>
<p>I also cleaned up the main descriptions by quoting directly from an article by Dr. Johnson; whoever wrote the text I overwrote ought to find some sources for the various claims made there, many of which were misleading (E.Q. is positively predicted by high scores on E, A, C, O, and low scores on N, not just high scores in E and A) and others which I've never seen before (are Low-C's really better at multitasking? Where is the research for this?).</p>
<p>Finally, I fixed some unencyclopedic language in the future of the FFM section and tried to give it a better wrap-up. Hopefully others will find these changes to be acceptible. Harkenbane 20:18, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am concerned with the Psychometrics link "A layman's overview of the field of psychometrics." and its promotion of the eugenics arguments on the pages of the website linked to from that page.

<p>You seem to know more about it than I do&#160;:-) I brought it up because most places I've seen the Big Five mentioned online, SLOAN is way invididual personalities are represented.

<p>You say, some people say this model neglects Conservativeness... But isn't that what Openness to experience is about? I can't tell the difference. Note, this is a question regarding a specification of what you mean. Not whether or not what you mean is correct. _____________</p>
<p>Psychometric Openness is only peripherally about liberalism versus conservatism; the subscales of factor O which *best* correlate with Openness itself appear to be Openness to Fantasy, Openness to Ideas, and Openness to Aesthetics; the three other scales - Actions, Feelings, and Values - appear to be less central to Psychometric Openness. You can read about this in _The Big-Five Trait Taxonomy: History, Measurement, and Theoretical Perspectives_ by Oliver P. John and Sanjay Srivastava; I highly recommend reading through that file if you're interested in understanding the Big-Five:</p>
<p><a href="http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~sanjay/pubs/bigfive.pdf" class="external free" title="http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~sanjay/pubs/bigfive.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~sanjay/pubs/bigfive.pdf</a></p>
<p>In other words, Openness is "really" about imagination, intellectance, and aesthetics; liberalism is not a central characteristic to factor O (even though it is still related to factor O).</p>
<p>That being stated, I think it's silly to talk about the Big Five failing to describe a person's tendency towards certain political orientations - I only left that part in the text in the interests of politeness and collaboration. Conservatism and liberalism may not correlate perfectly with psychometric Openness, but that's largely because those are value systems rather than personality traits, not because the Big-Five is missing anything.

<p>From the article: <i>Moreover, the methodology used to investigate these phenomena (factor analysis) does not have a well-supported, universally-recognized scientific or statistical basis for choosing among solutions with different numbers of factors.</i></p>
<p>The concept of explained variability can be brought into play here. What you find is that the first factor acounts for 70% of variability the second for 20%, and so on following a <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zipfs_law.html" title="Zipfs law">Zipfs law</a> type of distribution (numbers not exact). This is a common patten amongst all multi factor models especially the related <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principal_components_analysis.html" title="Principal components analysis">Principal components analysis</a>. So with five factors you maybe explain about 95% of variability. Adding extra factors does not significantly add to explained variability. From the Gordon Allport and H. S. Odbert quote:</p>

<dd><i>Those individual differences that are most salient and socially relevant in people’s lives will eventually become encoded into their language; the more important such a difference, the more likely is it to become expressed as a single word.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>we can see that the five factors account for the most <i>salient and socially relevant</i> factors. The other factors, whilst important, are not as <i>salient and socially relevant</i>.</p>
<p>A pet theory of mine is to do with the fact that we can only hold 5-7 items in short term memory at one time. You find that virtually all of the various psycological models have less than 5 items. This maybe more to do with the our (the observers) ability to hold concepts in our heads than the mathematics. So five factors is a nice comprimise between mathematical explainability and being able to recall and comunicate this information. --<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfafrich_c43f.html" title="User:Pfafrich">Pfafrich</a> 10:59, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You're quite correct that if the solution accounts for 95% of the variability, then it would be silly to extract more factors. Do you know of any published work that accounts for 95% of the variance in <b>R</b>? Because my recollection is that 50% is more like what these studies will achieve in their final solutions (although this is rarely published).</p>
<p>The problem that I was addressing is that there are many criteria for how many factors to extract from a factor analysis. The most common (in my experience) is to retain all eigenvalues greater than 1. I think parallal analysis or examination of a scree plot are far superior to this. Specifically, the problem is that two competent factor analysts, using different rules, can extract very different solutions, particularly after adding in rotations.</p>
<p>Your pet theory is interesting but is't it 5-9 (7 plus-or-minus 2)? I think there really are five broad factors that, in turn, have more specific traits underlying (just like the facet scales of the NEO). And having helped 16PF users, I do absolutely agree that our cognitive limits shape our preference for simpler models. The 16PF is too complex for a lot of people, certainly the NEO's 30 facets are far too complex to be comprehended as a whole.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmead_f367.html" title="User:Amead">Amead</a></p>
<p>No backing for the numbers, probably wildly inacurate. I have done some post doctoral work using PCA recording shape variability, there I did find a very fast drop off in the contribution of factors, and also a long tail. I suspect this is common pattern.</p>
<p>For 16PF I'd guess there is quite a lot of corelations between the factors (the word abstract apears twice), so not really orthogonal. It would be really nice to get hold of some real data.</p>
<p>I note neither Parallel analysis or Scree plot have articles. I've not come across them before.</p>
<p>This is all rasing lots of questions. Quite what is the explained variability being measured? Is it variability in types of personality acording to some arbitary set of axis or is it more a textural analysis of the words we use to describe ourselves, which I think is closer to the original analysis? Theres all sort of issues with scaling of factors as well.</p>
<p>Time to head for the original papers! --<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfafrich_c43f.html" title="User:Pfafrich">Pfafrich</a> 21:43, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

I agree that the number of factors to break personality down into is somewhat arbitrary, and in fact there are a variety of solutions which seem useful. While the psychoticism scale of Eysenck's three factor (P-E-N model) proved internally inconsistent, recent research has found that a two-factor solution works well, where the two factors are dubbed alpha (A, C, and the inverse of N) and beta (E and O). But there's a large amount of personality variation within any given level of alpha or beta, so the Big Five are a bit more accurate. Although it would probably be useful to break personality into more factors than 5, the 16 factors discovered by Catell weren't replicable, which is the main reason they were abandoned. Possibly the lexical hypothesis itself would have to be abandoned before future research could refine our understanding of personality - human language is useful, but far from perfect. It's imaginable that there is some variation in personality which we are instinctively unable to notice or even made not to notice, and any variation of this sort would be totaly invisible to language and even self report. Until we know more, however, it appears that the Big Five is the best we have. Harkenbane 07:38, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Harkenbane: You should learn more about the 16PF. The 16PF is far from abandoned and it's actually a two-tiered system with a broad five-factor solution indicated by the 15 underlying personality factors (the so-called 16TH factor, B, is actually some sort of general intelligence factor, not a personality factor). I believe Goldberg credits Cattell as the first to find five broad factors but Cattell never thought they would be useful for anything which is why he pursued the 16-factor solution. And, in fact, Goldberg has an as-yet unpublished chapter (cited in the recent Buchanan, Johnson &amp; Goldberg paper) in which he compares the cross-validated criterion correlations of a number of instruments... He concludes that the 16PF model predicts best (although his IPIP version of the 16PF outperformed the actual 16PF) beating the NEO at both the five- or 30-factor level, etc.</p>
<p>Actually, this idea of having a broad five-factor level and a "facet" level is the norm, rather than the exception, even for so-called five-factor instruments like the NEO. Off the top of my head, NEO, 16PF, Hogan HPI, MBTI Step II all have this two-tiered (i.e., second-order factor anlaysis) structure. What is also true, however, is that each of these instruments has a different represnetation of the "facet" level; the NEO has 30 facets, the 16PF has 15+1, .. I don't recall the Step II structure bug Hogan forms what he calles HIC's and he has dozens. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmead_f367.html" title="User:Amead">Amead</a> 03:20, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you a very simple question: Are the 16 factors replicable, or aren't they? My understanding was that modern research simply couldn't replicate all 16 factors. I suspect that this is a problem with the tools used - self report is probably too clumsy to render this level of detail - but this is an untested opinion; to date, the "Little 15" haven't proven to be as robust as the Big 5. Of course, I will concede that neither the 16PF model, nor PEN model, nor several other models are completely phased out, but that really doesn't mean much when taking into account the fact that even Freud's and Jung's ideas are still bandied about in college classes as though they're meaningful. Most modern research into differential psychology uses the Big Five (although the sixth factor, g, is often avoided by researchers who are all too aware of the politically unpopular findings surrounding that factor). Harkenbane 08:35, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Harkenbane: Your question isn't that simple. On the one hand, if you do research using an instrument such as the 16PF, yes, you do "replicate" the factor structure. For example, when the researchers at IPAT wrote hundreds of brand new 16PF items during the development of the 16PF, administered them to hundreds of volunteers, and then performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses... Yes, the factors were confirmed. Both in factor-analyses of the new scales and in analyses of the old and new forms.</p>
<p>But the same is true of the NEO with it's 30 facets and Hogam's HPI with it's dozens of HIC's. So if you mean, "Do researchers agree on any breakdown of the five broad factors?" then no. Since the choice of factors is somewhat arbitrary, there is no reason to expect that they would agree. But my point are that: (1) the big five is far too broad, so (2) virtually all commercial personality tests have adopted this two-stage model and (3) I have seen evidence (like Lew Goldberg's unpublished "Comparitive validity" chapter) that convinces me that these facets have significantly higher validity than the broad traits, even after you account for the different numbers of predictors (by using empirical cross-validation, in the case of Lew's chapter). Goldberg's chapter actually found that the 16PF factors were most predictive of all factorial models (e.g., NEO-5, NEO-30, Hogan-6, Hogan-36, etc.)</p>
<p>And I guess your also asking whether anyone has done the same things Cattell did and gotten the same results. That's not as cut-and-dried as you suggest. AFAIK, only one replication has been attempted (by Norman?) and it's true, he didn't find the same results. But one contrary finding does not constitute a stunning refutation and I'd argue that Norman's different findings could easily reflect that exploratory factor analysis is a poor way to find replicable factors. There are far too many judgments required (like **how many factors to extract** which is absoluetly **not** a solved problem).</p>

<p>_____________________</p>
<p>&gt; Your question isn't that simple.</p>
<p>Actually, it's pretty simple. Numerous attempts to discriminate between the validity of 5 or more factors have been carried out, such as:</p>
<p>Saucier, G. (1997). Effects of variable selection on the factor structure of person descriptors. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, 1296-1312.</p>
<p>Or consider this study, which specifically checked Catell's factor structure using Cattel's own questions, and still got five factors:</p>
<p>Tupes, E. C., &amp; Christal, R. C. (1961). Recurrent personality factors based on trait ratings. Technical Report, USAF, Lackland Air Force Base, TX.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; if you do research using an instrument such as the 16PF, yes, you do "replicate" the factor structure.</p>
<p>But that's because the test was created specifically with questions that would load on the factors they were supposed to load on. That tells us nothing about how many factors really do describe the broad range of human variation.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; So if you mean, "Do researchers agree on any breakdown of the five broad factors?" then no.</p>
<p>True, and I already conceded this point. Yet at the same time:</p>
<p>"what is different about the personality research community today versus ten years ago is that there is a clear trend towards embracing a single model — the FFM — as the research paradigm to follow."</p>
<p>Howard, Pierce J, and Howard, Jane M (2003). "The Big Five Quickstart: An Introduction to the Five-Factor Model of Personality for Human Resource Professionals (Revised)" Center for Applied Cognitive Studies (CentACS) Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; (1) the big five is far too broad</p>
<p>You haven't offered any reason to believe that five are "too broad." Too broad for what? For many purposes, five appear to be too many, even, especially in light of the findings regarding alpha and beta - for instance, vengefulness corresponds well to low alpha and latent inhibition to low beta. The question is whether the factor structure of personality is such that, at a given level of detail, a certain number of factors emerge. At the highest level, it seems that alpha and beta emerge, and lower down, the Big Five become apparent. But after this things get murky. The 30 subtraits tested for by Costa and McCrae are (I believe) chosen capriciously, while the 15 factors don't replicate properly. At the present time, it can't be stated confidently what (if anything at all) lies beneath the Big Five.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; I have seen evidence (like Lew Goldberg's unpublished "Comparitive validity" chapter) that convinces me that these facets have significantly higher validity than the broad traits, even after you account for the different numbers of predictors (by using empirical cross-validation, in the case of Lew's chapter).</p>
<p>While I'd be interested to see the research you're alluding to, it isn't surprising that a more narrow trait could better predict a specific outcome - the question is whether that narrow trait is itself a unitary factor.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; AFAIK, only one replication has been attempted (by Norman?) and it's true, he didn't find the same results.</p>
<p>If you have one study which finds X, and one study which finds not-X, then you have no means of discriminating between the two. Fortunately for the purposes of this investigation, a variety of other studies have been carried out which find that the 16 factor model doesn't hold up.</p>
<p><br />
&gt; There are far too many judgments required (like **how many factors to extract** which is absoluetly **not** a solved problem).</p>
<p>It is a fairly easily solved problem in this case: Five are replicable. More factors aren't. Maybe there are more factors to be found (and I do believe that there are); maybe the emerging consensus in the Big Five will later turn out to be unfounded; science is progressing all the time. But the state of the research as it exists now is unfriendly towards Cattell's efforts of 60 years ago, and science rarely backpedals to an old model.</p>

<p>There was a good article in new scientist on the issue and it seems that there is quite a strong correlation between expressed geans and some of the factors, especially extroversion.

<p>Although I don't know of any specific genes which relate to personality, Bouchard and McGue, in their 2003 meta-analysis, "Genetic and environmental influences on human psychological differences" published in the Journal of Neurobiology, issue 54, found the Big Five traits to have the following heritabilities:</p>
<p>O-57% E-54% C-49% N-48% A-42%</p>
<p>I've seen a veriety of individual heritability studies, and they've returned highly similar results, indicating that those heritabilities are very accurate. It's interesting to note that the beta factors of E and O have the highest heritabilities while the alpha factors of C, N, and A have the lowest, although all the factors have heritabilities near 50%. It's also interesting to note that political conservatives are outbreeding political liberals in modern America, and given the high heritability of factor O and its modest relationship to political beliefs, this may have the unforseen consequence of gradually reducing psychometric Openness throughout the population.</p>

<dd>Although both variants can be seen in use, extrAversion is the contemporary standard in the academic literature. Note that:

<dd>ExtrAversion is pretty much standard in psychology now, and it was the original spelling used by such theorists as Jung and Eysenck. ExtrOversion seems to parallel IntrOversion better, but it doesn't make sense linguistically. Extraverts go <i>extra</i> or "additional to themselves" to seek social contacts and stimulation. This is in the same sense as extrAsensory perception and extrAordinary.

<li>The first section heading I referenced just isn't very representative of the paragraphs in that section. Picking a more descriptive title would eliminate that part of the problem.</li>

<p>I'm no psychologist, but I recently saw these traits listed in a huge UK coffee table book, "Human," and it convincingly manages to avoid the polemics - each trait is paired with it's polar opposite on a continuum, making for 10 trait titles, but it never sides with one trait over its opposite. Some people are just this way, and some people that.</p>
<p>For instance, why not list "Conscientiousness vs. Spontaneity"? It's pretty obvious, as such, that both are desirable characteristics to be shared among us all. And yet, you've got "Agreeableness" vs "suspicious and antagonistic towards others"? Come on. You can show a bit more "Openness" than that! Franklin Roosevelt put forward a more "agreeable" personality than Churchill's "antagonistic" type, but (whether I'm right or not on those two), both types are needed. We need, say, thin skinned people to say "bull" when everybody else is just going along, failing to point out the king (or president) has no clothes, for instance. We all say "bull" at times, but we really need those who are constitutionally that more than the rest.</p>
<p>How about "Agreeableness" vs. "Principled." I can't remember what "Human" listed, but the principle is obvious (at least it should be to those thinking themselves up to writing for an encyclopedia) - be open to all, reasonably so. Start with 10 positive definitions, implying all types are need in our lives, and then give their aberrations, or excesses, etc.</p>
