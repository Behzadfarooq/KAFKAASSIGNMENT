<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK%29_f3d9.html" title="Edit section: Format">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Format</span></h3>
<p>Each week, the housemates individually go to the diary room and nominate two other housemates for eviction. The two or more housemates with the most nominations are then revealed to the House and the public; and the public are invited to vote for who they wish to be evicted by sending a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premium_rate.html" title="Premium rate">premium rate</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a> call or <a href="../../../t/e/x/Text_message.html" title="Text message">text message</a>. The housemate who received the greatest percentage of the public vote is evicted.</p>
<p>Often, particularly since 2003-2004, there have been twists to this standard format. Some of the most common types of twists are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double evictions can occur particularly near the end of series where the two housemates with the most public votes are evicted.</li>
<li>If a housemate leaves voluntarily or is asked to leave for breaking the rules, they may be replaced and the replacement housemate is often exempt from nominations, which means that they can neither nominate nor be nominated.</li>
<li>If a housemate breaks the rules, they may be either banned from nominating or another type of twist may be used to punish them. In severe cases a housemate may be ejected from the house.</li>
<li>The evictions process in <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_Big_Brother_%28UK%29_ece5.html" title="Teen Big Brother (UK)">Teen Big Brother</a> differed significantly from other series by the elimination of the public vote, so housemates were required to vote amongst themselves who should be evicted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Series 7 housemate Sezer Yurtseven holds the record for highest eviction percentage. Sezer was evicted in week two of Big Brother 7 with 91.6% of the vote. Fellow housemates Lea and Richard survived the vote. On the other hand, the closest eviction vote so far was between Alison Hammond and Alex Sibley of Big Brother 3. At the beginning of the eviction show Davina announced that Alex had the highest number of votes, Alison was second, and that Sandy was third. Then at the eviction announcement it was announced that Alison has been evicted with 38.52%. Alex received 38.44% and Sandy received 23.04%. There were just 1,027 votes between Alison &amp; Alex. Mark Owen won the second series on Celebrity Big Brother with 77%, this is the highest winning percentage in Big Brother UK history in both the celebrity and regular series. <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadia_Almada_e498.html" title="Nadia Almada">Nadia Almada</a>'s 71% win was the largest of the regular series, occurring in 2004.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK%29_f3d9.html" title="Edit section: House">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">House</span></h3>
<p>For the first two series, the house was located in <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow%2C_London_720d.html" title="Bow, London">Bow, London</a> near to the <a href="http://www.threemills.com" class="external text" title="http://www.threemills.com" rel="nofollow">Three Mills Studios</a> which housed Davina's interviews and the production crew. After planning permission expired after two main series (and the first <i>Celebrity Big Brother</i>), <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Borough_of_Newham_f237.html" title="London Borough of Newham">Newham Council</a> ordered the complex to be returned to a natural habitat. Subsequent series have taken place at <a href="../../../e/l/s/Elstree_Studios_4490.html" title="Elstree Studios">Elstree Studios</a>, which offers more security than the Bow site (which had a public footpath running alongside the southern border). The actual house is in a separate building, and <i>Big Brothers Little Brother/Big Mouth/Big Brain</i> as well as the eviction interviews are all filmed in the nearby George Lucas stage, where <i>Star Wars</i> was once filmed. Even the Elstree site has problems, however: it is close to <a href="http://www.rhaworth.myby.co.uk/oscoor_a.htm?TQ198967" class="external text" title="http://www.rhaworth.myby.co.uk/oscoor_a.htm?TQ198967" rel="nofollow">a residential area</a>, attracting complaints about crowd noise on eviction nights. Permission has recently been granted to extend the lease of the house for series 7 and 8 (2006 and 2007 respectively).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> On 20 July 2006 it was reported in a <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_e3a1.html" title="The Sun">The Sun</a></i> that Big Brother producers had failed to extend the lease of the house past 2007, mainly due to the noise on eviction nights. According to various websites, it was reported that on the 3rd April 2007, <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol.html" title="Endemol">Endemol</a> reached an agreement on extending the house lease until spring 2008, and Elstree are reportedly happy with keeping Big Brother at Elstree. The new owners of the Elstree Studios, Pacifica Ventures, have stated they wish for the house to remain as part of the site.</p>
<p>The interior of the house is changed each year according to the theme of the series. For example, the Big Brother 5 house was claustrophobic, with harsh design features. Series 7 had an "Inside Out" theme, where certain items that one would expect inside of the house, such as the dining table, were located in the garden. Starting with series three, the entrance and exit to the house have featured the same design.</p>
<p>Olympus Security is responsible for the whole of Elstree Studios, including the Big Brother house. Their security guards are commonly seen on the eviction shows.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK%29_f3d9.html" title="Edit section: Tasks">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tasks</span></h3>
<p>Housemates are regularly set tasks by Big Brother. These vary from a short job for one housemate (often conducted without the other housemates' knowledge) to tasks over several days involving the whole house. Shorter tasks are generally rewarded with "treats" such as cigarettes or alcohol. The longer ones usually determine the size of the weekly shopping budget. If housemates fail these tasks, they are provided with basic rations only. Tasks often involve an element of performance, dressing up, or artistic endeavour. In more recent series, some tasks have also rewarded or punished housemates with regard to nominations, such as the now infamous 'Pants of Power'.</p>
<p>Series 3 of <i>Big Brother</i> introduced the "Big Brother: Live Task" programme. Each Saturday at 9.00 p.m., the housemates would take part in a short task which could change the way they live in the house. For example, one task gave the housemates the chance to remove the bars (rich / poor side divide).</p>
<p>The live tasks were continued in <i>Big Brother 4</i>, where winners of the task were treated to special rewards in a hidden "reward room". In series 5 the results of the live tasks affected the size of the prize fund. £10,000 was taken off the prize; each task they failed however, this was discontinued in the third week of <i>Big Brother 5</i> to make way for further highlights from the house.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK%29_f3d9.html" title="Edit section: Eye">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Eye</span></h3>
<p>Each series of Big Brother has used a custom eye. The now iconic "eye" logo is designed by <a href="http://www.eatock.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.eatock.com/" rel="nofollow">Daniel Eatock</a> of design agency Eatock Ltd. Since Big Brother 5, the eye has carried with it a meaning usually present throughout the series itself. For example, the series seven eye was named "Twisted," as the programme's theme that year was "twisted." Currently, both the eye and the House design reflects the twists or theme of the programme that year, including the subsequent celebrity series. In 2006, billboard advertisements and posters contained only the eye, as it is a very high-profile and prominent television logo throughout the UK, especially in the summer.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK%29_f3d9.html" title="Edit section: Aspect ratio">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aspect ratio</span></h3>
<p>Series 1 to 6 of <i>Big Brother</i> (2000–2005), including the four correspoding series of <i>Celebrity Big Brother</i>, were some of the very few programmes on mainstream British terrestrial television that were broadcast in the old 4:3 <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29.html" title="Aspect ratio (image)">aspect ratio</a> as opposed to the more common 16:9 <a href="../../../w/i/d/Widescreen.html" title="Widescreen">widescreen</a> format. (Except the Big Brother Panto, which was in widescreen). The reason for this is unclear, but was believed to be because of the size of some of the cameras. However, from <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_7%29_a7ce.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 7)">Big Brother 7</a></i> (2006) the aspect ratio has been switched in favour of the 16:9 format, with <i>Big Brother</i>, and all of its sister shows broadcasting in widescreen.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK%29_f3d9.html" title="Edit section: Live streaming">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Live streaming</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> has made available live pictures and audio from the Big Brother house. However, the stream had a delay of 15 minutes so that audio and/or pictures can be edited out to comply with TV regulations. Channel 4 commonly mutes the voices of the housemates and replaces then with the sound of birds, this is used when housemates are using inappropriate language, mentioning brand names, etc.</p>
<p>The action from within the house has been streamed live over the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> for a one-off fee subscription that lasts until the end of a series. Subscribers to <a href="../../../n/t/l/NTL_1820.html" title="NTL">NTL</a> Broadband Plus can watch the live stream free over the Internet. Currently it costs £4.99 for a whole series, and it is only available in the UK and The Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>Since the second series, Channel 4's sister station <a href="../../../e/4/_/E4_%28TV%29_f4c2.html" title="E4 (TV)">E4</a> has also carried live pictures and audio from the Big Brother House. An interactive service available to digital viewers allows 24/7 access to the stream, even when E4 is carrying normal programming. In 2005 for Series 6 this service became available and free for 5.1 million viewers who have access to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeview.html" title="Freeview">Freeview</a>. During series 2 - 4 the interactive service via digital TV also carried up to 4 separate video streams; 2 containing live footage from the house, both focusing on different groups of people in different areas of the house whilst the others contained highlights from recent house action. Only a single feed appeared from Series 5 onward.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeview.html" title="Freeview">Freeview</a> viewers were previously able to view live streaming by pressing the red button while watching E4 and 'LIVE' is displayed. This redirected the viewer to channel 305, which required <a href="../../../m/o/r/More_4.html" title="More 4">More 4</a>+1 to be discontinued to allow for the transmission. However, as of 17th of July this feature was removed in preparation for a free version of <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film4.html" title="Film4">Film4</a> which began airing on the 23rd of July.</p>

<p><i><b>Big Brother</b></i> reports on events that occurred in the Big Brother House on the previous day, showing highlights of these events. The show is normally aired every day at 9:00pm on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> for an hour, but is subject to change. On Fridays, <i>Big Brother</i> is aired as a part of <a href="#Big_Brother_Live_Eviction" title=""><i>Big Brother Live Eviction</i></a>. During the summer series, Tuesday is the day viewers find out who is up for eviction. Unlike Big Brother Live, it shows Diary Room conversations. Narrated by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Bentley_0656.html" title="Marcus Bentley">Marcus Bentley</a>, the show is sometimes referred to as the 'Channel 4 Show', the 'catch-up show' or the 'main show'. On live finals, only a small amount of catch-up footage from the house is shown and during <a href="#Celebrity_Big_Brother" title="">Celebrity Big Brother</a>, the final day in the house is never broadcast. Big Brother UK has the most number of series of Big Brother throughout the world, a total of 14, and has been on air for 604 days.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK%29_f3d9.html" title="Edit section: Big Brother Live Eviction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Big Brother Live Eviction</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Big Brother Live Eviction</b></i> is broadcast on Fridays at 8:30pm on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a>, and is presented by <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davina_McCall_9a3f.html" title="Davina McCall">Davina McCall</a>. It is during this show that a housemate is evicted from the Big Brother House, and is from that point on no longer a potential winner of the prize. This rule was reversed by producers in Series 7, as they put ex-housemates up for a vote to see who should be voted back inside the house. The four chosen by the public were Nikki, Grace, Mikey, and Lea. Proceeds for this vote went to charity.</p>
<p>The first fifty minutes of the show are highlights of the previous day, shown in the same format as <a href="#Big_Brother" title=""><i>Big Brother</i></a>. In early series, Davina would provide narration for this part of the broadcast. At around 9:25pm, Davina will "talk to the house" and announce the latest evictee before the show breaks at 9:30pm. She would say to the house, "Big Brother House, this is Davina. You are live on Channel 4, please do not swear. [Names of people up for eviction], the lines are closed. The votes have been counted and verified, and I can now reveal that the [<i>n</i>]th person to be evicted from the Big Brother House is [long pause] [name of person evicted]. [Name of person], you have 30 minutes (seconds if something special is happening later) to say your goodbyes." In series 1-4, she used to say "You have 1 minute to say your goodbyes and gather your belongings" as well as the imfamous "Im Coming to get you" line. Housemates also had one minute in series 5, but they did not have to take their suitcase with them.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, the show returns at 10:00pm when the audience are shown how the housemates have reacted to the announcement. The housemate is then told to leave the House, and is interviewed by Davina, before the show ends at 10:30pm. At the end of the interview, the evictee is shown their "best bits", a compilation of their most memorable moments in the house, usually accompanied by music. During Celebrity Big Brother 2007, <i>best bits</i> were re-named "the story of your time in the house" after <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Goody_d2c9.html" title="Jade Goody">Jade Goody</a>'s eviction on the Celebrity series. Producers thought it would be inappropriate for Davina to call it "best bits" as her <a href="../../../v/i/d/Videotape.html" title="Videotape">VT</a> showed bullying toward fellow contestant <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shilpa_Shetty_564b.html" title="Shilpa Shetty">Shilpa Shetty</a>. <i>Live Eviction</i> is often extended if something special is happening that night, such as new housemates or a double eviction.</p>

<p><i><b>Big Brother's Little Brother</b></i> is a magazine television programme that airs on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> and <a href="../../../e/4/_/E4_%28TV%29_f4c2.html" title="E4 (TV)">E4</a> during a series of <i>Big Brother</i>. Presented by <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dermot_O%27Leary_f71b.html" title="Dermot O'Leary">Dermot O'Leary</a>, the programme looks at <i>Big Brother</i>-related activities outside the House and features interviews with celebrities, journalists and friends and family of housemates, and sometimes recently evicted housemates.</p>
<p>The show was first aired on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> as a part of <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_2%29_5335.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 2)">Big Brother 2</a></i>, and is shown every Sunday morning as part of Channel 4's <a href="../../../t/4/_/T4_%28Channel_4%29_47fb.html" title="T4 (Channel 4)">T4</a> slot as well as on E4 during the week. During the first two weeks, the show was co-hosted by <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalie_Casey_9b04.html" title="Natalie Casey">Natalie Casey</a>. She was later dropped and that week's evicted housemate took over co-hosting. <i>Big Brother's Little Brother</i> developed into a twice-weekly show with <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_3%29_aa22.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 3)"><i>Big Brother 3</i></a>. For <i><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_4%29_d812.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 4)">Big Brother 4</a></i> and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_5%29_c0a0.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 5)"><i>Big Brother 5</i></a>, it was shown every weeknight at 5 pm on E4 before being repeated for <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrestrial_television.html" title="Terrestrial television">terrestrial</a> viewers at 6 pm on Channel 4. The Sunday programme includes the first interview with the most recently evicted housemate.</p>
<p>Though introduced with <i>Big Brother 2</i> as a separate show, <i>Big Brother's Little Brother</i> was present during <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_1%29_2b66.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 1)">Series 1</a> (2000) of the show in the form of a 2-minute spoof each Friday, featuring ten <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinea_pig.html" title="Guinea pig">guinea pigs</a> (each representing a housemate), and a small cardboard house. Two children, one boy and one girl, were featured as the scientists, wearing <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_coat.html" title="White coat">white coats</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasses.html#Safety" title="Glasses">safety glasses</a>. Various wisecracks and witty, spoofing moments were parodied, and at the end of each eviction show, the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinea_pig.html" title="Guinea pig">guinea pig</a> would be seen being wheeled away on a tiny <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trailer.html" title="Trailer">trailer</a>.</p>
<p>Starting with <i>Big Brother 4</i>, an extra clause was added into contracts between contestants and producers <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol.html" title="Endemol">Endemol</a> which bound evictees to appearing on <i>Big Brother's Little Brother</i> the Sunday after their eviction (they are evicted on Fridays) and every night for the next week. Any other appearances on any Big Brother-related programmes are optional.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> series saw the start of 'reunion' programmes. For 2002, the live programme was a special episode of <i>Big Brother's Little Brother</i> in the afternoon of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">July 28</a>; this was later shown as a repeat that night on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a>. <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> saw a similar format.

The news reported on, is after the previous night's show or a clip from main show that night.</li>
<li><b>Call BBLB</b> - At the beginning of the show, Dermot announces what the topic of the night's Call BBLB is. It can range from a number of topics such as, "Ask the latest evictee.." or "Who do you want to be evicted?" The show always ends with callers and e-mails and text messages run along the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li><b>Ginger Watch</b> (<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_3%29_aa22.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 3)">BB3</a>) - During the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_3%29_aa22.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 3)">third series</a>, as part of Little Brother's Big News, Dermot reported on housemate Tim Culley's supposed <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">ginger roots</a>. It was a small parody of <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> series, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crimewatch.html" title="Crimewatch">Crimewatch</a>. Similarly, in <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_6%29_dd08.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 6)">series six</a>, BBLB followed housemate <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makosi_Musambasi_4b96.html" title="Makosi Musambasi">Makosi Musambasi</a>, as her <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair_weave.html" title="Hair weave">weave</a> was falling into a state of disrepair.

The campaign, which was born from a joke but turned 'serious', saw among other things viewers donating money to paste an advert on the billboard facing the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol.html" title="Endemol">Endemol</a> studios so that BB executives would see it every day going to work. The hat was later destroyed; which was shown on the screen in the house for the housemates to watch, as punishment for not returning it when first requested by Big Brother.</li>
<li><b>Gnome Cam</b> (<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_6%29_dd08.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 6)">BB6</a>) - During the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_6%29_dd08.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 6)">sixth series</a>, a hidden cam was added to the garden through the eyes of a Gnome's tractor.</li>

<li><b>Queen Cam</b> (<a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_Big_Brother_4_%28UK%29_e4d6.html" title="Celebrity Big Brother 4 (UK)">CBB4</a>) - During the fourth series of <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_Big_Brother_4_%28UK%29_e4d6.html" title="Celebrity Big Brother 4 (UK)">Celebrity Big Brother</a>, a camera was added to one of the photograph frames next to the front door.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK%29_f3d9.html" title="Edit section: Big Brother's Big Mouth">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Big Brother's Big Mouth</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Big Brother's Big Mouth</b></i>, formerly named <i><b>Big Brother's EFourum</b></i>, was introduced with <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_series_5%29_c0a0.html" title="Big Brother (UK series 5)"><i>Big Brother 5</i></a>, and was hosted by <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russell_Brand_7524.html" title="Russell Brand">Russell Brand</a>, until February 2007 when he announced his departure in <i><a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_%28magazine%29.html" title="Heat (magazine)">heat</a></i> magazine.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>, despite <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> bosses pleading with him to stay.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> It is unknown whether the show will be scrapped or if a new host will come in to replace Brand. The show is aired on <a href="../../../e/4/_/E4_%28channel%29.html" title="E4 (channel)">E4</a> with late-night repeats aired on Channel 4. For the fifth series of Celebrity Big Brother, the show aired at 10 p.m., Sunday–Friday, immediately after <a href="#Big_Brother" title="">the highlights show</a> on Channel 4, with a mixture of fans of the show and celebrities all airing their opinions on the show. A small invited studio audience is also present, so that they can add their opinions to discussions, while viewers are able to contribute through phone, <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-mail.html" title="E-mail">e-mail</a>, <a href="../../../s/m/s/SMS_4cec.html" title="SMS">text</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poll.html" title="Poll">polls</a>, or by leaving a message on the 24-hour 'Mouthpiece'.</p>
<p><i>Big Brother's Big Mouth</i> is unscripted and highly interactive, allowing input from the live studio audience and celebrity guests as well as the television audience as the show progresses. For example, before the first advert break, viewers are given the chance to enter a competition in which they must think of a phrase to accompany a piece of art sent in by a viewer of the show. The prize for winning this feature is often silly and largely useless.</p>
<p>One of the main features of the show is 'the mouthpiece' in which answer phone messages with peoples views about Big Brother are played. Often messages are chosen because of the random and meaningless comments they contain; one recurring message is a man advertising his band's performances and has nothing to do with Big Brother'. During 'the mouthpiece' often a collection of objects is shown which Brand will use and at the end destroy; sometimes throwing them at the audience.</p>
<p>Brand is well known for his many catchphrases and anecdotes on the show. An example of this is an anecdote referring to "My ballbags..." (or "My Dicksacks", which Brand has used in the series of Big Mouth which ran alongside Celebrity Big Brother 2007) which ends with the catchphrase "The swine(s)!". He also has some often-used phrases such as "Citin' (exciting) isn't it", "Sex mad", "Nice/good to be..." and "Regardez". Brand's catchphrases frequently involve the use of <a href="../../../n/a/d/Nadsat.html" title="Nadsat">Nadsat</a>, such as "Viddy" (look) and "Droog" (friend). Every show ends with the phrase "<a href="../../../h/a/r/Hare_Krishna_734d.html" title="Hare Krishna">Hare Krishna</a>".</p>

He shows little interest in Big Brother but seems adamant that he has a right to be on the show and still turns up regardless. Due to his obnoxious behaviour he was asked by Russell to no longer come on the show. His trademark saying is 'You Shithouse!' He only comes on the show now to find another male to make love with, since he came out as a homosexual. On the final show of the last series he was seen in the hot tub of the Big Brother house as Jon Connell' did an investigation inside the house.</p>
<p>The Whale is a favourite among fans. He has remarked on his liking for former <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality_TV_3699.html" title="Reality TV">reality TV</a> show <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Club_4c73.html" title="The Club">The Club</a>, attributing his enjoyment of it to the shows star, ex-<a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastenders.html" title="Eastenders">Eastenders</a> actor <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Gaffney_607e.html" title="Dean Gaffney">Dean Gaffney</a>. The Whale has also shown interest in celebrity <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanessa_Feltz_bee1.html" title="Vanessa Feltz">Vanessa Feltz</a>, during one particular Big Mouth show asking her if she was "single still".

His contraptions, which illustrate a number of Big Brother-related findings based on his scientific research, are regularly vilified and destroyed by Russell Brand. Jon Connell is known as a Big Brother expert, having appeared on the show since the age of 15, first as a panellist on 'EFourum' then later in a regular slot entitled 'The Connell Files'.</p>
<p><b>Little Paul Scholes</b>: Little Paul Scholes was a small doll with ginger hair, a nasal voice and snub nose, in a reference to the football player <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Scholes_fd68.html" title="Paul Scholes">Paul Scholes</a>. The doll was usually in the programme for a few minutes after the break in occasional shows and has a short conversation (often centreing around his mistreatment) with Russell Brand, usually resulting in him being hit off the bench or sat on. He died in the final <i>Big Brother's Big Mouth</i> of <i>Celebrity Big Brother 2007</i> following the live final. It is unknown whether he will return during <i>Big Brother 8</i>, Russell Brand referred to it as an 'end of an era' suggesting that he will not, and on the 4 February 2007, it was announced that Russell was leaving BBBM.</p>

<p>Originally done as a one-off tie-in series by Channel 4 in association with the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Relief_ec40.html" title="Comic Relief">Comic Relief</a> charity telethon, <i><b>Celebrity Big Brother</b></i> is now a full spin-off of Big Brother UK, shown on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a>, S4C, E4, E4+1 and Internet live streaming and downloading, backed up with email and sms text news reports to subscribers. The series features a number of minor <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity.html" title="Celebrity">celebrity</a> contestants living in the Big Brother House, trying to avoid being evicted by the public with the aim of winning a large cash prize to be donated to the winner's nominated charity at the end of the run. The show uses the same house and presenters as the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28UK_TV_series%29_5dcf.html" title="Big Brother (UK TV series)">non-celebrity version</a> of the most recent series, but the time length is shorter than a normal Big Brother UK series. The celebrities are normally paid for their appearances, on the basis that they don't voluntarily leave.</p>
<p>The first Celebrity Big Brother was on Channel 4 for almost all its episodes, but the final was broadcast live on BBC1 on Comic Relief night in 2001. Subsequent Celebrity Big Brothers have not involved the BBC or Comic Relief in any way, and the charities involved are given far less publicity than in the first series.</p>
<p>The series took a break for <i><a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_Big_Brother_%28UK%29_ece5.html" title="Teen Big Brother (UK)">Teen Big Brother</a></i>, which was shown in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> and given a revised repeat in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, but now is a regular part of Channel 4's winter schedule.</p>
