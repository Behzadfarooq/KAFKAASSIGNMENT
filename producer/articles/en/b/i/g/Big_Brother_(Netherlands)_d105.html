<p>The Dutch <i><b>Big Brother</b></i> is the original version of the notorious 'mother of all <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">TV</a> <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality_television.html" title="Reality television">reality shows</a>'. It created the format in which a number of contestants live in an isolated house trying to avoid being evicted by the public with the aim of winning a large cash prize at the end of the run. This <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol.html" title="Endemol">Endemol</a> production set the rules for many other highly successful <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28TV_series%29_c8a7.html" title="Big Brother (TV series)"><i>Big Brother</i> versions</a>.</p>

<p>The idea for <i>Big Brother</i> was born on Thursday, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_4.html" title="September 4">4 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> during a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brainstorming.html" title="Brainstorming">brainstorm</a> session at the production house <i>John de Mol Produkties</i>, an independent part of <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol.html" title="Endemol">Endemol</a>. Participants were <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_de_Mol_e939.html" title="John de Mol">John de Mol</a> himself, Patrick Scholtze, Bart Römer and his brother Paul Römer.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The original idea called for a luxurious house with only six contestants, closed up for a year. The one that would persevere for twelve months would win 1,000,000 <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_guilder.html" title="Dutch guilder">guilders</a>. Working title was <i>De Gouden Kooi</i> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Golden_Cage_18da.html" title="The Golden Cage">The Golden Cage</a>).</p>
<p>The brainsession group came upon the idea after contemplating the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosphere_2.html" title="Biosphere 2">Biosphere 2</a> experiment in the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> desert, in which eight men and women discovered just how hard it is to live together alone – in that case, inside an airtight glass and steel geodesic dome that sought to replicate the Earth's environment. To that concept of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imprisonment.html" title="Imprisonment">imprisonment</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isolation_%28psychology%29.html" title="Isolation (psychology)">isolation</a>, <i>Big Brother</i> added the alternating of <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">deprivation</a> with <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wealth.html" title="Wealth">excess</a>.</p>
<p>The format of Big Brother was also influenced by <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Real_World_23cd.html" title="The Real World">The Real World</a></i>, which began in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> and originated the concept of putting strangers together in the same environment for an extended period of time and recording the drama that ensued. <i>The Real World</i> had also introduced the concept of after-the-fact "confessionals" recorded by housemates. The <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> TV show <i><a href="../../../e/x/p/Expedition_Robinson_d43a.html" title="Expedition Robinson">Expedition Robinson</a></i>, which first aired in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a> (and was later produced in a large number of other countries as <i><a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor_%28TV_series%29_7392.html" title="Survivor (TV series)">Survivor</a></i>), added to the "Real World" template the idea of competition, in which cast members/contestants battled against each other and were removed from the show until only one winner remained.</p>
<p>The idea of the introduction of <a href="../../../2/4/2F/24_7_e8fc.html" title="24/7">24/7</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streaming_video.html" title="Streaming video">streaming video</a> was influenced by websites like Jennicam.org from <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Ringley_ecd5.html" title="Jennifer Ringley">Jennifer Ringley</a>, a <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington.html" title="Washington">Washington</a> resident who created it in 1997 to share her daily doings with <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wide_Web_2386.html" title="World Wide Web">Webwatchers</a> around the world.</p>
<p>In development, the period of occupation of the house was brought back to 100 days. At the same time the idea of an existing house was abandoned in favor of a house made from <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prefab.html" title="Prefab">prefab</a> containers. This would facilitate the building permit and made it possible to install the so-called <i>camera-cross</i>, which allowed cameramen inside the house, without being seen by the inhabitants. Originally the thought was to produce a (heavily edited) weekly program. But after some experiments with the employees of the production house the allure of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_living.html" title="Simple living">slow television</a> was discovered, and the potential for a daily program was realized. The <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality_Television_8678.html" title="Reality Television">real-life</a> <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_Opera_53fb.html" title="Soap Opera">soap</a> had been born.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawsuit.html" title="Lawsuit">lawsuit</a> filed in 2000 in a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_district_court_75c5.html" title="United States district court">federal district court</a>, <i>Big Brother</i> was homegrown in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.A._a0be.html" title="U.S.A.">U.S.A.</a>. The original idea for the show, said the suit, came out of meetings in summer <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> between low-level <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> executives and Voyeurdorm.com, a <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa.html" title="Tampa">Tampa</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, adult website that streamed live feeds of eight college-age women.

<p>Also in 2000, the independent production company <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castaway.html" title="Castaway">Castaway</a>, part-owned by musician <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Geldof_005d.html" title="Bob Geldof">Bob Geldof</a>, sued <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol.html" title="Endemol">Endemol</a> for theft of format in a court in <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, saying the programme was a rip-off of its own <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor.html" title="Survivor">Survivor</a>-show (<a href="../../../e/x/p/Expedition_Robinson_d43a.html" title="Expedition Robinson">Expedition Robinson</a>). A <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">lawyer</a> listed 12 points where <i>Big Brother</i> bore uncanny similarities to <i>Survivor</i>. An Endemol spokesman rejected the allegations, saying: "The genre may be the same, but the programmes are completely different and they evolved separately. There are 20 or 30 game shows on TV and many different talk shows, but there are the same genre, not the same programme."</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logo.html" title="Logo">logo</a> for the Big Brother was especially designed to fit with the <a href="../../../s/t/y/Style_guide.html" title="Style guide">housestyle</a> of Dutch television station <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veronica_%28television_channel%29.html" title="Veronica (television channel)">Veronica</a>.

Part in the discussion played the moral panic in <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, after the first contestant voted off <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expedition_Robinson_d43a.html" title="Expedition Robinson">Expedition Robinson</a> had killed himself shortly afterwards, with his family reportedly blaming the rejection he felt as a result of being unpopular with the public.</p>
<p>P. van Lange, a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_psychologist.html" title="Social psychologist">social psychologist</a> at the <a href="../../../v/r/i/Vrije_Universiteit_719f.html" title="Vrije Universiteit">Vrije Universiteit</a> <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amsterdam.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> pointed out the similarity to the infamous <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_Prison_Experiment_65eb.html" title="Stanford Prison Experiment">Stanford Prison Experiment</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>).<sup id="_ref-Meeus_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meeus" title="">[2]</a></sup> In that experiment the participants were placed in a jail, where half of them played guards and the other half the prisoners. In six days the experiment completely derailed. The people forming the upper hand in this <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regime.html" title="Regime">regime</a> became <a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggression.html" title="Aggression">aggressive</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repression.html" title="Repression">repressive</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadistic.html" title="Sadistic">sadistic</a>. They transformed into personalities outside their normal selves. "From the Stanford-experiment may be concluded that human behavior is largely summoned by the local circumstances", added his colleague J. van der Pligt, professor at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universiteit_van_Amsterdam_a2d9.html" title="Universiteit van Amsterdam">Universiteit van Amsterdam</a>.<sup id="_ref-Meeus_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meeus" title="">[2]</a></sup> "People get carried away" said A.

But some of them weren't entirely negative. A. Lange, professor clinical psychology at the Universiteit van Amsterdam indicated that the programme maybe would produce unexpected <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyeopener.html" title="Eyeopener">eyeopeners</a>. Such eyeopeners weren't possible anymore in modern social-psychological research because the protection of the participants prevailed over the importance of research.<sup id="_ref-Meeus_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Meeus" title="">[2]</a></sup> "The <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design_of_experiments.html" title="Design of experiments">design</a> of the programme is the <a href="../../../w/e/t/Wet_dream.html" title="Wet dream">wet dream</a> of a psychological researcher. Nowhere in the world an ethical commission will be found that would agree to such a design", agreed psycho-fysiologist A.

<p>From the moment that it became clear that <i>Big Brother</i> scored unprecedented high ratings, the debate shifted to the question what this fact implicated about the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character_structure.html" title="Character structure">character</a> of the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> people, and if the amount of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual.html" title="Sexual">sexual</a> explicitism and terms of <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abuse.html" title="Abuse">abuse</a> suited the early time of broadcasting. What was formerly considered <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voyeurism.html" title="Voyeurism">voyeurism</a> now became a staple of <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainstream.html" title="Mainstream">mainstream</a> <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entertainment.html" title="Entertainment">entertainment</a>. One explanation was that people who lived in the modern world had become more and more isolated and were searching for others to identify with. In this view, talking about Big Brother took the place of backbiting and <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandal.html" title="Scandal">scandal</a>-speaking on the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_green.html" title="Village green">village green</a>. Notable was the surrender of even the high class newspapers, who couldn't refrain from reporting on the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hype.html" title="Hype">hype</a> that <i>Big Brother</i> had become. Overnight the programme had become <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashionable.html" title="Fashionable">fashionable</a>.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, at the time it was unknown that such debates would be repeated over and over again in each country where <i>Big Brother</i> was to be broadcasted. In the course of time all debate in the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> died down and <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality-tv.html" title="Reality-tv">reality-tv</a> became a standard part of television programming.

His <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant.html" title="Lieutenant">lieutenant</a> was the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frisians.html" title="Frisians">Frisian</a> Willem, who took up the role of house<a href="../../../c/o/o/Cooking.html" title="Cooking">cook</a>. Hotly debated was the relation between the leading female, <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housewife.html" title="Housewife">housewife</a> Karin (who had recently been cured of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>), and her much younger '<a href="../../../m/a/t/Mate_%28colloquialism%29.html" title="Mate (colloquialism)">mate</a>' Maurice. Also much talked about was a sex-scene between youngsters Bart and Sabine. The long awaited action under the blankets was captured by the nightview camera's in the bedroom.</p>
<p>The first ever evicted housemate was Martin, who also vied for Sabine's attentions and had accused Bart of being <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a>. He was voted out by a landslide. The first ever <a href="../../../v/o/l/Voluntary.html" title="Voluntary">voluntary</a> <a href="../../../e/x/i/Exit.html" title="Exit">exit</a> was for young Tara, who left after only nine days because of boredom.

In the end Willem betrayed his friend Ruud in the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28TV_series%29_c8a7.html" title="Big Brother (TV series)">nominations</a>, and Bart became the first ever Big Brother-winner.</p>
<p>During the series the housemates were visited by artists <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Baker_%28Dutch_singer_and_songwriter%29_0c5e.html" title="George Baker (Dutch singer and songwriter)">George Baker</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marco_Borsato_ca59.html" title="Marco Borsato">Marco Borsato</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anouk.html" title="Anouk">Anouk</a>.

<p>Big Brother 2000 was again broadcasted by <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veronica_%28television_channel%29.html" title="Veronica (television channel)">Veronica</a>, it lasted from <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">14 September</a> till <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">30 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> (108 days). Presenters were Beau van Erven Dorens en Esther Duller. This second series still had high <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratings.html" title="Ratings">ratings</a> but was plagued by mediocre <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casting_%28performing_arts%29.html" title="Casting (performing arts)">casting</a> which resulted in a programme that rarely sparkled. Big Brother tried to push a romance between the youngsters Georgie and Kim but it never really took off. Both Jolanda and Leo left prematurely after they had discovered that they hadn't impressed the public. It seemed they only wanted to use Big Brother as a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stepstone.html" title="Stepstone">stepstone</a> to fame and a job on television. Cry-baby Desirée also regularly threatened to leave, but never made that threat true. House-pet Cindy, a <a href="../../../n/u/b/Nubian_goat.html" title="Nubian goat">Nubian goat</a>, was removed by Big Brother because the streamwatchers complained that she wasn't properly cared for.</p>
<p>There were good moments too, though. The irritations around would-be artist Mohammed Ali, Robin who couldn't hold his <a href="../../../l/i/q/Liquor.html" title="Liquor">liquor</a>, Annette who slept a night in the goatpen and the stolen kisses between <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housewife.html" title="Housewife">housewife</a> Hieke and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfing.html" title="Surfing">surfboy</a> Ferdi. Hilarious was the unexpected refusal of the idealistic Ed to leave during the live show. He thought he had been treated unfair, and only agreed to leave the next day, after being allowed to make a public statement.</p>
<p>The finals were a sad affair. Fifty year old '<a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandfather.html" title="Grandfather">Grandfather</a>' Koos was bought off by the producers, after they had discovered he probably would win. Instead they pushed the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexual.html" title="Bisexual">bisexual</a> <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Hagenbeek_f6d6.html" title="Bianca Hagenbeek">Bianca</a> to first place, because she better fitted the target audience of Veronica (<i>young and <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild.html" title="Wild">wild</a></i>). Afterwards Hieke was featured in the Dutch Playboy, and Bianca started an online magazine targeted at bisexual girls (<i>Lets Be Open</i>)<a href="http://www.letsbeopen.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.letsbeopen.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p>Known as <i>The Battle</i>, the third season Big Brother was broadcast by the new station <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorin.html" title="Yorin">Yorin</a>. It lasted from <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_6.html" title="September 6">6 September</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">30 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> (115 days). Presenter was Patty Brard, who used to be known in the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventies.html" title="Seventies">seventies</a> as a member of the <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_group.html" title="Girl group">girlgroup</a> <a href="../../../l/u/v/Luv%27.html" title="Luv'">Luv'</a>. Due to a better cast of characters, this Big Brother-series became <i>the talk of the town</i> again.</p>
<p>The format underwent some changes. Contrary to the former seasons the viewers were only able to vote for their favorite <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nominee.html" title="Nominee">nominee</a>, and not for the one they wanted to leave. This system was introduced to prevent that the most controversial housemates would be <a href="../../../e/v/i/Eviction.html" title="Eviction">evicted</a> first. Equally important for the producers was that the new system would generate more phonecalls, and thus more <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenue.html" title="Revenue">revenue</a>.</p>
<p>The housemates were divided in two permanent groups. One group lived in a <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxurious.html" title="Luxurious">luxurious</a> part of the house, the other group lived in <a href="../../../p/o/v/Poverty.html" title="Poverty">poverty</a>. On unexpected times a battle was announced, in which the two groups could fight for the right to live on the rich half. Each group had a <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a> with special duties and privileges (a <i>Head of Household</i> before that name was coined). At any moment each participant was free to challenge his leader in a <i>captains-battle</i>.</p>
<p>The series started out with only six housemates. The others were secluded in a <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villa.html#19th_century_and_modern_.22villas.22" title="Villa">villa</a> in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> and were only gradually introduced. Each new twosome started with a battle to determine which group they became part of. In Spain, where there were no cameras, a relation developed between Nancy and Richard. But when Nancy finally arrived in <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almere.html" title="Almere">Almere</a>, Richard was voted out at the same time. Another contestant never made it to the real house at all. Ellen was removed from the Spanish villa because she had made disallowed telephonic <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contact.html" title="Contact">contact</a> with the outside world. Rumor said she had gained possession of the telephone by having sex with a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Security_guard.html" title="Security guard">security guard</a>.</p>
<p>The first week the occupants were only visible on <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streaming_video.html" title="Streaming video">streaming video</a>. The producers thought that it would be prudent to start the television broadcast in the second week, so they could save up interesting material for a <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_start.html" title="Jump start">jump start</a>. They were wrong. During that first week <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a> happened in the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a>. Because of the magnitude of the event the housemates were informed. <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands_Antilles_f058.html" title="Netherlands Antilles">Antillian</a> Aldrico, who had many friends in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, took the news bad and had to be removed after he started to behave confused. On the other hand, some housemates for a while had the feeling the event was not real. Even after they received newspapers and saw images, they thought they were the victim of a very cruel joke.</p>
<p>The outspoken <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-fictional_character.html" title="Non-fictional character">characters</a> of this season yielded much viewing-<a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleasure.html" title="Pleasure">pleasure</a> but also lots of complaints about the high content of <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swearing.html" title="Swearing">swearing</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booze.html" title="Booze">boozing</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">sex</a>. Young teacher Andries ended up in bed with the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transsexual.html" title="Transsexual">transsexual</a> <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Van_Der_Veer_58f6.html" title="Kelly Van Der Veer">Kelly</a>, snogged with Audrey and had a sexual relationship with Diane. Before that, a very drunken Diane had forced sex with Frank. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Streamwatchers.html" title="Streamwatchers">Streamwatchers</a> who were <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witness.html" title="Witness">witness</a> to the event filed a complaint. However, neither the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Justice_d635.html" title="Ministry of Justice">Ministry of Justice</a> nor <i>Big Brother</i> took action. Housemate Gert-Jan gathered a big <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanbase.html" title="Fanbase">fanbase</a> after he had been much maligned by the manipulative Coos and Pascal and had proposed to his girlfriend in the outside world.</p>
<p>The final battles, in which the last contestants had to collect the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prize_money.html" title="Prize money">prize money</a>, were copied from <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fear_Factor_7909.html" title="Fear Factor">Fear Factor</a> (another <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol.html" title="Endemol">Endemol</a> production). The <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian.html" title="Lesbian">lesbian</a> beauty Sandy won the last popularity vote. Inspired by Kelly, she later used the money to pay for <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_implant.html" title="Breast implant">breast implants</a> for her girlfriend and herself. <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Van_Der_Veer_58f6.html" title="Kelly Van Der Veer">Kelly</a> herself gained a photo shoot in the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy.html" title="Playboy">Playboy</a> in which she could show off her newly gained <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminity.html" title="Feminity">feminity</a>.</p>

As planned, this led to several relationships from which the one between Arthur and Ursula endured for the longest time. Stefan, working in the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porn.html" title="Porn">porn</a>-business, didn't manage to choose between former <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah_witness.html" title="Jehovah witness">Jehovah witness</a> Daniela, Geesje and Margriet. This wasn't very much appreciated by the girls. Dutch <a href="../../../m/o/r/Moroccan.html" title="Moroccan">Moroccan</a> Mustapha put his stamp on the program by insisting to upheld the <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramadan.html" title="Ramadan">Ramadan</a>. In spite of that, ‘Mushi’ was involved in various rude arguments with the <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">emancipated</a> Margriet and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortuyn.html" title="Fortuyn">Fortuynist</a> Arthur. Meanwhile Judith, Marc en Wouter provided an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethereal.html" title="Ethereal">ethereal</a> component with their interest for the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranormal.html" title="Paranormal">paranormal</a> and for <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurolinguistic.html" title="Neurolinguistic">neurolinguistic</a> thinking. In the end the outsider Jeanette became the unlikely winner.</p>
<p>Excursions to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Weakest_Link_be46.html#The_Netherlands" title="The Weakest Link">The Weakest Link</a></i> and for <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charitable_organization.html" title="Charitable organization">charity</a> to <a href="../../../u/g/a/Uganda.html" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> upturned the principle of <i>no contact with the outside world</i>. Due to the poor casting, the unsympathetic characters (<a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Russell_Terrier_3879.html" title="Jack Russell Terrier">Jack Russell Terrier</a> Quincy being the most liked), and the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Deviation.html" title="Deviation">deviation</a> from the original format, Big Brother 4 was universally considered a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Failure.html" title="Failure">failure</a>. The ratings were consequently very low, and while Big Brother remained a success all over the world, it was cancelled in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Big Brother returned three years later, after <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_de_Mol_e939.html" title="John de Mol">John de Mol</a> introduced his own TV-station <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talpa_%28TV%29_c4d9.html" title="Talpa (TV)">Talpa</a>. Although he didn’t own the production rights anymore (he had left <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endemol.html" title="Endemol">Endemol</a> by then), he certainly hadn’t forgotten his crownjewel. Series 5 was shown with moderate success in the early evening from 24th August until 22nd December (121 days). The house had moved from <a href="../../../a/l/m/Almere.html" title="Almere">Almere</a> to <a href="../../../a/a/l/Aalsmeer.html" title="Aalsmeer">Aalsmeer</a>, and presenters were Bridget Maasland en <a href="../../../r/u/u/Ruud_de_Wild_658c.html" title="Ruud de Wild">Ruud de Wild</a>. This year the main theme was <i><a href="../../../s/e/c/Secrecy.html" title="Secrecy">secrecy</a></i>: all housemates entered with a secret that they weren’t allowed to reveal for a certain period of time. Aside from the usual weekly tasks, the housemates also received secret <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mission.html" title="Mission">missions</a> which were mainly devised to spark <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distrust.html" title="Distrust">distrust</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict.html" title="Conflict">conflicts</a>. Some gained <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cash.html" title="Cash">cash</a> rewards in small <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomination.html" title="Nomination">nominations</a>, which they had to hide for the others.</p>
<p>The series was dominated by the off and on relationship between <a href="../../../p/o/s/Posh.html" title="Posh">posh</a> icequeen Dido and rough living <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatter.html" title="Squatter">squatter</a> Roel, who shared his bed with Lieske and Linda as well. The series also borrowed some successful elements from foreign series, like the unexpected introduction of Nathalie’s ex-boyfriend in the house. However, most attention was directed to Tanja, who was seven months <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnant.html" title="Pregnant">pregnant</a> when she entered the house. Officially, Tanja could be voted off before the baby would be born, but the producers made certain that she stayed. Tanja’s unhealthy <a href="../../../t/o/b/Tobacco_smoking.html" title="Tobacco smoking">smoking</a> habits during her pregnancy were hotly debated in the media, as well as the role of the accidental father who didn’t want any responsibility but enjoyed his fifteen minutes of fame nonetheless. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_18.html" title="October 18">18 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> Tanja gave birth to her daughter Joscelyn Savanna in front of the cameras, another Big Brother first. Because limitations set by the Dutch Labour Inspectorate the baby thereafter wasn’t allowed to be shown on camera for extended periods of time. As a consequence, Tanja voluntary left with her daughter</p>
<p>During the last days of the series, the producers were accused of tempering with the results of the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_message_service.html" title="Short message service">SMS</a>-and telephone votes during eviction rounds. A campaign, spearheaded by third season housemate Gert-Jan de Boer called for attendance of a <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notary_public.html" title="Notary public">notary</a> at least during the finals. After much resistance Endemol gave in. In the finals Roel was defeated by happy go lucky Joost.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Netherlands%29_d105.html" title="Edit section: Season 6">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season 6</span></h3>
<p>August 18th 2006 was the internet <a href="../../../k/i/c/Kick-off.html" title="Kick-off">kick-off</a> for the sixth season, presented by <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridget_Maasland_af51.html" title="Bridget Maasland">Bridget Maasland</a>. The tv show started two days later. The finale happened on 27th November (102 days), which mad it the shortest Dutch Big Brother, ever. Viewing numbers were half of the previous season. The show also suffered from the competition with the similar show <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Golden_Cage_18da.html" title="The Golden Cage">The Golden Cage</a>, that was broadcasted by <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talpa.html" title="Talpa">Talpa</a> in the time-slot immediately after Big Brother.</p>
<p>Theme was <i>Together Alone</i>. Candidates were invited to enter as <a href="../../../c/o/u/Couple.html" title="Couple">couples</a>: 2 brothers, 2 sisters, a father/daughter, a father/son, a mother/daughter and a lovecouple took part as well as three <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_%28relationship%29.html" title="Single (relationship)">singles</a>. Communication with the housemates was done via intercom, wall-phone, red phone (obligatory answer), tv-screen and diary room. Every housemate had a <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safe.html" title="Safe">safe</a> <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deposit_account.html" title="Deposit account">deposit</a> of € 30,000. When leaving half was left behind, while the other half had to be donated to another housemate's deposit. The winner left with the amount accumulated in his deposit. Two "jokers" (safeguard against exit but obliged to nominate some one else) were been sold by auction. Marlies en Tijn won them for € 25,300 and € 29,200.</p>
<p>The series was characterised by tasks often copied from elsewhere as well by the editorial habit to ridicule the participants. The series started without daylight, fresh air or day/night rhythm which resulted in group instabilities and contestants getting physical and psychical complaints. After two weeks the garden opened for 2 hours daily. Ever since the <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slogan.html" title="Slogan">slogan</a> <i>hard and unpredictable</i> had never been made true again.</p>
<p>Two contestants, Jeroen and Milica, arrived one day early and had to pretend to be a couple (mission failed). Milica's mother Hilde entered a day after the group as not to betray her daughter. The first time the red phone rang Egbert answered it and heard the message that the viewers would decide whether he would stay. One day later he was allowed to stay with 75% of the public vote. Jeroen, Hilde, Milica, Etienne and Marcel formed a subgroup soon. When Egbert dropped his key into a hole in the floor, he had to survive in an inflatable canoe in the swimming pool for two days to get it back. Big Brother nominated Semih and Marlies for a minor rule offense but this was annulled and Etienne and Marcel were nominated instead for talking about their nomination strategy. Marcel was the first one to get an exit and donated his half of the money to his son. Soon after, the irate husband of Monique rushed to the house when the relation she had with Tijn was portrayed suggestively. After letters written hence and forth Monique decided to stay. Afterwards, the sisters Monique and Sabrina gained a private bedroom since Tijn and Etienne wouldn't leave them alone at night. In the second round Hilde and Etienne were nominated, the latter because of his <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">racist</a> talk. Hilde, who suffered heavily from <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibromyalgia.html" title="Fibromyalgia">fibromyalgia</a> was elected to leave. One week later her daughter Milica lost from Jeroen and gave him half of her money upon her exit. The red telephone rang again on September 25th and Semih heard that he would be nominated for four consecutive weeks. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">September 26</a> <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scabies.html" title="Scabies">scabies</a> was discovered within the house and measures had to be taken. A <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocktail.html" title="Cocktail">cocktail</a> party lead to a night with sexual acts amongst different contestants, including <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay.html" title="Gay">gay</a> Rik and Etienne (who had earlier said he hated gays). Marlies used her joker to put Janine in her place and the latter had to leave. A week later Egbert, Jeroen and Semih were nominated. Host Bridget told that Egbert and Jeroen both had to leave because they had the same percentage of votes. But Jeroen didn't leave for real; as a secret mission Monique and Sabrina had to hide him for a couple of days in their private bedroom. They succeeded, all gaining immunity in the next nominations. The following housemates to leave were Etienne, Micheline and Marlies. Marlies had ended up being nominated by a new joker, that Sabrina had bought from Jeroen. After that Marcia and Semih were the next to leave. From the four finalists the first to go were Tijn and Monique, the public was fed up by their egocentrical relationship. The winner became the rather undescriptive <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccerplayer</a> Jeroen. It is not expected that Big Brother will survive on Dutch television after this disappointing season.</p>
