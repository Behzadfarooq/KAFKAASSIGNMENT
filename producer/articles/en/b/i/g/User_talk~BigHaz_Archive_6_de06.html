<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bosniakophobia article</span></h2>
<p>Hi BigHaz, yes, I said it once, but I wanted to give more detailed explanation second time, so I think my opinion should also be taken into consideration both at Bosniakophobia Srbophobia talk page. Thank you.<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 07:07, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Protest</b></p>
<p>Why did you take my vote? Why did you cross "delete" two times? This way you censored my vote not once, but twice&#160;! I will complain to other admin's for your clearly illegal behaviour! <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 07:09, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Context Note:</b> The discussion here refers to the user's comments at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bosniakophobia_a37f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bosniakophobia">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bosniakophobia</a>. He had posted a bolded "Do not delete" on three separate occasions, and I struck two of them out for the sake of clarity when the AfD was going to be closed. He still has one of his three "votes" (inasmuch as they are in fact votes), which is as many as everyone else involved. The "more detailed explanation" to which he refers isn't in fact present, as it is in fact roughly 50% of a longer explanation that he had already posted. Again, in the interests of clarity, I struck this out. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:29, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Concerning your comments on my TalkPage, now that you gave enought explanation, fair enough. Although I wish you somehow merged all comments together instead of crossing them, but anyways. I see that Serbs are winning against nomination of Bosniakophobia as an article @ Wikipedia. What Serbs did BigHaz, and you need to understand this from factual and fair view of perspective, they (Serbs) invented word "Serbophobia", then nominated her on Wikipedia, and other Serbs came and voted "YES! Keep it!" and now thousands of "wikipedia scrapper pages" are basicly spreading this word as a cancer over the internet. So, let's delete both Bosniakophobia and Serbophobia, because NONE of these words is in English dictionary&#160;! So why keep Serbophobia? Why? Please tell me your reasoning. Please! Thanks. <a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBosniak_d234.html" title="User:Bosniak">Bosniak</a> 07:25, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would have merged the comments if there'd been anything to merge. As it was, one comment was a duplicate of the other, which meant that there was precisely nothing which could gainfully have been merged. In terms of Serbophobia, you'll note that I have not expressed any opinion at all in that AfD (even I have my limits when it comes to the murky world of Balkan ethnic politics). However, I will investigate the matter further, since you've asked. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:29, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Contextual Postscript:</b> Having looked into the murky world of Balkan ethnic politics slightly further in the interests of making sure that I wasn't shooting off my mouth about something that multiple people were doing, I noticed at the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Serbophobia_%28third_nomination%29_ebdc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Serbophobia (third nomination)">Serbophobia AfD</a> that the above user had in fact done much the same thing that he'd done at the Bosniakophobia discussion - although with the opposite intention. I repeated the process of striking the duplicate "delete" votes. One of the delete votes had a relatively long and potentially important rationale attached, so I didn't strike it. Of course, anything that's struck out is still patently visible to a closing admin or contributing user, and more legible via the editing screen if legibility is a problem. One of these days I'm going to have to make good my promise to myself of learning Serbo-Croatian. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:20, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for offering to help resolve the "teaching certificate" controversy. Note that I'm not against short certificate courses per se, but they are too often marketed by exaggerated claims that you really need one to find a job teaching English abroad. That certainly isn't true in Italy or Albania where I have a lot of personal experience, and I suspect it isn't true in other countries either. I suspect that some sites selling certificate courses even publish ficticious want ads for teachers in order to sell certificates. They are turning the web into a den of thieves. Merging my article with "Teaching English as a Foreign Language" would make it easier for certificate sellers to monitor and censor my writing, as well as make it harder for me to keep up with their extensive discussions. Their article is already too big. Let me know if need any more info. and thanks again. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmadaf2_d564.html" title="User:Omadaf2">Omadaf2</a> 16:44, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Currently, I don't see where the problem is. I agree that the general TEFL community may well be infested with advertising promoting this and that course, but I don't see that in the article itself. The only mention of certificates and qualifications is right at the beginning, talking about some of the more popular ones to have. Whereabouts in the article (or the external links section) are these courses being advertised and false claims being made? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:50, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Teaching Certificate Scams</b> Here are some quotes from the "Teaching English as a Foreign Language" article. “The basic qualification” is a “TESL or TEFL certificate” <b>Blatant advertising</b> and meaningless other than expressing “The ones you should buy, see our external links for easy ordering”</p>
<p>“the two most commonly recognized certificates” are the UCLES CELTA and the Trinity CertTESOL <b>Unverifiable</b> and <b>blatant advertising</b>.</p>
<p>“The typical” (<b>unverifiable</b>) U.S. qualification is a TESOL “although many shorter certificates exist” <b>Irrelevant</b> Who cares if shorter certificates exist unless this is a shopping guide?</p>
<p>“Schools willing to take untrained staff typically run short courses” <b>Unverifiable</b> How common are schools that force teachers to pay for training? VERY common only on the sites that sell certificate courses.</p>
<p>“More Information on the TEFL Profession” Links are <b>Blatant advertising</b> If your site steers visitors to buy certificate courses, advertise here. Any links to sites that question the value of short certificate courses will be quickly deleted.</p>
<p>Genuine want ads for teachers in the international press rarely mention certificates as preferred, let alone required, but on the sites that sell such courses the percentage of ads shoots up amazingly. Attempt to contact those "employers" to confirm the ads and you receive no reply. I wonder why. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmadaf2_d564.html" title="User:Omadaf2">Omadaf2</a> 15:08, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, now I see what we're on about here. Here are my thoughts on the phrases you've cited:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"The basic qualification": You may well be right here, although in my own experience there are fewer places which are interested in you <i>without</i> a certificate of some kind than there are who like you <i>with</i> one. I don't see any advertising in the external links section, though. Yes, they all tend to have the acronym TEFL (which I understand to be both the title of a certificate and the acronym for the act itself), but none of them are actually promoting a course that I can see.</li>
<li>"The two most commonly recognised certificates": I disagree that this is unverifiable. Surely it's possible to look into legitimate employers and see what qualifications they want? Obviously without any practical experience in the field, I can't be sure, but the article on the CertTESOL says that both it and the CELTA are recognised by the British Council, which confers a level of prestige. In terms of the advertising side of things, it only reads like advertising to me in the sense that an article on any product could be construed as advertising. It makes a statement about the certificates, yes, but it doesn't say that they're the "only" ways to get in or anything like that.</li>
<li>"The typical US qualification": Again, this can be verified. Simply round up a series of bright-eyed young TELF types in the states and ask what qualifications they have. The fact that shorter courses exist is a statement, not an advert - the sentence doesn't read "shorter certificates exist at these links", it simply says that there are other certificates and things available.</li>
<li>"Schools willing to take untrained staff": I really couldn't speculate about how common they are, but there's no discussion of how common they are in the article. What it says is that <i>if</i> there is a school which is willing to take untrained staff, <i>then</i> it will typically do the following. I'm sure there must be schools out there willing to take untrained staff, so again it can be verified.</li>
<li>The "more information" links strike me more as places which have links to sign up for courses, rather than "sign up for courses here" stuff. There have certainly been very commercial links on the page beforehand, but the worst of them are gone at the very least, if not all of them.</li>
<li>Looking at the link that you've added (to the interview with you), what seems to be the case is that your experience has been different to that of other people. The thing is, though, that an encyclopedia is about the generality of human experience, rather than how something was for one person. If you can find more sources than just your own interview (and very possibly about more than just Italy) saying that certificates aren't all they're cracked up to be, then you might be onto something. As it currently stands, it really does look as if your experiences have resulted in you adding your POV to the article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You suggested the article on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_L._Borgman_c482.html" title="Christine L. Borgman">Christine L. Borgman</a> be deleted, for reasons I'm still not sure why. She is the thrid most highly cited scholar in her field of all time - or at least since ISI has been gathering data on the most highly cited scholars. She's extremely well known in numerous fields, including information studies, communication, and computer science. I was surprised there wasn't already an article about her in Wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Really? My first port of call was the online journal database at my university and the only thing I could find was a review of one of her works. Still, if she's in a field which does more book-publishing than article-publishing, that might be the reason. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:44, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The irony here is that Borgman has helped create the theories and research that provided for library databases, perhaps even the database you searched. I wonder, however, if your school subscribes to information studies databases. They're kind of expenseive, and many libraries opt out because of cost.
<dl>
<dd>You may well be right. Still, looking at her faculty page, she seems to be one of the very few academics I've ever seen who doesn't have a list covering 75% of the page with every word they've ever written. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:34, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As a quick thought, by the by, I'm planning to hold off on creating articles for the confirmed national final winners until after they're actually performed at the contest itself. That way, we'll avoid any possible charge of Crystal Balling ("this will be the first time that X has done Y in Eurovision history") and should also end up with a more stable end product - free of fans saying that a song should do well before it tanks in the semi and also free of the need to change titles/artist details, as of course would have been the case in at least three cases last year. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:35, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Thank you for your offer.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lunchtime soccer</span></h2>
<p>You said in your policies on schools "My university is notable, it's big, important and old and has a lot of important people associated with it. My high school is notable because it has two famous people associated with it as well as having been in the media for less savoury reasons. My primary school may well be notable because I seem to recall learning that some famous people went to it, but if they didn't it would need another claim to fame. If it didn't have another claim to fame, it wouldn't be worth writing an article on it." I interperet this to mean that schools which have a claim to fame are notable. However you say that my school, which has many claims to fame, is not notable. Is this not contradictory, the very thing that you and the people you agree with have tried to catch me out on in the discussion on Lunchtime soccer. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensen_198_4321.html" title="User:Jensen 198">Jensen 198</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/n/User_talk%7EJensen_198_238c.html" title="User talk:Jensen 198">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jensen_198_afb9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jensen 198">contribs</a>) 05:49, 24 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>There are two misconceptions in your comments. Firstly, the quotes which you cite are from my "philosophy" page. They are not guidelines or policies, but merely my own thoughts on what notability is and is not as it relates to schools. There are periodic attempts to create a more coherent policy on when a school is notable and when it is not (I think <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS3_06b5.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS3">WP:SCHOOLS3</a> is the most recent one), and much of that section needs to be viewed in that light.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, at no point am I questioning the notability of your school. Indeed, the fact that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Friends%27_School%2C_Hobart_d6aa.html" title="The Friends' School, Hobart">it has an article</a> would suggest that <i>nobody</i> is questioning the notability of your school. What I <i>am</i> questioning, however, is the notability of the game which you and some of your friends at the school play in your lunchtimes. The comparison to my university or my high school is thus an unfounded one. If I were to create and/or defend the inclusion of a club which my friends founded at my high school or something along those lines, that would be contradictory to what I'm saying at the AfD for your article.</dd>
<dd>As I have said to other users, the President of the United States is a notable person, that's not in question. However, just because he's notable, there's no automatic notability for what he ate for breakfast yesterday morning or the contents of his iPod. Likewise, you attend a notable school, but there's no automatic notability for the games you play there or the teachers who work there. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:40, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
