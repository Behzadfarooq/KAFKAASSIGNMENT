<p>Founded in 1882, Big Horn soon caught the eye of well-to-do cattle and sheep ranchers who established operations along the base of the Big Horn Mountains as early as the 1890s. These included the sheep-breeding Moncreiffe brothers (from <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_Moncreiffe_bfb2.html" title="Clan Moncreiffe">Clan Moncreiffe</a> of the Scottish Highlands), Oliver Wallop (a member of the English Nobility), Goelet Gallatin (a descendant of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Gallatin_6ea8.html" title="Albert Gallatin">Albert Gallatin</a>, US Treasury Secretary under Thomas Jefferson), and Bradford Brinton (a businessman from Chicago). These residents of higher means were a minority among other residents who were primarily owners of small ranches and farms. This trend has continued to the present day, with several corporate executives seeking a picturesque low-profile retreat among upper-middle class residents, many of whom work in Sheridan, Wyoming. Land prices have risen exponentially in recent years, resulting in the subdivision of pastures that once served dairy farms and mid-size ranches. The large ranches along the base of the mountains have remained intact and largely undeveloped due to the foresight of residents who have established conservation easements on their properties.</p>
<p><br />
From fall to spring most of the community activity in Big Horn centers around its K-12 school, especially during football season. In the summer months the community attracts Polo players from around the world who enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of Big Horn Polo and the Flying H Polo Club in comparison to the more aristocratic experiences to be had in Long Island, Palm Beach, Santa Barbara, Spain, and Argentina.</p>
<p><br />
Though Big Horn is an unincorporated community, it has several civic organizations including the volunteer fire department, a non-denominational church, Women's Club, Lion's Club, and the Big Horn City Historical Society which boasts over 400 members nationwide.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Horn%2C_Wyoming_ef4c.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Big Horn is located along the valley of Little Goose Creek. From 1866-68 the military cut-off route of the Bozeman Trail crossed Little Goose Creek where Big Horn was later located. The trail was used by travelers going to gold fields in Montana, but was plagued by attacks of the Lakota tribe under Red Cloud. Fort Phil Kearney was established on Piney Creek, but continued harassment by the Lakota led to the abandonment of the Fort and the withdrawal of the US Army from the Powder River Country under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868.</p>
<p><br />
According to local historian Glenn Sweem, the main route of the Bozeman Trail did not pass through the site where Big Horn was later founded. Instead, the main trail lay farther to the east and followed Prairie Dog Creek, eventually leaving that drainage and taking a course now occupied by 5th street in Sheridan, Wyoming. From there the trail crossed Goose Creek and continued out Soldier Creek to present day Keystone Road, eventually crossing Tongue River between where Ranchester and Dayton, Wyoming were later located.</p>
<p><br />
Little Goose Creek was the site of General Crook's camp after the Battle of the Rosebud against the Sioux and Cheyenne on June 17, 1876. Crook was fishing in the Big Horn Mountains on Tepee Creek while Gen. George Custer was making his last stand at the Little Bighorn some 70 miles to the north.</p>
<p><br />
The first settler in the Big Horn area was Oliver Perry Hanna, an adventurer, prospector, buffalo hunter, and Indian fighter who built a cabin on Hanna Creek in 1878. During the winter of 1878 and 1879 he rode his horse north on the frozen Tongue River to hunt buffalo in the Yellowstone River Country. He participated in the massive-hide harvest that wiped out the buffalo on the northern plains. His published recollections told of entire steamships loaded with buffalo hides floating down the Yellowstone River, as well as entire freight trains loaded with buffalo bones. After the buffalo hunting dried up Hanna made a 400 mile round trip to Fort Laramie to buy seed and a plow, thereby becoming the first farmer to carve a furrow in what became Sheridan County. Hanna attracted many of the first settlers to Big Horn City, which was established in 1882. He operated the Oriental Hotel directly across the street from the Big Horn Mercantile for many years. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><br />
Local legend states that Frank James and Big Nose George were hiding out along Little Goose Creek in 1878. Apparently things got too hot for them in the Black Hills, and so they headed for the unsettled country near the Big Horn Mountains, where they encountered O.P. Hanna. This story has been passed down in the written recollections of early homesteaders, but has not been corroborated with outside historical references or the chronology of the James Gang.</p>
<p><br />
Polo was first played in the area at a summer fair in Sheridan in 1893. Among the players in the match were ex-members of the Ninth Lancers division of the English Cavalry who had brought polo from India. <a href="http://www.flyinghpolo.com/history.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.flyinghpolo.com/history.htm" rel="nofollow">Polo History</a></p>
<p><br />
At one time Big Horn had nearly 1,000 residents and boasted a college, a brick factory, a newspaper, two churches, a hotel, a livery barn, two saloons, and a mercantile. Big Horn made a bid to be the seat of Sheridan County, but an run-off election gave the title to Sheridan in 1888. An exodus of residents and businesses occurred around 1891 when it was learned that the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad was being surveyed through Sheridan. Since that time Big Horn has been a satellite community of Sheridan. Today Big Horn has a mercantile, two bars, a fly-fishing/outfitting shop, several bed and breakfasts, women's club, Bozeman Trail Museum housed in a blacksmith shop, a park, and an art museum located several miles up Little Goose Creek at the Moncreiffe/Bradford Brinton Ranch.</p>
<p><br />
Queen Elizabeth II of England stayed in Big Horn in October 1984 during a visit with her relatives at the Wallop Ranch. The event attracted national media who were interested in recording the visit of an international dignitary to a small western town. Residents who were interviewed by the press said they were happy for Big Horn to host the Queen, so long as the increased security and motorcade traffic didn't interfere with huntin' season.</p>

<p>Big Horn has a K-12 campus serving nearly 400 students. Graduating classes number about 40 students. Standardized test scores are routinely among the highest in the state of Wyoming due to small class size, excellent teachers and administration, and an involved community. Recent years have seen several National Merit Scholars and a graduate who was nominated for the Rhodes Scholarship. Several graduates are currently enrolled in Doctoral programs and Medical School around the country. Big Horn has also earned a reputation for competitive athletic teams, with several State Championships in football, volleyball, and girls basketball in the last decade.</p>
<p>Big Horn School uses a 4 day week with classes from 8 am to 4 pm, and teacher in-service days on Friday. Though controversial at its inception, this non-traditional schedule allows for increased teacher training and curriculum development, and reduces the need for students to miss school to attend atchletic contests and other extra-curricular activities on Fridays. It also allows for a consistent 3-day weekend, giving children more time to be nurtured in the home setting.</p>
<p>Big Horn School is under the jurisdiction of Sheridan County School District No. 1. Currently District 1 board members and the Wyoming State Facilities Commission are working on plans for new school buildings that will meet the future education needs of the Big Horn community.</p>
