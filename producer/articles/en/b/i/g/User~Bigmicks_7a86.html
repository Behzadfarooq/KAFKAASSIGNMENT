If you want something else (a side order), you order from the carte.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that menu is a false cognate in French and English.</li>
</ul>
<p>à la mode in fashion, style In English, this means "with ice cream" - apparently someone decided that having ice cream on pie was the fashionable way to eat it. amour-propre self love Self respect apéritif cocktail From Latin, "to open" après-ski after skiing The French term actually refers to snow boots, but the literal translation of the term is what is meant in English, as in "après-ski" social events. à propos (de) on the subject of</p>
<p>In French, à propos must be followed by the preposition de. In English, there are four ways to use apropos (we leave out the accent and the space): 1. Adjective - appropriate, to the point: "That's true, but it's not apropos." 2. Adverb - at an appropriate time, opportunely: "Fortunately, he arrived apropos." 3. Adverb/Interjection - by the way, incidentally: "Apropos, what happened yesterday?" 4. Preposition (may or may not be followed by of) - with regard to, speaking of: "Apropos our meeting, I'll be late"; "He told a funny story apropos of the new president." art déco decorative art Short for art décoratif attaché attached A person assigned to a diplomatic post au fait conversant, informed Au fait is used in British English to mean "familiar" or "conversant": She's not really au fait with my ideas. au gratin with gratings In French, au gratin refers to anything that is grated and put on top of a dish, like breadcrumbs or cheese. In English, au gratin means "with cheese." au jus in the juice Served with the meat's natural juices. au naturel in reality, unseasoned In this case naturel is a semi-false cognate. In French, au naturel can mean either "in reality" or the literal meaning of "unseasoned" (in cooking). In English, we picked up the latter, less common usage and use it figuratively, to mean natural, untouched, pure, real. au pair at par A person who works for a family (cleaning and/or teaching the children) in exchange for room and board avant-garde before guard Innovative, especially in the arts avoirdupois goods of weight Originally spelled averdepois bête noire black beast Similar to a pet peeve: something that is particularly distasteful or difficult and to be avoided. billet-doux sweet note Love letter blond blonde fair-haired This is the only adjective in English which agrees in gender with the person it modifies: blond is for a man and blonde for a woman. Note that these can also be nouns. bon appétit good appetite The closest English equivalent is "Enjoy your meal." bon vivant good "liver" Someone who lives well, who knows how to enjoy life. bon voyage good trip English has "Have a good trip," but Bon voyage is more elegant. brunette small, dark-haired female The French word brun, dark-haired, is what English really means by "brunette." The -ette suffix indicates that the subject is small and female. carte blanche blank card Free hand, ability to do whatever you want/need cerise cherry The French word for the fruit gives us the English word for the color. c'est la vie that's life Same meaning and usage in both languages chaise longue long chair In English, this is often mistakenly written as "chaise lounge" - which actually makes perfect sense. chargé d'affaires charged with business A substitute or replacement diplomat cheval-de-frise Frisian horse Barbed wire, spikes, or broken glass attached to wood or masonry and used to block access cheval glace horse mirror A long mirror set into a moveable frame chic stylish Chic sounds more chic than "stylish." cinéma vérité cinema truth Unbiased, realistic documentary filmmaking coup de grâce mercy blow Deathblow, final blow, decisive stroke coup d'état state blow Overthrow of the government crème brûlée burnt cream Baked custard with carmelized crust crème caramel caramel cream Synonym of flan - custard lined with caramel crème de cacao cream of cacao Chocolate-flavored liqueur crème de la crème cream of the cream Synonymous with the English expression "cream of the crop" - refers to the best of the best. crème de menthe cream of mint Mint-flavored liqueur crème fraîche fresh cream This is a funny term.

In both languages, it also refers to a young girl making her formal debut into society. Interestingly, this usage is not original in French; it was adopted back from English. décolletage décolleté low neckline lowered neckline The first is a noun, the second an adjective, but both refer to low necklines on women's clothing. dégustation tasting The French word simply refers to the act of tasting, while in English "degustation" is used for a tasting event or party, as in wine or cheese tasting. déjà vu already seen This is a grammatical structure in French, as in "Je l'ai déjà vu"=&gt; I've already seen it. It can also disparage a style or technique that has already been done, as in "Son style est déjà vu" =&gt; His style is not original. In English, déjà vu refers to the scientific phenomenon of feeling like you have already seen or done something when you're sure that you haven't. demimonde half world 1. A marginal or disrespectful group 2. Prostitutes and/or kept women demitasse half cup Refers to a small cup of espresso or other strong coffee. démodé out of fashion Same meaning in both languages: outmoded, out of fashion de rigueur of rigueur Socially or culturally obligatory dernier cri last cry The newest fashion or trend de trop of too much Excessive, superfluous double entendre double hearing A word play or pun. For example, you're looking at a field of sheep and you say "How are you (ewe)?" du jour of the day "Soup du jour" is nothing more than an elegant-sounding version of "soup of the day." eau de cologne water from Cologne This is often cut down to simply "cologne" in English. Cologne, which is the French/English name for the German city Köln, is capitalized in the French expression. eau de toilette toilet water Toilet here does not refer to a commode - see toilette, below.

In English, it can only mean the latter. fin de siècle end of the century Hyphenated in English, fin-de-siècle refers to the end of the 19th century. fleur-de-lis fleur-de-lys flower of lily A type of iris or an emblem in the shape of an iris with three petals. folie à deux craziness for two Mental disorder which occurs simultaneously in two people with a close relationship or association. force majeure greater force Refers to superior/greater force, or to an unexpected or uncontrollable event. gamine playful, little girl Refers to an impish or playful girl/woman. gauche left, awkward Tactless, lacking social grace genre type Used mostly in art and film - "I really like this genre..." haute couture high sewing High-class, fancy (and expensive) clothing styles haute cuisine high cooking High-class, fancy (and expensive) cooking or food hors de combat out of combat Out of action hors d'oeuvre outside of work An appetizer. Oeuvre here refers to the main work (course), so hors d'oeuvre simply means something besides the main course. idée fixe set idea Fixation, obsession je ne sais quoi I don't know what Used to indicate a "certain something," as in "I really like Ann. She has a certain je ne sais quoi that I find very appealing." joie de vivre joy of living The quality in people who live life to the fullest laissez-faire let it be A policy of non-interference maître d' maître d'hôtel master of master of hotel The former is more common in English, which is strange since it is incomplete: "The 'master of' will show you to your table." mal de mer sickness of sea Seasickness matinée morning In English, refers to the day's first showing of a movie or play.

In both languages, it now refers to an outstanding accomplishment or the final part of something - a project, a meal, etc. pied-à-terre foot on ground A temporary or secondary place of residence. protégé protected Someone whose training is sponsored by an influential person. raison d'être reason for being Purpose, justification for existing rendez-vous go to In French, this refers to a date or an appointment (literally, it is the verb se rendre - to go - in the imperative); in English we can use it as a noun or a verb (let's rendez-vous at 8pm). repartee quick, accurate response The French repartie gives us the English "repartee," with the same meaning of a swift, witty, and "right on" retort. risqué risked Suggestive, overly provocative roman-fleuve novel river A long, multi-volume novel which presents the history of several generations of a family or community. In both French and English, saga tends to be used more. rouge red The English refers to a reddish cosmetic or metal/glass-polishing powder, and can be a noun or a verb.

<p>Hi all...</p>
<p>My EA did the headgasket well and proper on thursday, sounds like a valve has gone also (thanks to water leaking into a cylinder or more)....</p>
<p>So far i've got the following:</p>
<p>New oil, new coolant. New Thermostat, thermostat o-ring, thermostat lower housing gasket. New ED Rubber rocker gasket New AU2 Steel Headgasket New AU2 Head Bolts New EA MPFI Gasket</p>
<p>The head off my other EA is down at a machining place in town here and they are going to do tests on it and if it's ok they'll machine it for me, otherwise i'll pull the head off that's on the car now and get them to take a look at it...</p>
<p>Now, as far as the actual swap, whats involved?</p>
<p>I assume...</p>
<p>drain oil dump coolant (lower rad hose) label spark plug leads unbolt power steering remove PCV breather hoses remove spark plugs remove exhaust manifold (if i just unbolt this will it sit in the way at all or should it be ok?) remove intake manifold (again, can i just sit this to the side and leave plugs and looms on?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>o get TDC just line the notch in the Harmonic ballencer to the TDC mark on your timing cover.</p>
<p>using your old rocker gear is fine, all EA-EL1 rocker gear is interchangeable between heads.</p>
<p>the chain wont move when you release the tensioner cause the chain guides hold them in place, you only need the cable tie on the cam sprocket because it is possible that it may seperate from the chain and when you lift it up it may skip a tooth. the best way to see if it correct is line the crank to TDC and the notch in the cam sprocket should be 3 mm above from the top of the head on the A/C pump side of the head.</p>
<p>yep stuff some lint free rags down all the oil gallery holes when taking the old gasket off, then just use an air gun to blow all the **** off. remove top thermostat housing, and bottom thermostat housing... remove brake booster vac hose (at one end) undo rocker cover and remove set engine to TDC (how do i do this? wind it on by hand but to where? - this will mean when I put the cam back in I just put it to TDC also right, no skipping teeth or anything?) put car in gear so engine doesnt move from TDC? (sheer laziness) release timing chain tensioner? and how? undo timing chain guide from head undo rocker pedestals remove rocker gear (any trick to this or can i just lift it off, the put it all back on? i've got the set off the other car no problems and that's all I can see, but aren't there suposed to be shims somewhere? or do u need to pull something apart to get to them?) unbolt &amp; remove timing gear from cam remove cam unbolt head (I've already got a single hex 14mm socket... needed that to get the other head off the other car&#160;:-/) lift head up off motor pry/peel away old gasket... (how do i get rid off any **** left on the block, stanly knife?) place AU steel gasket on to locating dowells/block... I don't use any gasket goo or anything here, right? place head onto gasket/locating dowells insert bolts to finger tight tighten from center bolts outwards to 30nM + 120 degrees (is this correct for the AU bolts, just going by memory atm?) put cam back in, rotate until it will fit gear at tdc? put gear back on and bolt to cam bolt cam chain guide back to head re-insert rocker gear (locating dowells again), and rebolt, using torque settings as in EA factory repair manual? - is this all or is there anything to be careful of etc? reset? timing chain tensioner... again how? replace bottom radiator hose put gasket goo on to thermostat lower housing gasket, and install thermostat lower housing. grease thermostat o-ring (insert on thermostat, then into the housing) bolt thermostat top housing up</p>
<p>now, should I leave installation of the rocker cover until i've run it to make sure all is well and that the timing gear has tensioned??</p>
<p>install rocker gasket (silicone the whole lot or just around the corners and half moons??) install rocker cover, tighten rocker cover bolts from center using torque settings as in repair manual. reinstall PCV breathers, and brake booster re-insert spark plugs (inspect and replace if necessary? they are fairly new autolite 985s so they should be ok) re-plug spark plug leads re-attach power steering and re-install power steering belt re-fill coolant re-fill oil re-bolt exhaust manifold re-bolt intake manifold (same as was unbolted...)</p>
<p>start up and get rid of any air in coolant...</p>
<p>and all is well?</p>
<p>any other things i will need to do afterwards, i change oil every 5000ks should I do this sooner after this change or? Oil filter is about a week old purolator so it's right... again with coolant, do i need to drain and refill again in a few weeks after this or will it be ok?</p>
<p>most importantly, is there anything i've forgotten (and re the rocker gear cos i got nfi...).</p>
<p>Any and all assistance on this would be very much appreciated. ________</p>
<p><br />
If you can post a pic of what bits you have removed, I can tell you what's missing. It's common for them to come apart. Use a magnet to remove the spring &amp; the other half of the notched tensioner. To re-assemble, you need to lock the two halves with the spring together. This is done by twisting the halves until they lock. You then refit the tensioner &amp; the large outer threaded housing. Using a long allen key that fits in the end of the tensioner, you turn it slightly while depressing the tensioner with a long thin screwdriver. This releases the tensioner &amp; the spring applies the correct tension to the chain. If this isn't done correctly, the chain will be either too loose or too tight &amp; may cause damage.______</p>
<p><br />
sorry all for diging up this old thread, but i'm having trouble setting the tension. i have to by a new one tomorrow seeing as it broke but can anyone tell me if this is the correct way to do it.</p>
<p>1. put the tensioner in with the spring and lock bit locked in. 2. screw the retainer in and torque it up (do you have to get the oil holes to line up? 3. use 3mm allen key and unlock the tensioner. 4. make sure the tensioner is sitting on the chain guide properly. 5. check chain tension (how much movement should there be?) 6. fit oil filter and o rings to plug and scew in.</p>
<p><br /></p>
