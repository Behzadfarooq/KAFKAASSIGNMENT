<p>Has anybody else considered that tis game was released this way purposefully? If you think about it, it's great way to gain fame; Despite how horrifyingly bad it is, it's well-known on the internet.

<p>I strongly believe this game was a cheap and low scam to get money, this game was obviously not done. yet they released it anyway... And it has nothing to do with racing, it's you driving. that's it. You have an opponent, but the car never moves. and you can drive through any obstacle. When you "win" a "race" the screen says You're Winner! which is grammatically incorrect. And the game has no sound. This game was a big fat SCAM!24.128.186.205 20:48, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I looked and looked and looked and didn't find anyone who had anything at all nice to say about this game. If positive commentary has been seen in the wild, including it here would be nice. <a href="../../../i/m/e/User%7EIMeowbot_a66d.html" title="User:IMeowbot">iMeowbot</a>~<a href="../../../i/m/e/User_talk%7EIMeowbot_b909.html" title="User talk:IMeowbot">Mw</a> 01:08, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, there has been positive commentary about the game, but it's all metaphysical gibberish, complete idiots, or people who can't tell a good game from a hole in the ground. Search Metacritic.com for this game, and you will quickly find this to be true.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidizer13_64bd.html" title="User:Davidizer13">Davidizer13</a> 17:50, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Not to in any way claim that I was responsible, but I emailed Metacritic to make sure they would have a score for the game. Originally, it was one review short of having an official Metacritc score, but then I pointed out that X-Play did (technically) review the game by calling it the worst game ever made. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 00:56, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>This article is very biased. All it does is point out the shortcomings in the game. Just because whoever edited the page doesn't like the game doesn't mean that that's supposed to automatically make his/her opinion fact. Some people enjoy this game. I, personally, think it has great humorous value. Also, the controls are adequate, as are the graphics (which for some reason get universal hate, even though the textures are perfectly fine for a low budget game released in 2003). The article, on various occasions, calls the game "bad" as if it were fact. I can't believe the people who think this is not biased. IT IS. Your opinion on whether you like Big Rigs or not is irrelevant. 190.30.152.151 21:39, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although different gaming websites gave Big Rigs unusually harsh/negative reviews, the current Wiki article makes no mention of the BROTRRers (Acronym from the game). With over fifty members and three different fansites, the BROTRRerhood and the Rigists (followers of Rigism, a religion created from the game) need to be mentioned in the main article (not just in the links at the bottom of the page) because otherwise it would not be fair for people that have different point of views on this game. Since Big Rigs came out about two years ago, it is safe to assume that the BROTRRers are fans of the game, and that this is not just temporary. HitokiriFelix- That's right!</p>
<p>Well, I added a "cult section" a few days ago, and some other people have polished it up. Hbdragon88 04:10, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yep. The box for MRC changed from "CV talkin', convoy rollin' action" to "keeping your cred in the ultimate street race". It was fundamentally the exact same game.

<p>I spent about 2-3 hours researching. The thing about it being an "early release" is based on assumptions, but all the "Midnight Race Club" images, vehicles, and other leftovers were found in the retail version of the game. I also verified this by finding screenshots of the final version. Might need a bit of revising, but the fact that the game was intended to be Midnight Race Club and shipped with the big rigs working is true. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowMan1od_7e39.html" title="User:ShadowMan1od">ShadowMan1od</a> 22:49, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I'm sorry if you feel that I've "vandalized" your page, but try to see it my way. I live by the RIGIST principles set forth by STELLAR STONE, seeing you call BIG RIGS the "worst game ever" is like walking into a mosque and calling allah the "worst god ever."</p>
<p>Basically, your page is very offensive, and I was annoyed. Now you spread your message of hate by showing that you don't even consider RIGtopians to be a race, our culture is zillions of years old and I don't need your prejudice added to the strugle of my people. If you're interested in making your page politically correct, you can fix it by:</p>
<p>Not calling big rigs the worst ANYTHING ever, that's the opinion of hate groups, it doesn't belong on wiki. Also, you shouldn't trivialize it by calling it a "game."</p>
<p>Another thing is that you've got to stop calling RIGISM a cult. It's a philosopy, not a cult, and we wouldn't have anything to do with cults anyway because the supreme council has declared them LOSER.</p>
<p>Another thing you should remove is the Alex Navarro links, that's like me going to the Christianity boards and linking to satanic websites.</p>
<p>If these demands are not met, I'm afraid it will be very hard to avoid open war on Wikipedia. That means that the big rigs army will hunt down the editors, overthrow their tyrannical rule, and set up a new RIG-friendly government.</p>
<p>If you need any help making this page more WINNER, I will be glad to help. I'll be adding a section on the code of WINNER and of course a section on the three-handled tropy of WINNER when I have the time, just please be patient, and don't go letting your anti-rigite tendencies get in the way of making wikipedia a better place.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 167.206.52.67 (<a href="../../../1/6/7/User_talk%7E167.206.52.67.html" title="User talk:167.206.52.67">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_167.206.52.67_d73d.html" title="Special:Contributions/167.206.52.67">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Wikipedia is not here to provide an unbiased article in the sense of never portraying anything as positive or negative, it is here to provide an unbiased article in that it is an accurate representation of the opinions of other official sources. If the only verifiable sources in existance portray the subject in a certain manner, then the verifiable NPOV on the subject is that view. In some articles, this means we have biographies filled with political correctness and praise but no criticism because those are the only verifiable sources on the person in question, in this article it means we represent it as one of the Worst Games of All Time. If you can get a mainstream, non-blog game website to publish an article in which Big Rigs is portrayed positively, then we will be able to fairly include that view. As is, pretty much the best we can do is state that a tiny minority of gamers think the game is so bad that it passes into a type of absurdist humour. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 15:17, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><small>You do that. If you can find those sources then we can make the article less negative. However, the fact will remain that the primary claim to fame this article has IS that it was considered the worst game of the year/all time by many people. There is additionally no way deepdreamer should be banned for his actions, and even if he were an "anti-rigite," whatever the hell that means (Doesn't like the game?) we don't ban people for holding opinions, we ban them for vandalizing pages repeatedly and sometimes for being trolls.

<p><small>I made some edits to the Rigism section, and they fixed some errors I noticed. For one, BROTRRers aren't followers of any religion, that's Rigists. BROTRRers are members of the Rig community. Secondly, Rigism isn't satrical at all. I removed the stuff about us liking big rigs because it's bad, since no BROTRRer considers the game bad that wouldn't make sense to say hate for the game inspired our way of life.</small></p>
<p><small>Also, we aren't mocking anything when we say YOU'RE WINNER, so that needed a change too.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>Yes, it is satirical. Your edits are themselves a type of satire, further enforced by your refusal to admit that they are. Read <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_burlesque.html" title="High burlesque">High burlesque</a> and tell me that isn't an accurate description of what you are doing. (Actually, knowing you you will tell us it isn't...) That doesn't change, however, that what your community does is takes a game that is considered by everyone else to be among the worst games ever, and satirically elevates it to the level of a religion. Rigism is a form of satire by the definition of everyone else. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 18:38, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>It isn't satirical. It seems that from what you and the others have been saying that Wikipedians are all about backing up sources, show one source where a BROTRRer ever said that Rigism was satirical. Big Rigs is a cult hit, please stop making it sound like the fans are all just trying to be funny and sarcastic.</small>
<dl>

<dd><small>I have indeed read that WINNER book, and I noticed that it doesn't say anything anywhere in there about satire. It's interesting how you can just declare something a joke because you don't believe in it.</small>

<dd><small>I suppose you believe <a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Modest_Proposal_989b.html" title="A Modest Proposal">A Modest Proposal</a> to be a serious work as well?

<dl>
<dd><small>Okay, but the entire concept of being serious ingolves treating something as if it were serious, and that is the case we're dealing with here. There are people who love Big Rigs, and people still buy the game after 3 years. Just because you (who I'm sure never even played the game) choose to believe the opinion of a few reviewers doesn't mean that there can't be people out there who love the complete freedom of leaving the gameworld and driving through anything. Stop forcing your opinion on us.</small></dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</dd>
<dd><small>I'm not forcing my opinion on anybody, because I don't even have one on the game itself. I've never played the game, and I have no opinion of it. I think the idea sounds funny in fact, and probably will play the game at some point just for the humour value. All I am doing is removing the nonsensical claim that Rigism is not satire. Because it is satire. The same way that the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn_1b4b.html" title="Invisible Pink Unicorn">Invisible Pink Unicorn</a> is satire. It' not a few reviewers either, it's ALL the professional review magazines and web sites. There are, according to one of you, 50 total members in the entire fan base for Big Rigs. The fact we are even including a section on the miniscule fanbase is already overrepresenting one side of the issue.</small></dd>
<dd><small>Think of it this way. If I claimed to believe that Swift's Modest Proposal (linked to earlier in the page) was a sensible idea, and further wrote derivitive pieces applying the philosophy of A Modest Proposal to other situations, and writing arguments as to its practicality and in its defense, and founded a community of like-minded individuals, all of whom spent their time online talking about the merits of cannabalism as a superior form of population control which had many side benefits, and all of us acted totally serious about it, would it make the community not be a satirical one? NO. We would still be engaging in a form of satirical humour, even if all of us swore we weren't. We would just be taking satire to an extreme form, idolizing and obsessing over what was originally a thought-provoking JOKE. (Except for the 3 or so people who were just sickos who liked the idea of eating people.)--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 15:41, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</small>

<dd><small>I understand what you're saying. Look at it this way:</small></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><small>Most people today don't play text adventures. Some people do, and they even prefer them to graphical adventures. Does that make them sarcastic because they disagree with the mainstream?</small></p>
<p><small>No, and we seriously do like BIG RIGS. I for one love the idea of leaving the gameworld, I love the idea of driving straight up cliffs without reducing my speed, and I love the fact that a game that contains these and more features is availible for the low price of $5. I honestly feel this way, so first of all I don't appreciate you saying that it's only because of the criticism that I like BIG RIGS.</small></p>
<p><small>Secondly I like the idea of a philosophy that will allow me to carry over the feeling I get when I see YOU'RE WINNER into real life, that's not satire either. This is the way the BROTRRers feel, and we don't appreciate being treated like a bunch of jokers.</small></p>
<dl>
<dd><small>I didn't say no one actually likes it, but rather that they like it because of the same reasons that other groups think it is the worst game ever. I was specifically saying that the psuedo-religion is a form of satire, not the entire fanbase itself. I can probably edit the section to more fairly represent this. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 21:50, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</small>

I always like to compare format and styling to similar articles and in this case I referenced the game articles of <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom.html" title="Doom">Doom</a>, <a href="../../../3/d/_/3D_Monster_Maze_3c36.html" title="3D Monster Maze">3D Monster Maze</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_Dark_3e3a.html" title="Perfect Dark">Perfect Dark</a>. In reviewing the article according to the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">Good Article Criteria</a>, this is how the article stacks up.<br />
<b>1. It is well written.</b> - <i>Weak Pass</i></p>
<ul>
<li>I gave it a weak pass because there is no glaring violations of <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">WP:MOS</a> however there are some awkard sentences that don't quite flow. I would take another look at them. Like...</li>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>2. It is factually accurate and verifiable.</b> - <i>Weak Pass</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall the article strives to be well referenced with sources from reputable gaming magazines that pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. It is a weak pass because there some minor OR concerns that need to be addressed. Like...<br /></li>

<ul>
<li>"Put simply, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing largely ignores the laws of physics."</li>
<li>"Despite all these issues, Big Rigs managed to be a commercial success. Though no known sales figures exist, the game was reportedly made entirely on a $15,000 budget. At USD $5 per game, Stellar Stone would have only needed to sell 3,000 copies to break even. According to GameSpot, Big Rigs sold several times that amount." (OR synthesis. You are <i>assuming</i> it is a success without a reliable source publishing it as so. It is even pointed out that you really can't know because there is no known sales figure)</li>

</dl>
<p><b>3. It is broad in its coverage.</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<ul>
<li>A significant area of coverage that is missing is development. In reading this article, a persistent thought I had was whether or not the developers <i>intended</i> for the game to be this bad.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4. It follows the neutral point of view policy</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<ul>
<li>While I understand that this is a <i>really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, REALLY</i> bad game, it doesn't have to be so blatantly and repeatedly asserted that it is. It is not the absence of positive reviews that makes this article fail NPOV it is the overbearing nature of its view that this game is so bad, when the article should be just stating the bare facts and letting the reader come to that conclusion. As <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> notes "As the name suggests, the neutral point of view is a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints. It is a point of view that is neutral - that is neither sympathetic nor in opposition to its subject." The whole tone of this article presents itself as in opposition to the subject. Some examples...(emphasis mine)<br /></li>

<ul>
<li>"In addition, no proper racing occurs in Big Rigs, as the "computer-controlled" opponent vehicle has no AI and never <i>actually</i> moves from the starting position."</li>
<li>"There are no true obstacles <i>whatsoever</i> for the player to negotiate in Big Rigs"</li>
<li>"Upon completion of the "race," <i>(scare quotes)</i> "</li>
<li>";Big Rigs was subject to an <i>overwhelming</i> number of negative reviews."</li>

</dl>
<p><b>5. It is stable</b> - <i>Pass</i></p>
<ul>
<li>The article is a bit of a vandal target but the editors on this article seem to be pretty active in maintaining the page's integrity. The main aspects of the article appear to be fairly stable.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>6. It contains images, where possible, to illustrate the topic.</b> - <i>Pass</i></p>

<li>For an article with this subject matter, the cover shot will suffice for the purpose of GA evaluation. For further consideration, a screen shot from the game (Maybe the famous YOU'RE WINNER) would be a plus to have.</li>

<p>I see that the article has been renominated for GA.

<p>Concured with Circus206 - there simply isn't anything else to write. It's a low-budget, low-profile game that caught on and became a cult classic due to Navarro's hilarious video review. Other than that, and the numerous other reviews, there isn't much else to latch onto. Hbdragon88 03:59, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've gone through the article and, at this time I don't believe that it qualifies for GA Status. Please see my comments below:</p>
<p>1. <b>It is well written.</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<p>Although the previous reviewer gave this category a weak pass, I think the prose is a little too awkward for a Good article. Although the cases that the previous reviewer pointed out were fixed, there were points that confused me.</p>
<p>"There are no obstacles for the player to negotiate in Big Rigs, as the truck may freely be driven on and off roads without any loss of traction, straight up hills, through structures, and even out of the map's boundaries. The truck falls through bridges as if they do not even exist."</p>
<p>The statement that there are no obstacles, and that the truck may fall through bridges seem incompatible to me. Although I think I understand what is meant, the way that it is written seems to be confusing.</p>
<p>"Big Rigs was subject to a great number of negative reviews" - Doesn't really flow right</p>
<p>"and so this screen may appear to end the race before it even begins." I'm unclear about the exact effect of this screen. Does it _appear to end_ the race (and thus the race still goes on), or does it appear (*poof*) _to end the race_ and the game is over?</p>
<p>2. <b>It is factually accurate and verifiable.</b> - <i>Needs improvement</i></p>
<p>I think there are a couple of other things that really do need some sort of citation. There's nothing about the patch that was released that's soruced either inline, or as a reference.</p>
<p>I am giving it a "Needs Improvement" instead of the "Weak Pass" that the previous reviewer did, because, as far as I can tell, one of the cites doesn't back up what's being claimed.</p>
<p>The Article states:</p>
<p>"Netjak rewrote the code of their site to allow the game to receive a score of 0.0"</p>
<p>The source states:</p>
<p>"The only reason this game doesn't get a negative score is that I don't think our php gurus envisioned us ever giving a game a negative score, and because I reserve negative scores for a game that makes me physically ill."</p>
<p>I don't see any evidence that the code was re-written to allow a zero.</p>
<p>Also see the comment about "development flaws" below.</p>
<p>3. <b>It is broad in its coverage.</b> -- <i>Needs improvement</i></p>
<p>I know that in the notes left to the previous reviewer, you said that there is no development information. I do have to agree with them that it really seems like a big hole. Was it meant to be that bad, if not why? It really seems to me that if a game is notable due to it being bad, that there would be <i>some</i> coverage in the game development world about it. Maybe there is not a full post-mortem, but I'd expect at least a few comments.</p>
<p>The statement "Due to a developer oversight..." makes it seem like there is some information out there about it. If that's not the case, then that line presents OR/POV issues and needs to be revised.</p>
<p>4. <b>It follows the neutral point of view policy</b> -- <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<p>Although most of the statements that seemed POV before have been resolved, there are a couple that stand out to me.</p>
<p>"Big Rigs managed to be a commercial success. According to GameSpot, Big Rigs sold well over 20,000 units" -- 20,000 units being a success is POV. Although the game might not have been a complete failure, I don't think many game developers would be happy selling only 20,000 copies.</p>
<p>"However, the patch simply replaced the broken track with a mirror image of the first track, without changing the corresponding preview image or name." --- The use of the term "simply" here suggests that the developers took an easy way out. Although this is probably the case, without any evidence to the motivation of the dev team, I don't think it's appropriate.</p>
<p>5. <b>It is stable.</b> - <i>Pass</i></p>
<p>Not many changes since it was nominated.</p>
<p>6. <b>It contains images, where possible, to illustrate the topic.</b> - <i>Needs Improvement</i></p>
<p>Although an article doesn't need images to be a good article, the ones that are included need to be properly tagged. This includes a declaration of the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html#Fair_use_rationale" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">fair use rationale</a>. I have listed this category as needing improvement because the screen capture of the trophy does not have a declaration about why it should be considered fair use.</p>
<p>I do (also) agree with the previous reviewer. It would be nice to see an actual screen shot (other than the trophy) from the game. <a href="../../../b/e/t/User%7EBethling_7cd1.html" title="User:Bethling"><font color="#BB45AA">The Bethling</font></a><a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBethling_721d.html" title="User talk:Bethling"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 07:05, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I will properly tag the trophy image right now and will later get another screenshot showing the ability to drive through virtually anything in any given level. <font size="2"><b><a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirus206_0b62.html" title="User:Cirus206">Cirus</a></b></font><sup><i><a href="../../../c/i/r/User_talk%7ECirus206_74d4.html" title="User talk:Cirus206">Talk</a></i>/<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cirus206_b391.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cirus206">Contribs</a></i></sup> 20:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So what's being said here is that this article is doomed to a B-class unless we find some dev info? *sighs* Hbdragon88 22:01, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, good luck with that. Stellar Stone has been pretty low-profile for basically its entire existance. They didn't really offer any information about the game.</dd>

<p>As anyone who has frequently watched this article knows, there was a section concerning the issue of Big Rigs being a pre-released version of <i>Midnight Race Club: Supercharged</i>. The section was removed due to it being an iffy source. However, running another Google search, <a href="http://www.gamershell.com/pc/midnight_race_club/screenshots.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gamershell.com/pc/midnight_race_club/screenshots.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> has shown up. A collection of screenshots from Midnight Race Club, showing even more detail as to how it could be a finished version of Big Rigs. The logo for MRC is located within the game files for Big Rigs, as are many of the textures for the bicycles and cars. Also, the levels shown in one of the screenshots shows that the same five levels are in both games. Lastly, a big rig can even be seen in one of the screenshots. Is there any way to implement this into the article? <font size="2"><b><a href="../../../c/i/r/User%7ECirus206_0b62.html" title="User:Cirus206">Cirus</a></b></font><sup><i><a href="../../../c/i/r/User_talk%7ECirus206_74d4.html" title="User talk:Cirus206">Talk</a></i>/<i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cirus206_b391.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cirus206">Contribs</a></i></sup> 04:07, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I read the deleted sections. Yes, I'm aware that that it is unsourced from any reputable publication, and I'm aware that the proof for the connection to the Supercharged game is only in the game files which make that original research, but I believe Wikipedia should go for the "completion" of information not "restriction." As the nomination above added, there is NO reputable publication to refer to. When you look up the cult status of the game, there is NO article about them, they are only in a few joke fan sites and message boards. When you look up for information on its development, there IS no information, while some can speculate or even conduct research (but that would be original research...), there is no place, not even in Russia except the developers themselves that can gives us a real source to cite.</p>
<p>When the rules for citation and original research was made, it was to make sure articles would be reliable and accurate, it was for the critical articles in physics, mathematics, and history where the article have to be absolutely accurate right from the start. Fandom, analysis, literature, and many others subjects, just don't have the attention or sources to cite from. Too many times, things such as controversy or content that need inference are not published and are only acknowledged in discussions. Big Rigs is not a major game, it did not gained massive attention, there is just no place for anyone to cite the cult status of the game (since fan sites and message boards don't count), the development, or anything else really. Since what the article information only exist in original research or in some message board, this article is likely to be doomed to B-class, and I don't think deleting massive content on what we do know will help.DarkGhost89 02:24, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, that's just the problem when Wikipedia is not paper or a typical encyclopedia. Wikipedia shouldn't "lower its standards" for articles simply because they have varying amounts of coverage. How do we decide which article includes OR or not? <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is important because it reduces major problems with what to include or not to include. For instnace, I was just in an argument over the A-Squad Power Rangers. Do we include the "fan generated" names for four nameless rangers? Only a minority of the fans adopted those names <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DrachenFyre&amp;diff=92085272&amp;oldid=92083939" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DrachenFyre&amp;diff=92085272&amp;oldid=92083939" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. What about other names used by other fanfiction writers? No, we remove them all, as it was never stated. Likewise, we have very limited capabilities to infer anything, and we cannot put forth the original theory that Supercharged = Big Rigs or mention its alleged cult status.

<p>I just erased all of that "editing" you just did. I have to admit that some of it is pretty funny, but do you want to be banned? You certainly are on the right track.

<p>This is a review at points. It talks very negatively about the subject, and seems to just drag on and on with criticisms. This isn't helped by words like "Furthermore" putting the emphasis on all of the glitches. When it mentions the patch, it mentions the 'fixes' but emphasises the shortcomings.</p>
<p>The article kicks off straight away by quoting Gamespot, setting the tone for this article as a collection of quotes from reviews. Not many 'Reception' sections have as many quotes from reviews as this one.</p>
<p>And what sums up the poor POV of this article is this sentence. "It is widely considered to be one of the worst video games, if not the worst, ever." I can almost understand the first bit but saying "if not the worst, ever." just isn't neccessary.</p>
<p>I hope you now know why I added this tag. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECream147_36cd.html" title="User:Cream147">Cream147</a> <sub><a href="../../../c/r/e/User_talk%7ECream147_daf9.html" title="User talk:Cream147">Shout at me for doing wrong</a></sub> 21:08, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It talks very negative about the subject because there simply are no positive sides to this game, it has an <b>8 out of 100</b> score on <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/bigrigsovertheroadracing?q=Big%20Rigs" class="external text" title="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/bigrigsovertheroadracing?q=Big%20Rigs" rel="nofollow">Metacritic</a> with the highest score being a 10 out of 100, which means a 1.0. Furthermore, Netjak specifically rewrote their site code to be able to give them a 0. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupreme_Bananas_5626.html" title="User:Supreme Bananas">Bananas</a> 15:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly — many review sites just technically cannot give a score lower than "1 out of 10", hence why the Metacritic score is <i>as high as</i> 8 out of 100. The game really is that bad. The article appears to be in line with the <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">describing points of view</a> guideline. -- <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntgr_3172.html" title="User:Intgr">intgr</a> 08:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Did I say it was good? I wasn't saying it was good at all. I understand it got 8 on Metacritic. That's how I found out about this game. I know that a site actually rewrote their code for it. I know everything that I've been told about it from you! What I am saying is the removal of phrases, such as "if not the worst, ever" which I notice is still there. However, I have to say, a little bit has been done relating to the POV of this article which I'm pleased about. I can't believe how negatively you have received this, I am merely trying to follow Wikipedia policy. Any sentences that try and sound negative, should, in my opinion, be quotes. Not all of them are. That's all I'm saying. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECream147_36cd.html" title="User:Cream147">Cream147</a> <sub><a href="../../../c/r/e/User_talk%7ECream147_daf9.html" title="User talk:Cream147">Shout at me for doing wrong</a></sub> 14:50, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think your quote is taken out of context. The entire statement is "<i>It is widely considered to be one of the worst video games, if not the worst, ever.</i>" While this fails <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>, I would personally consider it a statement of a fact — the article does not say that the game is bad, it says that the majority of some unnamed entity considers it bad. I'll go and fix it. -- <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntgr_3172.html" title="User:Intgr">intgr</a> 17:12, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh shit, I accidentally put my message here. I meant to reply to the IP who put a message in the "Pov check tag" topic above. I'd only looked at the diff and assumed it was the bottom topic, and blindly added my message.
