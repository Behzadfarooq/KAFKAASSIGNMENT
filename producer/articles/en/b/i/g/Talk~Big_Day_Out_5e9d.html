<dd>I added those past line-ups and they were sourced from the Big Day Out 2004 website (<a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=cache:Qu4NkXLNjHcJ:www.bigdayout.com/theshow_past_lineups.php+big+day+out+past+lineups&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=cache:Qu4NkXLNjHcJ:www.bigdayout.com/theshow_past_lineups.php+big+day+out+past+lineups&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">Google cache</a>), so they are accurate.

<p>This is rubbish. Lees and West have confirmed this in the January edition of Rollingstone. They do not have enough interest in the event for it to travel to the Northern Territory.

<p>Given the short length of the Jessica Michalik article, it sounds like a good idea to merge it with the Big Day Out article.</p>
<p>I disagree. While I would say that more could be added to the Jessica Michalik article, such as the public/media reaction to her death, details of the circumstances and changes resulting from it, I think that the accident was significant enough to justify a separate article. Having a separate article isn't confusing to me. Besides, just merging on the basis of an articles' current size is strange; it doesn't give an opportunity for others to expand on it. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESera_Black_2a91.html" title="User:Sera Black">Sera</a> 03:43, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Merge the Jessica Michalik article with the BDO article. The death was a significant moment in BDO history and should therefore be included in the main article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree - yes, the death was a significant moment in BDO history, which is why a short synopsis of it is under the history section. All that really needs to happen is for someone to expand the separate article out a little. --<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDomster_cf17.html" title="User:Domster">Dom</a> 23:22, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just a general question, should it be noted that At the Drive-In stormed off stage earlier that day due to moshing and people in the crowd just generally going too far? Just to like, note that the constant risk during the day. Something in the air maybe?</p>

<p>The BDO Forum is an entirely different entity to the Big Day Out, and as a result should not be merged. More information is soon to come, and apologies must be made for the nonsense that was edited into the article by others, however the plan was to expand on the information.</p>
<p>BDO Forum is a community, that despite being owned by the Big Day Out festival, is used for other purposes and has many, many types of subject matter that have absolutely no relevance to the festival. People involved, achievements, events of note, they are all specific to the forum.</p>
<p>Also with your problems or verifiability and notability, do you want each comment referenced? The reference links at the bottom should provide most, if not all, the information needed to verify any comments made. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Henry winkler (<a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenry_winkler_e1bb.html" title="User talk:Henry winkler">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Henry_winkler_e4c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Henry winkler">contribs</a>) 05:42, 14 June 2006.</small></p>

<dd>I realize this, however you should be made aware that these forums are not notable enough by wikipedia's standards to warrant an article of its own.

<p>I see what you are saying, but I still do not see the problems you may have. I understand you moderators are allowed to display subjectivity, however, if you could give a basic suggestion as to what may be grounds for "notability" in the opinions of yourself and your colleagues. I have read through the page provided in your message, but it is not clear at all where the dispute is between you and the wikipedia entry that was created.</p>
<p>I don't wish to create an argument, rather to receive a simple answer or suggestion as to what would be approved. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Henry winkler (<a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenry_winkler_e1bb.html" title="User talk:Henry winkler">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Henry_winkler_e4c6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Henry winkler">contribs</a>) 06:13, 14 June 2006.</small></p>

<p>The following line is incorrect "Lead singer of Tool, Mark Stevenson is rumoured to be entering the big day out by helicopter." Maynard James Keenan is the lead singer of Tool, not Mark Stevenson.

<p>CONFIRMED BDO BAND</p>
<p>TOOL are coming to the 2007 bdo... they have confirmed a show at Melbourne's Sidney Myer Music Bowl on January 31... about the same time as some other music festival.....</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is not a confirmation. Dwayne Kirkwood 23:45, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

RE: CONFIRMED BDO BAND</p>
<p>They are the headliners since they are being bought out to Australia by Lee's and West's touring company</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's still not confirmation though. I don't think anyone disagrees with you, everything points to them playing, but until the organisers actually confirm it, I don't think it should be posted on this site. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellboy1975_4560.html" title="User:Hellboy1975">hellboy</a> 02:40, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find the lineups for each year completely unreadable.</p>
<p>The layout for the lineups for each year are inconsistent. Reading the band names all in one line and in one paragraph is hard to read. Though a bulleted list will make the article too long, maybe have a neatly structured table, from headline act to "lesser" acts.</p>

<p>The third announcement for 2007 is expected soon. When it does come out, do you think we can clean up the 2007 list a little? The way it is layed out makes it a little confusing, with the nz only and aus only things so close to each other <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayKeaton_01af.html" title="User:JayKeaton">JayKeaton</a> 22:25, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Should there be some mention of the fact australian flags are being banned as gang colours at the Sydney Big day out and that racism fears have led to the event being moved away from the usual date of January 26th (Australia day) Matt Cranley</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but there's no need to be in any particular hurry about it; a few days often lends itself to a bit of perspective. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 05:28, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay...I've made a few, nay, several changes to the paragraph. What currently exists ignores the fact that the flag ban was opposed by a large section of the community, not a few stuff shirt pollies and their ilk. Nobody said that the BDO should be "banned"; rather they said if organisers could not guarantee the safety of attendees then perhaps it should be cancelled. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKransky_b5d8.html" title="User:Kransky">Kransky</a> 11:28, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Am I the only one who finds this "flag ban" concept to be utterly offensive? If they wanted to prevent any "racial" (I totally object to this description) tensions, then banning the NATIONAL flag might just be the worst thing you could do after banning particular ethno-religious groups from attending. Sorry I just had to get that off my chest, this "race-riots" myth has gone way to far in this country. Spoonman.au 23:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Before you get too carried away, you do actually realise they didn't actually ban the flag? Just another case of the media trumping up a news story.... <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellboy1975_4560.html" title="User:Hellboy1975">hellboy</a> 01:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speculation on the 2008 lineup has been removed in line with policy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL</a>. Please refrain from post unconfirmed info on this page. As an aside, from memory the headline acts for the Big Day Out's are actually booked about 2 years in advance. Based on this I'd consider the possibility of The Smashing Pumpkins and Rage Against the Machine perform in 2008 to be somewhat unlikey. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellboy1975_4560.html" title="User:Hellboy1975">hellboy</a> 10:38, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
