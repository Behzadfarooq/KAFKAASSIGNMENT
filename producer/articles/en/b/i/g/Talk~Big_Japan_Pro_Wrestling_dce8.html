<p>Well, there we go. My first attempt at creating a BJPW article, well any article at all in fact. Pretty darn good I'd say. Feel free to change anyhting that's wrong/ improve/ update.</p>
<p>P.S. The first link of 'External links' has a BJPW logo on. If somone could upload that pic onto here that'd be great. Not really sure how to my self&#160;:S&#160;!!</p>
<p>--Mr. Chrispy 16:31, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Did BJW ever acualy use explosives? I've never seen it. <a href="../../../k/y/l/User%7EKyle_Burris_f62f.html" title="User:Kyle Burris">Kyle Burris</a> 21:50, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To be honest I'm not sure my self if they did. I'm really only working on 2 paragraphs of infor, title histories and a handful of matches I've seen. Mr. Chrispy 10:48, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, BJW never used explosives, although Zandig and Matsunaga had a Exploding Glass Death Match but it was really just some fireworks in the corner near the glass. So I'm going to delete that bit as it has no relevence to BJW. - Paulo</p>

<p>The thing is, czw fucked bjw up the ass. I'll try to do a write up on this latter.</p>
<p>Yeah, that'd be cool. I really don't know too much about that myself. Mr. Chrispy 10:50, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would also like to see some more information as to what happened to the relationship between BJPW and CZW, there is a lot more to it that what is being represented <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 16:59, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is the dispute about? - Paulo</p>
<p>I forget who wrote this and it's difficult to decide what to include as there's plenty of POV, but here's a brief rundown of the problems with the relationship:</p>
<p><i>Basically, Zandig convinced Kojika that CZW had a big thing going in the US with future PPVs and DVD deals (which didnt exist). Truth was Zandig's CZW had only been around less than a year and had a very small crowd. Somehow, Kojika bought it, but the booker at the time for BJW, Mike Samples, knew better. he did his best to convince Kojika of the truth, but it was none doing. finally, Samples let loose and laid out Zandig, and left the promotion. CZW stayed, and brought in the best of their worst. For the bulk of 2000-2001, the leagues put on cut and paste hardcore matches, mainly revolving around the CZW guys going over the DECENT stars of BJW. in 2001, things began to fall apart. First, Tomoaki Honma began to no show, probably due to the company's direction. Then, not too long after, Wifebeater, probably the worst wrestler from CZW after Zandig, was in a match with Ryuji Yamakawa and went for the Chokenbomb off the apron thru a table. Wifebeater missed by a longshot and crashed Yamakawa's head onto the floor. Immediate, Yamakawa suffered a brain hemmorage and had to be rushed to the hospital, and was put on the shelf for about 6-9 months, and his career was pretty much ruined. In december 2001, the lagues put on a 'supershow' in Yokohama Arena. Zandig, who had pretty much been given the book at this point, had a big hand in the shows setup. This included what could possibly be considered the biggest piece of egotism outside of HHH. After booking his CZW guys to go over in pretty much every match, he had a main event with Matsunaga (even tho he pointlessly threw himself in as a mystery wrestler in an earlier 200 lighttube deathmatch). Zandig CLEARLY began to do what he pleased to Matsunaga in the match. several times you can see Matsunaga trying to go along a certain plan and Zandig CLEARLY deviating, and pretty much got ALL the offense in the match. after he went over, he brought out all the CZW guys and cut a promo about how he was tired of carrying the company on CZW's back (which was BS as the company had gone down in popularity since they showed up), and said he was sick of washed up pieces of trash like Matsunaga. He went on and one about this, then left. Matsunaga, upon figuring out what happened, got on the mic and threw a fit, and left, never to return to BJW (an pretty much leaving the biz in a full time since for good). Because of this event, several of the CZW wrestlers had BJW titles, and brought them back to CZW to parade around as their own (the big japan deathmatch title was used at least up until 2003). Gargiulo, CZW's commentator, still goes on and on about Zandig being a legendary Japanese hardcore wrestler. pure tripe. Zandig's egotism continues to this day, although his body has taken its toll and he cant put himself over anymore. but wifebeater remains, still being booked as if hes the greatest hardcore icon since Foley. sad but true, and despite CZW's turnaround in recent years into a decent promotion, this has mared their reputation for me.</i></p>
<p>The current part about Yamakawa sandbagging in the article is basically untrue. Having seen the incident, the most obvious cause is the fact they are using a Japanese table (which most of you will know are much more narrow and difficult to break) and Wifebeater's lack of ability. Having seen Wifebeater blow spot after spot after spot with any number of wrestlers, there's no way you can blame Yamakawa for what happened, certainly not while remaining NPOV. 81.155.178.248 07:26, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBig_Japan_Pro_Wrestling_dce8.html" title="Edit section: Neutrality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Neutrality</span></h2>
<p>Firstly, I propose the Criticism section be removed. The entire section is POV and unverified. The part about psychology is somewhat baffling, as I shall explain.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It talks about logical progression of a match, while seemingly saying use of weaponry is not logical. Let's say the stipulations of the match include a barbed wire baseball bat. Why would you try and wear down your opponent with an over-hand wristlock if you can hit them with the baseball bat? The logical thing would be to use the bat!</dd>
</dl>
<p>There can be criticisms of various styles of wrestling, from TNA's X-Division's over use of high-spots to the low-risk and predictable WWE style. I'm not saying I agree 100% with either of those criticisms, I'm just using them as examples. Neither criticism would be appropriate on the TNA or WWE page, so it's inappropriate to have them on the BJW page.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Wifebeater-Yamakawa paragraph needs rewording substantially. I propose this;</p>
<dl>
<dd>During this feud, CZW wrestler <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Prince_710f.html" title="Matt Prince">Wifebeater</a> severely injured BJW wrestler Ryuji Yamakawa while performing a move off the ring apron through a table.</dd>

<dd>I was ooking for sourcing on the Wifebeater Ryuji incident and couldn't find any. Hard for me not being able to read Japanese. I checked the Japan wiki article on BJPW and through babel fish I managed to discern that it would seem that it doesn't mention the incident at all. Which makes more sense as it should be attributed to the wrestlers involved not so much as the company. I am going to add the Pro Wrestling project template and hopefull get some interest this way. <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 15:47, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do think it needs some notable things that happened during the feud though, and Yamakawa's injury did have a significant effect on BJW 81.155.178.248 16:21, 13 December 2006 (UTC)\
<dl>
<dd>I agree but I think we should keep to the facts in the Wiki article. I wasn't able to find any information on the incident and the injury. If we can get a reliable source for that it should go into the article. <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 14:52, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's not that much about Yamakawa in there really apart from the injury. It's an interview with Zandig talking about the BJW-CZW feud. The translation isn't great as you'd imagine, as it's got Zandig's comments translated into Japanese, then run back through Google's automatic translation tool. Yamakawa does have an article on the Japanese Wikipedia <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E5%B7%9D%E7%AB%9C%E5%8F%B8" class="external autonumber" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E5%B7%9D%E7%AB%9C%E5%8F%B8" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (translated version <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25E5%25B1%25B1%25E5%25B7%259D%25E7%25AB%259C%25E5%258F%25B8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%25E5%25B1%25B1%25E5%25B7%259D%25E7%25AB%259C%25E5%258F%25B8%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG" class="external autonumber" title="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25E5%25B1%25B1%25E5%25B7%259D%25E7%25AB%259C%25E5%258F%25B8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%25E5%25B1%25B1%25E5%25B7%259D%25E7%25AB%259C%25E5%258F%25B8%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) but there's no sources in it anyway, which makes life difficult. 81.155.178.248 15:53, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
