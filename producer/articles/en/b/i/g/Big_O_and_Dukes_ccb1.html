<p>The Big O and Dukes show began as a late night program during a search by <a href="../../../k/z/o/KZON_1886.html" title="KZON">KZON</a> for new content due to the retirement of Phil Hendrie and the ending of The Phil Hendrie Show. Big O and Dukes premiered in the early summer, and was picked up full time and moved to the 8:00 PM slot by mid summer, 2006. Prior to their arrival in Phoenix, the duo hosted Out to Lunch, a midday radio show on 105.7 (the former WXYV-FM) in Towson, Maryland.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_O_and_Dukes_ccb1.html" title="Edit section: Cast Members">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cast Members</span></h2>
<p><b><a href="../../../c/h/a/Chad_Dukes_1d92.html" title="Chad Dukes">Chad Dukes</a></b>: Chad Dukes hails from the East Coast, he was born in Alexandria, Virginia. He often refers to himself as 'The Peoples Champion' amongst many titles. He is a sports fan, and runs a weekly program for KZON titled 'The Gridiron'. Chad is extremely open about his issues with weight loss and body image, as well as his upbringing as a child of divorce. Chad also frequently elaborates on his love for professional wrestling, and has brought in many guests from TNA, WWE and the independent circuit. When Chad had to go to court for speeding violations he didnt want a listener to come with him because he "didnt want them to know his real name" revealing the possibility that Chad is not his real name.</p>
<p><b>Oscar Santana</b>: Oscar Santana's family is originally from Bolivia but he has lived most of his life in Virginia and Maryland. Oscar refers to himself as "The Big O" or "The Samaritan". He likes to wear fitted shirts and straight legged pants. He often is accused of being a homosexual or a pedophile by other members of the show. Oscar's mother commonly appears on the show.</p>
<p><b>Matt Cahil</b>: Matt is more commonly refered to on the show as "Drab T-shirt" because of his relatively boring clothing choices. Cahil works at World Market as well as <a href="../../../k/z/o/KZON_1886.html" title="KZON">KZON</a>. The other cast members make fun of the fact that he does not have very much money. Matt was fired several months into the show but was brought back after Salty Trizzle, their board operator, was fired. Matt got in an argument with Oscar and Chad when they put up a video of him wearing a "Mankini" of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borat.html" title="Borat">Borat</a> fame, on their <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myspace.html" title="Myspace">Myspace</a> page</p>
<p><b>Gary Martin</b>: Gary joined the cast as an on air promotion to find a replacement for their former phone screener and junior producer, CJ Walker. Gary is referred to as "Emo Gary" or "Gary the Banana" because he wears a banana suit throughout the entire show. Gary wears a banana suit because Chad and Oscar thought it would be funny "To see a banana lurking in the corner at live broadcasts". Gary screens calls for the show but often leaves the phones to come into the studio. Gary once became very angry when Chad read one of his instant message conversations on the air.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_O_and_Dukes_ccb1.html" title="Edit section: Former Cast Members">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Former Cast Members</span></h2>
<p><b>Salty Trizzle</b>: Salty's real name is Tracy. He got his nickname the first day of the show because Chad and Oscar thought he heavily perspires and "looks salty". He lives in the Arizona town of Apache Junction and because of the region's reputation of <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Meth_99ef.html" title="Crystal Meth">Crystal Meth</a> the cast members say he has "a trailer full of crystal meth in his backyard". Tracy has several children and the cast members often make fun of him for it.

<p><b>C.J Walker</b>: C.J is the former call screener and junior producer for The Big O and Dukes Show. C.J once interveiwed models from Catwalk for the Cure, in the interveiw C.J became so nervous that he kept repeating the words "Alright Alright". A listener nicknamed Rammstein made a song out of sound clips from the interview. The cast members gave him the nickname "The Wrangler" . C.J quit the show to improve his studies at <a href="../../../a/s/u/ASU_b62b.html" title="ASU">ASU</a> but he still works for the station on weekends.</p>
<p><b>Glenn Clark</b>: Glenn is more commonly known as "Coach G". Glenn moved from Baltimore, Maryland to Phoenix to become the producer for the show.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_O_and_Dukes_ccb1.html" title="Edit section: Regular Segments and Contests">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Regular Segments and Contests</span></h2>
<p><b>The Pulse and Around The Horn</b>:The most recurring segments are the sports minded <b>Around the Horn</b> hosted primarily by Chad Dukes, and the show biz driven <b>The Pulse</b> featuring Oscar Santana. The segments are often combined to form the <b>Dueling Pulse/Around The Horn</b> with each host playing their respective theme music to indicate the start of their segment. Chad and Oscar stopped doing these segments to free up some time for other conversations</p>
<p><b>Booze News, Ninjas in the News and Octopus News</b>: These three segments are hosted by Chad Dukes. Octopus news is a segment devoted entirely to octopuses. For every Octopus News segment there is an Octopus of the Week. Octopus news was canceled due to lack of material. Ninjas in the News and Booze News were similar segments and were also canceled due to lack of material.</p>
<p><b>Fone Free FM / Lil' Fella Radio</b>: Fridays were commonly given to the fans of the show after 10:00 PM and became 'Fone Free FM', where the callers can pontificate on any topic of their choice. The Friday segment had lead to a segment within itself entitled 'Lil' Fella Radio', where younger listeners aged from approximately 10 to 17 report on their point of view of various topics, including movies, music, and video games. Some examples of these shows are: Guererro's Gaming News and Reviews, Seabass' Rap of the Week, Insane Story of the Week and The Rammstein Show. The favorite segments of Oscar and Chad are The Rammstein Show and Seabass' Rap if the Week</p>
<p>The Big O and Dukes Show also features a nightly contest for prize giveaways. The nightly games include:</p>
<p><b>Categories</b>: In this game, callers go head to head with their choice of Oscar or Chad naming members of a category such as Professional Wrestlers and Disney Movies until one of the hosts or the caller gives up.</p>
<p><b>Sports, Drugs and Rock and Roll</b>: In this game a listener plays against Oscar or Chad and names either a Sports Team, Drug or Musical Artist beginning with a random letter until one of them gives up like in Categories.</p>
<p><b>The Four Pillars</b>: This is a complex choice of 8 categories, 4 for each host, totaling 16 questions where the listeners answer the questions in the pillar until all the questions in the pillar are completed. If a caller gets a question wrong another caller can answer the remaining questions in that pillar to win a prize.</p>
<p><b>Cinemagic</b>: In this game Oscar and Chad read lines from some of their favorite movies. Callers then try to guess which movie the lines were from to win a prize.</p>
<p><b>O and D Songs of the Night</b>: This is the least complicated game on the show. Due to the fact that KZON is a talk station, it does not play much music, Because of this Oscar and Chad each play one song during the commercial break. Once both songs are played they ask for a caller to name both songs that were played to win a prize.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_O_and_Dukes_ccb1.html" title="Edit section: Catch Phrases of the Big O and Dukes Show">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Catch Phrases of the Big O and Dukes Show</span></h2>
<p>Big O and Dukes are noted for creating fan involvement with their self described 'Calling Card of The Show' term, 'Ar!'. The pronunciation of the term ranges from a canine like bark to the pirate like growl. Other phrases commonly used include:</p>
<p>'<b>Ciao Ciao'</b>: A reference to Oscar and, in particular, his occasional high maintenance habits. Oscar used Ciao Ciao as a way to say goodbye to his family when he still lived with them.</p>
<p><b>Chad's Title</b>: Chad will frequently embellish or modify his title. He most commonly refers to himself as 'The People's Champion, Chad Dukes', but this has been modified to include other descriptive qualites such as 'Chad Skinny Dukes' during his weight public weight loss challenge, and 'Chad Almonds Dukes' during the Christmas Season.</p>
<p>The show ends with the nightly out script from Chad Dukes of: 'On behalf of myself, The Big O, Drab T Shirt and Emo Gary, we remind you Don't Drink and Drive, wear condoms, and ... Were Rich, Bitch!' and then followed by a sound clip of <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Carrey_1cd5.html" title="Jim Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cable_Guy_7643.html" title="The Cable Guy">The Cable Guy</a> saying "This now concludes our broadcast day, click!"</p>
