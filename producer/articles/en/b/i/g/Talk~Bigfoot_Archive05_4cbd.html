<h2><span class="mw-headline">Patterson film and the "ape suit"</span></h2>
<p>The famous Patterson/Gimlin film of 1967 showing what appears to be a bigfoot has been debunked over the years by critics claiming it is a man in an ape suit; on the other side, proponents claim that if it is a suit, it is better than Hollywood ever came up with. Going from that perspective, critics should consider the following:</p>
<p>1) The Patterson/Gimlin film was made on a shoe-string budget, if it had the backing of anyone to begin bbbbb ioukhwith. This implies the "suit" also was limited in funding.</p>
<p>2) Hollywood came up with two films around the time of the Patterson/Gimlin film: <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_of_the_Apes_683c.html" title="Planet of the Apes">Planet of the Apes</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/s/2001%7E_A_Space_Odyssey_067d.html" title="2001: A Space Odyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>. Both films featured actors in ape costumes, and at the time the budgets levied for the make-up department was enormous. In the sequel to <i>Planet of the Apes</i> (<a href="../../../e/s/c/Escape_from_the_Planet_of_the_Apes_bb42.html" title="Escape from the Planet of the Apes">Escape from the Planet of the Apes</a>) carelessness on the part of the make-up department is clearly seen: in the sauna scene one can see the hem of the ape suit trouser on the Dr Zaius character. The Patterson/Gimlin film should be comparred with what Hollywood came out with at the time.</p>
<p>3) In all Hollywood films up until the 1988 (<a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorillas_in_the_Mist_21b3.html" title="Gorillas in the Mist">Gorillas in the Mist</a>), the distingushing characteristic of an ape suit is the fold in the fabric at various bending points (i.e. shoulder, knee, etc), similar to what one can see on ordinary clothing. <i>Planet of the Apes</i> had the apes wear clothing as part of the costume, in order to hide this defect (this was also used for the <a href="../../../e/w/o/Ewoks.html" title="Ewoks">Ewoks</a> to hide the seams in <a href="../../../r/e/t/Star_Wars%7E_Return_of_the_Jedi_6926.html" title="Star Wars: Return of the Jedi">Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</a>). It should be noted that there is no apparent folding of the fabric on the bigfoot of the Patterson/Gimlin film. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 16:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reason for shooting&#160;?s</span></h2>
<p>While I was moving, listening to <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_To_Coast_AM_7e03.html" title="Coast To Coast AM">Coast To Coast AM</a> 's "Open Lines" show, two subjects reported that a Bigfoot had <i>attacked</i> them, so they opened fire on it with weapons they had, incl. a .410 and a .44 magnum. One hit it in the head, which then drove the monster away. More reports of this nature will surface. Their Sheriff's Office ridiculed them. I'm now in Texas, and it is legal to <i>kill</i> anything threatening those who believe they are threatened by a intruder, be it another human or a monster. In a nutshell, if you think a person or monster is threatening you, you can blow him/her,it away. Someone else asking similar questions may not be so polite. Some will run from it, others will stand and fight. Wikipedians who listen to the radio show <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_To_Coast_AM_7e03.html" title="Coast To Coast AM">Coast To Coast AM</a>, and/or to <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Rense_351f.html" title="Jeff Rense">Jeff Rense</a>'s radio show should keep a eye on this matter. Is this worthy of inclusion to the article in relation to how different people's reactions to this thing vary&#160;? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 05:26, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm only stating that when this thing appears to people, people will react to it in various ways. Some will run from it, some will stand and fight it for various reasons, such as trying to collect it for a monetary bounty (<i>allegedly</i>, a FL. University placed a <b>$1M - U.S.</b> Bounty on the <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skunk_Ape_3513.html" title="Skunk Ape">Skunk Ape</a> after some Bigshot tourists have seen one), to prove it exists. I'm NOT trying to hurt anyone's feelings at all, just stating what people will do when confronted by this thing. Just stating what a person will do if and when confronted by this thing, a alien, UFO, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>As for Loren Coleman, if he is <i>really</i> on Wikipedia, he <i>has</i> to follow Wikipedia protocol, just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Again, I'm NOT trying to offend anyone at all, only stating what people will do when they encounter one or more of these things. Can it be stated that, " When people encounter this creature, some will react by running from it, while some will stand and fight, trying to obtain alleged bounties, to prove it exists, to chase it off of their property, to protect their lives, etc."&#160;? I have talked to these people myself in places like <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fouke%2C_Arkansas_a1cf.html" title="Fouke, Arkansas">Fouke</a> and in <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana.html" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, home of the Honey Island Monster. Some will run for it, while some will fight. I have a cousin who reported that one of these things chased a juvenile subject as the subject attempted to evade the said creature. He was not armed, but his family was. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 17:26, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Definatly not. That's information about other people, not bigfoot. Either way, it's not really encyclopedic (people will react to things how they react). --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 22:12, 16 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is how people react to this thing. I <i>am</i> in a area in which people <i>will</i> shoot to kill. Last night, someone killed a burglar when this person committed a home invasion. The story is in the local paper. That is why someone in a "Bigfoot suit" is asking for a <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin_Award_2e81.html" title="Darwin Award">Darwin Award</a>, and explains why some people will shoot at Bigfoot. Can this be stated:"<b>Weapons Use</b> Some people will, when confronted by this thing, will attempt to kill it, maybe to collect a bounty that may be in effect, and/or for self protection, to protect property and loved ones."&#160;? I have met these people, they carry loaded guns with them, even when they go to the "john","loo", the can, etc. I've seen some cases on some of the TOP Bigfoot sites citing personnel shooting at this thing, incl. Cryptomundo and the BFRO. One case mentions that some hunters thought they killed a <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear.html" title="Bear">bear</a>, then went to have a look at the kill, and found out they nailed a Bigfoot, then there is the alleged kill made by a "Bugs", who called <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Bell_b332.html" title="Art Bell">Art Bell</a>, claiming to have killed a Bigfoot family. Then there is the report I've heard on a <i>recent</i> <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_To_Coast_AM_7e03.html" title="Coast To Coast AM">Coast To Coast AM</a> "Open Lines" broadcast in which a armed party had shot at a Bigfoot that was attacking them and their truck. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 18:50, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I believe there is a single law either in Oregon or Northern California making it a crime to shoot and kill a Bigfoot, enacted in the 1970's, and I think it's a local or county ordinance (I could be wrong in this). However, it should be noted that officially (and I do mean officially!) bigfoot does not exist, and there are no real federal or state laws that would cause someone to be charged with a felony or misdemeanor if they shoot one. Unfortunately, science demands a specimen on the disecting table before it's recognised as a species, meaning one has to be killed...and killing one for that purpose is kind of repugnant. So, if anyone goes out to the forest to find one, pack that gun for safety...but try to shoot it with that video camera instead. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 16:16, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As stated, people will try to bring one in, mainly for the known accumalated <b>$20 M</b> Bounty. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 07:12, 28 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This comes from people, colleges and the like posting all manner of bounties, all in a effort to kill a Bigfoot and bring in a body to claim any bounties and fame for bringing one in. How would "YOU" like to be the one who killed one, brought it in to a major college, like Harvard to collect any bounties, and fame, to be known as "the person who PROVED that Bigfoot is <i>real</i>&#160;? "You'll" make a fortune in commercial endorsements, especially those launched by sporting goods/outdoor outfitters such as "Sportsman's Guide", as in this:"I used a .410, wore this Goretex Jacket, used Coleman Products...", etc.,"when I brought in the <i>real</i> Bigfoot. Now I'm after a Lizard Man that is haunting the Carolinas.". <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 07:28, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The college gets the body, the "bounty hunter" gets to make a literal fortune, later on, laws are passed to protect the creature.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re:Law in Bigfoot Article</span></h2>
<p>I have talked to law enforcement personnel about people hunting this thing. Can it be stated that:" The police, other law enforcement does <i>not</i> want people hunting this thing, since someone can get hurt, even killed, either by a hunting party looking for a bounty, and/or that this thing, if it exists, will hurt, if not kill them."&#160;? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 05:19, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A <i>major</i> reason that law enforcement does <i>not</i> want people hunting this thing, is that criminals are using remote areas to grow <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuanna.html" title="Marijuanna">pot</a> and making <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methamphetamine.html" title="Methamphetamine">meth</a>, and will kill intruders, have been known to use <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booby_traps.html" title="Booby traps">booby traps</a> and/or guards to deter law enforcement and inquisitive civilians.

<dd>No, Homo Erectus is too advanced and couldn't be the ancestor of a less advanced creature. Understand that mammals change in size over time...examples include the horse and even modern humans. The average European male in the 1500's was about 5'2" and that average is much higher now, only 500 years later. The only potential ancestor for Bigfoot is Paranthropus boisei or <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paranthropus_robustus.html" title="Paranthropus robustus">Paranthropus robustus</a>...they could easily have become larger over time. The fossil record does not support any evidence of Gigantopithecus or the Paranthropus beyond about 700,000 years ago...so unless there are new finds to yet be unearthed (which is probable), there is no fossil lineage to the modern Bigfoot, hence the argument by some that Bigfoot is an alien species. The only real proof we have is that Bigfoot is simply a myth, and that the sightings are not anything more than people either misinterpreting what they see (ie, it was actually a bear) or they are lying, or they just have zero knowledge of zoology.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 22:00, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The creatures are depicted to be the hight of a small building, have fangs instead if teeth, extremely strong, extremely agile.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">First sentence</span></h2>
<p>My proposed sentence didn't last long. Here it was: <i>"Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is a legendary creature, that some people believe is also real."</i></p>
<p>For the record I think it is highly unlikely that Bigfoot really exists. However it would be very cool if he did.</p>
<p>I can see that a lot of thought and work has gone into the opening sentence of this article: <i>"Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is the popular name of a phenomenon which many people believe is a real creature but many people do not."</i> However I do have a couple of problems with it.</p>
<p>For one thing the word <i>"phenomenon"</i>, although a very good word, does not give a clear impression of its intended meaning. This might discourage some readers rather than making them eager to read more, as a good opening sentence should.</p>
<p>For another is it necessary to bring in the non-believers so soon? I think it is the believers who make Bigfoot a notable subject, not the non-believers. Anyway the non-believers have lots of chances to make their points later on in the article. I think in the third paragraph the negative opinion of most scientists is cited.</p>

<dd>New to this discussion and Wikipedia, but the "urban legend" struck me as slightly out of tune to Bigfoot. How about "Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is believed by some to be an ape-like creature, but most people consider it to not exist in reality but to be a creature based in legend and folklore"? That would leave open, yet not explicitly stated, the possibility of autosuggestion, hoaxing etc. BaikinMan 14:35, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That sounds good to me. Besides the "urban" part Bigfoot does not really seem to be a "legend"; that is there is no story--people just "see" him, or his footprints, etc. However I do not want to fight with anyone over the opening sentence. The best way to improve the article, IMO, would be to find some more published debunkers and post their views with citations. That would help balance the article. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 23:52, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, seems the urban legend ref is a problem, so how about <i><b>Bigfoot</b>, also known as <b>Sasquatch</b>, is believed by some to be an <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">ape</a>-like <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptid.html" title="Cryptid">cryptid</a> and by others the product of vivid imagination</i>.

<dl>
<dd>Sounds good to me, with one minor suggestion. This is the first time I've heard the word "cryptid," and I don't know how commonly known it is. Linking it explains it, but would it be inappropriate to put a brief description/definition of cryptid in parentheses in the Bigfoot sentence? <i><b>Bigfoot</b>, also known as <b>Sasquatch</b>, is believed by some to be an <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">ape</a>-like <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptid.html" title="Cryptid">cryptid</a> (an animal presumed extinct or hypothetical species of animal) and by others the product of imagination</i>. It leaves the link intact, but gives lets those who aren't in the mood to follow sidelinks to know what is being talked about. I'd also agree with Steve Dufour on the elimination of "vivid" as POV BaikinMan 13:21, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No way. Intros exist to give a concise definition of the subject. This particular intro is intended to define biggie, not cryptid. Links exist to take readers to an article about something they either don't know about (or want further information about), in this case <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptid.html" title="Cryptid">cryptid</a>. If we explained every word in every intro then most intros would be bigger than the rest of the article. Unworkable. Yes, there have been intros to some articles that were magnificent examples of verbosity, but they lowered the standing of writing on Wiki, not enhanced it. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 21:30, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>If you check out the <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">ape</a> article you will see that humans, near human ancestors, chimps, and gorillas are all members of the same biological family. So humans are "ape-like" and apes are "human-like". I think that almost all Bigfoot believers would consider him to also be a member of this family. All of the theoretical suggestions for his identity are members (except for the minority opinion that he is an ET). "Ape-like" is therefore 100% correct but I wonder if it gives the right picture to the average reader.

<p>Sasquatch is a real men</p>
<p>History: Dr. Walter Langkowski was born and raised in British Columbia, Canada. He attended Pennsylvania State University on a football scholarship. During his freshman year Langkowski met Bruce Banner, who was then himself there, but who would later become noted for his work in gamma ray research and infamous for becoming the monstrous Hulk as a result of overexposure to gamma radiation. Although Langkowski only knew Banner for one semester, Banner had a tremendous influence on him, and Langkowski decided to enter the field of gamma radiation research himself. Langkowski pursued independent studies in the area even during his three years as a professional linebacker for the Green Bay Packers. Langkowski's football career made him a millionaire. When the fact that Bruce Banner was the Hulk became public knowledge, Langkowski conceived a new goal for his life. He entered a graduate program in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and rapidly earned his Ph.D. He was then appointed to the faculty of McGill University in Montreal. Since leaving his football career, Langkowski had accumulated all the information he could find on the Hulk and on other human beings who had been transformed through exposure to gamma radiation. Langkowski intended to recreate, under controlled circumstances, the conditions which produced the Hulk. Langkowski spent over a million dollars of his own money on his research into this area, and finally applied to the Canadian government for additional funding. James MacDonald Hudson, who organized a group of superhuman agents for the Canadian government's Department H, both arranged for the funding and procured an isolated laboratory near the Arctic Circle for Langkowski. During a leave of absence from McGill University, Langkowski designed and constructed a means to generate gamma radiation bombardments similar to those which had created the Hulk, but under laboratory conditions. It was because of the potential danger of radiation leakage that Langkowski performed his experiment in self-transformation in the isolated laboratory north of the Arctic Circle. There he used the equipment he had designed to bombard himself with gamma radiation, and was transformed into the ten-foot-tall, superhumanly powerful creature which went on a savage rampage for hours before finally reverting to human form. One of Hudson's agent, Snowbird, found Langkowski in human form lying in the snow after his rampage, brought him to a hospital, and summoned Hudson. Another of Hudson's agents, Dr. Michael Twoyoungmen, asked Snowbird, who was herself able to change shape, to teach Langkowski how to maintain his normal personality and intelligence in his bestial form. This teaching proved to be entirely successful for some time. Langkowski called himself "Sasquatch" when he was in his bestial form, "sasquatch" being the Canadian word for Canada's legendary "Bigfoot" creature, which he resembled. Once he had learned how to maintain his normal human personality and intelligence as Sasquatch, and had undergone a period of training in Department H's team of apprentice superhuman agents, Beta and Gamma Flight, Langkowski became a member of James Hudson's fully trained team of superhuman agents, Alpha Flight. Langkowski remained with the team even after Alpha Flight ceased for a time to be affiliated with Canadian government and after the death of its founder, James Hudson. Langkowski divided his time between adventuring with Alpha Flight and Teaching at Simon Fraser University in Canada. He became the lover of another Alpha Flight member, Aurora, and is responsible for the alteration in her superhuman powers. Langkowski attributed the fact that as Sasquatch he was not green like most other superhuman beings transformed by gamma radiation to the presence of heavy sunspot radiation interference at the time of his initial transformation, manifesting itself as an Aurora Borealis. However, Langkowski was wrong in believing that he had gained his Sasquatch form due to gamma radiation. His equipment that he used in the experiment in the Arctic laboratory had actually unleashed for a fraction of a second enough physical energy to sunder the mystical barrier separating Earth from the other dimensional Realm of the Great Beasts, enemies of the gods of native Canadian mythology. A mystic link was formed between Langkowski and the Great beast called Tanaraq, enabling Langkowski, without knowing what he was really doing, to take on Tanaraq's form and control it. But with each "transformation" of Langkowski into Sasquatch, Tanaraq's personality grew stronger. Eventually, Tanaraq's mind was able to supplant Langkowski's personality whenever Langkowski, in Sasquatch's form, felt intense anger or pain. Finally, Tanaraq took full control of Sasquatch. Snowbird, realizing what had happened, transformed herself into a being like Sasquatch, and tore out Tanarq'a heart, killing Langkowski's physical form, which reverted to normal in dying. Six members of Alpha Flight journeyed into the other dimensional realm of the Great Beasts and recovered Langkowski's soul, intending to return it to his body. Langkowski's body had mystically been crystallized to preserve it, but the body entirely crumbled away at the mystic site it was left at while the Alpha Flight members were recovering Langkowski's soul. So, instead, Michael Twoyoungmen, then known as Shaman, projected Langkowski's soul into the robotic body that its inventor, Roger Bochs, called Box. Langkowski thus remained alive in Box while he and Bochs sought for a new body for Langkowski's soul to inhabit. They finally located a nearly mindless humanoid form existing at an interdimensional nexus. Langkowski abandoned Box and his spirit was projected to that nexus, where he discovered that the body was that of the Hulk. Unwilling to take over the body belonging to his old friend Bruce Banner, Langkowski seemingly allowed his spirit to vanish from the mortal plane. But the present location of Langkowski's spirit is unknown, and it may be that the people of Earth have not seen the last of Walter Langkowski. Langkowski's spirit, however, found the shrunken physical body of Smart Alec who had been placed in the otherdimensional void accessible by Shaman's medicine bag. Langkowski thus returned to reality, in time to save his fellow Alpha Flight members from the villain Pestilence, who had possessed Snowbird's deceased body (in its Sasquatch/Great Beast form), by Langkowski himself briefly reentering the Box robot. Langkowski then took over Snowbird's form, transforming back to human form, albeit a female one. Langkowski, nicknamed "Wanda," remained with Alpha Flight for several adventures, unable to rekindle his relationship with Aurora or access his personal fortune since he was believed dead. Height: (as Langkowski) 6 ft. 4 in., (as Sasquatch) 10 ft. Weight: (as Langkowski) 245 lbs, (as Sasquatch) 2,000 lbs. Eyes: (as Langkowski) Blue, (as Sasquatch) Red Hair: (as Langkowski) Blond, (as Sasquatch) Orange Strength Level: As Sasquatch, Langkowski possesses vast, superhuman strength. Sasquatch could lift (press) about 70 tons. As Box Langkowski could lift (press) roughly 85 tons. Known Superhuman Powers: Walter Langkowski could, by an act of will, take on a physical form that was a mystical melding of his own and that of the Great Beast Tanaraq Langkowski was not aware that he was mystically melding with Tanaraq, but instead believed that he was changing his form due to the mutagenic effects of gamma radiation on his body. By another act of will, Langkowski could change from his superhuman form back into his human one. Originally, after the initial transformation itself, in order to transform himself into Sasquatch, Langkowski needed to achieved a meditative state (through use of a mantra, or self hypnotic chant), thereby producing the concentration necessary to effect the mystical transformation process. The necessary concentration was initially difficult to achieve. However, after many months of practice, Langkowski could effect the transformations with relative ease, without needing to achieve a mantic state. Langkowski learned to maintain his normal human intelligence and personality when in the form of Sasquatch, but the mind of Tanaraq grew increasingly strong in time, and finally took full control of Sasquatch's body on Earth. Besides his superhuman strength, Sasquatch had a large degree of resistance to injury, as well. The limits of this resistance are not known, but he has, for instance, withstood armor-piercing machine gun fire. Sasquatch's leaping ability was less than that of the Hulk's, but the exact extent of Sasquatch's leaping ability has yet to be determined. In human form Langkowski was nearsighted, but his vision was sharpened as Sasquatch so that he did not require aids for seeing in that form. As Sasquatch Langkowski was covered with thick orange fur which gave him great immunity to cold, but which proved uncomfortable in tropical climates. Abilities: Dr. Walter Langkowski is one of the world's foremost experts on the effects of radiation on human physiology. He is a well-trained athlete and had above average (but not superhuman) strength even in human</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Possible Correction</span></h2>
<p>In this article, there is a quote from Robert Michael Pyle's book Where Bigfoot Walks: Crossing the dark divide. It says, "Tracks commonly measure fifteen to twenty inches or more in length. They have five toes, a double-muscle ball, and a wide arch" (Pyle, 3). I happen to have this book in my house, and it says instead, "Tracks commonly measure fifteen to eighteen inches or more in length. They have five toes, a double muscle-ball, and a low arch." I don't know if this is simply a typo in my (well, actually, it's not mine: it's from the public library) copy of the book, or a typo in this article, but somebody with the book as well may check in their copy to be sure.

<p>Last week there was a this guy who was picking up dead animals on the road and he had a bunch of dead animals in the back of his pickup truck, and there was also a a deer carcass, moments later, he felt the truck shaking and as he had turned around and THERE IT WAS!!! A BIGFOOT!!!! with pointy ears and it was a big hairy scary monster. If you don't believe me then watch the channel 4 news!</p>

<dd>It could have been a bear but it wasn't. How many bears with pointy ears have you seen? Also it was standing on two legs. Bears do not do that unless they are pissed off or are in a circus. Also there were humoungous gig-a-nti-normous footprints and that is the sign of big foot because he has BIG FEET.</dd>

<dd>Thats ok but it has been all over the news and the bigfoot researchers are here and our town leader of the Town of Erin has told everyone not to let their kids go out into the woods this year to pick morel mushrooms because while you are not watching them they could get eaten by bigfoot!!!! and it is a scientific fact that bigfoot likes morel mushrooms that is probably why he was in the area. In fact just the previous week there were two kids that lived in the house by Holy Hill and those two kids were jumping up and down on their trampoline and their house it at the egde of the woods, they saw a big hairy monster and it scared them really really bad they went to tell their mom and their mom didn't believe them.

<dd>I've Read that there have only been 2 reports of Bigfoot attacking humans ever, and only one ever of someone being killed by Bigfoot, and that that killing was not verifiable. Plus, most Sasquatch reports show that Sasquatch is quite shy, simply observing humans from a safe distance until he himself is seen. I find it unlikely that Sasquatch would hunt down and eat children. <a href="../../../n/i/n/User%7ENineteenninetyfour_e91f.html" title="User:Nineteenninetyfour">Nineteenninetyfour</a> 16:19, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This article</span></h2>
<p>This article needs alot of cleaning and sweeping up. This person whose name is Erik Jon Beckjord has seemed to make more enemies for than friends through Wikipedia and many other websites where he is espousing his theory on how Bigfoot and the Lochness Monster are transporting through dimensional time worm holes. And I think the evidence he cites to support this is to say that no one has ever found Bigfoot. If Bigfoot does infact exist. It might be reasonable in which to conclude that not everyone who happens and chance upon a visual encounter is carrying a digital camera with them to take snap shots. I think the only three peices of evidence in existence so far are the Patterson and Gimlin footage from Bluff Creek Columbia from October of 1967. I think this issue is still hotly debated today among alot of people. If that is infact a man who is inside of a suit. The muscle mass and stride and swinging of arms suggest the most expert of hoaxes. The second footage comes from the guy whose name I cannot clearly remember right now. But the video footage of whatever he shot looks awful damn suspicious even when you are standing 200 feet away. The footage of what is rumoured to be a Bigfoot running across what I beleive is Chopoka Lake in Washington on my west coast. That to me looks ridicolous because of the fact whatever is being filmed running across the open field was videographed from what looks to be more than a mile or two miles away. The figure running across the screen looks like a literal small blip or a pixel dot running across the screen. If there are a rumoured 2000 to 6000 of the cryptoid hominids running around the United States. It seems that someone would have by now photographed one. I am sure there are untold millons of hoaxes proven and unproven which has greatly damaged the integrity in the existence of Bigfoot. But something is out there making these tracks. Something is out there and is emitting a foul odor and stench from a distance. Something is leaving foot prints in the ground with dermal ridges in the ground. Something out there is making loud and guttural shreiks and screams not easily common and identfiable to other animals. I grant you that people in large collectives lie. But if you accept that 4999 people are lying to you and one of them is telling the truth. Well one person telling the truth poses a problem. I would like to see this article get cleaned up. I would like to see cited sources that support the existence for and against Bigfoot. The United States is huge and loaded with techonology. But with all of that square acreage there are still places that human cannot go. I would really like to see this article get cleaned up more. Bigfoot is one of my favorite subjects. I wish someone could come forward with damning and undeniable evidence that something is out there and spark renewed interest in all of this. I would like to see all good spirited and fair minded Wikipedians clean up this article and to keep a disruptive influence like Beckjord out who esposes crazy theories.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Creature in Patterson film has rectangular eye slit</span></h2>
<p>I used to job coach for a young man diagnosed with autism. He was so high functioning in so many different ways that I often found myself questioning the diagnosis. But he did struggle with some social skills. One bit of advice I gave him was to look at the eye slit area. Not stare at someone's eyes, but the whole area surrounding the eyes, which is very rich in emotional content.</p>
<p>So, please look at the eye slit area of the creature in the Patterson film. And how natural does it seem to you?</p>

<dd>Coming in looking at this from a mostly outsider viewpoint (I only have the article watchlisted for anti-vandalism purposes, as I do many, many other articles). I think that the "Physical Evidence" section (along with the "Audio and visual evidence" section) could be chopped out into a separate article fairly easily. "Evidence of Bigfoor" or "Bigfoot Evidence" or something along those lines. Similarly "Formal studies of Bigfoot" looks to be another section that could be moved out to it's own article.</dd>
<dd>In general, sections can continue to be moved out, and <b>short</b> summaries written in their place, until the article reaches a much more managible size. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 16:09, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps Evidence Purported to Support Bigfoot's Existence would work. Granted, it's a little wordy, but...</p>
<p>Looking over the article as is, there seems little to be *added* so much as moved: we've got the dermal ridges, handprints, the PG film, the Gaussian curve, recorded screams, the deformed Bossberg tracks, the Skookum cast, etc. Maybe I could find some stuff on feces and hairs of unknown origin, as well as the other one or two bf films yet to be completely dismissed (the so-called "Freeman Footage" &amp; "Memorial Day Footage.") Additionally, I know there have been found in the Pacific Northwest Native American carvings that unambiguously depict simian faces and forms. (I'm not sure off-handedly if the article mentions these. They certainly raise *my* eyebrows.) My original thought was that perhaps the "evidence" could be described and touted with quotes by "experts" who've come to accept the creature's existence; then, immediately below, point-by-point, we follow up with "Skeptical Responses," whereby we counterbalance the supporters' voices with the rebuttals of non-believers. Actually, it's the latter of the two that's going to be the more difficult because, in essence, the skeptical thesis is "since there's no corpse, all 'evidence' can safely be discarded." Anyway, I guess it could go something like this:</p>
<p><b>Purported evidence</b></p>
<p>1.)The PG film</p>
<p>Pro: Krantz maintained no way it could be a man in a suit, blah blah blah, etc.</p>
<p>Con: Bob so-and-so recently admitted being that man, etc.</p>
<p>2.)Dermal ridges</p>
<p>Pro: Some important fingerprint guy claims it'd be nearly impossible to duplicate artificially.</p>
<p>Con: All such footprints were discovered by a single individual with a history of hoaxing.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>

<dd>I would add specific photos to illustrate. Like the footprints (including the "club foot" print); a comparisson of the Gimlin film to a pic from <i>Planet of the Apes</i> (both were made at the same time allegedly by the same man); hair evidence and who has it; evidence for <i>Gigantopithicus</i>...anything to make the article look good. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 03:09, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Okay. Well, I've got to say: this might develop slowly. I am, for one, a Wikipedia-editing newbie, so I'm still sort of getting used to the tricks of the trade. I *do* know the reputable sites ("reputable" being a sort of elastic term when we delve into this subject matter, of course) and own some literature by the late Dr. Krantz (probably the first academian to so vocally express his acceptance of the animal's existence, as well as the largest proponent of the validity of the club-footed tracks, and perhaps the first to suggest Giganto as the most likely suspect in the matter [but, just between you, me, and the wall, a bit of a grump: I actually called him long-distance one day back in high school to ask bf-related questions, and he didn't seem too pleased by the intrusion. Ha! Memories...], as well as issues of <i>Skeptic</i> covering the matter. Of the two "skeptical" mags out there, <i>Skeptic</i> is probably the fairest in its assessment of such phenomena; then again, CSICOP's <i>Skeptical Inquirer</i>, of all publications, wrote an article a good while back reviewing that <i>The Making of Bigfoot</i> book by Greg Long that claimed to blow open the story of how the PG film was phony, who was involved, etc., and whoever wrote the review basically said that, while bigfoot doesn't exist, Long's story doesn't hold up to scrutiny, either. The latest respectable book on the subject of bf in general, released just last year, is Jeff Meldrum's <i>Bigfoot Meets Science</i>, which I saw at Border's for close to $30. Uh...I don't think so. Perhaps I could find it used and cheaper somewhere online. Anyway, I suppose I could attempt to lay the rough groundwork for this, initially, and we could go from there. Someone tell me, though: is the basic idea to cut &amp; paste the evidence info from the original article, take it to this new one, and then rewrite/expand on it?

<p>I've done the basic move, as people seem to be in a "Let's do it" mode, but noone seemed to be steping up to do the actual move.&#160;:) A few things are still needed: 1) A short summary in this article, and 2) an intro over at <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence_regarding_Bigfoot_1db1.html" title="Evidence regarding Bigfoot">Evidence regarding Bigfoot</a>, the new home. I'm not the one to do either, as that's not my strength. I dropped the word "Physical" from the proposed names, as I moved a lot of stuff that was evidence, but not "Physical" evidence. IMHO, at this point, further discussion of the name of the new article, if people want to rename it, and of major revisions of the information, should now move over to the talk page of the new article. The old article is still large, so I'm going to at least chop out the Formal Studies section as well, as that's fairly well self-contained IMHO. We're down to 41K with the latest revision, and removing Formal Studies should bring it down into the mid to low 30s, which is getting to be a much nicer size. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 17:48, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Umm. I would not call what has just been placed back in a "short" summary.

If someone thinks they can do it faster and/or better, though...go ahead. Also, I changed the heading "Bigfoot sightings" (or whatever it was) to "Bigfoot sightings <b>of note</b>" because, as it was, one skimming the article not paying a lot of attention and/or not being very familiar with the subject might take the former version too literally and believe that these twenty or so sightings were/are the only ones in history. (Oh, and maybe the Evidence page could be entitled "Purported Physical and <b>Anecdotal</b> Evidence of Bigfoot's Existence." I mean, what else <b>is</b> there besides those two types? [Then again, who said, "Anecdotes do not equal evidence"? Michael Shermer? Maybe he was quoting someone else.])Massofspikes 01:31, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why Always "Blurry" When Photographed?</span></h2>
<p>Someone in one of the older talk archives was asking why bf was always "blurry" when photographed, I guess tongue-in-cheek intimating that the animal doesn't exist. Two things you have to remember, though, when it comes to pictures purported to be of bigfoot:</p>
<p>(1.) From the reading I've done in books and at sites like BFRO, your typical encounter involves someone with little interest in bigfoot nor any knowledge of the animal other than its reputation as folkloric monster that doesn't actually exist...in other words, someone who certainly never intended to run into one as he/she strolled through the woods; also, the encounters are over and done in a matter of seconds, with the supposed creature ambling off elsewhere and the person having the sighting spending those valuable seconds trying to integrate into his/her worldview what's taking place (which is how most of us would react, I'd imagine). So, even if someone had the presence of mind to reach for a camera and get off a shot within the small window of opportunity presented, it'd probably be expected that it not be of the best quality.</p>
<p>Also, (2.) there *have* been taken relatively clear pictures supposedly of bigfoot, at which skeptics paradoxically scoff because it's TOO in-focus and therefore MUST represent a hoax. (Say someone, by some miracle, took a clear photo of a sasquatch sitting on a log just with the ease and calm of someone taking a picture of a hiking buddy doing the same, wouldn't most people's reaction be, "*Snort* Yeah, right"?) It's a real catch-22. Besides, in this age, photographic "evidence" of sasquatch is almost useless because any picture of just about ANYTHING can be enshrouded in reasonable doubt given all the advanced graphics programs out there. Even a video can be brushed off as the product of some fun-loving FX guys with too much time on their hands and a really expensive suit. About the only kind of video I can see being taken seriously is one in which the "creature" on film is doing something extremely difficult--if not close to impossible--to replicate with FX costumery: giving birth, maybe.</p>

(One person joked that the pictures weren't blurry, but that it's bigfoot itself that's blurry.) A disclaimer at the top of the that *particular* talk page warned against editing it because it was now archived, but to go to the most recent talk page, instead. Seemed like I was just following directions. I wasn't the person who originally used a talk page to raise the issue; I was merely responding to it months later. I'm not sure why that--or my "point"--is difficult to "get." Massofspikes 16:46, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I suppose that the next time if/when this happens, I'll just personally message the poster in question so this sort of misunderstanding won't arise.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changed the layout</span></h2>
<p>I've done a layout change for the entire article, including some changed to sentence structure and word editing. What the article needed was a flow of thought throughout, because previously the arrangement suggested that subsections were simply thrown into the mix without anything coherent (there may be some of that remaining).</p>
<p>The layout I chose was to arrange the article first: with regard for bigfoot as an animal, arranging the facts for the animal in the proper position on the page, followed by second: that part of the article which describes both the pros and the cons for the animal's existence. The lead paragraph at the top had to be changed drastically; it was too-weighty, had too much wording, and the whole had to be reduced to the simplest terms possible...and that is to introduce the animal to the reader while providing a brief statement for or against the animal's existence.</p>
<p>Now it needs some good pictures to illustrate. Tracks, Native American art, any photos of the animal, etc. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 19:28, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no problems with the general rewrite, but I don't like what you did with the Evidnece section. I just got done moving the bulk of the evidence to it's own article, to cut down on the size of this one. IMHO what is needed in this one is a (at most) one paragraph summary of the evidence. If people want any more than that, the new article is prominently linked. What has just been placed back in is, IMHO, far too much detail, including a couple of sections that are returned completely from the material just moved out. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 19:51, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vandalism</span></h2>
<p>If you check the history page, there is an individual who got in this article and did as much damage as he wanted, several times over, and this included other pages as well. He also got the "dreaded" last warning tag...last week, which never stoped his behavior this week. We need administrators who can make these last warnings stick. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 12:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A few things about blockings. First, they are preventative, not puntative. They are used to prevent future actions, not to punish for past actions. So, once vandalism has stopped, as the vandal in question did last night, the need for blocking lessens. Also, the vandalism is coming from an IP address. Blocking of IP addresses is handled quite differently than blockings of accounts. Mostly because IP addresses shift and change. With a few specific exceptions, we do not indefinitely block IP addresses. The IP address being used by person A today may end up being used by person B tomorrow. So, also because of this likelihood of IP addresses shifting people, any warnings, especially "final" warnings, need to be recent. Like withing the last 24 to 48 hours. Anything beyond that, and you really cannot safely assume that earlier warnings were given to the same person.</dd>
<dd>There's also the fact that not all articles are being watched by an admin all the time. So, if you are not getting admin assistence, the next step is to bring the situation to the attention of the admins. The best way to do that for vandalism situations like this is to use <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. This is a page specifically for reporting of vandalism for admin action. Lots of admins watch it. Read the instructions there carefully. Do be aware, if the vandal is an IP address, and has not been recently warned as I describe above, the report is likely to be removed without blocking, as the warnings do need to be given. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 13:56, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By making the "last warnings stick" I mean't that sometimes these warnings get nowhere. This individual is an example in which he was warned about vandalizing, blocked for a short period of time, unblocked, vandalized again, warned again...and yes he will be blocked again only to have it removed and the pages vandalized all over again. I've also seen worse than what he did from other individuals, and on their user-talk pages I've seen enough last warning tags to choke a horse (and yes, that is an administrator problem). Now, if you truly want these blocks to be preventative, then we do just that. We work with the administrators to ensure that these preventative blocks stick by ensuring the vandals do not have the access needed to damage the pages. It's pretty simple. They damage one day; they get blocked for one day. They're back doing it the following day, they get blocked for a week, then a month, then 6 months, then a year. You have to look at it from the writers and editors point of view. We've invested too much time and effort to make Wikipedia work, and we cannot afford to have some clown come in and damage what we've put here just because he thinks it's funny. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 14:42, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've placed a proposal for changes to policy on blocking on the dispute/talk page. I don't expect an immediate change, but I do want the subject discussed among admin staff to see if it could be implemented. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarajou_9cea.html" title="User:Carajou">Carajou</a> 15:07, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
