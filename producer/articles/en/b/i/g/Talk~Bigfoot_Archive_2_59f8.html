<p>M.L., your arguments are atrocious, and worse than that you miss the fundamental point: Wikipedia is not the place for editors to try to argue in favor or against something, as that's a major violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. Your little stream of consciousness flight of logical fallacies cannot go in the article, and it's annoying as all heck for you to still be trying to support it when the relevant policies (NPOV, <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">WP:No original research</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>, Wikipedia is not a soapboax, etc. have repeatedly been pointed out to you. No offense, but it seems like we are dealing with a 12 year old here, since repeated explanations go completely over your head and you are so caught up in how your argument twists and turns that you don;t get that it's completely irrelevant either way.

<dd><i>"just stating what people do when they see this thing."</i> No... those links just show that some people who most people never heard of recommends that people shoot Bigfoot if it does exist and if they happen to see it. Those links in no way support a statement that people actually do see it or would shoot at it if they did, or that that that means people wouldn't hoax things. And most hoaxes aren't people in suits anyway, it's just someone lying when they claim to have seen it. If nobody else can confirm the story, why dress up in a suit and run around on the property of some alleged trigger-happy Bigfoot believer who has read Krantz? that's a lot of work when it;s easier to just tell a silly story.</dd>

<p>No. Not gullible at all. Right now, I'm facing a war that I can't stop without Wikipedia's help. see the "WAFE" referral below.

<p>I do NOT coddle terrorists, I'm here to contribute. I'm a evidence kind of guy. As to Bigfoot, have yet to see one <i>personally</i>. I am also a field investigator, but I do <i>not</i> post anything that will be in violation of Wiki protocol at all, thus why I Google Search everything FIRST, then, place what I find on the discussion page for other Wikis to examine, so that I don't <i>even</i> remotely mess up a article at all. Only upon Wiki approval will what I find will go into this article, given the nature of this article. User:DreamGuy(Forgive the formalities), is this a good idea, so as to prevent article disruption with nonsense, of which I do not coddle either ? Again, I'm here to contribute. User:DreamGuy, I am considering creating a article about mythical weapons and armor, and list examples, such as Minerva's/Athena's shield, which will kill all living things, because it has Medusa's severed head on it. Will you assist me on this, given your expertise on mythical related matters ? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 04:03, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>User:Beckjord, I have to follow Wiki protocol. No more, no less. I have not lied to you, will not lie to you now. I said MY E-MAIL IS OUT, <b>NOT' <i>that I had no E-mail. I had it examined.

I an currently on the Yahoo system, and it is known to foul up royally. I am indeed your friend. Its these "call to arms" that are making a mess of things for everybody. You, on the other hand, have progressed very well. Call off this war, and initiate no more of these wars, I'll give you a site that does permit original reserch, <b>BUT</b> you have to be <i>extremely</i> civil at all times while you're on it, and while you're on here. As a symbol of "Good Faith", I'll give you a really strange Bigfoot link, and go to UFO Casebook to see a entry concerning a entity that appeared out of nowhere, was glowing like a firefly on steroids. It is in the main(center) listings on the site, and tell you, after you go to my User Talk page about two incidents that has taken place near Shreveport,LA. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 09:30, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Well, I found the results <a href="http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=6830" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=6830" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and they are apparently hairs from a <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bison.html" title="Bison">Bison</a>.

<dd>There are lots and lots of cases like that where DNA tests showed normal animal hair, often bears, goats, etc. Apparently the Bigfoot true believers don't want people to know that. Furthermore, I find the claims of the one study mentioned here that no match could be made highly suspect. It was made before DNA testing was routine, so it's doubtdul they did any test that could stand up to scrutiny by today's standards. The reference in the article covers up it's age, and people today assume hair is tested for DNA when it is tested so would believe that those tests had been done in this case -- as in fact one of our pro-Bigfoot people here claimed on this talk page when I pointed out that all DNA tests that have been done show real, known animals. These sorts of things need to be in there, or else there is a strong bias by ommission. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 02:32, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm one of those that will not rule out the existence of such a creature. There is simply no physical proof that is accepted by the scientific community however. Basically, if they were to exist, there would have to be something close to at least 100 of them scattered across the U.S. Pacific Northwest and western Canada in order to maintain themselves through normal reproductive patterns known in all Great Apes and Humans, of which, apparently, this creature is most likely associated with biologically. Simply put...there has yet to be anything tangible in the form of physical evidence whereby we could honestly say, well, yes, here is proof of a previously unknown primate in North America. The section on skeletal remains is weak for the disbelievers as it is extremely rare for even an outdoorsman such as myself to ever stumble upon the remains of any animal. One of the reasons the great apes are so endangered in Africa is due to their relatively low reproductive capabilities and species thinning due to habitat loss and poaching. Taking all other factors out of the equation aside from species maintainability and the lack of physical evidence...the rest of the information probably should be covered for the sake of being exhaustive, but they do little to help the supportors or the disbelievers because they tend to cancel each other out.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 03:27, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>bison hair</p>
<p>No bigfoot researcher made any big deal of this, since the hairs were not yet tested. If you have questions on suhc things, ask Beckjord, who is here. The best hair analysis was done by three scientists, and no further need have been done. <a href="http://www.beckjord.com/bigfoot/bloodandhair.html" class="external free" title="http://www.beckjord.com/bigfoot/bloodandhair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.beckjord.com/bigfoot/bloodandhair.html</a> Current hair analysis, a waste of tiome now, imho, is done by Dr Henner Fahrenbach.</p>
<p>In light of the statements of Dr Michio Kaku, CCNY Physics, and CUNY, saying UFOs may come here via wormholes, an idea I sent him a year ago, (said it on tv - ABC.) it would seem that hairy humanoids __could be__ temporary visitors and dna only proves they were humanoid "at that time". DNA was obtained by LA state researchers several years back, they claim. ( James Lansdale.)</p>
<p>Just because a newspaper makes a big deal of possible hairs of BF that later are buffalo, does not mean we need to make a big deal. Being "verified" as source, does not mean truth. Some sources lie.</p>

<dd>Beckjord, do not squeeze your own comments in between earlier comments to try to throw off the conversation. I moved yours to the end... but, frankly, your comments make you like liks a paranoic conspiracy theorist. We aren;t supposed to trust reliable sources because they all lie, but we're supposed to take the word of fringe publications and self-declared experts nobody ever heard of just because they support your side? Claiming current hair analkysis now is a waste of time completely m isses the fact that now they can do DNA tests and figure out for sure where the hair samples came from, instead of old, old "studies" which were just some guy eyeballing a clump of hair and trying to guess what it came from. The old studies are completely unscientific by current standards. New studies are indisputable. And all of the new DNA studies have ALWAYS come back with, goat, bison, bear, cat, whatever. Your arguments are nonsense and we need to update this article to reflect modern DNA studies instead of the wishful thinking of the pro-Bigfoot crowd. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 23:14, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Thus, to work in the system, add your comments to the DISCUSSION page, which thousands of readers now are looking at, thanks to GOOGLE. Your points will be read and some may last a while.Some may be verified (found in a book,ANYBOOK, and then added to the main page, with a footnote reference. It is best if you take teh tiome and dig out a page saying what you want, in a known book, such as The Bigfoot Files, and not in old fart books like Pyle. These Wicki people are very,very uptight and jealous and resent newcomers. So try my idea. Quote things. Newspapers, tv shows, websites, journals, books, and newsletters. SOME info may make it. That is the game, so we must play it.</p>
<p>Ask for Zoe by name, or Bishonen, by name, or Bunchofgrapes, by name, or DanielCD by name, to assist. They will see it, and may help.</p>
<p>Ve must be cool, and no vandalism (wiping out sections) pleeze.</p>

<p>all you people really,really think newbies are going to spend hrs reading polices they 100% hate?</p>
<p>Many do NOT LIKE these rules and laws. They want CHANGE. The organizers were WRONG. Many newbies do not see these policies as anything to respect. We might read them, someday, but do not respect them.</p>
<p>You use these policies to suppress new info.</p>
<p>Now, what about TV PROGRAMS AS A SOURCE?</p>
<p>Dr Michio Kaku is quoted on ABC that he feels UFOs use wormholes,</p>
<p>YOU GONNA IGNORE THAT?</p>
<p>I will send in the quote here.</p>
<p>Is ABC "reputable" enough for you? Or does it have to be a an author who has 50 libel items in her book? Is she "reputable" ?</p>

<dd>Also, you have proven yourself incapable of determining what "libel" really is. You can;t simply remove a book from the biography because you disagree with it and then throw out ridiculous legal accusations against the author to try to support yourself.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NOTICE TO DreamGuy and others of like mind</span></h2>
<p>I, and others, of like mind, are not trying to "take over" the Bigfoot page.</p>
<p>We do not need to try to flood them page with PRO info, because if honestly reported,</p>
<p>much of the research shows something is there, and we do not have to stretch it, fake it or fudge it. But much of what is there now , ignores other objective info, and used bad, weak authors who never did field work. These are selected for their critical views. Pyle, for instance, never left his house to write his book. How ya gonna call that "Reputable" ? It isn't.</p>
<p>We, members of Wikians After Fair Editing, (which seems to threaten many insecure people here) just want all sides shown and we are confident that if all the info is laid out, it will present a positive showing, because the truth is never 50-50. It is usually 98-2</p>

<p>They always will. They have no basis for any complaints, since they do no field work, and were NOT THERE. In one case, "Looking for Mr Goodape" Bob Sheaffer was told he might not see nor hear anything on the trip, since BF stays away from skeptics. When he left, a kid camped with family and did see a Bigfoot. Later, I did get pix, of beings not seen.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">sherpas</span></h2>
<p>quote: In 2003, Japanese mountaineer, Makoto Nebuka, published the results of his 12-year linguistic study and postulated that the word "yeti" is actually a regional dialect term for "bear". The ethnic Tibetans fear and worship the bear (as do many primitive peoples) as a supernatural being. This does not match with what sherpas say,however.</p>
<p>The reference is in The Snow Leopard by Peter Matthiessen. The whole comment by Nebuka is insulting and implies that the local people are taken in by a linguistic trick.. or that we foreigners just do not understand the local language. This negative item is just a skeptic's POV item, and it smells. I'm not sure it is even true that local people worship bears since they do kill them. Further, the whole thing is absurd, since westerners have found Yeti tracks at altitudes where BEARS DO NOT GO, and with bipedal aspect, not quadupedal. Bears do not walk for miles on two feet. Basic common knowledge.</p>
<p>I think the Nebuka item needs to be erased. It is a red herring.</p>
<p>My opponent keeps putting in false or illogical items, as if this will Un-prove or debunk the Yeti and the rest. Yeti is neither proven nor disproven. He is into mythology and pedantry.</p>
<p>I hope you do not go that route.</p>
<p>Fighting illogical pedants is tiring. Evil energy abounds.</p>

<dd>I doubt discussion will help matters, as the problem appears to be one editor stubbornly refusing to follow Wikipedia policies and making the same edits across a variety of sockpuppets. There already is very clear consensus that his edits are inappropriate. We can all discuss it and come to the same conclusions, but he won;t change his mind. The only thing that would put a stop to it without a permanent lock down is for beckjord to start following policy, leave, or get under some ArbCom decision.

<dd>True... I'm just saying the ol' "protected, discuss this on the talk page" line when it has been discussed repeatedly and consensus has already been established is one of my pet peeves. Wikipedia has some major problems that make it tedious for people trying to do a real encyclopedia to do accomplish anything. Instead we let a single well-known netkook hold articles hostage. Marvelous. If this trend progresses every major article on this site will be permanently stimmied because it only takes one POV-pusher to beat out 5 or 10 or 20 or however many good editors weighed in on the controversy here. It's a recipe for making everything get worse and worse. We should just protect all the damn pages and not let anyone edit until there are reasonable guidelines for encyclopedia writing in place. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 11:15, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Commenting on what Mongo says about someone else's alleged edits...</p>
<p>Mongo has to show this is fantasy, and ol Mong just is unable to use real logic to criticise what HE says is illogical. I feel this discussion is above the mental level of most Wiki admins and of bureaucrats, and some outwide logician needs to be brought in to make a detrmination on the logic of these CLAIMED ideas, things __not__ presented as facts , but just presented as speculation, based on actual events. Mongo, Android79m, and worst - DreamGuy are unable to differentiate between a CLAIM (speculation) and an alleged FACT, proven hypothesis. Due to lack of scientific training, no doubt. Better qualified editors need to look in. So, show the "fantasy" and the "illogic", or go away and edit the mundane.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Semi-protection</span></h2>
<p>I've semi-protected this page; this will stop AOLers and other anonymous users from editing, as well as new sockpuppets (as well as some old ones, hopefully).</p>
<p>Note that this won't be permanant, and I've had to use a rather liberal definition of "vandalism" to justify semi-protection. I consider the ongoing, willful defiance of Wikipedia's core policies on verifiability, original research, and neutral point of view that this article has been experiencing to be vandalism. Usage of sockpuppets has only made this problem worse. Established editors who want to add new material to this article are welcome to do so as long as their edits are sourced and do not run afoul of the aforementioned policies. Newer editors who want to do the same can discuss changes here on the talk page first. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 13:03, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>+ - interdimensional traveller, due to disappareaing tracks evidence, and vanishings before witnesses. If this proves to be true, + - it will make this comic-book and tabloid joke being become a Nobel Prize material item. Of course, +</p>
<pre>
 This shows blind prejudice. The incidents are not only true, but some of them
</pre>
<p>have been documented on videotape. It has no relationship to tabloids unless a tabloid has lifted information from a website or newsletter. Obviously, as the most junior of editors knows, there is no way to get an alleged bigfoot creature to cooperate with an experiment that shows that it can disappear, before cameras, and measuring machines. If anything of that type shows up, it may be form a surviellance camera, and one such incident, involving __alleged__ shape-shifting is in the possession of Jack Lapseritis, MA, in Northern WA. (Proceedings of the 2005 Bellingham Bigfoot Convention.)</p>
<pre>
Reports of vanishings, and also disappearing tracks in mud and snow,
</pre>
<p>are found in the book "The Locals" by Thom Powell, listed in refs. below. Also other reports are found in the archives of the discussion site, <a href="http://www.bigfootforums.net" class="external free" title="http://www.bigfootforums.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigfootforums.net</a> , as well as on some controversial minority-view websites.</p>
<pre>
It is the __conclusion__ to be drawn from such events that greatly disturbs
</pre>
<p>some Bigfoot fans, in fact, most, as well as some of the highly prejudiced editors here in Wiki, who have skeptical POV, and not NPOV.</p>
<p>That conclusion is that space-time wormholes may access this Earth, from other parallel universes, (as discussed re UFOs by Dr Michio Kaku on ABC TV in Feb 05, with Peter Jennings,) and that alleged (unproven - see- NPOV)Bigfoot creatures, and also missing persons, missing aircraft, etc, may use or access these to go to other parallel worlds or universes. Yet this idea of tranversable wormholes is greatly discussed in Physics, and hundreds of website references can be found on the topic in Google. Scientific American discusses them, (Dec 05) and so does "Taking the Quantum Leap" by Dr Fred Allen Wolf, Harper and Row, 1981, isbn 0-06-055137-2 . This makes it hardly "comic book material".</p>
<p>Perhaps Android79 might use his epxertise in editing to enter this material and information into the Bigfoot site.</p>
<p>If not, it is guaranteed that new members will do so, over and over until it sticks.</p>

<p>and will be editing every day or week, over and over and over.Correcting false info, erronenous info, inadequate claims, correcting such simple things as Wiki listing 8-9 "sightings" as if these were the ONLY sightings, when some 15,000 people have turned in reports to John Green, the author and even to the BFRO group and the BIRO group. Some will be adding, over and over, the fact that one researcher has videotaped tracks in snow that end suddenly, and start suddenly, (Brian Smith, reported in the Bigfoot Coop Journal, June 2003) that just are not in the "mainstream" journals because such journals refuse to report __anything__ about the alleged Bigfoot. You skeptics with skeptic POV will have to permanently freeze this article, with all its flaws and bad editing,bad references, FOREVER. The editors currently involved are not working in good faith, are not honest, and have zero qualifications to edit this topic. Britannica, at least,does identifiy authors. Assume good faith? No. Assume quality? No. Assume ability? No. Assume they have read __even a single book__? No. As for accusations of identity, in America there is due process under law, and people are innocent until proven guilty. Stop the stupid and paranoid accusations. Anyone can write like anyone. Take it to court. You guys are amazing, fighting to be backward and retarded. People like DreamGuy are Thought Police, and would be comfortable in Saddams former empire, and in Orwell's.(1984). Petty rankings like "admin" give them power without any merit nor name. The founder has set up a police state, on-line. Good subject for a PhD thesis. You earn my utmost contempt.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most compelling photographic evidence of Bigfoot is a controversial short film shot by Roger Patterson in 1967, which appears to document a female Bigfoot striding along a riverbank in northern California.</p>
<p>"It certainly wasn't human"</p>

<p>Now, Bigfoot advocates are increasingly turning to forensic evidence to prove the existence of the giant creature.</p>
<p>Investigator Jimmy Chilcutt of the Conroe Police Department in Texas, who specializes in finger- and footprints, has analyzed the more than 150 casts of Bigfoot prints that Meldrum, the Idaho State professor, keeps in a laboratory.</p>
<p>Chilcutt says one footprint found in 1987 in Walla Walla in Washington State has convinced him that Bigfoot is real.</p>
<p>"The ridge flow pattern and the texture was completely different from anything I've ever seen," he said. "It certainly wasn't human, and of no known primate that I've examined. The print ridges flowed lengthwise along the foot, unlike human prints, which flow across. The texture of the ridges was about twice the thickness of a human, which indicated that this animal has a real thick skin."</p>
<p>Meldrum, meanwhile, says a 400-pound (180-kilogram) block of plaster known as the Skookum Cast provides further evidence of Bigfoot's existence. The cast was made in September 2000 from an impression of a large animal that had apparently lain down on its side to retrieve some fruit next to a mud hole in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington State.</p>
<p>Meldrum says the cast contains recognizable impressions of a forearm, a thigh, buttocks, an Achilles tendon and heel. "It's 40 to 50 percent bigger than a normal human," he said. "The anatomy doesn't jive with any known animal."</p>
<p>A few academics believe Meldrum could be right.</p>
<p>Renowned chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall last year surprised an interviewer from National Public Radio when she said she was sure that large, undiscovered primates, such as the Yeti or Sasquatch, exist.</p>
<p>comment- well, this still talks about Bigfoot, but did you guys think some souirce will say Bigfoot is PROVEN? Never. It cannot be proven, since it is paranormal.</p>
<p>I do not know where ML is going with all this. Good tries, bit he misses the main point=</p>
<p>with so many sighitngs and some film, why is there no f&amp;b BF ???</p>
<p>Ans: It is paranormal and beyond ability of science to study now.</p>
<p>THAT is your big story.</p>

<p>For crying out loud, the National Geographic article does not say Bigfoot is real, it quotes one guy who works at a police department as him saying he thinks Bigfoot is real, but then it also says "But the vast majority of scientists still believe Bigfoot is little more than supermarket tabloid fodder." National Geographic itself does not take a stance.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">note</span></h2>
<p>In many cases, such websites quote the research of others, not just their own.But I agree many are not credible. You must pick and choose.</p>
<p>But also note that NO UNIVERSITY funds and BF research, and NO PROFESSORS except Dr Jeff Meldrum, have done out on their own to do such research.</p>
<p>One PhD skeptic, Dr Molly Hanson, did go on a BF expedition, and FOUND TRACKS OF HER OWN, and became a believer.</p>
<p>In general, in amateur BF res., most alleged researchers do nothing, know nothing and criticize any that do anything. A seething soup of jealousy. Beware.</p>
<p>Dr Meldrum has a loose advisor relationship to the BIRO site, <a href="http://www.bigfoot.org" class="external free" title="http://www.bigfoot.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigfoot.org</a> BIRO</p>

If a scientific paper or research is <b>published</b>, then it has been peer reviewed and fact checked for the most part. I would also be leery of books on the subject, unless they have been published by the scientific community.

<dd>I think Mongo's point was, that given the previous track record of the random websites you've asked us to vet, it should be pretty easy by now to tell, for yourself, whether or not a given website would be a useful source. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 06:29, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Got it. There is some really weird sites out there, thus is why I needed those found checked out. One claimed that it was a scholarly site. One really strange one, the Bigfoot Biologist site claims that the creature is for real, another claimed a hoaxer was killed impersonating a Bigfoot. I've seen some that make User:Beckjord's site look scholarly. Some of them claim that Bigfoot is some kind of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demon.html" title="Demon">demon</a>. Personally, I thought I had seen it all. Appreciate the assisstance. I was in the Fouke, Arkansas area myself investigating the Bigfoot incident there. It is a small town, all are well armed, and one idiot threatened to shoot ME if I was, as he put it, "one of those (expletive)(expletive) skeptical (expletives)." Only proof I have is just a verbal conversation between this guy and myself. I'm a evidence man myself. See the article <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Boggy_Creek_0657.html" title="The Legend of Boggy Creek">The Legend of Boggy Creek</a></i>, which is based on horrifying police and civilian reports.

<p>&gt;&gt; I do not think Mongo, or anyone else here, is qualified to judge the reputation of a source.\ Also, it you want this article to be old,old, and stuffy, limited, then ask for "mainstream" sources. Those all have their heads up their ***es and they all are terribly biased at the onset. They predetermine their outcomes. Have to, to keep their jobs! Same goes for most tv docs. They are instructed by their network, "This is how your show will look." One semi-decent one, just semi, was Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science by White Wolf Productions, now on dvd.</p>

<p>Now the DVD is on sale and is a copy of the program that came out last year nationally, maybe 2003. Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">TRUTH</span></h2>
<p>User:Beckjord, I have told you the truth, no more, no less. The Bigfoot page is now protected. Call off this nonsense before you get tossed out like a <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rot.html" title="Rot">rot</a> riddled <a href="../../../e/g/g/Egg.html" title="Egg">egg</a>. You know I have <i><b>NOT</b></i> lied to you at all, and am not lying to you now, will not lie to you. If Jimbo sees <i>this</i> mess, he may have you tossed himself. Like you, I have to follow Wikipedian <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocol.html" title="Protocol">Protocol</a> myself.</p>
<p>How do you know that they use wormholes, and are'nt they disruptive ? Who is to say that they're beamed down to Earth, and removed, like what is depicted in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> ? After all, some web sites and data sites <i>do</i> mention UFOs seen with Bigfoot, such as the UFO being overhead when a Bigfoot is seen in some of these cases.</p>
<p>Again, you <i>must</i> call off this mess before things <b>really</b> get out of hand. I've seen the results of a really bad Edit War. They make <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiroshima.html" title="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>(1945 era) and <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagasaki.html" title="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>(1945 era) look good. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 21:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC) <b>:)</b></p>

<dd>Sorry about the last comment, even if you think it's vandalism, it's very true. There is a massive difference between an edit war (Lord knows I've seen enough in my time) and the deaths of tens of thousands of people. While it is true that some conflicts can get nasty and some people like to take things off the internet into real life, it no where is in the scale of that. I'm sorry for the terseness of my other comment, that sort of thing tends to sneak up on me when I see poor hyperboles.--141.157.252.125 03:04, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article just needs to be trimmed? No, I don't think so.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The current Bigfoot article is like 120kb! You'd have to do a ton of trimming to conform to 32kb standards. It's in this article's best interest to follow the simple guideline "Articles, other than lists, should aim to be less than 32kb in size." Although this is not policy, it’s a good idea nonetheless as the current article is much too cluttered. This may also give us the edge in becoming a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured article</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Not to mention removing or otherwise trimming information is really defeating the purpose of Wikipedia. There is no such thing as "fluff" and I argue we should not remove anything as all information is valuable. Just rewrite some stuff to polish up the current article and split it up the rest.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For instance, the current article can discuss what a sasquatch is and et cetera. The pro and con thing can go into another article named something to the effect of "Bigfoot controversy". --<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvery1blowz_0fac.html" title="User:Every1blowz">Every1blowz</a> 00:54, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Leaving aside "there is no such thing as fluff" -- there most certainly is -- there are plenty of ways to shorten the article without removing information. Use more concise prose. Eliminate redundancy. Summarize and paraphrase quotations from references where appropriate. Not to mention that there's probably a <i>lot</i> of unverified, unsourced junk in there that we've missed. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 01:17, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Andriod79 completely, and, more to the point, as I already stated, if we do have to split things off, there are much, MUCH, much better sections to split off than one so central to the entire topic. For example, many articles have split off the popular culture section to a new article to avoid having only marginally related trivia take up so much space, so we could have a Bigfoot in fiction or <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot_in_popular_culture.html" title="Bigfoot in popular culture">Bigfoot in popular culture</a> article and save space there. We could trim the info on the Patterson movie. We could get rid of the alleged sightings as a list and have an article on all those (but then w'd have to watch that one like a hawk too, as people like to put unsourced and biased info there). An article like Bigfoot controversy is the last thing we should do.<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 01:27, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

I regret that I cannot agree with you on splitting the article at this point - I think DreamGuy is correct, and we should split the article as appropriate, but I feel cleanup takes priority - we can organize and split intelligently that way, rather than be chasing bits of text back and forth across different articles, all needing attention. I feel we need to focus on organization and structure, and where to spin off child articles will become more clear. The article is overlength, true, but not horrendously so, and "desired" is not the same as "absolute upper limit" - there have been several FA's which were "overlength".

“Eliminate redundancy.” With an article so long, you cannot possibly hope to eliminate redundancy. Things will be duplicated and misplaced with so much editable text present.</p>
<p>Well anyway, since the majority disagrees with me then by popular vote the article will probably stay unsplit for a while. But for the meantime I do think that organization is the best option. Dreamguy has excellent ideas as to splitting up certain sections "Bigfoot in fiction" so if anyone decides to do it in the future please start there.--<a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvery1blowz_0fac.html" title="User:Every1blowz">Every1blowz</a> 01:55, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Here, it means the article is <i><b>permanently</b></i> "locked down" (protected) and only Admins. and those of higher ranks may edit the locked down article. All it takes is one more Edit War, one more personal attack, and some Admin may initiate the Wikipedian version of Martial Law. Other Editors, such as I will not be permitted to edit the affected article. We will have to <i>recomend</i> any and all edits in the article's <i>discussion</i> page, and hope a Admin will edit what was presented to the said article. This is the Wikipedian version of Martial Law.</p>
<p>As stated, this would be done to negate any and all Edit Wars. Even those editors using sock puppets would be negated on articles that have been placed under "Martial Law", and the Check User tool is also used on any and all suspected sockpuppets.</p>

<dd>Would have to agree here with <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> on this one. Some of the websites you have mentioned are information poor in respects that they seem to "borrow" information from other websites. And some have not been updated with anything new and interesting. The only thing that peaked my interest was the book <b>Making of Bigfoot</b> by Greg Long about the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patterson-Gimlin_film_7ae9.html" title="Patterson-Gimlin film">Patterson-Gimlin film</a> being a hoax. He even had the "individual" who wore the suit. It was rather disappointing due to the fact the conclusion he came up with was rather lame and nothing new. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusTCicero_a3a0.html" title="User:MarcusTCicero">MarcusTCicero</a> 00:30, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have in my travels on the internet forum boards about <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> have read many of these topics concerning types of weapons to use to hunt it. They have ranged from large caliber handguns to field artillery. It sort of one those topics of my gun is bigger than your gun debates.

<dd>Now you know why Law Enforcement <i>does'nt</i> want people hunting this thing, other than someone getting hurt or even killed by someone who'll shoot first, ask questions later. Rural people will shoot and kill tresspassers, since there is hardly any law enforcement in rural areas. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 07:52, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>I think that is a bit of sterotype regarding Rural people shooting tresspassers. Actually you more likely to get shot during hunting season by the people who travel from the big city to go hunting. I have witnessed some of these idots do things that I wish law enforcement was around to arrest them. And most likely it would be the Wildlife Division responsible with the protection and enforcement when it comes to wildlife issues</i>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcusTCicero_a3a0.html" title="User:MarcusTCicero">MarcusTCicero</a> 13:37, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What would <i>you</i> do <i>if</i> you had seen this thing ? After all, I've seen many documentaries on TV, heard on the radio that skeptics actually want a <i>body</i> of this thing. Reason is this: Pixes can be faked, people could be lying or are idiots, evidence is sparse at best. Now you know why people will try to bring in a body, in spite of what law enforcement indicates, in spite of laws against taking a Bigfoot in some areas of the world. Only being truthful, no more, no less. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartial_Law_9af9.html" title="User:Martial Law">Martial Law</a> 08:01, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your head is so far up your ### it not even amusing. Sadly, your POV is typical here. State the "reliable sources" and state what things you think I want them to say. That means you use words, and write them here, not just implications and hints.</p>
<p>Bigfooty (hairy humanoids) are/is a murky topic and little is, proven. The sleptics so far, are correct that ther is no verified zoological Bigfoot species. On this I agree. I wonder if you read this and are not just dashing about reverting things all over?</p>
<p>Now, STATE THE RELIABLE SOURCES . Who are they and why are they reliable?</p>
<p>(This is sooooooooo fucked.) Do I assume good will? Hell no. Are wikians nice? Nope.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">RE: Martial Law, Bigfoot Question</span></h2>
<p>Martial Law, It seems you are some what interested in the Bigfoot question. I would suggest that you look into a couple books that help with understanding it. One, I will highly recommend is John Green's book, <b>Sasquatch - Apes Among Us</b>. This is a prized book by those who do research and investigations into this. John Green spent some time in gathering information and witness stories. It is sort of a primer for those who are really into finding a answer. Another is Chris Murphy's book, <b>Meet the Sasquatch</b>. Another interesting book to read. It approachs the question from the researcher point of view. I think you would find them both a great read and help with all these questions you have.

<p>Hello! These pictures are fantastic. We would just like to share this story. we are doing so after hearing the re-broadcast of Robert. W. Morgon tonight on Art Bell from 2001. In Jan of 2001 in the early morning around 4 to 5am, my husband and his fishing buddy of 11 years were fishing in Roosevelt Lake right where the Mogollon Rim borders the area. His buddy saw the figure first and , could not figure out what it was and quickly told my husband to look . My husband looked where he was pointing and saw what looked like a 9 foot tall man covered in dark brown hair walking quickly along the mountain ridge above them perhaps less than 100 feet away.. He said it was extrordinary because the "man" was taking huge strides unlike a human could walk and was able to walk the entire ridge in five minutes or less. He said the being swung it's arms as it walked and walked straight ahead. For a second, he wondered what a man was doing up on the ridge?It begun to dawn on them this was no man!They were able to view the hairy being" for five whole minutes.He said you couldn't miss it. It was HUGE and certainly from that distance it had to be. He said it had huge long arms, but not like an ape, and long hairy legs but not ape like. My husband said there is no way it could be a human since the area it was walking in was inaccessible, as there is no ingress or egress up there. his buddy shook his head in disbelief and said he;'d never tell anyone what he saw. But my husband is convinced the huge 9 foot tall early morning strider is abosolutely 100 percent BigFoot. He said there is no way it was a man because of the way it looked. when we heard the Broadcast tonight , Morgon validated that BigFoot sightings have occured around The Mogollon Rim. And that BigFoot families do live around there. We believe it !My husband knows they saw something most unsual that morning, and that it was something other than human as we know it. Thanks for allowing us to share this true story. BigFoot is not a myth! They exist, as my husband saw firsthand. Stephanie Stevens foxy loxy</p>

<dd>Brrrrr. If I had been fishing up there in January I would also have been sipping moonshine all through the night to keep warm.

<dd>AZ is not famous for heavy snowfall. The point is that researchers get hundreds of similar reports, from people who do not need fame, do not need money, and just want to repport what they encountered. Often, researchers may, as I have, go to such places, and sometimes, not always, they fnd tracks, or make sightings, or get photos of creatures they did not see directly. And yes, yes, some reports are faked, but our experience is that most of them are not, and are submitted by honest people who seek answers. The photo and follow up photos re "Old Yellowtop" were taken as part of such a followup effort. See <a href="http://www.bigfoot.org" class="external free" title="http://www.bigfoot.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigfoot.org</a> photos Then of course, many other followups result in nothing. Wikians should understand that despite some big nothing efforts by hoaxers, that the great majority of of researchers and also witnesses are jut good plain honest folks who want to help solve this mystery. 5%-10% are hoaxes, and the rest mostly not so. Now understand that a report is not "proof", and only a dead body is proof of a zoological flesh and blood creature. We know this. It is not news to us. Harry Dickens
<dl>
<dd>Not entirely true Becky. A <i><b>live</b></i> body would be proof. No? Funny thing is that no-one has ever produced one, or even a whisker of DNA to prove that Biggie is anything but the result of imagination. Funny thing that! <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoriori_1969.html" title="User:Moriori">Moriori</a> 06:18, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">kindly reply to Moriori</span></h2>
<p>1) many reports change the date and even location, to "protect" Bigfoot from shooters. I doubt anyone is fishing in January, but that may be the reason. The basic report jibes well with thousands of others. Vist <a href="http://www.bfro.net" class="external free" title="http://www.bfro.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.bfro.net</a> or <a href="http://www.bfro.org" class="external free" title="http://www.bfro.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.bfro.org</a> for 10,000 reports. Ignore the owner, see the reports.</p>
<p>2) To many, the world is black or white. But there is grey. Yes, there is NO acceptable zoological evidence for Bigfoot. Yet, it is seen often, and even photogaphed. Why? Perhaps, maybe, as a theory, they may come in via space-time, as ufos may also. And have non-earthly f&amp;b char. See wiki's most famous BF researcher on this <a href="http://www.beckjord.com/wormholesinuse" class="external free" title="http://www.beckjord.com/wormholesinuse" rel="nofollow">http://www.beckjord.com/wormholesinuse</a> If it was good enough for Einstein, it's good enough for you. Remember, this is NOT proven fact. Never said it was. Got that?</p>
<p>I did love Lucy</p>
<dl>
<dd>Speaking of Einstein, I see you have adopted his advice where he said <i>"If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts."</i> As soon as someone points out the absurdity of your "facts" that two people were in an area that they could not get to, fishing in the middle of winter, early in the morning when it was as cold as charity, when it was as dark as the inside of a cow (pre mutilation), and they watched something walk the entire length of a ridge - you change the "facts". Anyway Becky, at least you agree there is no zoological evidence for Biggie. Can we quote you on the Biggie page?</dd>

<p>Something "verifiable" by being quoted in a journal does not mean it is true or false. You guys will quote even the worst garbage simply because someone wrote it down and got it into a newspaper. For reports, you can only compare them to existing ones, and this one jibes well. One of the only two skeptics to actually go into the woods looking for Bigfoot, Dr, Molly Hanson, found tracks on her own near this lake area, in AZ, and became a believer!</p>

<p>neVer take Bigfoot as a given. We are always careful to say "the alleged Bigfoot" or the "unproven bigfoot". IOHO, the other negative editors REFUSE TO TAKE NOTE OF THAT. Anyway, the "so called Bigfoot", the unproven Bigfoot, is alleged to have been seen (what nonsense to do this..), maybe, in an unproven way, (got it?) in China, in Russia, in Australia, in South America.</p>
<p>You know, whenever we mention the word Bigfoot, it is ALWAYS A GIVEN that this is an unproven animal.So, it is NOT proven, it is Not a fact, it is not verified by zoologists. OK??</p>
<p>ok??? ok???OK????? Jesus!!!!!! You pedants. DO YOU UNDERSTAND, NOT PROVEN!!!!!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bigfoot alleged sighting</span></h2>
<p>I remember seeing something about shapeshifting. Bigfoot possibly changing into odd looking people. A few years back my brother and I were hiking up the north side of Mt. Hood in Oregon. We were headed up the trail towards Elliot Glacier. At this point the the trail is somewhat like a knife edge. Up ahead we could see dust being blown UP the side of the canyon. We were thinking it was possibly rock fall causing this. As we came further up the trail, we saw a "man" sitting at the edge of the canyon throwing rocks and causing the dust blowing. I decided to take some pictures of him. From where we were, he could not see us. I zoomed in on him and he instantly looked directly into my lense. Now, I was hiding behind a rock and some Alpine fir trees. As I looked at him I realized that he didn't look like your average hiker or backbacker. He was wearing old ratty bib overalls, only one strap was buckled. That was it, no shirt, and I don't remember if he was wearing shoes or not. The odd thing was he was HAIRY. He also had a crudely shaved head, and a large browridge. His facial features were very neanderthal looking. This guy was weird. He continued throwing rocks and we continued up the trail. When we were even with him, I said Hi, hows it going. He turned slowly looked me in the eye and let out this ODD glutteral sound, I said "pardon me?", he puffed his cheeks and did it again !! I just kinda figuerd he was some weirdo hanging out at like 6000 ft. I didn't think much of it until I saw the post on shapeshifting. I would also like to add that I am a beleiver in Sasquatch. I had an experience in 1996? on Mt Hood just below Timberline Lodge. Only vocals and scent, no sighting. I will try to find the slides of the stranger near Elliot Glacier and e-mail them to you and see what you think. Thank you and take care. Also feel free to e-mail with any questions you have. Brother Cain</p>
<p>Note; "Bigfoot" can be any odd variation on humanoid that involves lots of hair.</p>
