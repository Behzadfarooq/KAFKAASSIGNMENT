<p>The correct tag for images which have been copied to commons is {{NCT}} ("Now Commons This") if the image title is the same, or {{NowCommons|filename.jpg}} if the name is not the same as the commons, and the correct name of the image on Commons for "filename.jpg". Use this rather than speedy or db for such cases. Hope this helps.

<li>Most of the images that I have been tagging for speedies are ones where there is no image at Wikipedia, just a blank description page. I'm not asking for an image to be deleted - only a blank description page under I2. The blank description page comes from one of two things usually - either the picture is a former "featured picture" candidate and so someone added {{<a href="../../../f/p/c/Template%7EFPC_6a24.html" title="Template:FPC">FPC</a>}} and it was later removed or someone added a description to the WP page that they really wanted to have on Commons. The problem with these blank description pages is that they add the image to <a href="../../../u/n/c/Special%7EUncategorizedimages_d046.html" title="Special:Uncategorizedimages">Special:Uncategorizedimages</a>, which is a special page that is patrolled to find missing or incorrect image tags. The only other ones I have tagged for speedies where there is actual media at Wikipedia (not just a blank description page) are ones where <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> I9 is met or where the image was only available under a non-commercial license. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 11:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for the heads up. That was the first photo I ever uploaded to Wiki and I screwed it up (couldn't figure out how to put down licensing). I reuploaded it under <a href="../../../a/m/b/Image%7EAmber_corwin_photo.jpg_8b32.html" title="Image:Amber corwin photo.jpg">Image:Amber_corwin_photo.jpg</a> with the proper licensing. The one you notified me about (Image:Amber_corwin.jpg) can be deleted, it's a duplicate and orphaned image. I added the licensing anyway.

<p>The image was taken from a subscription online historical archive, I use several subscriptions so it may take a few days to obtain the original photographers name (a photo this old the photographer is often not known) and official release, but I will do my best to find it and list it with a ref to the (now possibly defunct) agency.

<dd>Unfortunately, that is not free enough. In order to be used on Wikipedia, an image must have no restrictions on its use. It must be free for commercial use and for derivative works. It may very well be that if you email the webmaster of that site, he/she would be willing to release it and provide you with a copy that doesn't have the copyright notice. But as it stands now, images from that site cannot be used.

<dd>An album cover can be used to illustrate the album - using it to illustrate the composer or artist of that album is questionable. At any rate, I don't believe that using a picture from the inside of an album would qualify as fair use. Please see also Jimbo's comments on fair use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3APublicity_photos&amp;diff=66922063&amp;oldid=58823881" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3APublicity_photos&amp;diff=66922063&amp;oldid=58823881" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Basically, the idea behind "fair use" is that there is no free way to have a picture of a TV show - you have to use a screenshot. The same is true for something like a CD album - you have to use a picture of the album cover. That's the purpose for fair use. Anything else is questionable at best. I hope that helps. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 16:17, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These pages are deleted when the images were deleted, but I restored them and blanked them so as to preserve the edit history, as required by the GFDL. Please do no list these pages for deletion.

<li>The main concern I have is that the images are currently being added to <a href="../../../u/n/c/Special%7EUncategorizedimages_d046.html" title="Special:Uncategorizedimages">Special:Uncategorizedimages</a>. I don't particularly care about the existence of the description pages - but they need a category if they are going to exist. I asked about it on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia_talk%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_0059.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion</a> and was told by three different administrators that tagging them as I2 was appropriate. <a href="../../../u/n/c/Special%7EUncategorizedimages_d046.html" title="Special:Uncategorizedimages">Special:Uncategorizedimages</a> is patrolled to find images with broken tags or other problems and having these images in there is not a good thing. If there are description pages that are being preserved for GFDL purposes where merely copying/pasting the edit summary is insufficient, there needs to be a category created for them. Perhaps they can be added to a category like Category:Commons images with history or something. Is there any reason that merely copying/pasting the history to the commons talk page is not sufficient for GFDL? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:08, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, at least in the case of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Image%7EAssumption_Cathedral.jpg_32d4.html" title="Image:Assumption Cathedral.jpg">Image:Assumption Cathedral.jpg</a>, the en description was written AFTER the Commons description and thus could not possibly be needed for GFDL. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:16, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If they were added to en first, then should probably be categorised here. I'm not sure what the complete requirements of the GFDL are, but it's certainly useful to keep the edit history. If the english page was created after the commons page and is just a duplication, then it should be deleted, but this should be noted in the template so it is not incorrectly applied to other images.

<p>You left me a message about my image attribution. I have contributed several good photos. I think I should probably attribute them in a way that anyone can freely use them if they give me some sort of credit outside of wikipedia. What do you think of the {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-sa-2.5_49da.html" title="Template:Cc-by-sa-2.5">cc-by-sa-2.5</a>}} attribution tag for this purpose.

<p>Someone has placed the following tag on some of my photos {{self2|GFDL|cc-by-sa-2.5,2.0,1.0}}. What is the difference between that and what I have chosen?</p>
<p>Well, it's not really appropriate for someone else to have tagged your images (unless they were just correcting spelling, etc). That aside, in terms of practical differences? None really. The GFDL license is more restrictive than the Creative Commons license. With both, they have to give you (and any other contributor) credit and any derivative works must be released under the same license. The GFDL gives a lot of lawyer talk and describes random and arbitrary hoops to jump through. The creative commons license is in plain English that anyone can understand, so I prefer that one ... although it doesn't really matter that much. If someone is honest, they are going to give you credit for your work and if they are dishonest, then they are going to use it and they couldn't really care less about your license. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:45, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's been a very long time since I uploaded that image. Frankly BigDT, I've lost all track of it. After receiving your reply I tried to locate its associated article but to no avail. There is none. Then it dawned on me that the article was on zh:wikipedia and not en:wikipedia. Then it occured to me that whilst being a novice, that perhaps (I can't be certain that this is the reason), it was highly probable that I had uploaded it in the believe that the article on zh would be able to link to it. Anyhow, as a direct result of the above, it can be safely said that this image is now redundant. Please go ahead and delete it.

<p>Hi. Sorry, if this is not the "expected" way I can communicate with you (I am not yet proficient in Wikipedia's mechanisms). I would like to know the reasons for deletion of the above image, as I don't understand the "code" initials. The picture has been published in two of my books and I scanned it from the book itself, as I didn't save the electronic image. Just tell me how I am supposed to categorize it, because it is a very valuable photograph. Thanks a lot. <a href="../../../s/k/a/User%7ESkartsis_5ae6.html" title="User:Skartsis">Skartsis</a></p>
<ul>
<li>It is "your" book meaning that you wrote it or you bought it at a store? If you wrote it and own the copyright, then it's not a copyright violation (obviously). Do you have plans to use it in an article? Wikipedia generally only keeps images that are being used in articles or are going to be. There is another Wikimedia website that you may not be familiar with called "Commons" - see <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org" class="external free" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org</a>. Commons collects all manner of images and, if you don't plan on using the image here, but someone possibly could elsewhere, Commons may be the place to upload it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 11:54, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You seem to be a pawn by NicholasD who is intentionally removing copyright notices. Are you associated with him? He seems to be getting more clever about his attacks, so that instead of just modifying or removing an image and getting reverted, he's removing the copyright notice and then someone like you jumps in and reacts. These more sophisticated attacks are annoying. I haven't figured out who he is yet.

<li>Company logos should be removed from all free images. If I see a company logo, I strongly question (1) whether the image is really free or (2) if it is the best way to illustrate the subject.

<p>All three images at <a href="../../../k/f/a/Kfar_Darom_d5eb.html" title="Kfar Darom">Kfar Darom</a> do not qualify for fair use, as they are AP images. I uploaded them over a year ago before I really knew the rules about images, so as they arent fair use you can just delete them without my objections. As for the Massoud image, and related images at Afghanistan Civil War, CNN (for a time) put images on its website that were merely screenshots from its TV coverage, as shown by its overall low quality. To the best of my knowledge these are screenshots, but perhaps once again I dont understand the exact rules about fair use. If these dont qualify, than I dont have any reason to object to their deletion either. ~<b><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">Rangeley</span></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERangeley_d899.html" title="User talk:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">talk</span></a>)</b> 17:57, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Ok ... I will tag the other two images on that page. As far as the rules for fair use ... <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR</a> explains them. The general thing to keep in mind is that on Wikipedia, fair use is intended for something like a screenshot of a video game or a television show. If you are writing an article about <a href="../../../n/c/a/NCAA_Football_07_b64e.html" title="NCAA Football 07">NCAA Football 07</a>, there is no such thing as free media that you can use to illustrate it. EA Sports owns the box cover. They own images from the game. Even if you had every resource in the world at your disposal, you could never, ever, in a million years, produce a free image to illustrate that game. The same would be true of a television show, like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>. There is no such thing as "free" Simpsons media because it is all copyrighted. In those cases, everyone agrees that fair use images are appropriate. On the other hand, a photo of something like a <a href="../../../b/i/r/Bird.html" title="Bird">bird</a> or <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lane_Stadium_da0b.html" title="Lane Stadium">Lane Stadium</a> would almost never qualify for fair use because anyone who really wants to could take a photo of them any time they want. The more questionable case is a photo of someone like <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>. Sure, he's still alive so it's in theory possible for us to take a picture of him, but it's unlikely that he is going to be readily available to Wikipedians for a photo shoot. So in such cases, we will use photos from a media promotional packet, press release, or some such thing, although this use is disputed and Jimbo himself has said that he doesn't like it and wants to move away from it. In each of these cases, we are using the copyright holder's work to illustrate the work itself or the copyright holder. On the other hand, a media photo is using the copyright holder's work to illustrate some third party. Further, in particular with the AP and Reuters, since they derive their income by selling the rights to use their photos, our use of their photos without permission infringes directly on their ability to market their product. I hope that gives a good explanation. Feel free to ask if I can explain something better. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:08, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So the Massoud image does not qualify for fair use, as it is being used to depict the event pictured rather than the station for which it occured on/the photo itself? ~<b><a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERangeley_3f20.html" title="User:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">Rangeley</span></a> (<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERangeley_d899.html" title="User talk:Rangeley"><span style="color:#0055aa;text-decoration:underline;">talk</span></a>)</b> 20:45, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Correct. Image:Massoud2000.png would be reasonable to use in an article on, CNN's coverage of the war or some other critical commentary on CNN ... but it is not considered fair use to illustrate the subject of the photo. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:49, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your help with the Bible Portal. You`re the first person to take any significant interest in it. I created it almost by accident because I was surprised there wasn`t one. I just followed the templates and there it was. Maintaining it myself has been quite a task! Especially when I can`t really afford to have internet service all the time.&#160;:0( You`re also the first person who doesn`t seem to want to add any kind of religious P0V or worse, extra-biblical P0V! I hope it can reflect the best of what Wikipedia has on the 0ld and New testaments only. And frankly, what Wikipedia has is thin and rife with P0V. I`m not a writer, or at least not a very good one, <a href="../../../a/_/n/M_A_S_H%7E_A_Novel_About_Three_Army_Doctors_fe06.html#Plot_overview" title="M*A*S*H: A Novel About Three Army Doctors">(the one thing I`ve actually written)</a>, but I can edit like crazy. And so far, I`ve been piecing together stuff from existing articles. Mostly I just want to get people to read The Bible, so I started the featured chapter; which, I knew from the beginning would be a daunting commitment: there are only a couple thousand chapters! I kept up pretty well for a while, but then I was off-line for a month. I like your changes very much. You may be more technically proficient than me.

<li>Cydebot has bugs in it. It messed up my user page when it went through it. Also, I am not subst the templates, I am switching the old with the new. That means that I have to do a little extra on each page for some of the switches. It is long and tedious, and the reason that I started the TfD before having them all done in hopes that the users would see the TfD notice and the switch notice and do it themselves. I think that at least 80% of the users with these boxes are inactive since I have seen them over and over again doing the various switches. That is why I need help, there are thousands yet to be done, and my poor hands aren't up to it.</li>

<p>A brief howto on using variables in the Babel Box.</p>
<p>To use a variable or variables in the Babel Box, the pipe must be brought in using another method. In this case the {{<a href="../../../%21/_/_/Template%7E%21.html" title="Template:!">!</a>}} template must be used. So, for the GMT and other time zone templates the Babel Box code would look something like this...</p>
<p><code>|time zone{{!}}GMT{{!}}watch|</code></p>
<p>It is a workaround that works brilliantly. - <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELady_Aleena_2b68.html" title="User:Lady Aleena">LA</a> @ 01:52, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here is a list of time zone templates that are left to be done...if you will do them, I can concentrate on the non-time zone related templates and the last two which have to be done manually since they have variables to them. I have added a lot of templates to that javascript (though for some reason the pop-ups one now works and I now know how annoying it is), you may want to take a look for the first 3 on the list below. - <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELady_Aleena_2b68.html" title="User:Lady Aleena">LA</a> @ 10:48, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi BigDT. Could you mark your recent edits to userpages as <b>minor edits</b> so I could bypass them while doing RC patrol. Thanks! — <span style="font-family:Edwardian Script ITC"><font color="#00FF00">The Future</font></span> 17:34, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I know the answer!&#160;:) Try <b>My preferences</b> under the tab <b>Editing</b>. There will be a checkbox that says "Mark all edits minor by default".
