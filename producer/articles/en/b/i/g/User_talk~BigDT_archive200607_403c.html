<p>Hi, I am contacting you as you commented in the deletion discussion for these lists. You may not have realised that recently some users have placed conditions for inclusion on these lists that many users find unreasonable. Currently, no common sense is permitted in judging whether a person should be on the list. Even if a person is sourced as having both parents born in X Country, or if they say "my family is X", or "I have X blood" we still can't list them. Many users disagree with Jack'O Lantern and other users who have adopted this position. For more discussion related to this and proof many people disagree see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Estonian_Americans_8dcd.html" title="Talk:List of Estonian Americans">Talk:List of Estonian Americans</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Greek-Americans_75c6.html" title="Talk:List of Greek-Americans">Talk:List of Greek-Americans</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Polish-Americans_3354.html" title="Talk:List of Polish-Americans">Talk:List of Polish-Americans</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Is_deductive_reasoning_original_research.3F" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#Is_deductive_reasoning_original_research.3F</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#ethnicity.2C_hyphenation.2C_and_membership" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#ethnicity.2C_hyphenation.2C_and_membership</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Deductive_inferences_in_OR" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#Deductive_inferences_in_OR</a>.

<p>Hmm... So, is it realy just "we feel like using it" and "decoration "? I mean, Don't they have the "clear purpose" of showing the Iranian economy and achitecture? How is one supposed to visualize that, if not by examles? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:17, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The picture of the car is a completely different issue - that is a photo from the news media. Even if a news media photo is of tremendous benefit to an article, that is not permissible, unless the photograph itself is the subject of the article. As for the hospital and the Mofkham House, policy #8 says, "The material must contribute significantly to the article (e.g. identify the subject of an article, or specifically illustrate relevant points or sections within the text) and must not serve a purely decorative purpose." The Mofkham House is not discussed in the article. The hospital is not mentioned in the article. Qajar architecture is not discussed in the article. There is no way that either of those images are central to the text of the article when the article doesn't even mention them. Even if they were, there would almost certainly be a free equivalent available (policy #1) - surely, somewhere (perhaps on Commons or on an Iranian-language Wikipedia), there is a free photograph from the Qajar era. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 01:37, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi BigDT,</p>
<p>I have cleared this issue already with other editors and admins in the past. These images can be used because Iran and the United States hold no mutual copyright agreements or relations <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, therefore the <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> laws do not apply, and Wikipedia is under no legal obligation vis a vis these pictures. We should make a template for this so this doesnt keep happening again. As for the Mafkham House images, instead of tagging them for deletion, you could have notified me first, and I would have added text to the corresponding articles to alleviate any FU concerns.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 16:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If that's the case, then fair use is still the wrong tag to apply. I don't think, though, that just because we (America) don't have a treaty with Iran on the subject means that Wikipedia is free to use anything it wants from anyone in Iran. Perhaps this should be discussed to determine what the policy is. I have posted a request for clarification on the issue at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia_talk%7ECopyrights_Can_I_use..._af1e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Copyrights/Can I use...">Wikipedia talk:Copyrights/Can I use...</a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:14, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi BigDT,</p>
<p>The Jimbo Wales statement has come up for debate before. regarding the statement:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Unless there is something particularly strange about the copyright situation in Iran, we should generally respect Iranian copyright law as best we can, the same as we do for other countries around the world."</dd>
</dl>
<p>two things can be said and have been brought up before:</p>
<ol>
<li>Regarding the first sentence, the copyright situation in Iran is anything but usual. Iran is not a member of the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works_eb1d.html" title="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works">Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works</a>, or its extension <a href="../../../w/i/p/WIPO_Copyright_Treaty_da4c.html" title="WIPO Copyright Treaty">WIPO Copyright Treaty</a>, or <a href="../../../w/t/o/WTO_1c1a.html" title="WTO">WTO</a>. This is e.g. stated <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/21/1095651288238.html?oneclick=true" class="external text" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/21/1095651288238.html?oneclick=true" rel="nofollow">here</a> in non-technical terms, and is also stipulated in <a href="http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?lang=en&amp;treaty_id=15" class="external text" title="http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?lang=en&amp;treaty_id=15" rel="nofollow">WIPO's own Berne membership list</a>.</li>
<li>Regarding his second sentence, in "respecting Iranian copyright law as best we can", the fact of the matter is that we are doing just that. Nowhere on Wikipedia have we allowed any image to be uploaded with its origin from Iran that has an unclear copyright status. The only exception being images from <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran%27s_Cultural_Heritage_Organization_3f33.html" title="Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization">Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization</a>. And the reason is that their images are strictly promotional; they are in fact encouraged for use in media such as WP, because the images serve as a form of publicity for them and for Iran. I have been to their offices on many occasions, done photography for them, and used their images. We are actually doing them a service in using their images. I dont see any reason to ban usage of these images. It highly enriches wikipedia, and entails no legal consequences whatsoever, and it actually does ICHO a service. But we can make it clear that this exception doesnt extend to any other image from Iran. Only ICHO.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 13:01, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If it does them a service and you frequent their offices, why not just get a letter of permission to release the images under the GFDL license?

<dd>I am not an administrator and I have no capacity to erase or not erase a photo. I nominated your three photos because they have patently incorrect fair use claims - not because I care one way or the other about pictures from Iran. If photos from Iran are being deleted, then the solution to that is to provide sufficient information on the media pages to prove that either (a) you have permission to use them under the GFDL or another free license or (b) they qualify for fair use under <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR</a>. If the information isn't given on the media page, then neither I nor anyone else knows the justification for keeping the image. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:29, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your knowledge of the law and the process of downloading images and in other areas is wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>The process of downloading requires an immediate categorisation. Many of the categories are poorly defined and inaccurate. I and others used to download things without categories and then once downloaded added in the templates. This however is no longer possible with the bots. Even in the few seconds it takes to update a file once downloaded, the downloader will still find that their userpage will have been defaced by a bot claim that they did not insert the required information. This flaw has been pointed out repeatedly but not fixed. As a result, to stop the continuing defacement of pages with false bot claims it is necessary to insert a category <i>while</i> downloaded. If due to the shoddy wording of the options the image falls between two categories or whatever, users have to post the least wrong one. So categories like {{political event}} etc <i>have</i> to be used, to dodge inaccurate bot attacks. If you want people to stop using these inaccurate categories then you will have to get those responsible for the bot to fix it. Until it is fixed, those categories will continue to be used by users. Accusing users of adding in false claims is grossly unfair. The problem is with flaws in the download procedure and the bot, not the users.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The claim about the picture of the queen and the pope suggests you don't know how photographs are taken in the Vatican. Unlike some other locations, where numerous photographers and television crews are admitted, in the Vatican to avoid an unseemly scramble in frequently limited space has its own photographer and camera crew and they then supply their images to all media outlets, without exception (they even supply their photographs to anti-Catholic publications). The image from the BBC website is a Vatican photograph. The issue of Vatican images was discussed numerous times on WP. The overwhelming consensus was that they are perfectly legal to use. They are issued, with no conditions, by the Vatican to <i>all</i> publications; print, broadcast, books, magazines, encyclopaedias, school books, pamphlets, etc. If, as you seem to think their use is not permissable, that would mean that practically every image of, or taken in, the Vatican, would have to be deleted because they too are all taken by Vatican photographers and crews for issue. Wikipedia would have to delete every image of every pope taken in the Vatican, every image of every religious ceremony in the Vatican, every image of the Apostolic Palace, the Lateran Palace, etc. <i>All</i> these images are taken by the exact same source as this one, the Vatican, and all are issued, without restriction, by its press office. Indeed the classic official image of Pope John Paul II, which has been copied worldwide by the billion, and has appeared in every publication on the planet at some stage, as well being hung in churches worldwide, would be unavailable on Wikipedia, making Wikipedia quite literally the only location on the planet supposedly not able to use it. That is quite frankly ridiculous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your knowledge of the law on fair use is not accurate and you are misinterpreting rules in ways that were never intended and, as in the case above, frankly both ludicrous and unworkable. The nonsense is shown in your claim about the image. Mantillas are (or more ofter were) worn to meet popes. People need to be able to see what a mantilla is. As they are only worn in the Vatican at meetings with popes, the only source of images of them will be from the Vatican. So there is no alternative but to use this image, an image from a source Wikipedia uses widely, in fact the source Wikipedia uses most widely throughout the encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">Jtdirl</a> 19:19, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is necessary to pick an incorrect license temporarilly, why not correct the license once you upload it? I pointed out several of your images that still have incorrect tags applied. I didn't "accuse" you of anything. Stating that the images are incorrectly tagged is a statement of fact, not an accusation. You have given a logical reason for it and <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>, I accept that reason, but I fail to understand why the incorrect tag cannot be corrected after you complete the upload.</li>
<li>As for Vatican photos, you are correct, I have no idea how the Vatican sends out photos. The image description page offers no such rationale so I would suspect that the vast majority of Wikipedians would be unfamiliar with this claim. If the Vatican supplies these photos free of charge for anyone to use, why not simply state that on the description page and provide a link to the policy? As it is, all you did was provide a link to a news media site using the photo that gives no indication that it is a freely available image.</li>
<li>As for my knowledge of the law or fair use, please feel free to correct me on any area where you believe I am wrong.</li>

<p>Sorry if I sounded unduly critical, mate. I have been suffering from severe physical pain for the last few weeks and it has left me rather grouchy. (I am chewing painkillers like sweets at the moment!) I and others weren't sure if, in taking off the other caption we'd then be <i>botted</i> again!!! If we know we can be sure of that we can be free of that "pleasure" then of course they should be taken off. What happens is that if someone is working on a number of things, constantly going in and out of old images just adds more work when in fact we may have moved off to another topic completely and forgotten about an individual image.</p>
<p>Re the Vatican: it is confusing. There was a template created to list Vatican images and their context but that was deleted, so users then end up linking to where the image was displayed, not where it came from. Organisations which use these images don't state they are Vatican images because they don't have to.</p>
<p>In the media (I do some media work) we often like to maintain that something was taken by <i>our</i> photographer or film crew — it sounds good to the viewer. Newspapers and TV stations don't explain to viewers and readers the concept of <i>pooling</i> where one agreed photographer takes images that then everyone uses. People would expect that if the Queen meets the Pope, that it would be the BBC who would record it, or if President Bush meets the Pope that it is CBS/NBC/ABC etc who were there, not the Vatican's own guy. I simply know how these things work because I work in the media and have had dealings with the Vatican Press Office — I am on their email list. In any case, as mantillas are worn exclusively in relation to meetings with popes, the only images available are going to be news agency images in the Vatican. Ordinary people aren't able to be there to photograph the head of state wearing one unless the head of state goes walkabout with tourists (and their cameras) in St. Peter's Square, etc. So there is no alternative to those images. If there was, I'd use it immediately. (I spent an hour searching for alternative images. News agency images are only ever used by me as a last resort where we need to be able to show something and there simply is no other way of doing it. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">Jtdirl</a> 21:21, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That explanation sounds reasonable. Why was the template deleted? Unless the reason for deleting the template is that there was a dispute over the copyright status of those images, why not just add some scaled down version of what you just told me to the image, preferably with a link to the Vatican press office where the policy is described? That way, there will be no question that the use of the image is considered fair use.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I guess my only remaining concern was Image:Eamon de Valera (portrait).jpg. Do you know the original source for the image? It might still qualify for fair use even if the original source is not PD. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 21:35, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your rationale for deletion of pictures that don't appear elsewhere on the Internet seems to imply all images taken with a digital camera will have to be deleted, unless the user has posted them elsewhere.

<ul>
<li>If someone claims to be the person who took the photograph or created the artwork and there is no reason to doubt their claim, there's no problem there. However, in the case of some of the images you have uploaded, you don't make a claim either way. For example, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3A77174531059416918.jpg&amp;diff=63486038&amp;oldid=63485659" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3A77174531059416918.jpg&amp;diff=63486038&amp;oldid=63485659" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, you have tagged it as being licensed under the "Creative Commons Attribution License v. 2.5". That statement needs some justification. If this is a photo from a family scrapbook that was passed to you and you own the rights to it and have scanned it in, just say so. I, and most others, will <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. The same is the case with Image:Kahrar-Charlotte 04a.jpg. But if they are images you found somewhere, then you need to tell exactly where the source is. In other words, where does one find the "James Gerard Kennedy archive"? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:33, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've been wanting to clean that section up for a while. Honestly, I wish someont from Tech who is more familiar with the Corps than I would work on it. Either way, whether he picked the right or wrong list, I'm pretty sure that it was a good faith edit by someone genuinely wanting to contribute to the article.

<p>Sorry BigDT, you're not close at all.

And now there's a separate <i>Q</i> that appears to be different than <i>B</i> (I dont' really know what the <i>Q</i> is all about). I don't think CSD G4 remotely applies in this instance. I changed it from "Speedy delete" to "delete" because it wasn't a proper speedy deletion, not because it was a proper normal deletion.

<p>You have recently either supported my userbox consolidation efforts or at least applauded them. Currently, I am putting together another larger batch of userbox deletions which will have master templates. (The master templates are not "live" yet.) Would you be willing to support me in this and any future consolidations? There will probably be a lot of resistance at first to this, so having a group of people supporting me would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>At the moment, 5 master userboxes are in the works to replace 72. That may increase significantly if I can get the sixth one to work as I would like. Some of the templates to be replaced are widely used, but with the consolidated templates there is more funcitionability.</p>

<dd>Hi Lady Aleena, as noted in an earlier discussion with you, I think consolidation is fine for thematically related userboxes. However, I also support diversity through mass customization, so I'm more inclined to support consolidations that maintain display differences in images, colors and especially wordings. That's easy enough to do with parser functions. I wish you all the best.

<dd>I don't overly care too terribly much. I will say that I think having generic userboxes is a good thing from one standpoint - it helps newbies learn Wikicode. If you can't just add {{User Hokie}} to your page but instead have optional parameters like {{User Hokie|year=2001|border=maroon|major=CS}}, that's definitely a good thing. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:21, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rfrisbie...have you thought about getting your Myers-Briggs templates deleted in favor of the combined one that Thadman created? That would be another 18 deleted. I did a survey of how many people were using each...</p>
<p>Some people have more than one of these on their user pages, so some of those are duplicates. I know that some look like a lot of people use them, but once we get people migrating from individual templates to master templates, it will get easier and easier to consolidate them. Hopefully we can keep user templates in Template space if we can show that we can police them. - <a href="../../../l/a/d/User%7ELady_Aleena_2b68.html" title="User:Lady Aleena">LA</a> @ 22:48, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi LA, of course, we all know they're not “my” templates. I just moved some to userspace as part of the effort to find a userbox compromise most people could live with. I wasn’t kidding when I said I support diversity in userboxes. Although I think Thadman’s userbox {{<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Userbox_MBTI_b195.html" title="User:The Thadman/Userbox/MBTI">User:The Thadman/Userbox/MBTI</a>}} is cool, it displays differently than the others – only one color scheme with a set of profile scores – and it doesn’t use categories . I don’t have any problem with it or another template designed to consolidate the existing features of the other boxes for “elegance” reasons, <i>as long as no features are lost</i>. However, I do not see a “need” to do it. On a web site that went from 1 million articles to over 1.25 million in about four months, I really consider the number of userbox pages to be a non-issue. I’m also not aware of any material debates on keeping userboxes in templatespace <i>if</i> someone polices them. Maybe you can show me a link or two on that. In this particular case, it’s even more superfluous because all personality boxes already are in userspace (User:Rfrisbie/Userboxes/Personality) <b>and</b> the Wikipedia directory page was deleted. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Wikipedia%3AUserboxes%2FPersonality" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=Wikipedia%3AUserboxes%2FPersonality" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="../../../r/f/r/User%7ERfrisbie_fdd2.html" title="User:Rfrisbie">Rfrisbie</a><sup><a href="../../../r/f/r/User_talk%7ERfrisbie_975e.html" title="User talk:Rfrisbie">talk</a></sup> 02:08, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the link. What that shows me is that you are very well-intentioned in your efforts, your rationale for this process as a means to keep userboxes in template space is not supported by consensus, and the specific case of the Myers-Briggs templates does not apply, since they already are ugly in userspace. Sorry, I'm still not convinced of the need or consensus to do this. However, if you're still interested in combining the boxes for "efficiency," without changing the displays or categories, it's fine with me. <a href="../../../r/f/r/User%7ERfrisbie_fdd2.html" title="User:Rfrisbie">Rfrisbie</a><sup><a href="../../../r/f/r/User_talk%7ERfrisbie_975e.html" title="User talk:Rfrisbie">talk</a></sup> 12:13, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've known this might happen for a while. Here's the thing. I work for Austin College in the website-photographs division, and my employer knows that I am using this picture on the Wikipedia page. I am allowed, even encouraged, to use it. But I couldn't find a copyright that would work for such a situation. Can you help me figure out which one will be the right one?</p>
<p>As for the logo on my userbox, what about the other college userboxes that have a picture of their school's mascot on them? Did those have a different copyright from the picture on mine? Again, that picture comes from Austin College's own photos, which I have access to and permission to use. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklegirl_75d1.html" title="User:Frecklegirl">Frecklegirl</a> 04:17, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"By permission" images are not permitted. There is a tag {{<a href="../../../p/e/r/Template%7EPermissionAndFairUse_c9ad.html" title="Template:PermissionAndFairUse">PermissionAndFairUse</a>}} that may be used to tag images where specific permission has been given to Wikipedia to use the images. However, those must have an accompanying "fair use" rationale. If your school would be willing to release the image under the GFDL license or release the image into the public domain, then, obviously, it could be used. I am going out on a limb and assuming there's no way they would release their logo into the public domain, but it you work for them, it couldn't hurt to ask about the photo. Depending on how formal or informal things are, it may be that they would be willing to release the photo. As for other schools using logos in userboxes, if you find one, be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a> and remove it - they are absolutely 100% not allowed. Please take a look at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_Education_United_States_ed35.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes/Education/United States">Wikipedia:Userboxes/Education/United States</a>. Just about all of the school userboxes just use the initial letters of the school in plain text. A few use a photograph. A few use a fake logo. If anyone is using any kind of "fair use" image in userspace, it is supposed to be removed, regardless of permission. I hope that helps. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:47, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Eww ... I don't know what I think about that ... even with permission. Our userpages are GFDL, meaning that it has to be possible to create derivative works that are GFDL. Use of an image that would not be GFDL makes that questionable. With fair use images in articles it's different because if it's fair use in an article, it would be fair use in any conceivable derivative work. However, I honestly don't really care enough to argue about it ... but regardless of that, you may want to put some kind of warning on the template itself - surrounding it with &lt;noinclude&gt; ... &lt;/noinclude&gt; so that it doesn't get transcluded. That way, the next person to come along doesn't just make the same change. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 05:06, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe that's why the University requests that the "TM" remain visible; so that any creator of a derivative work would be aware that the image itself is a trade mark. I believe that the same is true of a logo appearing under fair use on an article. If someone makes a "derivative work" of an article and uses a Fair Use image in a way that exceeds that provision of copyright, the creator would not be able to defend herself based on the rights granted by the GFDL. I can conceive of many such conceivable derivative works. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 05:17, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>That may be ... but at any rate, you probably still should put a warning label on the template so that the next person to come along doesn't remove the image. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 05:19, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have done that. It would also be nice if people checked to see if a Fair Use claim was in use before removing content based on policy about Fair Use.

If it's obviously a copyvio image that cannot possibly qualify for fair use, I usually don't bother, but in the case of ones like this, if someone can provide source for this image and provide evidence that it is freely licensed, the image can be kept.

<p>You left a message on my user talk page regarding message left in the en.wikipedia name space vs. the common name space. I post the original image here in en.wikipedia, but it was moved to common for other edition of wikipedia. On one hand, I am glad that someone's taken care of it. On the other hand, I've never logged into the common name space before, so I honestly don't know how to do what you have suggested. If you think my comment is in the wrong name space, then please move it for me.

<dd>Ok ... thank you for your reply. I have placed your comment on the talk page at Commons <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image_talk:Acridotheres_tristis1.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image_talk:Acridotheres_tristis1.jpg" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. FYI, at Commons, just as at WP, you can edit without an account. If you would like a Commons account, you can register for one at <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org" class="external free" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org</a>. Commons caters more towards media that is usable on any project (not just English Wikipedia), whereas media here is deleted or moved to Commons if it is not in use. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 18:25, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Like en.wikipedia, I think commons won't let me upload pictures if I don't have an account. So when my image postings were moved to common, I basically was disconnected from my own uploads after the move. May be someday, I would sign up at commons. Meanwhile, I still continue to upload to en.wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKowloonese_2c09.html" title="User:Kowloonese">Kowloonese</a> 18:31, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Correct ... unless you register you cannot upload. To be honest, the main reason I originally registered on Commons wasn't for uploading, but it was to prevent someone from ever being able to take my name. On the Virginia Tech message boards, there is a troll who likes to impersonate established users ... so I'm in the habit of snagging my username anywhere I care about it. But then the Commons upload page seemed less convoluted then this one ... so I just started using that one. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 18:42, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It depends on exactly which Creative Commons license they use. That particular image, for example, uses the "Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.0" license. "Non-commercial" and "No derivative works" are problems. The license that image uses is this one <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/" class="external autonumber" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, but the tag you have added is this one <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" class="external autonumber" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. They are both 2.0, but are not the same 2.0. Anything with a non-commercial creative commons license uploaded after May of 2005 should be speedied. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 19:44, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah! I see now. I made a couple other similar changes, I'll go back and fix those too.

<li>I don't know if the "noderiv" part qualifies an image for speedy deletion or not. The "NonCommercial" part does, but I have no idea about "noderiv" images. They obviously aren't allowed, and I have just taken them to IFD on the rare occasion that I have found one, but I don't know if they are speedyable. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:02, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
