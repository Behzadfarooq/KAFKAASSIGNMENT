<p>A 1932 graduate of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Minnesota_1d57.html" title="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>, "Biggie" Munn was a guard and sometimes fullback. He played under head coach <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fritz_Crisler_a980.html" title="Fritz Crisler">Fritz Crisler</a> and was a two-time first-team All-Big Ten, 1931 Big Ten <a href="../../../m/v/p/MVP_21d5.html" title="MVP">MVP</a>, first-team All-American and football team captain during his college career, as well as the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_captain.html" title="Team captain">team captain</a> of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track_and_field.html" title="Track and field">track and field</a> team. While in school, he was considered by many as the top collegiate <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punter_%28football_position%29.html" title="Punter (football position)">punter</a> in America. He stood just under six feet and weighed 215 pounds, but was recorded running 100 yards in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Munn was inducted into Minnesota's "M" Club (Hall of Fame) in 1993.</p>
<p>Three years after his playing career ended, Munn got his first head coaching job at <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albright_College_6df7.html" title="Albright College">Albright College</a> in Reading, Pa. He held the position for two seasons. Munn moved on to become an assistant at his <a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_mater.html" title="Alma mater">alma mater</a> in 1940. From 1942-44, he was a line coach at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Michigan_a8fd.html" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>. Beginning in 1944, Munn became an assistant at <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse_University_d1c9.html" title="Syracuse University">Syracuse University</a>. Shortly after arriving, Munn got his big break when <a href="../../../o/s/s/Ossie_Solem_a82a.html" title="Ossie Solem">Ossie Solem</a> resigned as head coach following the 1945 season. Biggie was appointed head coach for the 1946 season. One of Munn's assistants at Syracuse was former Orangeman standout <a href="../../../d/u/f/Duffy_Daugherty_dfca.html" title="Duffy Daugherty">Duffy Daugherty</a> who joined Munn's staff at Michigan State for eight seasons, beginning in 1947, before becoming Munn's Spartan coaching successor. Also while at Syracuse, Biggie coached alongside former Gopher teammate <a href="../../../b/u/d/Bud_Wilkinson_8ce3.html" title="Bud Wilkinson">Bud Wilkinson</a> who would become one of the great college coaches at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oklahoma_0676.html" title="University of Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a>.</p>
<p>Syracuse enshrined Munn into its Hall of Fame in 1973.</p>
<p>Munn left Syracuse after one season for the head coaching job at Michigan State College, which became <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_State_University_3713.html" title="Michigan State University">Michigan State University</a> in 1955, following Munn's retirement as coach.</p>
<p><a name="Coaching_career_at_MSC" id="Coaching_career_at_MSC"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Biggie_Munn_8c08.html" title="Edit section: Coaching career at MSC">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Coaching career at MSC</span></h2>
<p>In 1947, Biggie Munn and the Michigan State administration (primarily university president <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A._Hannah_f819.html" title="John A. Hannah">John A. Hannah</a>) approached and managed to convince the highly popular <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Notre_Dame_aca9.html" title="University of Notre Dame">Notre Dame</a> president <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_J_Cavanaugh_1480.html" title="John J Cavanaugh">Father Cavanaugh</a> to play the Spartans. Macklin Field (now Spartan Stadium) was expanded from 26,000 to 51,000 capacity in 1948, enabling MSC to play a national schedule. MSC initially offered to let Notre Dame take 80 percent of the gate, but Cavanaugh insisted they split the receipts down the middle.</p>
<p>Once Notre Dame agreed to play, Michigan State attained almost instant national recognition and thereafter was able to get other big games across the country.</p>
<p>Munn was the only coach to beat Notre Dame's three-time national champion head coach <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Leahy_48dc.html" title="Frank Leahy">Frank Leahy</a> three years in a row: 1950, 1951 and 1952.</p>
<p>Munn developed the "Wingback Deep" formation of his formula "Michigan State Multiple Offense." The play featured a shifting back and forth from T-formation to Single Wing, and included a direct snap to the <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tailback.html" title="Tailback">tailback</a> between a T-formation quarterback's legs. On the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Lansing%2C_Michigan_f4a8.html" title="East Lansing, Michigan">East Lansing, Michigan</a> dressing room wall, the coach hung a statement on fundamentals the team members were required to read before every home game: "Do not cheat your team or your teammates. Know your plays. Block. Protect. Add to what we are trying to do. [Signed] Biggie."</p>
<p>During the latter part of his coaching career, Munn developed the talents of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Thrower_4456.html" title="Willie Thrower">Willie Thrower</a>, the Big Ten's first black quarterback. Thrower subsequently became the first black <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a> to play in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a>, playing for the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_3f7c.html" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a>.</p>
<p>Munn was named the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> college football Coach of the Year for the 1952 season after MSC went 9-0 to claim the first of his two back-to-back national championships. In 1953, the Spartans tied for the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Ten_Conference_77c8.html" title="Big Ten Conference">Big Ten</a> title in their first year in the conference. The school had joined the Big Ten Conference in 1949 but wasn't allowed to contend for the championship until 1953, when Michigan State and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign_5af2.html" title="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois</a> tied for the title. The conference voted to send Munn's team to the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Bowl_Game_3a09.html" title="Rose Bowl Game">Rose Bowl</a>, where it beat <a href="../../../u/c/l/UCLA_052f.html" title="UCLA">UCLA</a> 28-20 on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Rose Bowl victory, MSC's athletic director Ralph Young retired and Munn took over and remained in that position until 1971. When he retired as coach he named his assistant, <a href="../../../d/u/f/Duffy_Daugherty_dfca.html" title="Duffy Daugherty">Duffy Daugherty</a>, to succeed him.</p>
<p>Munn's coaching produced seventeen <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_7275.html" title="All-America">All-American</a> players and he was inducted into the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame_85e4.html" title="College Football Hall of Fame">College Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1959. Munn's teams have held on to the school's top four spots in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28American_football%29_8e53.html" title="Rush (American football)">rushing</a>-yards-per-game in MSU's history: 1948 (304.5), 1951 (293.9), 1952 (272.4) and 1950 (269.3).</p>
