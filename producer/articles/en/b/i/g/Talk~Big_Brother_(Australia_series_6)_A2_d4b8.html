<p>This table is not pertinent to the Housmates, but rather a depiction of the current status of the contest. It should be given it's own section, and/or moved closer to the weekly summary and highlights with which it is more closely related. Perhaps "Current Status" would be correct here.

<dl>
<dd>I myself think that while the series is in progress, it should be near the top; then when the series is finished I plan on having a different table on a separate page, and the current one can be deleted. If you feel it might look or function better further down the article, you should check it out, and if you think it's better, save it. If somebody doesn't like it, they can always undo it and discuss it on here.</dd>

<li>Again, thank you for the speedy reply. How do you classify your sources if not "personal web sites"? Your second request cannot be logically answered until this point is agreed to. They appear to be sites which speak about the primary topic of the article, "the show", but the article does not address how much the show has earned, the companies involved in producing it, the viewing area or channels where it is available, the estimated viewing demographic, or other facts about the show itself. The article does appear to contain a replay of the content of the show, rather than discussing the show itself. The data presented as content specifically speaks of various third party individuals whom are neither authors of the source web sites, nor stock holders in the show. It is therefore pertinent how you define the classification of these sources in regards to their reliability. Thanks, and by the way, the graphic arrangement is very evenly balanced.

<dd>Wow. They are things I haven't even thought about where a Big Brother article is concerned, or even when watching the programme. I would have to do a bit of research on the subject, but if I found some information from reputable websites, I would definitely try to find a way to include it in the article. Some of that information is already on the main <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_%28Australia%29_4c63.html" title="Big Brother (Australia)">BB AU</a> article, but it focuses more on Big Brother in general, rather than individual series. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small><sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font> 13:26, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would like to ask you to further review <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, please. I do not doubt the reliability of the sources themselves, however, if these sources are not considered to be personal web sites, then they appear to be self published sources. As discussed earlier, it is pertinent how you classify the sources in regard to their reliability. As self published sources they may not involve claims about third parties, which would be considered to be hearsay. Please let me know after review of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> how you find the sources to be classified. Thanks! Ste4k 13:41, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Some of the information comes from the housemates themselves, but as it's unlikely that many of these things have been documented by reliable sources, I'm not quite sure how those sources would be classified. A lot of the information also comes from broadcasted shows, and is published on the Big Brother Australia website. It doesn't fit enough criteria to be classified as a published source, but it could, in some interpretations, be seen as a fact or coming from a primary source. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small><sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font> 13:56, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. This means that we only publish material that is verifiable by referring to reliable, published sources. The page should be written as historically accurate. How will this page be viewed as informational ten years from now? The burden of evidence lies with the editors who have made an edit or wish an edit to remain. Editors should therefore provide references. If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic. Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable sources. Editors adding new material to an article should cite a reputable source, or it may be removed by any editor. The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I think that my chief concern here is that there are statements made in the article which are about third party individuals and made by sources which have a financial interest in the show. The hearsay then looks to be factual to the general public. Rewording or removal in areas which are clearly only POV of the sources is warranted. I hope you can understand this perspective clearly. Regarding house mates themselves as reliable sources, quoting should be used, but their opinions are only hearsay and quite likely to be arguable among themselves on the program. To say "John said that Jane was pretty", does not mean that Jane is pretty. For a specific example, a statement such as "Anna seemed to form a tighter bond with the men in the house." might use some rewording or explanation. For another example, I checked the sources regarding "David Graham Goondiwindi, Qld 22 April Came out as gay on Day 4.", and there is no relevance to the show here. This may be relative to the plot of the show, to the sales of the show, or other factors, but that relationship is not stated in the article. The actual reference for day four quotes David rather than making any sort of opinion about his statement. These are only two examples picked at random. I hope this helps make my earlier points clearer. Ste4k 15:13, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><s>Not quite sure what you mean by this one... Sorry.</s> I think I got this one now, but correct me if I got it wrong. When housemates are up for eviction, in BB06 the public can vote to save a housemate, or to evict one; or as many as they like, as many times as they like (or can afford). The votes are then merged, and the final results are used to decide who's evicted.

<dd>Nominations are the things given by housemates in the diary room Monday night. They may given one or two nomination points. The three most nominated housemates are then <i>up for eviction</i>. Editors to this page sometimes use the term <i>up for nomination</i> when really they mean <i>up for eviction</i>. Usually and by default, whenever a nominations round is held, <i>all</i> HMs are potentially up for nomination: anyone can be nominated (except for rare exemptions). Home viewers may vote for a <i>nominated</i> HM: they can vote to evict or vote to save. Viewers at home cannot <i>nominate</i> a housemate. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 20:12, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes in early seasons - probably because the show was new - HMs and Gretel usually stuck to the official terms. In later seasons things changed as Big Brother became "BB" and even "Beebs", "Nominations" became "Noms" and one might "Nom" or be "Nommed", and soon "Nominations" also came to mean eviction to. I guess when someone says "I am up for nomination this week" it is pretty clear wheat they mean, but it gets confusing when we do that on wikipedia too. You'll note this year "Beebs" etc are all banned and they get fined for saying that now; in a recent show Gretel used the term "Nom" before correcting herself. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 20:26, 20 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Here is the problem as I read it. Keep in mind that I do not watch television and couldn't care less about what the story line is here. My opinion is NPOV. This page needs to stand on its own for readability. There is no definition of nomination in the article at all. There is however, this idea which is planted early on: "Viewers are able to vote for Housemates they wish to SAVE, as well as those they wish to EVICT." So, when I get down to the line that says "Karen and Krystal were exempt from nominations in the first round." I am wondering if this is the audience or the people in the house, or both. And I am wondering what the rest of the "rules" are in this contest. The article never even states how many houses these people are living in. You have intruders and insiders and quite a few different terms that are clearly specific to the functioning of this contest, but are left completely to the readers imagination. Once again, I repeat from above, you have added nothing to this article that describes the show, and only vaguely how it works. You are concentrating too much on the story line and not enough on the program. You are adding the definitions here in the talk pages instead of in the article itself, and to be verifiably correct, the article CANNOT be making any statements about the future. Please see <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> regarding the addition of original research. That pertaiins not only to making claims about the future, but also about providing defintions that you are making up yourself. You need to find these rules and these terms on a verifiable source and cite them. I hope this makes my point clear. Articles may not contain any previously unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas; or any new analysis or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas that serves to advance a position. The only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources which provide information that is directly related to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say.

A lot of things, including the Nominations process, and what FNL is, are described in detail on the main <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_5309.html" title="Big Brother Australia">Big Brother Australia</a> article. Nominations is the process where the housemates vote for who they want out of the house, but other housemates are not allowed to know who each person nominates. The housemates with the three highest number of votes are then up for the public vote, where the public get involved. They can vote for the housemates they want to save, or the housemates they want evicted. On the Eviction show, these votes are merged (save votes are subtracted from the evict votes), and the final result is the person with the highest percentage of votes is evicted. It's assumed that anybody would already know this. Any definitions for any of the words are unlikely to be found on any website because of this. If the only real source, the Big Brother Australia website, cannot be used as a reference for anything, then the whole article, along with every other Big Brother article on Wikipedia, would have to be deleted as published proof would never be found.

<dd>I gotta admit I do find it annoying on this page where editors freely use terms like "Three point twist" and "free from nominations". Those might have been the terms used in the broadcasts, but clearer terms need to be used here. The page says a couple of times that Karen and Krystal were free from nominations one week. Does this mean they couldn't nominate and couldn't <i>be</i> nominated? Does it mean that they could nominate but could not <i>be</i> nominated? Does it mean all the housemates went in not knowing about this and could and would nominate Karen and Krystal, only for the nominatations to be secretly voided by Big Brother after the event? (Like what happened to Michael one week where he succeeded in his secret insider task.) I would have fixed this myself but as I didn't watch these shows, I didn't know what actually happened. I think the unverified tags on the page seem a little pointless. It would be more contructive to place <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags against contentious sentences within the page. Most of what is here seems OK and is merely description of televised events. Many television programs have lengthy descriptions of format, storylines and characters on wikipedia without each aspect of the description being verified by external sources. Note that I normally hate ever-growing list articles (like <a href="../../../j/u/m/Jumping_the_Shark_a9f8.html" title="Jumping the Shark">Jumping the Shark</a>) but as this is linked to a specific tv season which will be over soon I figure this page will probably be eventually cleaned up when the series ends, so I'm not too worried about its format <i>while the series is in progress.</i> <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 23:22, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To say they may enter on June 21 is misleading, as that leaves room to suggest they may not enter.

<p><b>a)</b> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:3RR#Detail" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:3RR#Detail" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] Reverting, in this context, means undoing the actions of another editor or other editors in whole or part.

<p>Tense - The sections should either all read in the future, the present, or the past. Past is preferred since this is a history.

<p>I don't want to start an edit war by removing the tags again, so I'll bring up my points here. There's no point in having the tags because a lot of the information on it is received from televised broadcasts. There's no way to cite these. Any information that comes from the BB06 website can't be cited either, because as soon as the series finishes, that site gets blanked; and as it's unlikely that there will be another series of Big Brother Australia, I wouldn't be surprised if the website didn't come back. None of this is original research; if something was incorrect, or if somebody felt that a part of the article were inaccurate, and they know as a fact that it is, they will correct it. The tags are unnecessary. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small><sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font> 22:58, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>past tense</b>, that is, chronology should be. For example, "Jim spent three hours in the diary room moaning about Bob".

<p>Well I'd actually rather the article were written in present tense, but think it should be written in past tense, but things that are valid in real time, such as John's GTS, or Karen and Krystal's relationship, peoples' jobs, and other things like that, should be written in present tense. If something that is known to be happening, such as new housemates entering the house, is going to be written into the article, it should be written in future tense until such a time where past tense would be appropriate. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small><sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font> 18:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm a casual viewer of the show and a casual editor of the BB Aust wikipedia pages. In the last few days it has become apparent that several editors have various problems with <i>Big Brother</i> pages on wikipedia. There have been AfDs on the <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Fitzgerald_4e92.html" title="Ryan Fitzgerald">Ryan Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Deering_46fa.html" title="Simon Deering">Simon Deering</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Brunero_f66e.html" title="Tim Brunero">Tim Brunero</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Mathew_c6d4.html" title="David Mathew">David Mathew</a> pages. Some have been AfDed to make a point, and others seem to be cut and paste AfDs applied to any page about a former Big Brother housemate. Gee I wonder if this page will also be targetted? <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 11:25, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This brings up another small question: If Big Brother were nominated for deletion would you be concerned that a majority of people would agree to have it removed? If so, why? Ste4k 21:03, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As it currently stands none of the AfDs on <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Fitzgerald_4e92.html" title="Ryan Fitzgerald">Ryan Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Deering_46fa.html" title="Simon Deering">Simon Deering</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Brunero_f66e.html" title="Tim Brunero">Tim Brunero</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Mathew_c6d4.html" title="David Mathew">David Mathew</a> successfully led to the article being deleted, so it seems unlikely that an AfD to delete the main Big Brother page would succeed. Since many, <i>many</i> television shows, even ones far less popular, influential and long-running than Big Brother, have wikipedia pages, I don't see why BB shouldn't be here! Clearly lots of people don't like BB, but that is no reason to obliterate references to it on wikipedia. Twenty years ago it was <i><a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_operas.html" title="Soap operas">soap operas</a></i> that were derided and criticised in this way, but these day they all have individual entries on wikipedia too. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 21:54, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm assuming you're referring to the edit I made to the <i>The Insider</i> section. I changed only one word because changing it, I thought, wouldn't cause any arguments; as the sentence as it stood was incorrect at the time. I thought the argument was about the chronology section and the Housemates section, as these are the two places where the tense used is most important. As there's a vote going on somewhere above this section of this talk page, I was assuming people would want that to be seen through before any major changes to the tense of the article were committed. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small><sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font> 14:41, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>How is the inclusion of the Housemates table count as original research? According to the policy OR is referred when information is presented on Wikipedia when it hasn't been published by a reputable source. All the information regarding to housemate names, entrances and evictions from the house are gained from the television show, the website and even press releases and articles about said evictions. The television show itself is a source of information as it's medium. It's like an episode summary or list for television shows.

The actual policy reads: Articles may not contain any previously unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas; or any new analysis or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas that serves to advance a position. The table itself suggests that the progam will be completed. The tags about warnings to users are specifically against policy. This is an encyclopedia. Per consensus above you will see that for several days a poll carried out agreeing that the tense of this article is in the past. That agrees with <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and the templates warning user's about future possibilities should be very easy to realize have nothing to do with something that has already been completed. If you'd like to take a straw poll vote on that, it would be fine with me. It would certainly be better than putting the question up in the AfD. True? Either way, per policy, unless it can be shown otherwise. It is the responsibility of the author to provide verification. Verification of the future is well, impossible. Thanks!&#160;:)
<dl>
<dd>Well, the table did not at any stage predict anything to do with the future of the show and didn't present any arguments or ideas that isn't easily verified by the Big Brother website so I don't think any arguement relating to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> can refute the inclusion of the table. Secondly, the nature of this program and reality shows in general means that the article should be closer to the format and style of a sporting event article such as the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_25dc.html" title="2006 FIFA World Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> than a traditional on-going television series (such as <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a>). The <a href="../../../i/n/-/Template%7EIn-progress_tvshow_4de6.html" title="Template:In-progress tvshow">in-progess template</a> has a similar function as the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Template%7ECurrent_sport_8860.html" title="Template:Current sport">Template:current sport</a> template which notifies the reader of an article that as this series/competition is on-going, what is written in the article is likely to change and may be out-of-date from time to time. For instance, housemate Rob was evicted last night, however, if Big Brother decided to turn around and let him back into the house tonight then until someone edits this article after he's let back into the house than what it says about Rob will be incorrect (saying that he is evicted if he's let back in). I do agree that spoiler templates aren't necessary as everything in this article has already happened, but the in-progress template serves a different function than the spoiler template. The only case where spoiler templates might be needed would be when information which is verifiable is written in the article but hasn't happened yet, such as information relating to upcoming intruders or double evictions. -- <span style="color: blue; border: 1px; border-style:solid"><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanlord_d0f1.html" title="User:Chanlord">CHANLORD</a></span> <sup><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChanlord_7953.html" title="User talk:Chanlord">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chanlord_fc80.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chanlord">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/25px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" /></a> 03:23, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is this topic going to be worth reading about in ten years specifically? If you say yes, then tell me why one needs go only a few programs back in time to see the that <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_Australia_series_1_8e27.html" title="Big Brother Australia series 1">Big_Brother_Australia_series_1</a> doesn't have a table. And for that matter, tall me why, except as a miscellaneous place holder does that page even exist. Hey, maybe I'm wrong, who cares. This page is nothing more than an advertisment in my opinion. And JD_UK only has an interest in it as an obsessive passing passion. If that weren't true, then the entire project would be balanced. Not only that, but if you think about it, this program isn't even a real program until it's been completed. What would you need such a table for after its done?

<p><b>Question:</b> Do tenses have to be uniform for an entire article like the difference between American/English spelling? Some of the recent changes have better reflected the activities in the house (Eg, Danielle <i><b>was</b></i> evicted on Day xxx) however I believe some tenses should be put into the present tense as they are on-going (eg, John <i><b>has</b></i> a mild case of tourette's and Michael <i><b>is</b></i> a political science student). These current and ex-housemates are still these things and unless John somehow gets rid of his tourettes or Michael drops out of uni they should be in the present tense to avoid confusion. -- <span style="color: blue; border: 1px; border-style:solid"><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChanlord_d0f1.html" title="User:Chanlord">CHANLORD</a></span> <sup><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChanlord_7953.html" title="User talk:Chanlord">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chanlord_fc80.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chanlord">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/25px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Australia.svg_9b78.html" /></a> 03:49, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What happened (turkey-slapping, or whatever you want to call it) would be an indecent assault, not a sexual assault. It is indeed 'alleged' or 'apparent' or something like that, as opposed to proven in front of a jury.

<dd>I find the intense attention, critiqueing and monitoring of the Australian Big Brother pages by just a couple of editors pretty irrational. Wikipedia is <i>full</i> of highly detailed articles about television programs which go into intricate detail describing the storylines and characters of the show, the setting, style, the locations, etc. Few of these articles feature any form of referencing: the descriptions are based on viewing episodes of the show. The article on <i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a></i> contains just a handful of references: most of which are studio released videos and DVDs or fan books apparently released by the makers of the series. <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i> article features just eight references, two of which are studio released fan material. The <i><a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmerdale.html" title="Emmerdale">Emmerdale</a></i> article, while going so far as to actually quote ratings figures, does not provide any references for this information; the entire article features just one external source. The article on <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guiding_Light_3221.html" title="Guiding Light">Guiding Light</a></i>-the world's longest-running soap opera ever, features just three references, of which two seem to be fan books released by the makers of the series. This Big Brother series 6 article features many, many, <i>many</i> more external referces (including 20+ mainstream newspaper reports, some of which quote the Prime Minister of Australia discussing the show). So why is Big Brother being singled out? This seems to be getting beyond genuine concern for quality and seems like a vendetta against the article. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 12:10, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That article is not as great and holy as you're making it out to be. The Big Brother pages were doing fine before that WikiProject was made (by you), and if it weren't there now I'm sure the Big Brother Australia articles would be better, if anything. Asa01 is right about sources, not everything needs a source. You're treating this article exactly as I would be treating the Big Brother 7 UK article - a lot of stuff that I think should be sourced, isn't. But the difference is, I'm not doing anything about the Big Brother 7 UK article, because <i>not every single damn word needs to have a source</i>. But more to the point, <i>not everything can be sourced</i>. We can't insert recordings of the actual show, so this is as good as it's going to get. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 12:24, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia still seems to be enforcing stronger guidelines about referencing requirement when activities that occur on <i>Big Brother</i> are being described. Why aren't similar references required in the articles about other television programs? The referencing rule for BB doesn't seem too specific to BB. Why isn't this applied to <i>all</i> articles about tv programs. Maybe we should start looking into this guideline itself? <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 12:29, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Problem with verification tag is it does not make clear which precise sentences need a reference. For example, if we keep this article (and <i>all</i> other series of BB have articles, so we probably will) then it is pretty useless to then intentionally exclude things like the innovations made this series, like the new <i>save</i> vote. But external references for this will be difficult to find; news reports only bother with the big events or the scandals. I also note that this page is <i>still</i> receiving intense attention: it has now had a new verification banner added, yet those other long descriptive tv show articles I mentioned (<i><a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../e/a/s/EastEnders_4f21.html" title="EastEnders">EastEnders</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmerdale.html" title="Emmerdale">Emmerdale</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guiding_Light_3221.html" title="Guiding Light">Guiding Light</a></i>), all of which have far fewer references than this article, haven't had that banner added at all! What inconsistency, especially after I've pointed-out that fact, and I even link-to the pages making it easy for the verification-keen editors to go add that tag to those pages too. I wonder why it never happened? Even the <i><a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Kane_0ced.html" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i> article features few references; certainly each sentence in that article is not cited. My understanding is that verification helps keep out original research and tempers bold claims; but if we are merely describing actual components of the program broadcast on TV then that is not original research, and though this article is probably a bit long, there's nothing too bold in it. And in any event, this BB06 article is still better referenced that many hundreds of other wikipedia articles. As a current series it is bound to get messy every few days; it will settle down after the series ends. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 22:01, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggested this on the main Big Brother page, but as it's not getting many responses, I'll just go around to the Big Brother pages where I'm most likely to get a response, and propose this there. I know I'm probably even less likely to receive a response here, but here goes anyway. I think the Big Brother pages should be renamed, to either <i>Big Brother Australia 6</i> or <i>Big Brother 6 Australia</i>, and the main Big Brother Australia page page should be named <i>Big Brother Australia</i>. --<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 19:54, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My belief is that a map or plan is one of the more useful things to have in an article such as this, and kudos to <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronchef90_cc8b.html" title="User:Ironchef90">Ironchef90</a> for uploading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:House360.gif" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:House360.gif" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:House360.gif</a> and adding useful info to the article on the various areas of the house.</p>
<p>A problem has arisen because <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">Wikipedia policy on fair use</a> requires that we should use this image only if: <i>"No free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information. If unfree material can be transformed into free material, it should be done instead of using a "fair use" defense. For example, the information in a newspaper article can easily be used as a basis of an original article and then cited as a reference. Maps and diagrams can often be redrawn from original sources, though simply "tracing" copyrighted material does not make it free. ..."</i></p>
<p>Therefore this is an appeal to regulars and everyone who values this article to help create a free equivalent to House360.gif. This is also an opportunity to help make a much cleaner image, as the original of House360 is used to link to 3d views of the house in java or quicktime - hence the strange markings on the image, about which some may have been curious.</p>
<p>An example to show how it could be done is on the UK Big Brother series 7 article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bb_uk_7_houseplan.svg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bb_uk_7_houseplan.svg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bb_uk_7_houseplan.svg</a></p>

<p>The table should have all the information that it has in it, in it. The removal and replacing of housemates is not common at all; replacements have only ever been added to the hosue once before, and that was after two housemates that cheated to get in the house got evicted. If they left voluntarily, then I would be able to see why that section isn't needed, but they hardly left under normal circumstances. —<font face="verdana"><small><a href="../../../j/d/_/User%7EJD_UK_d396.html" title="User:JD UK">JD</a></small>[<sup><a href="../../../j/d/_/User_talk%7EJD_UK_1391.html" title="User talk:JD UK">don't talk</a></sup>|<sub><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_JD_UK_2a54.html" title="Special:Emailuser/JD UK">email</a></sub></font>] 12:16, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
