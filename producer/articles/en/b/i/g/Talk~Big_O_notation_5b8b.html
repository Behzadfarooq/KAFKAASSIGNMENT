<p>"Big O notation"? It sounds like the name was created with the intention of teaching it to eight-year-olds... I can't believe that this is the accepted terminology. Unless I'm mistaken, "big O" stands for order (or some foreign equivalent), and in my experience in maths it's always been referred to as such. When I heard order notation formally introduced as "Big O notation" for the first time in computer science, I burst out laughing... You people are all mad&#160;:p. --203.206.183.160 14:38, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You say that like madness is a bad thing&#160;:-). However, mad or not, we professionals call it "big oh" more than anything else, especially when we are talking to each other. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">McKay</a> 06:16, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Meet "Wikiality" my friend. Big-O is the most commonly used term for it, no matter how ridiculous it sounds. It's taught in college's around the country and most professionals use that term for it. Thus, if the populous says it's right, it's right. --20:18, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree "big O" is a common term. However, I think (to write) "big Oh" goes too far. I don't think there is a serious reference for that (once again, for <b>writing</b> "Oh" - of course an O is (may be) pronounced "oh", and those who cannot distinguish a 0 from an O will have that problem elsewhere and should change their fonts or have the phrase read aloud by their navigator, so there are no excuses...). So I'll delete "big oh" from the 1st line, but leave "big o". — <a href="../../../m/f/h/User%7EMFH_a7c6.html" title="User:MFH">MFH</a>:<a href="../../../m/f/h/User_talk%7EMFH_e552.html" title="User talk:MFH">Talk</a> 16:30, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are the lim-sup and lim-inf definitions correct? I haven't seen them before. Reference this in the article, perhaps. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnelly_7db8.html" title="User:Connelly">Connelly</a> 00:15, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The lim-sup and lim-inf based definitions have vanished (in the table with the definitions). I do not know why (no comment was given at the appropriate changes), but the present lim based definitions of <span class="texhtml"><i>O</i>,Ω,Θ</span> are clearly wrong. Example: Consider the function <span class="texhtml"><i>f</i>(<i>n</i>): = 1</span> for even n and <span class="texhtml"><i>f</i>(<i>n</i>): = 2</span> for odd n. Clearly, it should be <img class='tex' src="../../../math/7/a/0/7a08dd9de18c7aa07cc820fa3498fabc.png" alt="f\in O(1),f\in\Omega(1),f\in\Theta(1)" />. But <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/4/c/44c388e98b5e5ba23ed7f0fe665d406f.png" alt="\lim |f/1|" /> does not exist. Further, the definition of <span class="texhtml">ω</span> does not consider the absolute value of <span class="texhtml"><i>f</i> / <i>g</i></span>. Then e.g. <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/3/0/130bc1a2915620ec3c30d7cf8594ace5.png" alt="-n^2\not\in\omega(n)" /> but <img class='tex' src="../../../math/4/b/4/4b401f2aa2ebf6570b99fe04d004a0f3.png" alt="n^2\in\omega(n)" /> (in contrast to the other definitions where a negation of f does not matter).</p>

<p>(the below moved from "Incorrect use of limits in table?" which is discussing the same thing):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Is the use of limits in the table of "relate asymtotic notations" correct? Knuth's definitions in the cited paper don't use them, and invoke instead "exist C and x_0 such that |f(x)| &lt; C g(x) forall x &gt; x_0". The "formal definition" section of this article (and linked articles) agrees with Knuth, but the limit in the table (it seems to me) doesn't say the same thing. Beyond that, Knuth's definitions are easier to read:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/5/1/95191103594e0b9b12063855cba0704a.png" alt="f(n) \in \theta(g(n)) \iff \exists\; C, C', n_{0} \;\; \forall (n&gt;n_{0}) \; Cg(n) \le f(n) \le C'g(n)" /></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He wrote these on a typewriter but it's a good chance to excercise my Latex skills.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I propose changing the table to match Knuth's definitions, or else justifying the use of limits with at least a reference. 203.4.250.143 15:16, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't think about your proposal, but I'll agree that the current defs have problems. Consider <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) = 1/<i>n</i> for odd <i>n</i> and <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) = 0 for even <i>n</i>, and <i>g</i>(<i>n</i>) = 1 for odd <i>n</i> and <i>g</i>(<i>n</i>) = 0 for even <i>n</i>. Then <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) = o(<i>g</i>(<i>n</i>)) by the usual definition but <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)/<i>g</i>(<i>n</i>) fails to exist half the time so its limsup is undefined. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">McKay</a> 04:04, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, you can also write it in soft-O, as in Õ(n). Is that "special"? --<a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovenhot_93bd.html" title="User:Rovenhot">Rovenhot</a> 00:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But Õ(n) doesn't specifically mean O(n log n). Logarithmic factors are ignored, but it's not implied that there was one in the first place. --203.206.183.160 14:16, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Thus, apparently, Õ(n) === O(n log n). The reason is that big-O is an upper bound, so inherently, it does not imply that the function has a logarithmic factor. --<a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovenhot_93bd.html" title="User:Rovenhot">Rovenhot</a> 20:57, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think some of them may be saying how to <i>pronounce</i> big-O. Still, Knuth is usually pretty canonical. Can we call the article "O-notation", and direct both big-O and big-oh here? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 19:23 29 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Isn't that the same case in omega and theta? My impression is that he O-notation or the big-O notation is in the same line with big-Θ and big-Ω because O is typically in italic like big-<i>O</i> notation while you cannot italize characters on the Internet.</dd>

<dd>Besides, actually I want to suggest to name this article asymptoic notations because we certaily want to cover little oh, big-theta and big-omega as well as big-oh.</dd>

<p>Only three out of 8 refer exclusively to "Big Oh". The other clarify O-notation to be pronounced "Big Oh", this is to avoid confusion with a zero. We already avoid this by having the text "with a capital letter O, not a zero". I see no reason to change the title from "Big O notation", since this is what Google likes the most, perfectly correct and does not require us to fix any double redirects (the way I know Taku's moves, he probably won't do it himself). However, a redirect here is of course acceptable.</p>

<p>No, in case of a much-linked page, it's preferable to</p>
<ol>
<li>Propose the move on the talk page with arguments. Announce that you will move the page within a few days if there are no objections.</li>
<li>If a consensus is reached, move the page and at the very least, fix double redirects (in this case, without editing the redir at <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_O_31e7.html" title="Big O">Big O</a>, 45 links would suddenly become broken).</li>
</ol>
<p>It is <i>not</i> desirable to leave Wikipedia in an inconsistent state (in this case, 45 links that suddenly show the user a confusing redirect page, because of the double redir caused by your move) because your move would then be "easier to revert". It should not have to be reverted, because it was properly discussed first.</p>
<p>You have the annoying habit of simply moving pages around without prior discussion, in the expectation that people will complain if they disagree.

<p>Anyway above is completely off-topic. Eloquence, you claim Goolgle likes the number of hits with"Big-O notation" is twice as much as that of "Big-oh notation". It is true (by the way, "big o-notation" with 6,450 while "big oh-notation" with 2,990). But my impression is that although big o outweights big-oh, pages with good and formal writing seem to use big-oh notation. First it is consistent with other notations, big-omega and big-theta. Omega and theta are pronounciation of each letter, but so is big-O. Besides, see the list above. Only one textbook uses Big-O notation. I think it is logical to think that the sentence like</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>O</i>, <i>&amp;Omega</i> and <i>&amp;Theta</i> (big-Oh, big-Omega, big-Theta) are used in CS. And this is called big-oh notation.

<p>(Forgive the lack of mathematical notation...) Technically speaking, isn't it "f(x) <i>is an element of</i> O(g(x))"? In the article, "equals" is used. I think big O is the <i>set of functions</i> with the appropriate property. <a href="../../../p/3/d/User%7EP3d0_7b66.html" title="User:P3d0">P3d0</a> 13:06, 1 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Technically that is correct. The thing is that the "=" notation is long established; I would say most authors I have seen use "=" when writing about asymtotic bounds. I know that when I initially studied this, I would change the "=" to "<img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/c/2/8c20c78b364ed5dbadd49e5b997aa1cc.png" alt="\in" />" in my head, since by context the latter is correct. However, I, apparently like others, became accustomed to "=" notation that is (I think) more widely used.</p>
<p>In light of this, I notice that the article mixes these two freely. I think we should pick one or the other, and I nominate "=". If no one objects I'll change it, but add an explanation similar to the one above to the appropriate article (since this applies to all asymtotic notation, not just big-O) Chris Connett 20:59, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, mixing the two could accustom the reader to recognize both forms, since they are both used in practice, and there are cases (certain math classes, for example) in which one notation or the other is preferred or even enforced. Also, I must personally argue that the <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/c/2/8c20c78b364ed5dbadd49e5b997aa1cc.png" alt="\in" /> notation is very logical and unambiguous. --<a href="../../../r/o/v/User%7ERovenhot_93bd.html" title="User:Rovenhot">Rovenhot</a> 21:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Essentially it means that the "missing terms" go to zero "much faster" than <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> does, not just "at the same rate". Thus, for example, it could be that <span class="texhtml"><i>e</i><sup><i>x</i></sup> = 1 + <i>x</i> + <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>x</i><sup>4</sup></span> (not true, of course, but it would satisfy your "little-o" statement above).

<p>The question is, should Wikipedia itself use Θ instead of <i>O</i> when both are correct, and the former is intended? (e.g. in discussing topics like the <a href="../../../f/f/t/FFT_86de.html" title="FFT">FFT</a> and sorting.)</p>
<p>I have a computer-science background, and I know the difference between these two...however, I also know that Θ(...) is essentially unknown outside of computer-science circles, while <i>O</i>(...) is widely used and, informally, more-or-less understood to mean Θ. At a certain point, when usage becomes widespread enough, it ceases to be "incorrect" (it's only notation, after all).</p>
<p>One argument is that, since Θ is so little-known, its appearance will only confuse most people...thus, one should use <i>O</i> as long as it is correct (even if it is weaker than necessary) except in cases where one wishes to explicitly distinguish between the two. On the other hand, one could use Θ whereever possible, making the symbol a link to this page...requiring an extra page of reading for people not familiar with it, but hoping that most people will simply guess that the symbol looks like <i>O</i> so it means what they expect.</p>

I think for all that grows faster than exponential, one eventually takes the log and discusses the growth class of the latter. i.e.:</p>

<p>I know this is a really minor point, but can we standardize the italicization of <i>O</i>? Is it <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) or O(<i>n</i>)? It's displayed both ways on this page. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaesura_ad40.html" title="User:Caesura">Caesura</a> 19:17, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>What do the formal properties mean? In particular, what is the meaning of O(fg) = O(f)O(g)? --<a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoUrfahraner_7166.html" title="User:NeoUrfahraner">NeoUrfahraner</a> 14:11, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The only possible meaning of this would be that if <i>h=O(fg)</i>, <i>f'=O(f)</i>, <i>g'=O(g)</i>, then <i>h = O(f' g')</i>, but the previous notation is indeed not completely well defined/correct.

<p>What I am missing on this page is remarks on the relation between the various notions, in particular between Big-O and little-o. Intuitively, it seems that f=o(g) iff f=O(g) and g!=O(f). The "only if" direction of this claim is clearly true, but I am not so sure about the "if" direction. Is it true? If yes, it should be noted in the section discussing Big o and little o. If it is not true, there should be a brief remark why this is the case.</p>
<p>After a bit more thinking, I see now that the converse of the above does not hold. Take the following functions:</p>
<p>f(n) = 2^n if n is even, and n if n is odd</p>
<p>g(n) = 0.5 n</p>
<p>Then f=O(g), g!=O(f), an f!=o(g). I guess the converse holds only for monotonic functions.</p>

<dd>In fact g=O(f) in that example. You need f(n)=n, g(n)=mixture of n or 2^n. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">McKay</a> 14:48, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're correct as far as I can tell. One way of fixing this might be to say that f=o(g) iff f=O(g) and f≠Θ(g). <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 11:41, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This should really be moved to order of growth, asymptotic growth of a function, or something to that effect. Describing orders of growth in an article called "Big O notation" makes about as much sense as describing limits in an article called "limit notation", addition in an article called "summation notation", or for that matter mathematics under "mathematical notation". Of course, the notation must be described, but that's not the <i>primary</i> purpose of the article. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredrik_8a6d.html" title="User:Fredrik">Fredrik</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFredrik_61e6.html" title="User talk:Fredrik">talk</a> 11:40, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Two comments on notation.</p>
<ol>
<li>As someone stated above, "=" is much more common than "is" or <img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/c/2/8c20c78b364ed5dbadd49e5b997aa1cc.png" alt="\in" /> so it should be used throughout with the other notations given only as alternatives.</li>
<li>The explanation given for "f(x) = h(x) + O(g(x))" is inadequate. Strictly speaking it is correct, but it does not allow for slightly more complex statements like "f(x) + O(j(x)) = h(x) + O(g(x))" or even "f(x) = h(x) + O(g(x))+ O(j(x))". Such patterns are commonplace in asymptotic analysis. Also consider "n<sup>O(1)</sup>=O(e<sup>n</sup>)". I'll try to formulate a general rule.</li>

<p>I'm a mathematician, and I can honestly say I have never seen the "element of" notation used in connection with the big O notation. Is this something that's common in computer science? If not, it should be deleted from the article.--209.43.9.143 19:19, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, it isn't common in computer science either. There are some popular textbooks that use it but it has not caught on amongst the professionals. Despite the oddities of how "=" is used with <i>O</i>( ), it is what the vast majority of mathematicians and computer scientists use, so we should use it too. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">McKay</a> 03:18, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Everyone in practice seems to use the "=", but I think it's important to at least mention the element of syntax.

<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I removed supralinear from <i>n</i> log <i>n</i>. I've never seen it with this particular meaning outside of Wikipedia, but I have seen it used to mean "superlinear". In any case it's uncommon.</li>
<li>I removed an incorrect entry with <i>n</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> as "exponential".</li>
<li>I added double exponential to the table.</li>
<li>I added examples of all complexities.</li>
<li>I removed the sublinear row. This should be mentioned somewhere, but it doesn't really fit on the table (all others could be expressed with Θ, for example).</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that might need work:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not happy with my example for factorial complexity; is there a more standard example? Ideally it would be ω(<i>c</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>) for all <i>c</i>.</li>
<li>AKS is usually thought of as polynomial (in the size of the number rather than in the number itself); should I use a different example then for polylogarithmic complexity?</li>
<li>Should I specify both constants in the double exponential, or should I leave one fixed for simplicity's sake?</li>
<li>Is there a term for the 'epsilon complexities'? I'm thinking in particular of O(<i>n</i><sup><i>n</i>+ε</sup>) = O(<i>n</i><sup>o(1)</sup>) (the first is for all ε &gt; 0), but others also come up. This is a wider class than just soft-O of n; it would include, for example, <i>n</i> (log(<i>n</i>))<sup><i>n</i></sup>.</li>
<li>Is there a term for sublinear complexities of the form O(<i>n</i><sup><i>c</i></sup>), like baby-step giant-step?</li>
<li>I'm not terribly happy with the wording of the examples in general; if you have a better idea, please suggest it.</li>
</ul>
<p>General notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the examples is to give an idea of the kinds of problems these classes represent. I'm less worried about specifying them precisely than I am of keeping them simple; the entries on the individual classes can iron out any wrinkles. As such, I don't intend to mention, for example, that oddness and evenness can be tested for in constant time only when the number is represented in an even base not dependant on the number.</li>

<dd>I noticed that, too, and I think it would occur to a fair number of readers familiar with computing but not the notation in particular. Perhaps zero or non-zero?

<dd>I like it as it is now -- Big O notation as the main page, with other pages like Hardy notation and Vinogradov notation explaining variants on it.

<p>The article at the moment uses a real mess of different notations. This won't do.

<p>In the properties section there is a paragraph on the effects of changing units. This implies that doing so can affect the order of the algorithm, which sounds counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>It also says (in part): "If, however, an algorithm runs in the order of <span class="texhtml">2<sup><i>n</i></sup></span>, replacing n with cn gives <span class="texhtml">2<sup><i>c</i><i>n</i></sup> = (2<sup><i>c</i></sup>)<sup><i>n</i></sup></span>.

<dd>No, the article is correct. e.g. <span class="texhtml">2<sup><i>n</i></sup></span> is <span class="texhtml"><i>o</i>(3<sup><i>n</i></sup>)</span>, i.e. asymptotically smaller.

<p>With the way <span class="texhtml"><i>O</i>(<i>n</i>)</span> is defined, it would almost seem to confuse comparisons of the running time of algorithms. Suppose we have two functions, <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>n</i>) = <i>n</i></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>n</i>) = <i>n</i><sup>2</sup></span>.

Now, when deciding which algorithm is the fastest, you would think that <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><sub>2</sub></span> would be the best to implement, when, clearly, this is not actually the case.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could add some comment about usefulness -- namely that in order to compare two functions, say <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><sub>2</sub></span>, we find minimal, 'monic' expressions (i.e. without any arbitrary constants -- for the sake of cleanliness: it is really seen that <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>O</i>(5<i>n</i>)</span>) for <span class="texhtml"><i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)</span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>g</i>(<i>n</i>)</span> before proclaiming that <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>O</i>(<i>f</i>(<i>n</i>))</span> and <span class="texhtml"><i>T</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>O</i>(<i>g</i>(<i>n</i>))</span>.

<p>I'm not a mathematician, but I like math. I also like Unix, and the big O notation comes up a lot in Unix. My understanding of it is: for a function f(n), O(f(n)) is the maximum number of iterations that may be required to compute f(n).</p>
<p>It seems to match the examples given in the article:</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes one operation to tell whether a number is odd or even.</li>
<li>14 people in a hight scholl have signed up for yearbook. It takes 14 operations ("reads") at most to tell whether Michelle is one of them. (A sign-up sheet is an unsorted list, right?)</li>
<li>I takes at most about log <i>n</i> operations to find Ms. Lucy McGillicuddy in the phone book. That seems about right. For a natural algorithm, that's 14 operation to find her in the phone book of a city with 3 million people, and 6 operations in a small town of 1,000. For a base-10 logarithm, it drops to 6 and 3 respectively. Both seem in the correct range. (Though I assume that here <i>log</i> means natural logarithm, which makes a lot more sense.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Did I get this right?</p>
<p>If I did, what the £%*µ! does THIS mean?</p>

<p>1. What's <i>g</i>? I assume that <i>g</i>(x) is the same as O(<i>f</i>(x))</p>
<p>2. Same thing for M. What is M? It makes sense in the mathematical <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_O_notation_de3e.html#Example" title="Big O notation">example</a>, but not in the practical ones, the ones <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_O_notation_de3e.html#Common_orders_of_functions" title="Big O notation">Common_orders_of_functions</a>.</p>
<p>The second definition, I can sort of make out:</p>
<ul>
<li>There exists a specific value of x called <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i><sub>0</sub></span>.</li>
<li>There also exists a positive constant M.</li>
<li>Let's define a new function g(x).</li>
<li>After the function f(x) has passed <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i><sub>0</sub></span>, this is, for all values of x GREATER than <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i><sub>0</sub></span>, the absolute value of f(x) will always be smaller than the absolute value of g(x), after g(x) is multiplied by the constant M.</li>
<li>Big O of f(x) is that g(x).</li>
</ul>
<p>But I don't understand how this relates to the examples I gave above. (If they are indeed right.)</p>
<p>If that vulgarisation of the mathematical definition is correct, how can I apply it to the sign-up sheet or the phone book examples? Or for that matter to the odd and even problem? How can I apply the two mathematical definitions to those problems?</p>
<p>The closest I can get is with the sign-up sheet example. f(x) is defined as follows. There are n names on a list. Each x is a person looking for someone on the sign-up sheet, reading from top to bottom. In the best-case scenario, the person they're looking for is the first, they only have to read one name. In the worst-case, they are looking for the last name and have to read all of the names on the list. The maximum number of operations requited in n. Thus Big O of f(x) is O(n). Would <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i><sub>0</sub></span> be the first person to read all of the names? If there are 14 names on the, list f(x) will always be less or equal to 14. But in my example, how do x and n relate to the mathematical definition? In the mathematical definition, both f and g use the same argument.</p>

<dd>Your understanding is a little off. Given some problem P, which involves an integer n, let f(n) be the number of operations it takes to solve problem P for n. To say that for some f(n) and g(n), f(n) = O(g(n)), it means that there exists some integer x_0, and some constant c (not depending on n) such that when n &gt; x_0, it is true that f(n) &lt;= c * g(n). For example, depending on what you count as an 'operation', checking whether an integer is even or odd may take 1 operation, or it may take 50. However, f(n) = O(1) means that there exists an x_0, and a constant c (maybe 1, maybe 50, maybe 100, maybe 1000000) such that when n &gt;= x_0, it is true that f(n) &lt;= c. The x_0 is like a starting point. For example, the function f(x) = {x^2 if x &lt; 1000, 123 if x &gt;= 1000} is O(1), since eventually it is O(1) (here x_0 would be any number greater than 999). Does this help?

<dd>Thanks, Rob. you do make it a bit clearer. My point about asking this <i>here</i>, specifically, is that I think that Wikipedia can be about making this understandable to people like me. I think (but I could be wrong) that rather than delete this, the sort of definition you've just given me should actually go into the article. If I'm completely wrong, just tell me and I won't insist, but I think that including a vulgarised explanation would draw people to understand the whole and that's what Wikipedia is about. Also, asking on the Talk page may get people to use what you just wrote to figure this out too. <a href="../../../e/j/e/User%7EEje211_5793.html" title="User:Eje211">Eje211</a> 20:09, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I got it. If f(x) is seeking in an unsorted list of x elements (any element, a random number between 1 and x in a shuffled series of numbers from one to x) and returns the position of the sought item (which is also the number of items previously checked). Let's say f(x) belongs to O(1) (which is false). Then, as x goes to infinity, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/c/e/0/ce0affb125581ddb0823f4c54fa30a9e.png" alt="\limsup_{x \to \infty} \left|\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right| &lt; \infty" /> can't always be right, because f(x) can reach infinity and g(x) is always 1.</dd>

<dd>And, no matter what M or x_0 are, <img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/1/b/b1b5e726fadb08c62f83743392ecb7c5.png" alt="\exists \;x_0,\exists \;M&gt;0\mbox{ such that } |f(x)| \le \; M |g(x)|\mbox{ for all }x&gt;x_0." />, f(x) can get to infinity and g(x) cannot. However, if g(x) = x, then, both make sense.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And, if a function changes values of O as it progresses, we only want the last one. In the example given in the article, for f(x) = 6x^4 + 2x^3 + 5, g(x) = x^4 because it's its fastest growing possible speed. (It's also its first. x_0, here, is 0, right?)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And if a function can only return two real values (like in the odd and even example), O(1) works with M being the largest value, and x_0 the LAST occurrence of the largest value.</dd>

Big-O notation is just a way of being able to compare expected run times
without getting bogged down in detail.
Suppose you need to run an algorithm on a set of n inputs. Perhaps the actual
number of 'operations' (however you choose to define that term) that would 
need to be carried out is something like:
    2n^2 + 3n - 5
This is really only interesting when n gets large, in which case the only term
that really matters is the n^2 term, which dwarfs the  others. And in fact, the
constant coefficient isn't really that important, either. So we just say that
the algorithm runs in 'order n squared' time, or O(n^2)."
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>From this, what I get is: g(x) is the fastest growing element, the one that "trumps all others", as Dr. Math puts it. Also, if there are several, we only look at last one (which starts at x_0) within the given range to seek, or the very last one if our range is infinite. Am I closer now? <a href="../../../e/j/e/User%7EEje211_5793.html" title="User:Eje211">Eje211</a> 21:06, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, if f(x) is a polynomial in x, then for x-&gt;infinity, f(x)=O( x^d ) where d is the degree of the polynomial. But not all functions f grow like some polynomial... (you can have terms like x^3 * log(x) or exp( 5 x ) etc.). In general, if you have a sum of several terms and one will grow faster than all others, the function is O( this term). If you have a product of terms (like x^2*log(x)) you have to keep all factors, except if one factor goes to a constant (e.g. x^5 exp(-x) = O(x^5) since exp(-x) -&gt; 1). (I don't know what would be the meaning of x_0 in general). — <a href="../../../m/f/h/User%7EMFH_a7c6.html" title="User:MFH">MFH</a>:<a href="../../../m/f/h/User_talk%7EMFH_e552.html" title="User talk:MFH">Talk</a> 20:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is an interesting concept. Would it then be true that <img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/f/7/5f7438ae7df29b56ad6016430cbfd6ae.png" alt="2^{-x} \ne \Omega(1)" />?

<dd>Yep, I don't think you negated the inequality correctly. The inverse of ≥ is &lt;, not ≤, so it would be <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/1/a/91a89b46046b7729f2b58b81d3120a6e.png" alt="\forall M &gt; 0: \exists x: |f(x)| &lt; M|g(x)|" />, which is the definition of little-o.</dd>

<dd>No, no, no, that's completely wrong. You are confusing "there exists arbitrarily large <i>x</i>" with "for all sufficiently large <i>x</i>". Consider the function <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>) such that <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)=<i>n</i> for even <i>n</i> and <i>f</i>(<i>n</i>)=1/<i>n</i> for odd <i>n</i>. This function is <i>neither</i> Ω(1) nor <i>o</i>(1). <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMcKay_32b8.html" title="User:McKay">McKay</a> 07:36, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even though this is about a 'scientific' or 'mathematical' subject, the summery should be much more approachable. I believe it should be changed to something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big O notation roughly estimates the runtime, a relative measure of computer instructions, of a function in terms of n where n is the size of the input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is much more clear and less cryptic. No one without significant education is going to understand the current summery, let alone page. It's like some one is trying to validate their extended education by making this simple topic more complex than it actually is. This should be simplified to meet wikipedia standards. --65.189.189.23 22:40, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree completely that we should be as clear as possible for beginners. Unfortunately, your suggested text won't work.</p>
<p>First of all, the use in computer science is just a specialization of its use in mathematical analysis. But even assuming you're only talking about its application in the complexity theory and the analysis of algorithms, it has several serious problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big O can be used to characterize <i>any</i> characteristic of an algorithm, whether it's runtime or amount of storage needed or number of times it calls a given functional argument (or <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle_%28computer_science%29.html" title="Oracle (computer science)">oracle</a> or even the numeric precision of the result.</li>
<li>Though it is true that Big O can be used to characterize the upper bounds of execution time for "functions" in complexity theory, it is also commonly used to characterize specific <i>algorithms</i>. There is a huge difference. There are many different algorithms that embody the "sort" function, for example: there are things you can say about the complexity of sorting in general, but there are also things you can say about the concrete complexity of particular algorithms.</li>
<li>The number of instructions executed is often a good proxy for runtime, but even if you're only interested in runtime, things like cache</li>
<li>The arguments of Big O can refer to <i>any</i> property of the input, not just its size. For example, in polynomial factorization, they may refer to the input degree.</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, though I agree completely that we need to make an effort to be simple, we also have to be accurate. I'll be happy to work with you and other editors to improve the article. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 00:14, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What about this:
<dl>
<dd><i>Big O notation is commonly used to estimates a program's runtime, as a function of n where n is the size of the input.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It brings up the most common use, without limiting Big O to just that.</dd>

<dd>Well, the <i>n</i> isn't essential. How about:
<dl>
<dd>Big O notation is often used to characterize an algorithm's running time as a function of the size of the input.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I'm not completely happy with that, but... --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 19:22, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about: Big O notation is often used to estimate an algorithm's performance, usually speed or memory usage, typically as a function of the size of the input. Big O notation is also used in many other scientific and mathematical fields to provide similar estimations.</p>
