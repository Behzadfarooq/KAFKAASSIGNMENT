<p>Hi. Your contributions are very decent, but you make one mistakeâ€”you're not supposed to put your signature in articles. Notice how nobody else's signatures are there? Neither should your be. If you check these: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mora_%28game%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48810111" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mora_%28game%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48810111" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kukkiwon&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48810819" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kukkiwon&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48810819" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Taekwondo_Federation&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48812063" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=World_Taekwondo_Federation&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=48812063" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taekwondo&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49347987" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taekwondo&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49347987" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taekwondo&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49379901" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taekwondo&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49379901" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, you will see that in all cases, the edits include removing your added signatures. This is not done for harm, but because you <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html#Don.27t_sign_what_you_don.27t_own" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">do not sign what you do not own</a>.</p>
<p>Enough about that for now, happy editing.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkPhoenix_bdac.html" title="User:DarkPhoenix">DarkPhoenix</a> 10:11, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bigzilla, I recommend you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proofread your edits. There's a huge number of edits after each of your changes cleaning up your typos</li>
<li>Check your facts and find references. You've constantly been trying to change the Belt section on 10th Dan, but I found a reference today to 2 honorary 10th Dans being given by the WTF which invalidates the information you keep trying to put in. All Wikipedia articles should be verifiable. Either find a reference or stop making unsubstantiated claims.</li>
<li>Discuss your changes on the discussion section</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Thank you for the advise on name signing and typos. My understanding of this technology, and my writing skills need refinement. I've been working on this.</p>
<p>As far as the belt section, it had gross mistakes and led readers to believe that the WTF issues Dan. The WTF does not issue it's own Dan, it may however, award honorary Kukkiwon Dan of various levels, including 10th Dan, which is very rare. Many persons are confused in regard to Kukkiwon and WTF. They are very seperate organizations and this should be noted. My edits are based on information I learned training at the Kukkiwon and being involved in the affairs of the WTF.</p>
<p>On the WTF website it states that all issues regarding Dan should be addressed to the Kukkiwon. One can simply e-mail the WTF and ask if they issue Dan and get their answer direct. Also, WTF is not a style of Taekwondo, the WTF is a tournament organizing committee in addition to being the International Federation (IF) for Taekwondo competition for the IOC. The Kukkiwon is the academy and educational institution of Taekwondo. I think now I sign my name? --Bigzilla 07:38, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article you edited is about the word an concept not the website (see <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshido.net.html" title="Bullshido.net">Bullshido.net</a>) please reconsider your edits taking this into account. You have removed a large amount of information on the use of the term why?</p>
<p>&gt;because the article is very negative and has an agenda. Many highly qualified martial arts schools use contracts, belt promotion fees, etc, and have for many decades. The article is writen from the point of view of the wannabe tough guy and is just his uneducated experience.--Bigzilla 06:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article is about a derogatry descriptive word so is nessasarily negative. The article was created by a consesnous of edditors who consider it to be from a netural point of new.</dd>

<p>While i don't have sources to hand, from what I can remember some of Bruce Lee's fight took place in public. do you have any sources to back this up?</p>
<p>&gt;So, you don't have sources at hand? Because there are no sources for ANY Bruce Lee fights. Good luck, if you find them, please share with us.--Bigzilla 06:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the book "Bruce Lee Fighting Spirit" by Bruce Thomas <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-330-34930-9</a> has various accounts of fights, on page 30 it mentions that he was repetedly reported to the police. On page 29 it mentions him fighting in the 1958 boxing championship involving 12 Hong Kong schools defeats the reigning three year champion, Gary Elms.

<p>To be honest I can't be botherd to did out sourece for you if you want to belive it it's up to you, even if you only take him as a popular MA flim actor it it quoted as an opinon held by him.<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate1481</a> 17:59, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can google Mickey Mouse and get more hits than that, but that does not make Mickey an authority. Maybe you have heard of him, maybe I have heard of him, but the mass majority of martial artist have no idea who he is, unlike Mickey.--Bigzilla 06:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was an appropreate example for the context, he is more well kown then many Martial artists, you are however free to disagree with his opinion but saying he is completly unknow is inacurate. My point is that if soemone wants to find who he is then they can. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate1481</a> 17:59, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could you please give sourses of "Mixed martial arts is the worst of all. It is a mess of exagerated stories and claims"</p>
<p>Could you give me examples of where MMA is not? Myabe I'll change my opinion if you can show me enought that are not "mess of exagerated stories and claims"?</p>
<p>Wikipedia policy is that if you want something in an article you are the one required to produce evidence, you can have whatever opinion you wish.<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate1481</a> 17:59, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As the modern sport of MMA has been widely televised (Does this count a records?)</p>
<p>&gt;No.</p>
<pre>
:why? <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate1481</a> 17:59, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
</pre>
<pre>
Some MMA coaches can trace there linage (if they claim any) to schools that have produced competative fighters or use their own fight record, considering that MMA is effectively a new disapline this is all the lineage that might be required.
</pre>
<p>&gt;Then their lineage comes to a grinding halt. That's not all that is required to have a lineage in martial arts, but I guess in MMA you can just make up the rules as you go along, oh wait, MMA is not supposed to have rules because everyone is a tough guy, silly me :)--Bigzilla 06:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What else is required? Is older/longer linage (so more <i>chance</i> for alteration) nessasealy better?</dd>
<dd>Most modern MMA does have rules to protect the competetors, but to allow for diffrent modes of fighting these are kept to a minumum. see the Mixed martial arts, article. Most MMA people don't care that much aobut lineage they use their fight record, the complaint is about false <b>claims</b> of lineage and effectiveness, and not about the lack of it<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate1481</a> 17:59, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
The comments on qualifications are also probably unjustified as there are martial atist of various styles who contribute to the teaching of MMA unless you can site sources of this it should be removed.&lt;
</pre>
<p>According to your "bullsh***" article, would not "martial artist of various styles" by part of your so-called "bullsh***" myth? Do these "martial artist of various styles" have authentic lineages? Or are they part of the group that likes to cross certify eachother with Kinko's generated certificates?--Bigzilla 06:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No i'm refering to the fact you get BJJ, boxing, Mauy Thai, Judo coaches teaching people who compete in MMA [Http://www.bjj.org has linages for BJJ as to the others Judo as a regulatory body and coaches can trace a lineage to Kano so to various Japanese JuJitsu ryu.<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate1481</a> 17:59, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
