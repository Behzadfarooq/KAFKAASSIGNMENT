<dd>Take a look at it now ... there was a bunch of extra Adobe data in there. I'm guessing that the software that runs Wikipedia was having trouble rendering it in some cases.

<p>If you want to protect this page against creation, simply transcluding the image at a size of 1px would do the trick. I suspect, however, that it's unlikely that this particular (seemingly random) title will be targeted for the same vandalism again. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 18:48, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your message to Trejm just popped up in my watchlist.

<dd>I have no objection to it being speedied ... I usually don't speedy music-related things myself unless it's obvious that we're talking about high school kids that hope to make a CD if daddy will buy them a pack of CDs.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I tried to answere the issue that concerned you. I edited under other names and then I made this user name to be consistent with other Iranians. Then I understood that I can not move my previous works to this user name. Therefore I renamed my previous usernames as Sangak1,2 and 3. Its now 8 month that I am writing under Sangak about science and art. I also write about history of religion and contemporary history under pen name Sina as explained in my page. The range of articles I edit by these two names have almost no overlap. Unfortunately there is no way to merge my works to a single name. I consulted with admins last year and they said there exist no way for that. In summary 10% of my edits (~5000) were in talkpages. Thanks. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESangak_f537.html" title="User:Sangak">Sangak</a> 16:28, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But that has nothing to do with Wikipedia space participation (pages that start with Wikipedia:). Administrators have buttons that allow them to delete and protect pages and block users. So it is necessary, before supporting you, to know that you know when to use these buttons. If you participate in deletion discussions, that tells us that you know when to hit the delete button. If you report repeated vandals to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, after they have vandalized after being warned with {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}}, that tells us that you know when to hit the block button. Discussing possible changes or updates to Wikipedia guidelines on Wikipedia talk pages shows that you understand policies. I, for one, don't really care that much what you do ... the whole point is to gain experience with and an understanding of Wikipedia policies and processes. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 16:50, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, BigDT,</p>
<p>I see that you are both a ScoutingWikiProject member and a WikiAdmins! Before I knew those things, you helped me a few days ago find relevant info to upload an image of the DESA on its neck ribbon (Image:DESA2007.jpg) and then remove my IP from the logs (I had forgotten to log in)...</p>
<p>Here's my dilemma, in stages (thanks for your patience!):</p>
<p>Once I set up that new image, as a DESA honoree, I decided to add my name to the list of notable Eagle Scouts (after reading the criteria, etc.). That got me to thinking that this listing would not have a link back to any article, as most of those listed do. (I began to "think more about Wikipedia"!)</p>
<p>To start this, I next created a page covering an national Mentoring Award I have established, and that page seems to have "survived" (<a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonald_Award_for_Excellence_in_Mentoring_and_Advising_4a1f.html" title="McDonald Award for Excellence in Mentoring and Advising">McDonald Award for Excellence in Mentoring and Advising</a>).</p>
<p>I then got to thinking about a page concerning myself, which took quite a few hours to research (for facts, images, references and links) and to type up in Wiki fashion. I uploaded that a few minutes ago as <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capers_McDonald_af0e.html" title="Capers McDonald">Capers McDonald</a> -- only to see a message saying:</p>
<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">
<tr>
<td width="20" valign="top" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:35px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:10px 10px;">“</td>
<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;"><i>"It is proposed that this article be deleted, because of the following concern:</i>
<p>Notability in question. ghits: [1]</p>
<p>If you can address this concern by improving, copyediting, sourcing, renaming or merging the page, please edit this page and do so. You may remove this message if you improve the article, or if you otherwise object to deletion of the article for any reason. To avoid confusion, it helps to explain why you object to the deletion, either in the edit summary or on the talk page. If this template is removed, it should not be replaced.</p>
<p>The article may be deleted if this message remains in place for five days.{{{1}}} This template was added 2007-02-04; five days from then is 2007-02-09.</p>
<p>If you created the article, please don't take offense. Instead, consider improving the article so that it is acceptable according to the deletion policy."</p>
</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The number of Google hits for "Capers McDonald" (as posted) combined with "Capers W. McDonald" and "Capers Walter McDonald" is approximately 800. If that count is simply insufficient, I guess those are the community rules.</p>
<p>However, I'm wondering if this is the case -- how about the number of searches that are done to those relevant sources? I know there are constantly students, Scouts, parents, business people, educators, government officials and others finding me through the Web and talking to me about common interests. Not to press this too far, but how about other metrics, such as being a Distinguished Eagle Scout, or having established the Mentoring Award (with its annually increasing honorees), or having won some national recognitions (such as an entrepreneur of the year, and ethical business person)?</p>
<p>So, my obvious question to you is: What should I be doing now? Is there something that's more productive than taking your valuable time to help me get oriented...</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, Wikipedalist 19:52, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ok ... there are several questions/points here ... I'll try to address everything.&#160;;)
<ul>
<li>When an article is nominated for deletion using a {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} (as this one was), anyone (including the creator of the article), may remove the template to stop the deletion process. A {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} is used for an uncontested deletion - so anyone is allowed to object and the means of objecting is simply to remove the template. In that case, if someone still wants to pursue deletion of the article, the issue would be taken to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. So if you would like to stop the article from being deleted after the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} expires, simply remove the template.</li>
<li>There is no exact standard on "g-hits", or "google hits". Google is best used as a tool to confirm whether the subject of the article is real or fictional. There are plenty of people who are subjects of Wikipedia articles who will get very few Google hits. On the other hand, a company that is trying to launch an advertising campaign may get 50,000 Google hits, but be a very minor company which does not meet Wikipedia's notability standards. There's no magic number of Google hits that makes a topic notable ...</li>
<li>We are strongly advised against writing about ourselves - see <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. The thought is that we want Wikipedia to be a serious and neutral encyclopedia and most people will not write neutral articles about themselves.</li>
<li>Wikipedia's guidlines for notability of individual persons are given in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, as well as <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. The biggest question is whether there are multiple non-trivial published works that provide information about a topic. Wikipedia's fundamental policies include that articles must consist of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a> and must have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. So any topic that you could not write about while citing sourced independent of your own personal knowledge probably should not be on Wikipedia.</li>
<li>To answer your obvious question, there isn't anything more important for me to do than help new users - I'm always happy to help in any way I can. In general, I think taking a look at some of the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a> pages and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a> guidelines is the biggest thing you can do to grow as an editor. There's a lot of background that you can learn from them.</li>
<li>With respect to this I think, in general, autobiographical articles are a bad thing. I think, probably the best thing to do with it is to "userfy" it. You have a user page that, within reason, you can use for whatever you want. My user page is <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">User:BigDT</a> ... your's is User:Wikipedalist. I would suggest just moving this article to your user page. It would not be considered a part of the encyclopedia, but you would be free to leave it there, unimpeded. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please, if you tag something that might be transcluded somewhere else for speedy deletion, like Talk:American Foxhound/Comments, add &lt;noinclude&gt; around the speedy deletion tag. Otherwise, it can make it annoying to figure out where the speedy deletion tag is coming from, especially when <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a> is filled up.

<p>Thanks for your notes on my talk page about nominating myself for RFA.</p>
<p>I would be very interested in being nominated for adminship if you were willing to nominate me. As I indicated to someone else a while back, I would never self nominate myself - I have some fundimental issue with that. Same basic issue I have with asking someone else to nominate me.</p>
<p>My one weakness with a nomination would be the limited article creation I have done. Most of my work has been around the clean up of stuff.

<p>Hi, I don't know why the two images at <a href="../../../w/a/i/Waitara%2C_New_Zealand_7abf.html" title="Waitara, New Zealand">Waitara, New Zealand</a> have been targeted for deletion. I have followed fully the procedure for uploading the images Waitara 1.jpg and Waitara 2.jpg. I obtained written permission from the copyright owner, forwarded this by email to the address given at the Wikipedia article on image copyright, noted on the talk page of the article that I had done this and attached what, to the best of my knowledge, was the correct tag on the image. I'm sorry, but the obscure shorthand of "(Not an orphan) tagged as GFDL and as all rights released, source website gives no indication of either BigDT 12:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)" is just insufficient explanation of what is lacking. Can you please explain what else is required to keep these two images at this page? Thank you. Grimhim 21:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What address did you forward the letter of permission to - "permissions-en AT wikimedia DOT org"? Can you do this? (1) On the image description page, copy/paste the text of the email you received granting permission for the images to be released (removing email addresses, names, other personal information) and (2) note in the discussion on<a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion</a> that you have done so? This will allow us to look at the permission that you have received and determine that it meets Wikipedia's requirements.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Remember, it is important that the letter of permission say something like, "we release the image under the GFDL", not just, "you can use it on Wikipedia". Wikipedia can only use the image if it is released under a "free" license, meaning, one that allows anyone to use it for any purpose - simply allowing it to be used on Wikipedia is insufficient.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, please keep in mind that plenty of times, images are uploaded with false licensing information. Any image that was not created by the uploader that has only a source and a license tag with no explanation for the license is going to be looked at carefully.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I hope this helps ... if I can help you with any other image questions, please feel free to ask.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:13, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I have checked the email address I forwarded the permission to: it is exactly as you mention, so I'm baffled at why these images have still been targeted for deletion. However I have copied the copyright owner's email to both image pages and also left a message on the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion</a> page.

<dd>I thought I had ... oversight ... I also removed the "All rights released" template since that's not technically the case.

<p>You deleted an image that is currently being discussed. I made a Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Green Bay Packers request for mediation on the issue. The user has uploaded new higher resolution versions of almost every NFL team and has taken the old one out. This seems to violate <a href="../../../f/u/c/WP%7EFUC_7b76.html" title="WP:FUC">WP:FUC</a> #3. Just confusing why the original small one was delete while it was being discussed. I'm trying to settle this dispute, so I hope you can help me out; I'm not quite sure if I'm doing this right. I'm trying to avoid an edit war and discussing the issue, while the other user hasn't said much, just how it looks nicer.

<p>I'm working on finishing the preliminary code for an IFD bot, the current plan is to check all the images in Categories: Images and media for deletion and see if they have been listed in the last 20 days else relist them at the current IFD page. The first run is going to dump to a user sub page as to not flood IFD so an admin will have to go through them (aprox 300).

<p>Hi, BigDT... Now I find that two of the thumb images in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capers_McDonald_af0e.html" title="Capers McDonald">Capers McDonald</a> article are not printing (or showing on print preview, either). They appear to be formatted exactly as thumb images that print from other articles. Also, frustratingly, they show and print when in Editing Preview mode, but not when saved. They are the "MBA Fellows Program" and "BioAlliance visit" thumbs... Any quick ideas? Thanks, Wikipedalist 21:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as printing goes, try going to "Page setup" and changing it from portrait to landscape mode. It looks like portrait is just too narrow for whatever HTML Wikipedia is generating to fit everything on the page. As far as the image not showing up in the article, are you still having a problem with it? I looked at the article and the images look fine. If the problem is still occuring, what browser are you using? --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:57, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Could you please recommend what I should do? The map was taken from a book cover.

<dd>Please see <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html#Policy" title="WP:FAIR">WP:FAIR#Policy</a> #9. Non-free images can only be used in article space and then, only under an appropriate claim of fair use. We can use book covers to illustrate an article about the book, but not just because it has a picture that is helpful. The simple version of it is that you can use Bob's work for an article on Bob or an article on the work itself - you can't use Bob's work for an article on something else or somebody else. Also, please note that any manipulation of that map would merely be a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:derivative_works" class="extiw" title="commons:Commons:derivative_works">derivative work</a> - and thus, non-free. Really, the only solution is to find or create a free map. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="commons:Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a> has a number of free maps - see <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Dravidian_languages" class="extiw" title="commons:Category:Dravidian_languages">Commons:Category:Dravidian languages</a> - maybe one of these images would work?

<p>Can you please help me learn to do it correctly? The nomination will still be withdrawed, but I would like to learn for the next time, and I would like just use <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProveIt_5236.html" title="User:ProveIt">ProveIt</a> as an example. I know that the instructions are at<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_nominate_0df3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/nominate">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/nominate</a>. This is what I did.</p>
<p>1. I went to where it says <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_nominate_0df3.html#To_nominate_someone_else" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/nominate">To nominate someone else</a> and took off <b>Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/USERNAME</b> and replaced it with <b>User:ProveIt</b>.</p>
<p>2. After the nominee told me that he accepted the nomination, I created this page <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_ProveIt_ce6a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ProveIt">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ProveIt</a>. At the top of that page, I added a heading which said <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_ProveIt_ce6a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ProveIt">ProveIt</a>. Then, right below it, I added, <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_ProveIt_ce6a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_ProveIt_ce6a.html" rel="nofollow">Voice your opinion</a></b>. I did not add when it was scheduled to end, because I have no idea how to determine that. Finally, I wrote the name of my nominee like this <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProveIt_5236.html" title="User:ProveIt">ProveIt</a> (<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProveIt_ca2d.html" title="User talk:ProveIt">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ProveIt_f0e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/ProveIt">contribs</a>) and after that, that I am nominating him to become an administrator and why. I signed my name. I realize that my first mistake was not waiting until the canadate confirmed that he accepted there, before added it to the main RfA page. I do believe I read that it would be ideal to have all of the questions be asked and answered there before adding it to the main RfA page. I know that no voting or comments are to be placed until the my canadate's RfA page is on the main RfA page.</p>
<p>Could you please tell me what I should do in addition to what I did that time, and what should be done differently? Could you please give me a sample of each step that should be done?

<dd>One of the things that the person nominated will do is set the ending time just before their nomination is listed. All you have to do is create the nomination page using this code:</dd>

<dd>That code will automatically expand into the full nomination and give the person you nominate a place to accept the nomination. I am pretty sure that the problem with your nomination was that you did this:</dd>

<p>I re-created the sub page itself, but I only did this to experiment to make sure I knew what I was doing. I think I know what I am doing, now.

<p>Hello again <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a>. I need help with a another small detail. When the instructions say not to allow any <b>voting</b> or <b>comments</b> on the sub RfA page, does that noone should fill the spot where it says <b>General Comments</b>? And if someone could or should, who should do it, and what should the comment or comments be?--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 03:39, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure which instruction you're talking about. The "General Comments" section is usually reserved for procedural things - like links to previous RFAs, links to edit counts, etc. It shouldn't be used for discussion - discussion beyond just voting or responding to a vote should be on the talk page. Does that answer your question? If not, could you copy/paste the particular statement you are referring to? --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 03:45, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>In that case, I think my canadate should be the only one to add those things, if it comes to that. Should my canadate wait until doing so after the sub page has been added to the main RfA page. If my canadate doesn't need to wait until then and can add something, like an edit count, should he and the administrators of Wikipedia be the only ones that I should allow to add modify the <b>General Comments</b> Section. I don't know how to copy and paste the section, but it's right above <b>discussion</b> and right below question <b>3. A</b>, I'm pretty sure. When the sub page is added to the main RfA page, <b>who</b> should I allow and not allow to add <b>General Comments</b> then, not that I have any authoriy on Wikipedia, but I am responsible for doing all of these things right.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 04:00, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I reconsidered and decided the nominate <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProveIt_5236.html" title="User:ProveIt">ProveIt</a> after all, because he said that he would still accept if someone else nominated him. He was just not going to nominate himself. I'm now watching the page(while I'm online) to make sure that the sub page is not added to the main RfA page until the canadate accepts and all the questions are answered. I'm also watching to the page to make sure there are no comments or votes on the sub RfA page.<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_ProveIt_ce6a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ProveIt">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ProveIt</a>.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 03:44, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok ... I see what you are talking about. It is saying that non-logged in users (meaning, users who edit from an IP address) should not case a vote in the support or oppose section, but, rather, should express their opinions in the "comments" section or on the talk page. I have added the edit count box and will place the edit count on the talk page, so you don't have to do anything there. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:05, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for adding the edit count box, although I must admit that wasn't was I was thinking. I'm going to be logging out of my account now, so as of this time, I won't be able to watch the sub page, but I'll be back within 24 hours.--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 04:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a>, please forgive the unexpectedly soon return. I'm later than I thought I was, and it looks like the page is ready to be added to the main RfA page.<a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_ProveIt_ce6a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ProveIt">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ProveIt</a>. If that is so, I just add it above the canadate at the top, and I make it look just like this, right? {{Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ProveIt}}. I won't change anything yet, just to ensure that everything continues to run a smoothly as they are. I have owed, and still do right now to you for that! Thank you!--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 08:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, actually, the candidate is supposed to add the voting page himself/herself. See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_nominate_0df3.html#What_to_do_if_you_are_nominated_by_someone_else:" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/nominate">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/nominate#What to do if you are nominated by someone else:</a>. Step 3 is to set the ending time for the RFA (it has to end exactly one week after it is listed on the main page). Step 4 is to list it on the main page. Both of those are steps that the candidate takes - your job is done. All you have left to do is to cast your&#160;!vote sometime after the RFA is listed. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 12:20, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now I can just wait for the results. Just to make sure I'll be prepared in the future, how did you add the edit count box on the sub RfA page and add the add the amount of edits on the talk page?--<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedier_9f6b.html" title="User:Wikipedier">Wikipedier</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedier_f068.html" title="User talk:Wikipedier">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikipedier_d69f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikipedier">contribs</a>) 22:17, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For the note in the comments section, I just copied and pasted the box from someone else's RFA and changed the name to have ProveIt's name. On the talk page, see the link at the bottom. That link takes you to an edit counter. You can put anyone's name in there you want and it will show you how many edits they have. If you highlight that and hit copy, you can paste it onto the RFA talk page. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 22:21, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hehe. thanks, I only noticed the autoblock when I went to say thanks on your talk page. It's 2:16am here, so I think I'll call it a night now anyway. I agree with your comments, that reverting isn't really the solution, and that discussion is the way forward. I'm sure the admins involved in the edit war are reasonable people, and that I simply haven't explained myself very well. I'm actually not religious myself, but it's interesting to see that they seem to have assumed I am based on the material I feel should be included in the article. I somehow feel this erronous inference may somehow be relevant to the situation, but I could be wrong... I'll sleep on it!

<dd>Ok ... I didn't realize that there was an arbcom reason for it ... no mention of it was made in the protection summary - just that it was fully protected as a result of edit warring and that was dropped to s-protection. I'm not incredibly picky about it - we just don't generally permanently s-protect anything. If it is necessary, though, because of a banned user, I completely understand that. In any event, as the message at the top of the page that I stole from NoSeptember says, please feel free to reverse it.&#160;;) --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:29, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, at that time the ArbCom case was still in progress, so the banned user wasn't a banned user yet. If he abides by the outcome of the ArbCom decision which was a ban from this and related articles, and no one jumps in to take his place, there won't be a problem.

<p>thanks for your note.Actually teh encyclopedia does cite a source-www.scientificmisconduct.com</p>
<p>I tried visiting the site but could not.Howver I did ring Vice Chancellor of Monash Univesrity's office.Prof.Larkin's office admitted they were aware of thsi information as well as www.scientificmisconduct.com but despite my repeated prodding,did not call it inaccurate.I shall try visiting the source again but I felt given the facts were in the Vice Chancellor's knowledge and not contradicted it had to be true.I shall be of course guided by your advice but this anonymous user has been vanadalising so many other pages besides this-was blocked for three months in November and actually used 3 different ID's all relating to Monash University.I ahve a feeling it is Funder himself.I shall welcome your advice.(<a href="../../../v/r/_/User%7EVr_7b83.html" title="User:Vr">Vr</a> 06:11, 14 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Well, anything that you discussed from your interview with the university would not be allowable either. That would be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. The standard for Wikipedia isn't merely "truth" - it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. There are plenty of facts about famous people that are true, but if a reputable, reliable source doesn't mention it, neither do we. In order for this information to be added to the article, it would need to be covered by a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. That could be a newspaper, a book by a respected author, an official publication of the school, an article in a journal, etc. It may very well be that there is no reliable source that discusses this issue. If that's the case, then it cannot be in the article ... but we err on the side of caution when it comes to biographies of living persons ... and any other article for that matter. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 06:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Thanks again for your opinion.Actually I did not create the article-it was only when I discovered this user indulging in unbridled vandalism that I came across this problem.He had blenked teh netire page once-as he did to at least half a dozen pages in his chequered career which has seen him being blocked over and over again the last for 3 months in November.I was keeping an eye on the Sony page actually!I am sure this uuser is John Funder or some relative of his.I am a little unsure of teh reliable information bit and would value your guidance.Looking at the history of the page,I note that the person who put in this information had cited additional two references-www.scientificmisconduct.com and one from the Judicail gazette.The scientificmisconduct site is available n cached form-I do not know whether that woudl be accepotable,The Gazette appears to be a bit of a maze-I may have to work on it.But is teh cached article acceptable?In any case I woudl request you to look at the history of edits from this user!Regards(<a href="../../../v/r/_/User%7EVr_7b83.html" title="User:Vr">Vr</a> 10:28, 15 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>Hi, can you help out. I've made a pig's ear of a page move.

I tried to correct myself but <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandmaster_%28chess%29.html" title="Grandmaster (chess)">Grandmaster (chess)</a> has been nominated for <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> by someone to make way for the move... grr.

<dd><font color="Orange">Well, everything other than admins and bureaucrats is done as needed at the discretion of the arbitration committee or the Wikimedia Foundation ... so there really is nothing that you or I can do to help there. If they need someone new, they will appoint someone. As for admins, there is a need for more. To some degree, I think that need has been answered with what has to be a record number of nominations recently. By all means, if you find someone who is a long-time editor, has no civility problems, and is trusted, definitely, consider nominating them. But also, it's important to be careful ... I was looking through old RFAs a week or so ago (see <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_PRFA_3976.html" title="User:BigDT/PRFA">USER:BigDT/PRFA</a>) and found a disturbing number of users who stopped editing after a failed RFA. That can be a source of great discouragement, particularly if the reason it failed was <i>pro forma</i>, meaning that the nomination was poorly written or the user had fewer than some random number of edits to some namespace. It's best to nominate someone you have experience with so that you can write a thorough nomination. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:47, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</font></dd>

<dd><font color="Orange">Well, looking at ProveIt's RFA, it seems to be going fine - I wouldn't worry about that too much. An unquestionably qualified candidate is going to get selected no matter how bad the nomination is. But there are different people who have different views. Some will decide whether or not to support someone based on what percentage of their edits are in article space vs Wikipedia: space. Others will only support if the candidate appears to "need" to be an admin based on their answer to question #1. Other people have other criteria. But in the case of ProveIt, he is so obviously a good candidate that it didn't matter too much. But yes, there is a lot to understand about the process. There are other ways to contribute to Wikipedia other than just adminship-related things. Take a look at <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_changes_patrol_3ff8.html" title="Wikipedia:Recent changes patrol">Wikipedia:Recent changes patrol</a>. There is a lot of vandalism and by patrolling the recent changes link (look to the left of your screen in the "navigation" box), you can help get rid of vandalism. Another place you can take a look at is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_backlog_317c.html" title="Category:Wikipedia backlog">Category:Wikipedia backlog</a>. This has a list of articles that have been identified as having some kind of problem. Also, you can just pick an article that interests you and work on it! RFA can be a complicated and stressful process, but there are a ton of ways to contribute in other areas. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 02:09, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</font></dd>

<p><font color="Orange">I had no idea that <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProveIt_5236.html" title="User:ProveIt">ProveIt</a> was in such good standing.(Also, the reason I think you are a good administrator, is because you are helping me so well with the quesions I have. I saw your RfA recently succeeded in the new year. Here is a late Congratulations.) The reason why I tryed to nominate so many people for adminship is, because I noticed so many people that I thought were responsible enough to use the tools, but I also agree with the concept that <b><a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_adminship_is_not_3fae.html#Adminship_is_not_a_trophy" title="Wikipedia:What adminship is not">Adminship is not a trophy</a></b>, meaning that people are <b>not administrators</b> because they have <b>more value than the standard user</b>.(<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">Anthere</a>, for example, doesn't have more value to Wikipedia than the newest signed in user because of being a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stewards" class="extiw" title="m:Stewards">Steward</a> and the chair of the Wikimedia, board of trustees.) Admins just have the requirements to help with extra maintence, like a form of community service, that could potentaly be abused.

<p>Hi BigDT,</p>
<p>I saw your website scouting.wikia.com (well... at least I assume it is yours). Would you like to cooperate with other scoutwiki's in different languages? Currently the finnish, german, french and dutch scoutwiki's have created <a href="http://www.scoutwiki.org" class="external free" title="http://www.scoutwiki.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.scoutwiki.org</a>. We are currently looking for an English scoutwiki in addition to the present languages, because this could serve as some kind of intermediate between the different wiki-languages. Would you like to take a look at the forum and cooperate in the discussions?</p>
<p>Regards, <a href="../../../s/i/e/User%7ESietskeEN_52c6.html" title="User:SietskeEN">SietskeEN</a> 15:04, 25 February 2007 (UTC) (from scoutpedia.nl)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I took a look at scoutwiki.org. I will add a link to those wikis from the Scouting wikia. Is there a particular discussion you would like for me to participate in? I looked and there doesn't seem to be any English discussion. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:13, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is currently running is that we tried to set up [<a href="http://media.scoutwiki.org/w/Promising_practice|a" class="external text" title="http://media.scoutwiki.org/w/Promising_practice|a" rel="nofollow">promising practice about ScoutWiki</a>] for the WOSM, so that the WOSM can decide if the scoutwiki's are interesting enough to receive some kind of "official status" from the World Organisation. If you like the idea, you can take a look and see if you think that it is already "promising" enough. At the moment we are implementing the language links. Only the Dutch wiki does not yet have them, because of an old server which can not handle the new MediaWiki-version. How to implement it yourself in a way that we all use a standard way just like wikipedia does, you can find at <a href="http://wiki.partio.net/PartioWiki:Interwiki" class="external free" title="http://wiki.partio.net/PartioWiki:Interwiki" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.partio.net/PartioWiki:Interwiki</a>. When you like to cooperate in this project, this means that an extra interwiki code for your wiki has to be implemented in the interwiki-code that we already use, but I think that is not a problem. As soon as you have implemented interwiki-codes, you get a search field from the main page at www.scoutpedia.org.</dd>

<dd>I hope you understand what I mean with the above. I can understand the English language quite well but it is hard to explain things in a language which is not your mother tongue. That is another reason for being glad when an English language scoutwiki is involved, so that we all get less "<a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_in_translation.html" title="Lost in translation">lost in translation</a>"...&#160;:-) I hope you like to cooperate!

<dd>I love your boards!

<p>BigDT, I hope not to seem unfriendly or argumentative, but I'm concerned about the addition to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_NAME_d5f0.html" title="WP:RFC/NAME">WP:RFC/NAME</a> of the line:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>New</b> - Optionally, if you block a name that is clearly vandalism or trolling, you can use {{<a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_substitution_a63d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template substitution">subst</a><tt>:</tt><a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUsernameBlocked-vandal_242b.html" title="Template:UsernameBlocked-vandal">UsernameBlocked-vandal</a>}}.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Could we discuss that concern here?</p>
<p>In this context, <b><a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#Types_of_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a></b> would refer to <i>"usernames that contain <b>deliberately</b> offensive or disruptive terms"</i>.</p>
<p>Since, as the <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_NAME_d5f0.html" title="WP:RFC/NAME">WP:RFC/NAME</a> instructions say, <i>"Grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate usernames should be reported at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> instead"</i>, this template might be usefully mentioned at <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, or in the warnings-to-blocks escalation system, where its proper targets should be reported.</p>
<p>However, such clear-cut and indisputable violations should not be brought to RFC/NAME in the first place, because they don't <b>need</b> the discussion and consensus-building process of an RFC to determine whether they meet policy or not. The whole point of "gross, blatant, and obvious" is that there's no debate about it: admin sees it, admin blocks it, done.</p>
<p>I worry that putting instructions about how to handle such cases on RFC/NAME -- other than to take them away to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> -- might give people the impression that RFC/NAME is the right page for reporting them after all. I'd much rather that not happen, as those are not our proper topic: we shouldn't have to run "gross, blatant, and obvious" cases through the RFC process, along with all the genuinely debatable cases.</p>
<p>The verdict of vandalism, with its tone of certainty about <i>"deliberate"</i> bad faith, also doesn't fit well on an RFC page where we <i>"try to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">don't bite the newcomers</a>, if possible: <a href="../../../a/p/b/WP%7EAPBB_cb1e.html" title="WP:APBB">allow for the possibility of innocent error</a> or other reasonable explanation."</i> The change of tone comes off a bit like dumping a truckload of ice into an occupied hot tub.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that RFC/NAME is not the right page for that template, just as it would not be the right page for a user-conduct-RFC template or an article-content-dispute-RFC template -- I've written both <u>those</u> kinds of templates myself, but I would never have put them on the <u>username</u> RFC page.</p>
<p>So I hope you'll agree to move that line elsewhere.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate learning your own views, understanding your reasoning, and discussing what alternatives might avoid raising this concern.</p>
<p>You have several options freely available to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.</li>
<li>If you prefer, we can discuss this topic at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_bb98.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment">Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment</a>, where other editors could contribute their viewpoints.</li>
<li>If we can't agree in these settings, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution process</a>, such as <a href="../../../t/h/i/WP%7ETHIRD_66a0.html" title="WP:THIRD">asking for a "third opinion"</a>, or <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">requesting comments</a> from other Wikipedians.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me reassure you that I appreciate the effort you've invested in this template, and that your motive was to meet a perceived need of the community. This is just a case where our opinions may differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus -- either here, or on <a href="../../../r/f/c/WT%7ERFC_0b3a.html" title="WT:RFC">WT:RFC</a>, or in an RFC. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued company on <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_NAME_d5f0.html" title="WP:RFC/NAME">WP:RFC/NAME</a>.

<p>Thanks for the tip. Did you see my email question on afd times and procedures? Thanks again for all the help. I'm trying to be careful and check policy before I do a new admin task, I err on side of caution, but will probably still make errors. I indef blocked a user name as it was reported to aiv, the reporter and I thought it was sexually suggestive.
