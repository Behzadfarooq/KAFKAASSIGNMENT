<h2><span class="mw-headline">Creator of Light Horus</span></h2>
<p>The tournament for the Horakit that you have took place on July 24, 2005 in Tokyo Japan. That other guy is full of crap. However I should inform you that I have the what you refered to as the ATK Horakit. The tournament took place for that one on January 14, 2006 at the same location. Please respond to my edit as soon as possible! I just have one question, how did you get this card. I heard that the previous owner died in a car accident or something? <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightmare_81_e2de.html" title="User:Nightmare 81">User: Nightmare 81</a></p>
<p>Yes he did die in a car accident. I got the card from Jake's younger brother. And please answer my question. Did a girl win three of the tournaments and what Horus cards did she win? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Boss_0_5fda.html" title="User:Big Boss 0">User: Big Boss 0</a></p>
<p>You mean Jake Stilskon?! Man I didn't know that he was dead! Anyway yes a girl did win three of the Horakit tournaments. So far there have been 22 Horakit's awarded as prized at the ten tournaments. They started on July 24, 2005 and ended August 19, 2006. As for what Horakit cards that she won would be what you defined as the Counterstrike, Divine Light, and Swiftkill Horakit cards. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightmare_81_e2de.html" title="User:Nightmare 81">User: Nightmare 81</a></p>
<p>Spelling errors aside thanks for the information. However could you by chance give me her name and a breif description of her. I want to know a little more about this person. And by chance could you give me the new web site of the tournament winners. The old one appears to be down. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Boss_0_5fda.html" title="User:Big Boss 0">User: Big Boss 0</a></p>
<p>The name and adress that she gave was completely fake. As far as a description she is about 5ft 6in tall with dark hair. I'm sorry but I know almost nothing about her too. As far as the web site I have no idea why it is down but I will try to set up a new one. By chance how do you upload images on this site? <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightmare_81_e2de.html" title="User:Nightmare 81">User: Nightmare 81</a></p>
<p>Your spelling leaves a lot to be desired, but thanks for the information. About the images ask Moe. He is a recipient of the Big Boss Award just like you so he should be no problem finding him! Have you by chance checked out my user page. I suggest you do but you need to slow down a little bit when typing. And isn't the japanese name of the cards Horakti? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Boss_0_5fda.html" title="User:Big Boss 0">User: Big Boss 0</a></p>
<p>You need to capitalize man however thanks for the information. That is about all of the information that I have right now. I will try to build a new web page as soon as possible. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightmare_81_e2de.html" title="User:Nightmare 81">User: Nightmare 81</a></p>
<p>I have a question for you. Why did you help me out against that guy? There for a while I was beginning to believe him. The you came along... Why tell me he was wrong? And by the way do you know if she kept any of the Horus cards that she won. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Boss_0_5fda.html" title="User:Big Boss 0">User: Big Boss 0</a></p>
<p>I helped you out because he by saying that that wasn't the tournament prize Horakti would take away from my prestige of winning the tournament. It was single elimination and I barely won. I couldn't stand by while someone tried to destroy what I worked so hard to acomplish. I then created an account and went offensive. As far as if she kept any of them HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW!!!!!!!!! <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightmare_81_e2de.html" title="User:Nightmare 81">User: Nightmare 81</a></p>
<p>Thank you for answering my question. And please try to spell correctly from now on. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Boss_0_5fda.html" title="User:Big Boss 0">User: Big Boss 0</a></p>
<p>Last Statement to Big Boss 0: I did not know for sure if he was dead. That is why I asked if he had died because I heard that he died. I wasn't 100% shure. Anyway thanks for the help you have given me and I will see you around again someday. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightmare_81_e2de.html" title="User:Nightmare 81">User: Nightmare 81</a></p>

<p>As far as the southpark one goes, just wait for him to vandalize again. After that, report it to the AIV board as a vandalism only account (assuming that he keeps up with nothing but vandalism), and it will get indef blocked. If you want to prove that it is a sock, you'll have to let it stick around for a little while. That way the pattern of vandalism will become apparent. After that, request a checkuser. One John Cena vandalism isn't enough to request a checkuser. If it comes out positive, then the IP would be blocked as well. That would be the main advantage to letting it stick around. Sadly, IPs can't be indef blocked, but they can receive incredibly long blocks. If you could tell me the main pattern that would be great. I know that they tend to linger around the John Cena page, but if their is more I will need to know.

Another <a href="../../../p/w/_/WP%7EPW_f376.html" title="WP:PW">WP:PW</a> fan has contacted the WWE, so there may be a list posted on wwe.com within a couple months. As far as the sock announcing who he was going to attack, he just wants recognition. He wants us to worry. It is an intimidation tactic. Of course, what can he really do? Even the infamous Willy on Wheels didn't do anything that lasted. After a couple months, everything will be lost in page histories, and no one will remember Bowser Koopa. He may pop up now and again after IP blocks expire, but after about 2 edits he will be gone for another year. This is just another worthless, generic puppet vandal. Nothing to be worried about. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">T</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">H</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">L</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_The_Hybrid_1835.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/The Hybrid"><font color="purple">R</font></a></b> 02:28, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Willy on Wheels is the most infamous vandal in Wikipedia history. If he wasn't the first, he was the most effective page move vandal ever. He would move large numbers of pages to (Article Name) <i>ON WHEELS!</i> For a while he could move 50 pages in this way before anyone knew he had returned and block his current account, and all of those pages would have to be moved back by hand. In a strange way, he actually helped Wikipedia in the long run. Bots were developed that rendered him useless compared to what he was capable of before. He might move 3 pages before a bot would revert his edits and notify an admin who would block him. Bots like <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntiVandalBot_aa84.html" title="User:AntiVandalBot">AntiVandalBot</a> are his uncanny legacy. He quit about a year ago, and since then there have been many imitators and people who have tried in vain to make a name for themselves in the same way he did. Bowser Koopa is just another person who will have their name lost in page histories trying to be remembered. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">T</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">H</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">L</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_The_Hybrid_1835.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/The Hybrid"><font color="purple">R</font></a></b> 02:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because you are a good editor who is taking the initiative to stop vandalism. The same people that have been vandalizing you have been vandalizing me, and I love it! They get blocked almost immediately by the RC Patrol, taking care of the problem once and for all. Don't loose heart; remember that nothing they do is permanent.

<p>They know that they are going to be blocked soon, so they decide to try and take revenge on the people responsible before it happens.

<p>It will happen on occasion. It usually happens when users who have selected <i>Remember Me</i> let their friends or family use their computer and not pay attention to what they do. They will then go to Wikipedia, see that they are logged in, and then decide to play a prank on the real user by vandalizing. There may have been instances of someone making a correct guess as to someone else's password, but I haven't heard of any.

<p>The length of the protection is at the discreation of you and the protector. I appreciate your support, but I have withdrawn my RfA.

<p>You're right about what is #1. I'm not sure if vandal fighting is #2, but I know that it is pretty high on the list. I haven't been adding to and editing pages to much; I've been devoting a lot of my time to vandal fighting. I'll change that eventually, but for right now I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I think that I could use the admin tools as well as anyone else, but they want to know that you can handle yourself with anything before giving them to you. At least I have VandalProof, which gives me some of the tools anyway.

<p>I completely understand why you would want to call him that, but don't. On Wikipedia, personal attacks are not tolerated for any reason, even when the other user attacked you first. Moving on, VandalProof has been abused before, and it was terrible. What I described to you was the most basic form of the Rollback button; admins have the ability to do all of that as well. That is part of the reason there is so much responsibility that comes with adminship. Admins receive many tools, and have to be able to make the right decisions with them. The Wikimedia Foundation would like us to think of them as "regular editors with a few more buttons", but it goes so far beyond that. Admins will be faced with conditions where they have to make critical decisions, and make them quickly. If an admin makes the wrong decision, it may cause permanent damage. Admins are not just regular editors with more buttons, and being an admin is a big deal whether or not the Wikimedia Foundation admits it. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">T</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">H</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">L</font></a></b> 01:25, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why don't they wait? Because most of them don't know things like that exist. When I was a new user, no one explained anything to me. All I had was a welcome message to learn basic editing information. It took me months to finally understand that there was a community that decided what took place and when. It took me a while to learn how this community functioned, and how to find my place. Vandals don't even get a welcome message, so they have no way of knowing that if they were to wait, they could be much more effective. However, I may have accidentally exaggerated how profuse the damage would be. Bureaucrats, the people above admins, and Stewards, the people above them, generally have the ability to reverse any damage that an admin vandal could do to the files, and hundreds of users would do their part to revert rollback vandalism. After maybe 2 days the damage would be fixed, and needless to say the abuser is perma-banned. Their IP would probably be blocked for a while as well. Their is almost always a way to fix any type of vandalism. It would probably take a steward to legitimately hurt Wikipedia in the long run. Also, when I told you about rollback vandalism, I forgot that an admin could rollback the rollback. I guess that there is an undo button.

<p>Oh, and as far as protecting the Rock's page goes, we typically try to wait a while before protecting a page. No matter how much effort a vandal puts into vandalizing a page, it still takes the same amount of effort from us to revert it. Protecting a page prevents anons and new users from editing it, which also keeps some useful material from being added. We try to avoid this as much as possible, but in some particularly attractive targets must suffer from protection - and they do suffer from it.

<p>Since you are an anti-vandal guy, you may be interested in <a href="../../../p/o/p/WP%7EPOPUP_72b4.html" title="WP:POPUP">this tool</a>. It is <i>extremely</i> useful, and it isn't anywhere near as easy to screw up with as VandalProof, or as dangerous. I highly recommend enabling this tool. It is available for anyone to use, and as I said before it is very useful. VandalProof has a lot of bugs in it, so I almost exclusively use this tool. It isn't quite as effective, but it is reliable and easy to use. I love this tool, and I hope that you will to.

<p>There was one night that I couldn't sleep, so I came out to the computer and the defcon was at level 2. It was very recent. When I checked back after reverting the <b>massive</b> amount of vandalism on my watchlist, it had gone down to level three. It has been in its current state of bouncing between 3 and 4 ever since then. I haven’t ever seen a level 1, but I have no doubt that it reached that level after that one episode of The Colbert Report. At that point I didn't have the defcon meter on my user page, but I'm sure it reached that level.

<p>That would be extremely difficult to do. Even I, with my VandalProof, have the ability to fix a situation that one person could create with one click. Remeber the magic rollback button. It would take an ungodly number of people to create an ungodly level of vandalism.

<p>It sounded like you wanted one person to cause all of it. For the reasons stated, it is impossible for one person to create a level one situation. Absolutely impossible. It would take tons of different people, not sockpuppets, to pull something like that off. I don't think there would be enough volunteers for what you are thinking. Maybe there would be, but it would only take 2 clicks for each person to stop the entire thing in its tracks. One to block them, and another to roll back their vandalism. I have complete confidence in Wikipedia's ability to handle an attack of biblical proportions.

<p>The Wikimedia servers are too advanced and too protected to be destroyed like that. VandalProof may be vulnerable since its core file isn't saved on the Wikimedia servers, but the bots are saved on the WM servers. The ungodly number of admins would be left to rollback the vandalism. Though it wouldn't <b>ever</b> come to this, if necessary some people could be given emergency admin status, and then desysopped after the vandalism subsided. Wikipedia is invulnerable. There is no way to sink this ship.

<p>The most efficient method of dealing with vandals under any circumstance is to revert them, warn/report them, and ignore them. Go to <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_User_talk_namespace_c29d.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace">Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace</a>, learn the warnings, and give them out to vandals. If it may have been an accident, assume good faith and start out with a level 1 warning. Otherwise, start out at level 2. Go through them until level 4, and then report them to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. Under any circumstance, do not respond to any threats, and don't insult them. Just give them the appropriate warning for each offense and move on. For previously blocked users, start out with a level 3 warning or the blatant vandal warning. Don't follow a specific user around waiting for them to vandalize; just move on like I said. If they show up in your watchlist again just revert, warn, and ignore. This is the method that has been used on Wikipedia for a long time, and this is the most effective method.

<p>Good. I just get frustrated at the IPs who walk in and openly ignore you when you tell them to not use talk pages for a forum. They act like toddlers but swear like sailors, and I get angry. I swear sometimes, but at least I try not to when I'm not angry. After that, two more people started up another conversation on the subject, and ,as you can see if you go to the talk page, I deleted everything related to that subject as promised. I'm glad that you didn't take that personally, as I doubt that you meant to violate policy. I encourage you to delete anything like that from the John Cena talk page in the future. Not necessarily other talk pages, but just that one as it is hit the worst.

You removed the orphaned tag and replaced it with the {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_orphan_4145.html" title="Template:Not orphan">not orphan</a>}} tag. These images are still considered orphaned fair use as they are not used in any wikipedia article. Please note that I will be re-tagging the images for discussion at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion</a> where you will be able to state your case for not having the images deleted. As a final note, further to your comment on my talk page of "Do not mess with them again. They are mine and not to be deleted unless I say so." I would suggest you review the policy <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, which applied equally to images as articles from an ownership standpoint. I welcome your discussion at the IfD or my talk page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Please review our policies</span></h2>
<p>Please take some time to review Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, especially <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. this is a policy that lists some things <i>Wikipedia is not</i>. Among other things, it says that Wikipedia is not a free web hosting service. Wikipedia is not a MMORPG. And Wikipedia is not a democracy. We don't vote on image deletions. We have rules about them. If they are not being used on articles, they will be deleted.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that you spent time uploading them to no avail, but perhaps you need to consider if Wikipedia is the right place for you. If you are here to build an encyclopedia (which you don't seem to be working on at present) we welcome you and your associates. If you are here for any thing else - we will close your account. Regardless, the images can't stay as they are. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 03:57, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These images are important to PDL and myself personally. They must be kept beacuse I will soon be creating a PDL artical. However our policies differ with wikipedia on the rules and effect changes reguarding PDL. I am taking up all my time worrying about losing my images when I should be editing wikipedia instead. It would be a great help if they were kept so I could move on th other things. I am logging off after this and I will view your response tomorrow. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Boss_0_5fda.html" title="User:Big Boss 0">Big Boss 0</a> 04:02, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hello Big Boss, thank you for your reply. I am sorry that your stress level is rising. I know it may seem to you that you are under attack or that we are ganging up on you. We are insistent only because these are important points. They are so important that they are non-negotiable.</dd>
<dd>You say, "They must be kept beacuse I will soon be creating a PDL artical." - I'm sorry, but you don't get to dictate that. We don't have to keep anything. In fact, nothing will be kept that violates our policies.</dd>
<dd>You say, "However our policies differ with wikipedia on the rules and effect changes reguarding PDL." That does not make sense. Wikipedia does not allow sub-groups to form who have different policies than Wikipedia has. You have 3 choices. You have to either comply with our rules, comply with them until you can successfully build a consensus of the community to change them, or you have to go away. It is that simple.</dd>
<dd>You claim you need the pictures for an article on PDL, but we can't keep fair use images unless they are in an article. On the other hand, we have lots of articles with no images. Write the article first, then upload the pictures.</dd>
<dd>You never explain what PDL is. It looks to me like it is the name of a club or a game you invented. Be aware once again of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Also, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Wikipedia is not the place for an article on the game you made up at school one day. All of our articles must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Whatever PDL is, if you can't cite mainstream media sources about it, we can't have an article about it.</dd>
<dd>There is no point you arguing these points. They are firmly established policy. I don't want to sound harsh but I prefer plain speaking over you potentially wasting a lot of your time, and the time of good contributors here. You need to understand that we are serious about these policies. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:21, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My money is on the Undertaker. I have heard that he is going to face Batista at WM 23. Of course, that doesn't mean he will do it by winning the Rumble, or that he will actually be facing Batista, but that's what I heard, so that's my guess.
