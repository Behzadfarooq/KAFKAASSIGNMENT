<p>The machine gun used in the movie was a modified <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Gustaf_M_45_5f90.html" title="Carl Gustaf M/45">Carl Gustaf M/45</a>, not a modified <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intratec_TEC-DC9_f7bd.html" title="Intratec TEC-DC9">Intratec TEC-DC9</a>, but the TEC-DC9 is also made using parts from the M/45. It may be OR, but I've met the designer and he told me so. He actualy made a living making custom guns. But the TEC-DC9 was developed during the same period, so it's not suprising they have a simmilar look. The TEC-DC9 was a yet unnamed (as far as I know) prototype by 1989. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>
<p><br />
<i>Can you provide anything else to back this statement up? It sure looks like a Tec-9 to me. Also, the Tec-9 page shows it as being in production in 1985, and the ATF knowing of it's existence in 1982. Is that wrong?</i> --<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJOK3R_dbe7.html" title="User:JOK3R">JOK3R</a> 16:50, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>On a cursory examination of pictures of the various weapons, the length of the weapon used seems more in line with that of the Gustaf than that of the TEC-9.</p>
<p>I don't know, unless they pushed the magazine feed much closer to the handle or theres a variant that I'm not finding pics of, it bares very little resemblance to a Gustaf and a strong one to a TEC-9. Infact, some of the links on the <a href="../../../t/e/c/TEC-9_7262.html" title="TEC-9">TEC-9</a> article seem to have pics that look exactly like the gun in the movie. Also, he uses the gun semi, and a TEC-9 is a semi. In addition, I'm not sure a guy you met is a sitable resource. Anyways, I'm gonna change it for now and correct the machine gun part, neither type are machine guns. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighlandlord_a340.html" title="User:Highlandlord">Highlandlord</a> 02:51, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>It seems that almost immediatly after I made the change someone else cut away everything but that a TEC-9 is seen in a poster for it, is that even worth having at all? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighlandlord_a340.html" title="User:Highlandlord">Highlandlord</a> 03:30, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That was me. If it's a TEC-9, then it's not remodeled or specially made for the film. It's just a bog standard TEC-9.&#160;:-) The trivia section isn't really asupposed to exist at all in film articles, according to WP guidelines, so the interesting stuff should be integrated into the text and the useless bits should be deleted. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff_B_df13.html" title="User:Geoff B">Geoff B</a> 06:16, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Notice the front of the gun. The protection around the barrel. That's directly from the m/45. But then the TEC-9 is a redesigned m/45 so it's difficult to tell just by looking at them. Also check <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interdynamic_MP-9_33bf.html" title="Interdynamic MP-9">Interdynamic MP-9</a>. // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The perforated jacket around the barrel is typical of TEC-9s pre-1994. Not to mention that the style of perferations are totally different to those on the M/45. The initial KG-9 model was changed to KG-99 in the mid 1980s (when BTILC was made) and designated the TEC-9. If you go to tyhe TEC-9 page here on WP, the pic is of an AB-10 model, which lacks the perforated jacket around the muzzle. There would be no reason on Earth to use a modified M/45, as the TEC-9 was already in production. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff_B_df13.html" title="User:Geoff B">Geoff B</a> 20:54, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Several of the links from the TEC-9 article show pics more similar to the one used in the movie. Once again, now that all it says is "The gun used by Jack Burton and shown on the movie poster is a Intratec TEC-DC9." is that noteworthy enough to be in the trivia for the movie? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighlandlord_a340.html" title="User:Highlandlord">Highlandlord</a> 20:48, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The wiki article suggests that this was originally a cowboy movie. However the IMDB suggests that this was originally the sequel to Buckaroo Banzai, known as Buckaroo Banzai vs. The World Crime Syndicate. Which is correct?</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to the film's commentary, with Kurt Russell and John Carpenter, the script went through a few incarnations.</dd>
</dl>
<p>JC: "It was originally a Western, with a cowboy riding into town...he does the same basic thing, he gets involved, they steal his horse or something so he has to go into this underworld...it was modernised by W. D. Richter (sp?) and his rationale was Rosemary's Baby worked because it was the modern day, so why wouldn't this?"</p>
<p>KR: "Had he done Buckaroo Banzai?"</p>
<p>JC: "He had done that."</p>
<p>So it was definitely a Western originally, but it may have been adapted by Richter to be a BB sequel before being changed again. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff_B_df13.html" title="User:Geoff B">Geoff B</a> 06:34, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Several articles that appeared in <i>Starlog</i> magazine around the time the film came out also back up the origins of the screenplay as being a Western. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Ringworm_781a.html" title="User:Count Ringworm">Count Ringworm</a> 13:12, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've re-written the WoW paragraph so that the movie references are followed by the game references - since that is the chronological sequence. [Sorry that I forgot I wasn't signed in at the time.] I have also hyphenated "Six-Demon" and "Upside-Down" on what I concede are solely my personal stylistic preferences. If anyone can cite a published screenplay or studio-based movie website to the contrary, that's great. But the mentions in WoW, being derivative works, would not be authoritative. <a href="../../../r/i/b/User%7ERibonucleic_19a2.html" title="User:Ribonucleic">Ribonucleic</a> 19:39, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article currently describes him as a "magician". Aside from the term's unfortunate rabbit-from-the-hat associations, is there any textual basis for this designation - as opposed to "wizard" or "sorcerer"? Although Lo Pan sneers at Egg's "peasant magic", I don't believe this establishes anything. And FWIW - admittedly next-to-nothing - the top Google match for "Egg Shen" describes him as a "sorcerer" and "alchemist". <a href="http://surbrook.devermore.net/btilc/eggshen.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://surbrook.devermore.net/btilc/eggshen.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../r/i/b/User%7ERibonucleic_19a2.html" title="User:Ribonucleic">Ribonucleic</a> 00:44, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Lo Pan calls him a 'little bastard sorcerer', not that it makes any difference whether he's called a magician, wizard, sorcerer or conjurer in the WP article. He's a man that does magic. Whatever the Chinese language term(s) for that are, I doubt any of them translate neatly into those English language terms. They all have rather unfortunate associations. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff_B_df13.html" title="User:Geoff B">Geoff B</a> 02:13, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that I check, <i>The American Heritage Dictionary</i> doesn't seem to make any distinction between "sorcerer", "wizard", and "magician" either. Although I would have sworn that "wizard" had some kind of higher status than the others deriving from the ostensible course of studies involved. And the film - even apart from Lo Pan's perjorative comments - does seem to suggest that what he and Egg do aren't exactly the same thing. Combining 1) Lo Pan's "bastard sorcerer" remark, 2) the "sorcerer" identification in the top Google match, and 3) my personal judgment that it's the most Chinese sounding of the three choices, I'm changing the description of Egg from "magician" to "sorcerer". Since you've stated it doesn't make a difference, I trust you won't have any objections. <a href="../../../r/i/b/User%7ERibonucleic_19a2.html" title="User:Ribonucleic">Ribonucleic</a> 04:15, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>By all means, do so. I'm sure there are technical distinctions between the terms, but I don't think it really matters here. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoff_B_df13.html" title="User:Geoff B">Geoff B</a> 05:04, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since "old Jack" doesn't appear in any other works that I'm aware of, I don't see how he justifies his own article - especially when it's only a stub [and not a particulary well-written one IMHO]. So I've heeded the encouragement to Be Bold and brought in what I thought was the best that article had to offer. This required an extensive rewrite of the Plot summary - which still needs the Lo Pan plot explained a lot better than I can do at the moment without watching the movie again. <a href="../../../r/i/b/User%7ERibonucleic_19a2.html" title="User:Ribonucleic">Ribonucleic</a> 05:17, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>from <i>The American Heritage Dictionary</i>:</p>
<p>bluff (adj) - Rough and blunt but not unkind in manner</p>
<p>buff (adj) - (<i>slang</i>) Having good muscle tone; physically fit and trim</p>
<p>While Jack meets both descriptions, I thought the first was more germane. Also: although I can't locate one, I assume there's a rule of article style that rules out slang. So I'm changing this back. <a href="../../../r/i/b/User%7ERibonucleic_19a2.html" title="User:Ribonucleic">Ribonucleic</a> 14:19, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
