<dd><b>Comment</b> -- it is a fact that the apparent inconsistency (do we need to refer to a dictionary as to what an "apparent" inconsistency is?) is resolved by inflationary theory.

<dd>Linde happens to be one of my favored modern scientist, and I keep updated of his research very frequently. More inflationist than him, I don't know anyone. So before suggesting I dislike inflationary theory, try supposing that maybe my actual concern is unrelated to my opinions here. The quote: "This <b>apparent</b> inconsistency is <b>resolved</b> by inflationary theory," is sure not NPOV, it is a taking of position, and this, regardless of if it is true or not. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix">Fadix</a> 18:58, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>How is it not NPOV? The inconsistency is apparent and it is resolved by inflation. That's a fact. So where's the beef? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 20:05, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The <i>early universe</i> as a concept exists only in the context of the Big Bang and there is no view I have seen that this is incorrect. If you have a reference to someone claiming that the early universe wasn't filled homogeneously and isotropically with radiation, let us see the citation. As far as I know, nobody has a different view of what the early universe was filled with. I don't know of any other competing theory that describes a dynamically evolving universe other than the Big Bang. If you think that it is POV that there was an early universe then you aren't describing the early universe anymore and really cannot comment on the quote. If you are trying to say that simply starting a sentence with "The early universe was" is giving undue acceptance to the concept that an early universe existed at all, then how would you rephrase it? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 23:19, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now comming to the quote: "This <b>apparent</b> inconsistency is <b>resolved</b> by inflationary theory," ...

<dd>The inconsistency is each of those things. In the context of inflationary theory, it is absolutely true that this <i>apparent</i> inconsistency is resolved (since that was, in some sense, why the theory was designed in the first place). How is this not NPOV? We're not saying here that the inflationary universe is the only possible resolution that anyone can think of, but simply that the apparent inconsistency is resolved by inflationary theory. Please, offer a rewording if you think it is NPOV. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 23:19, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are just few examples, since you wanted more examples. I do realise that there is no one article that would be really compleatly NPOV, including featured articles, and more people are adherent to the majority view maintained in an article, more it appears that a POV slightly on the right side of the median passes as incognito, the ironic here is that I do adhere to the majority position and that I believe that making such articles as compleatly NPOV is a protection against revert wars.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Lastly, on second consideration, some articles, more particularly in the scientific field, could not make without overruling a little bit, the NPOV policy. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix">Fadix</a> 21:16, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a stock market guy, but I think this is wrong: "there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the universe should have more helium than deuterium". Stellar fusion is an obvious reason. Although deuterium is an intermediate step, it is believed that the main product of stellar fusion is helium.

<p>I would like to write a page about the deregulation of the London financial markets in October 1986, an event oftened referred to as the Big Bang because of the all-or-nothing nature of the deregulation.</p>
<p>I am a novice Wikipedian and have no idea how to go about creating a disambiguation page, or indeed of naming conventions (clearly Big_Bang should by default come to this page).</p>

<dd>1. Name your page something different. A common convention for this problem is to add something in parentheses, so I suggest:</dd>
<dd>Big Bang (financial)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Write your deregulation page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3. Add this line to the top of the main Big Bang page:</dd>
<dd><i>For the London financial deregulation, see Big Bang (financial).</i></dd>
<dd>If you look on the "edit this page" version of this discussion, you will see how I made that line look like that. I can't tell you what the punctuation is without directing you to the edit page, because I can hardly see it on this page (with my font anyway). But it shows up fine when editing.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">this article is highly unscientific</span></h2>
<p>exactly how would this theory be the beginning of the universe anyways? If matter can neither be created nor destroyed, where the hell did the matter come from to begin with? and secondly</p>
<p>you cant just say that matter came from nothingness, thats an act of god which is UNSCIENTIFIC to say the least</p>
<p>Just because the big bang is wrong doesnt mean all you atheist have to believe in creationism, come up with somthing better than some "scietific myth"</p>
<p>the second law of thermodynamics, which i might add is VERY scientific and is one of the most highly regarded scientific laws ever...states that everything over time goes to chaos... so how do you propose that chaos from the beginning goes into more chaos? that makes no sense, and if a theory doesnt line up with the laws of themordynamics, im sorry, but its just plain wrong. The big bang (and evolution) are the EXACT opposite of the laws of thermodynamics stating that over time chaos turns to order WHICH is exactly the opposite as stated in the laws of thermodynamics</p>
<p>I might also add that the reason string theory was even created in the first place, was because the equations for the big bang didnt work... but oh yeah they forgot to tell you that didnt they???</p>
<p>this is the most foolish scientific theory ive heard, right next to evolution, hahahhaha notice that they are THEORIES and that already stated scientific fact and law dispute the evidence of these theories, but these facts are ignored...</p>
<p>ignroance is bliss people...ignornace is bliss....but that doesnt mean it should be tolerated..</p>

<dd>One of the reasons I think dark matter isn't widely accepted is that physics (and science in general for that ..um.. matter) is much bigger than cosmology. That is, dark matter isn't really necessary to explain things in any other discipline. (Personally, I think dark matter is a hack, but then again who am I?) At the moment, I don't have any hard evidence to back up my claim. However, I am confident that if I did some research, I could support it, but I'm busy enough as it is (hence the slow reply). Plus, one little line in a wikipedia article isn't *that* big of a deal. Perhaps we could change it to say it is widely accepted among <i>cosmologists</i>?<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe1physicist_cf45.html" title="User:The1physicist">the1physicist</a> 15:44, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>According to the Big Bang Theory, we can conclude from Earth the observable universe was once the size of a grapefruit. In theory, so could an observer who is now 10,20,40 billion light years away from Earth. That observer could also infer a grapefruit sized universe in her distant past. I take this quote from Scientific American, March 2005 p.40 "Thus, we can conceive of the early universe as a pile of overlapping grapfruits that stretches infinitely in all directions. Correspondingly, the idea that the big bang was 'small' is misleading. The totality of space could be infinite. Shrink an infinite space by an arbitrary amount, and it is still infinite.</li>
<li>I stress this point because the article on the Big Bang does nothing to alert the reader to the <b>possibility</b> that the early universe as <i>primeval atom</i> was larger than the observable universe is today.</li>

<dd>The statement made in that FAQ, while not strictly incorrect, is misleading. The expansion of the universe from the big bang singularity is a time-reversal of the _formation_ of a black hole. When the star forming a black hole collapses past a certain density threshold, the light-cones of all material in it point entirely inwards, so collapse to a singularity is inevitable even though the matter is not yet a singularity. One of the earliest results derived about the big bang was that if <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> is a complete description of how gravity behaves, then if the early universe was ever past a certain density threshold, then the only geometry of spacetime consistent with <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> is one in which the universe - all of it - originated at a single point. This is what the "extending through all of space" comment refers to, though I'd argue that it's poorly worded. The "singularity extending through all time" comment refers to a black hole's singularity's worldline _after_ formation. It would make sense to use this comparison if I was trying to say that the big bang acted as a <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_hole.html" title="White hole">white hole</a>, but that's not what was shown. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 18:57, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If general relativity is the core reason for thinking all of the universe, observable and non-observable, originated from a single point, then we should be able to draw some conclusion about the non-observable universe. Is it finite or infinite? If general relativity doesn't answer that question then (in my mind) it can't resolve the issue I raised about size at t=0. --<a href="../../../j/w/a/User%7EJwalling_6099.html" title="User:Jwalling">john</a> 21:33, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The primary conclusion that can be drawn from a pure GR model is that the rest of the universe should be expanding just as the observable universe is. A secondary conclusion is that we should expect the distribution of matter in both the observable and unobservable parts of the universe to be roughly uniform on large scales. Surveys of very distant parts of the observable universe have been consistent with these predictions. These surveys are still quite active, as any deviation from a GR-only model's predictions will teach us something about how the forces behaved close to unification energies (which we can't test in the laboratory). Surveys of the non-observable universe will have to wait a while (and may not be possible at all; if <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_energy.html" title="Dark energy">dark energy</a> or a <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmological_constant.html" title="Cosmological constant">cosmological constant</a> exists, parts of the universe that are now observable will cease to be observable, as opposed to the other way around). As for size, you can construct both bounded and unbounded topologies of spacetime that will satisfy the equations, so this isn't a question that can be used to test the model. The simplest solutions have an unbounded universe, but there are active studies looking for artifacts in the microwave background that would result from it being bounded. For the time being, these studies have had inconclusive results. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 00:23, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have introduced some "critics say.." to give this article just a semblance of balance. It will be interesting to see if big bang proponents erase everything or actually try to engage in a scientfic debate. If they erase everything, it will be good evidence that they no longer have any scientfic arguments on thier side.<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElerner_3f7c.html" title="User:Elerner">Elerner</a> 06:06, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>“This is not the place for debate” says Joshua, implying that the big bang is beyond debate. But it is very much being debated and the article should reflect it. Did you see the July 2 cover of New Scientist, which had a wreckers’ ball descending on the big bang?</p>
<p>My point is that big bang proponents are not interested in scientific truth but in repressing views that challenge their careers. That is why you eliminate factual corrections rather than replying to them. That is why you continually attempt to deface the article on plasma cosmology. That is why some of you hide behind anonymity. Big bang defenders have the same attitude towards scientific debate as the Chinese government does to political debate—repress it, don’t reply to it.</p>
<p>For those who are curious, here are the changes that I attempted to make in the big bang article. I gather it is not possible to erase them here.</p>
<p>“While the theory is widely supported, critics of the theory contend that its predictions have been contradicted by observations in many significant ways.</p>
<p>Critics of the theory, however, point out that there is no experimental evidence for any process that produces an asymmetry between matter and antimatter. In particle accelerators, matter and antimatter are always produced in exactly equal amounts. If such equal amounts of matter and antimatter existed at high density, they would have annihilated each other during the expansion, leaving behind a very dilute universe. Thus, critics contend, the big bang theory, combined with observed physical laws, produces a universe that is billions of times less dense than that observed.</p>
<p>Again the notion of dark matter has been sharply criticized by some physicists, who point out that laboratory searches for such dark matter particles have given only negative results for the past 25 years.</p>
<p>The necessity for big bang theorists to introduce an unobserved type of matter (dark matter) and an unobserved type of energy (dark energy) to resolve contradictions between the big bang theory and observation has been compared by critics of the theory to the epicycles introduced by Ptolemy to resolve problems with the heliocentric model of the solar system. The big bang theory predicts that surface brightness, brightness divided by apparent surface area, decreases as (z+1)^-3, where z is redshift. More distant objects actually should appear bigger. But recent observations show that in fact the surface brightness of galaxies up to a redshift of 6 are exactly constant, as predicted by a non-expanding universe and in sharp contradiction to the big bang. Efforts to explain this difference by evolution--early galaxies are different than those today-- lead to predictions of galaxies that are impossibly bright and dense.</p>
<p>However many observers pointed out that the anisotropies in the WMAP data were not random or Guassian, as predicted by inflation. Instead they had strong alignments in the sky--for example with the Local Supercluster of galaxies. Such alginments of the CMB with local features in the universe contradicted the big bang explanation of the CMB.</p>
<p>In addition, in 2005 Richard Lieu and colleagues presented a study of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect of 31 clusters of galaxies. In this effect, CBR from behind the clusters is slightly “shadowed” by hot electrons in the clusters. Lieu showed that the effect for these clusters was at most one quarter of that predicted, strongly implying that most of the CBR radiation originated closer to us than the clusters, as predicted by the plasma model, but in sharp contraction to the big bang model, which assumes that all the CBR originates at extreme distances.</p>
<p>in section on light elements- replacing factually inaccurate statement that there is agreement between BB predictions and observations: However, increasingly accurate measurements of these abundances point to values that are in contradiction with the values predicted by the big bang. In particular, lithium abundances are only one quarter of that predicted by big bang theory, a difference far larger than the uncertainties of lithium measurements. Critics have pointed to this contradiction as another failure of the theory.”</p>
<p>If you have reasons why any of this is not true, state them. Otherwise, they belong in the article. The article as it stand now is not factual, it is a polemic—a one side presentation, with many inaccuracies – of a ongoing debate.<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElerner_3f7c.html" title="User:Elerner">Elerner</a> 17:40, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will briefly respond to these, although I emphasize again that Wikipedia is not the proper venue for debate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Very few physicists think the theory has been contradicted.</li>
<li>(re: baryogenesis) Fitch and Cronin discovered CP asymmetry in 1962.</li>
<li>(re: alignment of CMB) This is contradicted by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404567" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404567" rel="nofollow">Slosar and Seljak</a> who state that "as soon as foreground uncertainties are included the evidence for this alignment disappears."</li>
<li>(re: Sunyaev-Zel'dovich) The Lieu paper has not been peer-reviewed, so certainly does not belong in the main big bang article.</li>
<li>(re: BBN) There is a problem with lithium abundances. They are a little less than 50% low, not 75% as you state. See <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0501591" class="external text" title="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0501591" rel="nofollow">Steigman</a>. This may be due to astrophysics. There are still large experimental uncertainties. (You may be familiar with the physics joke that 95% of 2σ results are wrong.)</li>

<p>Actually most physicists think the Big Bang has become a joke. Cosmologists and particle physicists are themselves a small minority of all physicists. I note that you had nothing to say to the surface brigthness work. The rest of your remarks are not worth replying to until you tell us who you are.

<p>I only know a handful of the world's physicists, of course, but they are fairly well distributed amongst astrophysicists and astronomers, cosmologists, particle physicists, plasma physicists, nuclear physicists, atomic physicists and even some biophysicists and condensed matter physicists. They also seem to be relatively well distributed amongst theorists, experimentalists and observers. I have yet to meet any who doubt the big bang, which is not to say that I don't think they exist, just that they're in the minority.</p>
<p>I have nothing to say about the surface brightness work, because I don't know anything about it and a lot of astrophysics is outside of my competence. Joshuaschroeder seems to know more about that than me.</p>
<p>I will not tell you who I am. Feel free to attribute any nefarious motives to that you like. You can doubt I am a physicist if you like. I don't care. I never made any representations of being a physicist. All I ask is that the Wikipedia community judge me by my substantial record of editing general relativity, cosmology and particle physics related articles.

<dd>As an astronomer who has worked at many different observatories around the world, I can assert that in the astronomy community there are <i>very</i> few people who disagree with the Big Bang theory. In my personal experience of the physics community as a whole, every person <i>I</i> have met who disagrees with the Big Bang theory has turned out not to understand the evidence supporting the theory. As far as F. Hoyle, G. Burbidge, and J.V. Narlikar are concerned, it is probably not helpful to your cause <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> to bring these people up. Hoyle in particular was quietly considered (later in his life) to be an embarrassment by many in the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_of_Astronomy_7987.html" title="Institute of Astronomy">Institute of Astronomy</a>, and people were releaved when he (and his <i>flu viruses from space</i> theories) were relocated to Wales. Unfortunately every astronomer receives hundreds of emails a year from lunatics who claim to have disproved the Big Bang theory (usually people who have no qualifications in physics at all, and usually not making any sense at all), so there is a tendency for astronomers to reject all such theories as just more "spam". This is, admittedly, not ideal in terms of scientific practice, but astronomers just don't have time to read hundreds of emails. <a href="../../../r/n/t/User%7ERnt20_32c8.html" title="User:Rnt20">Rnt20</a> 17:21, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is your <i>opinion</i> and <i>personal experience</i>. It may be that the people you have not met tell you what they believe ... or, with those that have told you, you may have misuderstood thier position (I wasn't there so I can't make that jusdgement). To impinge the F. Hoyle's character, though, isn't helpful .... and this wasn't just him but G. Burbidge and J.V. Narlikar also. I also don't have a "cause", just stating neutrality should be observed and the proponents can be wrong as the critics can .... (and historically, the BB proponents were as wrong as everyone else when the CMB was measured ... but the BB proponents changed thier equation as did the other "good" theories ... but then the BB proponents "declared" victory. ...)

<dd>Sorry, I should have said -- I never actually met Fred Hoyle and was merely reporting what astronomers had said to me (and you can't always believe what you hear of course!). I know the Fred Hoyle made plenty of very important contributions to astronomy, particularly earlier in his career, and added a lot to the great cosmological debates of the 1960s. <a href="../../../r/n/t/User%7ERnt20_32c8.html" title="User:Rnt20">Rnt20</a> 09:42, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The good news here is that the discussion has suddenly turned toward counting well-known supporters and dissenters, not trying to decide the Big Bang for ourselves. That is my understanding of the Wikipedian ideal way to decide how much attention should be given to a minority opinion. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArt_LaPella_8451.html" title="User:Art LaPella">Art LaPella</a> 21:14, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The point about anonymity is not about credentials. If someone claims to be an expert, they need to say who they are, so that their record can be judged by others. Joke137 identified himself on his profile page as ‘a competent cosmologist’, so that is why I asked that he identify himself. Now we know he is not a cosmologist at all, since he says he is no physicist and all cosmologists are physicists—it’s a branch of astrophysics. Fine, then it is irrelevant who he is. But he should not claim an expertise he does not have.</p>
<p>The article as it stands does the reader a disservice because it states things that are just not true and because it portrays a field that is controversial as non-controversial. A controversy over the big bang is being widely reported in the press, --New Scientist, BBC, elsewhere. There are scientific conferences about it. To say there can be no discussion of that debate nor any mention of what critics say is wrong with theory means the article is deceptive—it is disinformation, not information.</p>
<p>The self-appointed guardians of this article even admit that they don’t know anything about some of what I have posted—such as the surface brightness data—yet they remove it anyway. That is hardly NPOV.<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElerner_3f7c.html" title="User:Elerner">Elerner</a> 02:22, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"<i>To say there can be no discussion of that debate nor any mention of what critics say is wrong with theory means the article is deceptive…</i>" — I don't see anyone refusing to discuss it here. I just see people who do not wish to identify themselves. That's how Wikipedia operates. If you'd like to discuss your concerns with other editors "offline", so to speak, there are other options. For example, I believe most registered Wikipedians allow you to send emails to a registered account (just go to a user page and look for the relevant link). <span class="user-sig user-horsepunchkid">—<a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family:monospace;font-variant:small-caps;cursor:crosshair;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color:#070;cursor:help;" title="Kame-san says: Talk to me!">龜</span></a></span> 02:34, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, I forgot my user page even says that. You can see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Joke137&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Joke137&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> that I have never even edited the user page. I suppose <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> got tired of seeing the red link on my name. Eric, I never claimed not to be a physicist, however. My point is that it doesn't <i>matter</i> who I am. I am not interested in making arguments from authority. What matters is that I am able to constructively discuss changes to a page and use the scientific literature to improve it.</p>
<p>I agree that there are people who disagree with the big bang, and think that dark matter, dark energy and cosmic inflation are Ptolemaic edificies. They published an article in the <i>New Scientist</i>, had a conference in Portugal, and write scientific papers. Their theories belong on Wikipedia. They are mentioned in the article. However, the scientific consensus in the academy is still <i>overwhelmingly</i> in favor of the big bang model and framing the whole article in a tentative way would be as much POV-pushing as not mentioning them at all.</p>
<p>I removed the surface brightness reference because it was not from a peer-reviewed journal and given the other disagreements I had with your changes, it seemed likely that that was suspect as well. I have also seen <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a>'s disagreement about this and know something about how hard it is to do comparisons at different redshifts from my knowledge of the systematics of Type Ia supernovae. I'd have thought it would be admirable that I admit I am out of my depth on one of your points.</p>
<p>You and the other editors can see my willingness to engage in constructive discussion – within the framework of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> – on here and on <a href="../../../p/l/a/Talk%7EPlasma_cosmology_bb1b.html" title="Talk:Plasma cosmology">Talk:Plasma cosmology</a>.

<dd>Joke137, your understanding of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is not non-selective in what that entails and your adherance to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is not neutral. Keeping a academic POV and only allowing "peer-reviewed material" prevents consensus being formed.

<p>It’s late, so I will make this short. The surface brightness paper was in a peer-reviewed proceedings. The lithium papers are all peer-reviewed. I see absolutely no willingness on your part or Joshua’s to allow anything on this page that contradicts the big bang. That is so not NPOV it is absurd.<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElerner_3f7c.html" title="User:Elerner">Elerner</a> 04:48, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The surface brightness paper is not peer reviewed. Any reviewer would point out that there is a simple alternative explanation involving galaxy evolution from early times to late times. The utility of surface brightness comparisons for ruling out the Robertson-Walker metric is certainly in principle possible, but you have to have a confirmed standard candle which Lerner has not demonstarted he has. As I said on the plasma cosmology page, though, I am not the reviewer of Lerner's paper. I defer to Joke's reference for the lithium paper. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 06:03, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just because you say something does not make it true, Joshua. There’s also reality. My paper was peer-reviewed as part of the proceedings. It is a requirement for all American Institute of Physics proceedings. If you had read the paper, or even the paragraph you deleted, you would realize why you are wrong about evolution. The data demonstrate that if you assume that evolution exactly compensated for the BB-predicted dimming, the surface brightness of the high-z galaxies would be more than an order of magnitude brighter than the brightest observed low-z galaxies, including very young ones. Indeed such extreme surface brightness appears to be physically impossible in the UV, because dust absorption limits it. Also, if you believe evolution accounts of this, you have to believe it is just an amazing coincidence that the data exactly supports constant surface brightness.</p>

<dd>Models continue to be discussed accounting for surface brightness evolution and selection effects in HST. <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/stsci/meetings/shst2/longairm.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stsci.edu/stsci/meetings/shst2/longairm.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 13:49, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I don't see that the proceedings have been published yet, but I do see that (at least some, but perhaps all) AIP proceedings are peer reviewed. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 04:48, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Incidentally, I don't see much justification for the edit summary "revert to more balanced article, since objections scientifically unsound", since I actually made an effort to respond to some of the points you added, to which you responded by attacking my lack of credentials. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 04:50, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As for Rnt20, he or she should state their name. Otherwise, we can assume that the claim to be an astronomer is just boasting. If you want a list of astronomers who doubt the big bang, just try www.cosmologystatement.org. As the statement says, there are many more that in fact doubt this theory, but are afraid to say so.<a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElerner_3f7c.html" title="User:Elerner">Elerner</a> 03:12, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
