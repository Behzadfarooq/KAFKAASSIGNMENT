<h2><span class="mw-headline">Your reversion re: Campion and Luther Colleges</span></h2>
<p>You're quite right: there was a grammatical error. I had written the sentence which I had now edited with a view to make it more accurate as to the status of Luther and Campion before they became federated colleges of the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus (as it then was). Both were high schools -- as the old Luther remains. But they also offered first year university courses accredited by the University of Saskatchewan, as did Regina College. When they became federated colleges (and, before that, when Regina College became the U of S Regina Campus) this became moot; they simply offered university courses at Regina Campus. So we are talking history here. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 16:26, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That that wikifying tag was added was a few minutes after the article was created, and was still being added-to. That has nothing to do with what BigNate37 is referring to, which is the slapping on of maybe fifty cite tags in each of this and other articles identified with me, and another putative adversary of this editor, by by the blocked user. The user was blocked right after his spree. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 14:36, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Ah, I wasn't accurately speaking when I said I removed Rayc's wikify tag from <a href="../../../e/c/u/ECustoms_be3b.html" title="ECustoms">eCustoms</a>. What I meant was that I removed the {{context}} tag. Rayc put it there when he removed the wikify tag, and used (wikify) as the edit summary.

<p>Hello; thanks for contacting me. I've unblocked your account and your autoblocked IP at wiktionary. Apologies for the situation. I'll look further into it in a minute.

<dd>Sorry about the aggravation. The "auto-block bot" had been a bluff - you entered your new account during a vandalism storm (much more noticable on smaller projects) with a username pattern that matched the vandal's. That is, there is no <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:BigNate" class="extiw" title="wikt:User:BigNate">wikt:User:BigNate</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Big_Nate" class="extiw" title="wikt:User:Big_Nate">wikt:User:Big Nate</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Bignate" class="extiw" title="wikt:User:Bignate">wikt:User:Bignate</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Big_nate" class="extiw" title="wikt:User:Big_nate">wikt:User:Big nate</a>, so the addition of the numbers implied it was a semi-automated addition of a two-to-three digit number. When you incurred an auto-block, I renewed the checking request on meta: since that didn't fit the pattern properly. When the results of that check <b>finally</b> came back, Vildricianus unblocked you. Of those twenty-seven blocks, your's was the only incorrect one.

<dd>Say, can I ask another question? I see that Wres recreated the article shortly after it was deleted (and it's been re-tagged as CSD A7). Is it possible to end up in a loop where one editor keeps recreating an article that keeps getting speedied, or does something else happen? I know that an article deleted on AFD can be speedied if its recreated, but I'm not sure about this case. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37">BigNate37</a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BigNate37_2704.html" title="Special:Contributions/BigNate37">C</a></sub> 09:18, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If the article was speedied, then the previous deletion is not considered. You just check to see if it still meets the speedy deletion requirements. If the article went through AfD and is substantially similar, it can be deleted as recreated content. If a deleted article keeps getting recreated, it can be deleted and then recreated with nothing but a template that explains things and then permanently protected from editing. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 09:23, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Nathan, thanks for your concern about the Paraguay article. I left a message to the IP user that made the last change (restoring the whole Braziguayan paragraph) and I'll do the same for Osasco. I'll wait for a response from them, but if they don't reply and keep adding the same stuff without any type of sources then we can request protection for the page. Does it sound like a good "plan" to you?. Regards. <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruno18_d341.html" title="User:Bruno18">Bruno18</a> 14:41, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. I wasn't too sure if there was something we should be doing or not in light of this recent <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braziguayan.html" title="Braziguayan">Braziguayan</a> onset of anonymous edits to the article. I'm mostly concerned with the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braziguayans.html" title="Braziguayans">Braziguayans</a> article, because in my eyes it is totally unverifiable and as such information relating to the topic would only taint the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraguay.html" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37">BigNate37</a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BigNate37_2704.html" title="Special:Contributions/BigNate37">C</a></sub> 14:45, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I forgot about the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Braziguayans.html" title="Braziguayans">Braziguayans</a> article. While the article is true in some way (there are many Brazilians and their descendants in Paraguay) it's the whole "according to unofficial data" statistical part that is plain wrong and uncyclopedic. Unless Osasco can back that up with sources, it needs to go in my opinion. Do you think it would be a good idea to nominate the article for deletion? <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruno18_d341.html" title="User:Bruno18">Bruno18</a> 15:02, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've <i>just</i> cleaned the article up a lot (though I did nothing for its <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>) and slapped on a disputed tag.

I'd definately support an AfD nomination but with my very limited knowledge on the topic I thought it best not to be hasty in removing content. If you, being more familiar with the subject matter at hand, feel that it merits AfD as having no chance to be verified, I'll be the first to support it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37">BigNate37</a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BigNate37_2704.html" title="Special:Contributions/BigNate37">C</a></sub> 15:06, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear BigNate37, thanks for the welcome message. It's my only message here so far. I'm not certain what prompted it, although it could be because I started a new article (Memory Spots) whereas I usually just correct grammar and spelling as I read.</p>
<p>I love wikipedia, and use it every single day. I drink my morning coffee from a wikipedia mug.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I haven't spent a lot of time reading the policies here, b/c 1 - I don't plan to vandalize. No malicious intentions here. 2 - I figure that after I make my first big blunder, I will be corrected and thus motivated to read the details.</p>
<p>For now, I've simply been copying markup language as I need it (e.g. to create external links, to sign with tildes, etc.)</p>
<p>I do have a question, though, and I said that I could ask here: How do I remove the red text that says "Template" at the Durban Strategy page?</p>

<dd>It is my position that if a redirect's target is being considered for AfD that this is <b>not</b> a valid reason for deleting the redirect on RfD. In fact, this is terrible reasoning.
<ul>
<li>If the target gets deleted, the redirects linking to it can be speedied as a matter of housekeeping and we've wasted our collective breaths considering the redirect for deletion. Worst case, the pages are not deleted and we've made a decision on a phantom criteria that never came to fruition.</li>
<li>RfD should not be considering the validity of the articles that redirects link to. RfD's scope does not include deleting a redirect because the target does not deserve a redirect. Any deletionist arguement, in my opinion, must originate from one or more of the six criteria at <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html#When_should_we_delete_a_redirect.3F" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD#When_should_we_delete_a_redirect?</a>. It is very bad practice to judge the merit of a redirect on the merit of its target, and I strongly discourage you from this line of reasoning. As a corollary, the only basis for deciding whether an article does not <i>deserve</i> a redirect is whether the article deserves to be an article. I believe this applies to non-namespace zero articles as much as it does to namespace zero articles.</li>

Off the top of my head, I think this was mentioned in a few RfA discussions. How do people arrive at these numbers? Personally I'd like to know what proportion of my edits are actually in article space. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37">BigNate37</a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BigNate37_2704.html" title="Special:Contributions/BigNate37">C</a></sub> 01:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cool, thanks. Say, I know its asking a lot, but is it also possible to count edits from deleted articles? Either way, thanks again—your tool + MS Excel gave me a quick tally and percentage breakdown. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37">BigNate37</a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BigNate37_2704.html" title="Special:Contributions/BigNate37">C</a></sub> 03:07, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately it's not possible to do this with Tool2, as there is no on-wiki way to get a list of a person's deleted edits. It might be possible to do that with the toolserver tool, but again, that's old data. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 04:49, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">MarzEz' deleted page</span></h2>
<p>MarzEz (actually my younger brother) was complaining because his page at ME and my family: got deleted. I explained his error to him, and showed him how to create pages in his userspace and created an empty page at <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarzEz_ME_and_my_family_c4cf.html" title="User:MarzEz/ME and my family">User:MarzEz/ME and my family</a> for him. I was wondering if you could recover the contents for him and put them at <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarzEz_ME_and_my_family_c4cf.html" title="User:MarzEz/ME and my family">User:MarzEz/ME and my family</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to post on my <a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerrorBite_100a.html" title="User talk:TerrorBite">talk page</a>. Thanks, <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorBite_8f26.html" title="User:TerrorBite">TerrorBite</a> 08:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid only an administrator can revive deleted pages, of which I am not. Sorry for the fuss, normally I (read: probably not others) would move the article to the user's page if the user didn't already have a page. In this case, I wasn't able to do that because there was already a page there. Perhaps in the future I'll create a subpage in instances like this. Anyways, sorry I can't help recover that material, and best wishes with it. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigNate37_8426.html" title="User:BigNate37">BigNate37</a><sub><a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html" title="User talk:BigNate37">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BigNate37_2704.html" title="Special:Contributions/BigNate37">C</a></sub> 08:32, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK then, thanks anyway. I knew it was a long shot. Btw, I also added a comment under <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigNate37_d4bc.html#Trouble_with_section_-_dumping_it_here_for_now" title="User talk:BigNate37">User_talk:BigNate37#Trouble with section - dumping it here for now</a> concerning those Categories links. I just happened across that info while trying to find out how to right-align an infobox. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorBite_8f26.html" title="User:TerrorBite">TerrorBite</a> 08:39, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
