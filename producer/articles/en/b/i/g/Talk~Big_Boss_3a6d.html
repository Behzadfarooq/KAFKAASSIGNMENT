<p>I've played Portable Ops all the way through and they don't give any reason why Big Boss starts Outer Heaven, the events of the game at most serves as where BB got the <i>idea</i> for it, but not the reasons itself (which is left open until the next game). I'd like to change that little part in the article under the Portable Ops section where it blindly says the game "explores his reason" to "shows his inspiration for". Just to be a little more accurate.</p>
<p><br />
It does in a way; In the final cutscene in which Snake/ Big Boss appears, he tells Campbell something like he only feels truly alive when he's in the battlefield, much like Solid Snake states in MGS I believe. Considering what he saw Gene doing, by continuously manipulating soldiers such as Snake's mentor (The Boss), himself, as well as the other soldiers abandoned in the base, he probably felt partially obliged to do something. For extense, when Gene reveals to Big Boss the idea of creating a nation, he refers to it as "Army's Heaven" I believe. Big Boss does not consider such definition entirely accurate, considering the kind of person Gene truly is, and states that what soldiers are actually looking for is something "outside your heaven", which seems a direct reference to "Outer Heaven" and his idea of what a nation run for and by soldiers should be. Altough the amount of money Gene was able to accumulate over the years is not revelaed, it is possible that this was the money that allowed Big Boss to establish his future nation.</p>
<p>It also may show why Big Boss sent Solid Snake 25 years later into Outer Heaven: Because of what Elisa told him, regarding his children. Altough he may have not been able to fully understand it's meaning at the time (after all, he couldn't be a father), he would later on understand what she meant by it.</p>
<p>Sorry if I'm speculating a little bit(?), but after all, there are so many possibilities.--User:Bigger Boss</p>

<p>I uploaded the new render of the MPO version of Big Boss because it's a full body picture like the artwork from MGS and the MGS3 render.

<dd>It might look better, but it's watermarked too and I don't think Wikipedia is partial to watermarked images. Eventually someone else's gonna remove it, so better find an unmarked one or used a screenshot. Jonny2x4 03:32, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>·Name: Big Boss' real name is definetly unknown for the time being. Here it says Jack/John. Either of them can be the real one:</p>
<p>1-About Jack: At the beginning of the game Para-Medic asks Snake his real name already knowing that they call him Jack (<i>And they call you Jack for short</i> she says after he answered his name was John Doe). If Jack was actually his real name it would be silly to ask his name again,she actually knows that he is called Jack. That means Jack is definetly NOT his real name after all. Note also that if you choose the "I like MGS2" option before starting (when Snake weares the Raikov's Mask) there are a few calls with Major Tom which suggest that for some reason is better to hide Snake's true identity to the gunship crew. In fact everyone who knows him calls him Jack (the Major,The Boss)so he commonly uses Jack to be refered in some way but he doesn't want his real name to be known (maybe it's a really odd one xD,remember that he has japanesse ancestors). Also there is another reference to Raiden,who suggest that he dislikes his name (<i>It's better that the one my parents gave me</i>he says to Snake in MGS2)</p>
<p>2-About John: He tells Para-Medic his name is John Doe trying to hide her his real name (we know that John Doe is bla bla bla a name used to hide someone's name or to identify someone without name), which is something that is clear for everyone. The next time he says his name is John is in the "Last Showdown" with Ocelot, at the same time he says John his mouth turns in a mock expression. He is clarely lying Ocelot, he knows that Ocelot will sure believe it because it's idolic seen of him, Ocelot is also younger and unnexperienced (that also suggests that Ocelot real name is in fact Adamska...). Also when Ocelot sees him off (So we meet again, John) Snake does that mocking smile again.</p>
<p>In almost every MGS Snake dislikes to reveal his name, because that links him to a person. And in fact in a mission could be something unnecesary <i>A name means nothing in the battlefield, after a week, no one has a name</i> both Solid and Big Boss say that. Solid Snake only reveales his name to Meryl and Otacon (can we doubt it that one? The cannonical final is the Meryl one...,just kidding). So,for the time being we really don't know Big Boss' real name so please change it to Unknown. And one more thing,where didi you get that Solidus named Raiden Jack after Big Boss?</p>
<p>·Age: People is starting to think that he was born in the 1930's, and that's not for sure. Liquid said that he was in his latest 50 when they created his copies, and that is impossible too. He should be born late in the 20's,probably 1926 or 1927. It is said that he was in WWII as a teenage by his own will,but with 11-12 years...If he was born in the dates I said he could be in his first battle at at least 17-18,just like his sons. Also in 1964 (Snake Eater) he resembles much to Solid Snake in MGS2,who is 37 (and looks older by advanced cell degeneration). So he must be in a similar age,maybe a little older...born in 1925? Why not? There's no need that The Boss would be much older for teaching him, she has a lot more of experience and she also has been trained by the Philosophers' best. She could be born perfectly in 1920-1921 and Snake in 1925-1927.He would be 37-39 at Snake Eater,43-45 at MPO,45-47 being cloned,68-70 at Outer Heaven and 72-74 at Zanzibar Land.</p>
<p>·Nationality and etnicity: It is clear that he has japanese ancestors (Raven told it to Solid Snake,he also knew and their factions denote some etnic mix),but it's unclear how. There is some info in the net that says he was born in Hawaii, the third generation of a japanese-american family. It is also said that in the Pearl Harbour Incident he lost the american branch of his family while the japanese was imprisioned (that sounds a little fantastic...). Do any of you know something about this?</p>

<dd>I'd say Big Boss was born in the 30s, probably 1930-33 (making him 31-34 in Snake Eater, though he does look much older in the artwork than he does in game). Given the fact we know that The Boss encountered Big Boss after he did the stuff at Bikini Atoll, and we know that they were together for "ten years" and that they had been separated for around five years in 1964, my guess is that he was involved in "Operation Sandstone" on Bikini Atoll in 1948, when he was 15-18. BB strikes me as the sort of person who would have lied about his age to join the army earlier. He then becomes a disciple of the Boss (who is ten to thirteen years older than him) in 1949 and sees his first proper war in the Korean War of 1950, aged 17-20.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think he's any closer in age to The Boss for the following reasons:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>He refers to her being like a mother.</li>
<li>She refers to him as a child.</li>
</ol>
<p>(80.1.72.245 16:20, 23 November 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But as I said she was a lot more experienced, the age factor has almost no relevance. Besides, think in what I said about him being very similar to Solid Snake in MGS2 (37 and looking older) he looks older than 30-31. You are probably right when you soy that he lied about his age, but being a little older than 12-15.Think about it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see that the name factor do not causes discussion so I'm going to change it.</p>
<p>Black Dollar 14 December 2006</p>
<p>Actually I'm sure that Big Boss' real name is Jack because even in Metal Gear Solid: PO, Gene calls him Jack at the end o the game</p>
<p>24.81.59.101 02:27, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Big Boss' real name issue has been discussed countless times, and I believe Kojima once stated that BOTH names may be considered canonical. Don't ask me how though...</p>
<p>Also, last time I checked, Adamska is a woman's name, therefore I believe that Ocelot was merely trying to tip off Big Boss to who he really was: ADAM. But then again, that's just (another) theory... - Bigger Boss 07:16, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Name debate</b> (maybe we should have left this section in the article, since the issue remains unclear for many people): So what elements do we have here:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>In the "Leaked Document", his real name is "Jack".</li>
<li>In the game (both MGS3 and MPO) people not calling him by his codename call him "Jack"</li>
<li>He says to Ocelot that his real name is "John".</li>
<li>Konami's official website states his nickname to be "Jack"</li>
<li>In the 8th session of the Kojima Production Report (the english version of the "Hide-chan Radio"), Kojima was a special guest and he was asked what was Big Boss's real name, Jack or John&#160;? His answer: "It's both. (interviewer: <i>Like Bill and William, it's the same name</i>). So either of one is OK. There's no distinct difference. It's like saying "Hey man&#160;!" as a greeting".</li>
</ul>
<p>So you have it, they're both interchangeable names. When Zero and the crew are calling Snake "Jack" they're not using a false name, when Snake gave his name to Ocelot he wasn't lying. Now in general, it was John which came first, and then "Jack" was the diminutive or the nickname. Seeing how his crew and his close friends call him "Jack" and how he gave the name "John" to Ocelot, who is concidered as a valuable and respectable opponent by BB, we could deduce that John is his actual name, the name that appears on his official ID or vital record, etc. But it doesn't matter much as both names are interchangeable.</p>
<p>I'm very sure his name IS John, simply because Jack is a nickname of John. My name is David and I get called 'Dave' when people first meet up as a sign of say, amity? Gene called him Jack as well, now he has been called Jack twice and at both times they were expressions of 'attempted' amity (Despite Gene being the adversary, he was trying to convince Snake.) Either way, it's a good name for a Boss =p <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZerocannon_2317.html" title="User:Zerocannon">Zerocannon</a> 09:52, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Age debate</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Again, the "Leaked document" states he was born in the 1930s</li>
<li>Kojima stated somewhere that Naked Snake was designed to be around the same age as Snake in MGS 2 (that is, ~35/37) and that he was specifically made younger compared to what was stated in MGS 1 about him (Liquid said Big Boss was cloned "in his late 50s" but this has now been retconned, BB was in his early 40s when he was cloned).</li>
<li>That would mean he was born in the early 30s. If he was 35 in MGS 3, then he was born in 1929 or 30. If he was 37, he was born in 1927/1828. Of course he could easily be 34 or 33 in MGS 3...</li>
<li>Big Boss never took part in WWII. These were just extrapolations published in an MGS 1 game guide entirely authored by US writers. Kojima already said he had nothing to do with this guide. And anyway, in the light of MGS 3, this would have been technically impossible: he was too young (with the MGS 3 new chronology, he was around 15 during the war), and how could he possibly have taken part to WWII if he only met The Boss in the 1950's&#160;?</li>

<p>Well spoken. But in any case you have forgotten the part above in which I mention his dialog with paramedic at the begining of MGS3. Black Dollar 14 January 2007</p>
<dl>
<dd>I take into account only official explanations from Kojima himself or other official documents/commentaries. You're personal interpretations about some dialogues between Paramedic and Snake do not matter, since Kojima himself said Big Boss's real name was either Jack or John. In this dialogue, Snake is just joking about his real name. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolken_de_Fanel_8812.html" title="User:Folken de Fanel">Folken de Fanel</a> 12:48, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Liquid said that Big Boss had been cloned in his late 50s in MGS2, not MGS1. I believe that his age at the time should have never been mentioned to begin with. But then again, Liquid loves to taunt his brother... Bigger Boss 13:11, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Boss was born in 192X, she looks like she is in her late fourties. Big Boss is easily assumed with common sense that he was born sometime in the thirties, if not, the last year (1939). I would say his age would be somewhere from 27-29. The Boss makes a comment saying he is too young to come with the Cobras near the end of the Virtous Mission, so thats a minor supporting detail. Also, in six years, Big Boss would be 33-35, the age of Solid Snake being 33 in Shadow Moses, and 35 in the Tanker Chapter of MGS2. I would stick to this age.<br />
Also, Pliskin looks almost exactly like MG/MG2 Solid Snake if you take out the mullet and a wrinkle or two.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and in The Document of MGS2's script, it says Solid Snake was experiencing accelerated aging recently at the time of the Tanker Chapter. Solid Snake is 35. I wonder why that age?&#160;;)--24.91.78.26 03:05, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Which would mean that you're implying that Big Boss was cloned when he was 35, making him 27 in MGS3 and 33 in MPO. Ofcourse, this goes against Kojima stating Snake was in his 30s (ofcourse, the Leaked Document had small differences with the finalized character data - like Volgin's full name.)Jack Raiden 08:04, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Big Boss was defintely in his 70's during MG1-2 according to early published materials. Not just the MGS: Official Mission Guidebook, but also the official Japanese MGS site and the Art of MGS. There's really no point at listing Big Boss' ages, since it seems to had changed from MGS2 to MGS3. Jonny2x4 21:10, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I corrected the statement about Big Boss' loss of his eye. While it (the paragraph) originally said that Hideo Kojima lost his eye when Ocelot shot it accidentally, the truth is that the bullet itself did not strike his eye, but it was the muzzle flash that burnt it. This is revealed in the Hideo Kojima commentary for MGS3. There is a link to it which can be provided, but hopefully this is not a big enough issue that needs to be linked to. Also, I don't know how to write in references to sources, so if anyone can post a reference to my source if it comes under question, feel free to do so.</p>

<p>Most of this article is an in-universe plot summary of the bits of games where Big Boss appears or is mentioned- only bits and bobs are about the character's development through the series, the inspiration for him, etc. It's more a Metal Gear/ 2/ Solid/ Solid 2/ Solid 3/ Portable Ops plot summary than a character page at the moment, IMO. I suggest we rethink how best to approach a re-write to discuss how the character evolved from stereotypical villain in MG to the protagonist of later titles, the inspiration for him, the role his character performs in delivering Kojima's dramatic message, etc. Leave the "Big Boss Bio" for a fansite or MetalGearWiki. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperspacey_36cc.html" title="User:Hyperspacey">Hyperspacey</a> 12:21, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just deleted the speculation bit(?) regarding Big Boss' role in the Patriots organization and the Outer Heaven bit, since it's nothing more than that. So far, it has already been discussed in the previous games why he established it, and therefore it makes no sense to say that he did it to destroy the Patriots, altough it may be possible indeed. Therefore, unless there is a confirmation by Kojima or something of that sort, it makes little sense to add something like that to the article.</p>
<p>Also, whoever keeps adding stuff such as the date in which the "Les Enfants Terrible" Project started, the time in which Big Boss' cells were extracted or the mysterious third party, please stop. There's no way to proove the Project began in 1971, since the official MGS chronology establishes it in 1972 (the birth of the three Snakes anyway). There's no way either to know if Big Boss fell in a coma after destroying Metal Gear, since there's not enough info to support that (altough it's possible). The same applies to the mysterious third party; Let's stick to the facts please, and NOT speculation. Thanks for the attention. --User:Bigger Boss - 29 December 2006</p>

<p>His age was retconned from Metal Gear Solid to Metal Gear Solid 3. In Metal Gear Solid, Liquid Snake sais that Big Boss was in his fifties during Les Enfants Terribles. The Art of Metal Gear Solid also states (in the official profile, that is) that Big Boss died in his late seventies. Horever, in Metal Gear Solid 3, Naked Snake seems to be in his early thirties, and that would make him 40 during LET and in his late sixties when he died. Kojima changed his age 10 years. I think that should be mentioned in this article. [16:46, 23 January 2007 (UTC)]</p>
