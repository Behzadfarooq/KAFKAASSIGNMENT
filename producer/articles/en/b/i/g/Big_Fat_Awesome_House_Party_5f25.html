<p><i><b>Big Fat Awesome House Party</b></i> is an online <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adobe_Shockwave_90fa.html" title="Adobe Shockwave">Adobe Shockwave</a> video game created by <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartoon_Network_8384.html" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a>'s interactive division and Powerful Robot Games featuring the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Foster%27s_Home_for_Imaginary_Friends_characters_3258.html" title="List of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends characters">characters</a> of <i><a href="../../../f/o/s/Foster%27s_Home_for_Imaginary_Friends_4c3c.html" title="Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a></i>. Availability is limited to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">USA</a> and its territories. The game is a "massively-singleplayer online role-playing game." Unlike an <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a>, in which the players interact with each other, no player in this game can interact with another directly. The game began on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_15.html" title="May 15">May 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>
<p>Registration for the game is free of charge, only requiring the user to give a screen name and password. The user must also give a state and birthday. The state information gives the game the player's time zone, which supposedly determines the relevant day and night cycles in the game; however, the time is determined from the system clock of the users computer. On the player's birthday, the other residents of the house will throw a party for the player. As a gift, the player's popularity bar is filled and they are given a party hat to wear.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the game is to go on adventures with <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloo.html" title="Bloo">Bloo</a>. To do this, the player must perform chores to build up their citizenship. Going on an adventure with Bloo is their reward for doing enough chores. Additionally, doing favors for other friends and going on adventures with Bloo allows the player to unlock minigames, giving them the ability to win various in-game prizes.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Fat_Awesome_House_Party_5f25.html" title="Edit section: Gameplay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h2>
<p>Top-down scrolling makes up the majority of gameplay, with the exception of some of the minigames. Action within the game is limited to interacting with various objects and people. Every task in the main game involves talking to a character, picking an object up, triggering a specific object, or transporting an object from one point to another. In the bottom lefthand corner are the status bars, which show the player's citizenship level (nine points total), their popularity level (nine points total), and the number of favors they are owed (four total). In the bottom righthand corner, an exclamation mark will appear when the player can interact with an object.</p>
<p>Progress in the game is saved each time the player logs off. Premature disconnections do not result in a loss of progress, but require that the player give the system five minutes to log the user out automatically, since logging in requires the account be inactive. Chores and favors in the game are based on a 24-hour clock, and only a few can be done within a given day. The game is reset at 12:00 a.m. <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Eastern_Time_Zone_d793.html" title="North American Eastern Time Zone">EST</a>, allowing the player to repeat these actions and progress further. Minigames offer no progress other than the collection of decorative items, so they are not restricted by this.</p>

The character design screen.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After creating an account, the first thing the player does is design their imaginary friend. The player can select the head, body, and feet, each of which have six different options. The player can also choose the color of each body part. The game gives three options when creating imaginary friends. The first option creates a friend with a head on a body. The second option creates a friend with a head attached to a pair of legs. The third option creates a complete imaginary friend. Players can also choose a randomizer option, which assembles a random combination from one of the first three options into a working friend, and can be used repeatedly until a desirable result is achieved. Each option gives different body parts, but always the same number of total choices for each part (six). Once the friend is completed, it can be named and begin the game. Although they do not appear in the character customization screen, hats and buddies can be used to "enhance" the look of the player's imaginary friend.</p>

</div>
<p>Noteworth Bookingham (known to his friends as "Notey") is the player's personal assistant. He appears at the beginning of the game to narrate the tutorial. Afterwards, he can be called on at any point to give a player the status of their chores, favors, and adventures. He also allows a player to review the tutorials and previous conversations. Any items (photos, furniture, etc.) the player collects are also stored by Notey. Finally, he'll allow a player to change various settings (current music, current buddy, etc.) and redesign their friend if they wish.</p>
<p>The November update added a special code area to Notey, indicated by a lock icon. When the correct six-character code is entered, the player will receive a gift. The codes are given in various <i>Foster's</i> media, such as episodes of the series and podcasts.<br style="clear: both" /></p>

A typical list of chores.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In <i>Big Fat Awesome House Party</i>, a player's imaginary friend will be assigned three random <a href="../../../h/o/u/Household_chore.html" title="Household chore">chores</a> (referred to as duties) daily by <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Herriman_ed4f.html" title="Mr. Herriman">Mr. Herriman</a>. Once the chores are done, the player must wait until the next day to do more. Should the player neglect to finish their chores, they are made twice as difficult on the following day. Completing a chore increases a player's citizenship bar by one point, which will allow a player to play with Bloo once it's full. Chores include various gags on the show, such as collecting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Foster%27s_Home_for_Imaginary_Friends_ef3e.html#Scribbles" title="List of secondary characters in Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends">Scribbles</a> or picking up laundry. During holiday months, chores can also consist of appropriately-themed tasks for the occasion, such as feeding turkeys in the month of November (<a href="../../../t/h/a/Thanksgiving_%28United_States%29_7e49.html" title="Thanksgiving (United States)">Thanksgiving</a>).<br style="clear: both" /></p>

Favors</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When not doing an adventure, the player can speak to <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduardo_%28Foster%27s%29_926e.html" title="Eduardo (Foster's)">Eduardo</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankie_Foster_7464.html" title="Frankie Foster">Frankie</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_%28Foster%27s%29_447c.html" title="Mac (Foster's)">Mac</a>, or <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilt_%28Foster%27s%29_5f30.html" title="Wilt (Foster's)">Wilt</a> and do a favor for them. Favors follow the same pattern as chores, but only consist of two actions at the most. After completing the favor, the person the player did the favor for will owe the player a favor. The player will also gain a popularity point. Calling on a favor will allow the player to skip half (rounded up on uneven numbers) of the total amount of one of their regular chores. For example, if the chore was to collect five snails, calling in a favor would collect three of them, regardless of whether or not some of the snails had been collected previously. If a chore only has one goal, calling in a favor will complete it instantly. One favor can be done by the player per day. Only four favors can be owed at one time, but they can be from any character in any order.<br style="clear: both" /></p>

One of Bloo's adventures</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After completing nine chores (three days' worth), a player's citizenship bar will be full and they can go on an adventure with Bloo. The adventures are usually based on episodes from the series. Favors can't be done during an adventure, so any exclamation point will specifically relate to the adventure. The adventures follow the same pattern as Mr. Herriman's duties, but take longer to complete. Once an adventure is complete, the player receives a photo commemorating the event and earns six popularity points. Some adventures can also have an actual purpose, such as repairing the elevator. The elevator remains out of order until the particular adventure associated with it is completed. The player's citizenship is reset to zero after the adventure.</p>
<p>Each month adds the same number of adventures as there are new minigame levels (two new minigames means six adventures, for example). Once the player completes every available adventure (69 as of latest update), they can no longer go on adventures until the next update. When the adventures for a given update are completed, the game allows the player to make up any adventures they might have missed in previous months, starting with the earliest. The characters are also moved to the locations they were at during that time.<br style="clear: both" /></p>

The Foster's mansion.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Foster's mansion consists of five floors, the roof and the basement. Of these, all but the roof are accessible through stairs; the roof is accessible through the elevator. Additionally, the front and back yards can be accessed. Originally, only the first and second floors were accessible. New areas are usually unlocked each month. During holiday months, the house is redecorated with appropriate items, such as pumpkins and orange rugs for <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a>.</p>
<p>Each area has various features taken from the show, such as the library or the unicorn stables. The various tasks the player can perform take place in these areas. On the third floor is the player's personal room. With the exception of the front and back yards, each floor has both a staircase and an elevator to access other floors. The main characters can be found in various rooms in the house. They remain in specific rooms, but their locations change depending on how many adventures with Bloo the player has completed. The secondary characters from the series make appearances in random areas of the house. They can be spoken to, as well, but offer nothing other than amusing dialogue.<br style="clear: both" /></p>

It's not possible to pass the Foster's gate, but both the back and front yards can be accessed. To either side of the house are pathways between the two yards. The left-hand pathway also allows access to the basement. The backyard holds many notable locations: the unicorn stables, the forest, the Extreme-a-saur cage, Cyrus the Sea Serpent's lake, the greenhouse, and the pool. Cyrus and the Extreme-a-saur are usually hidden within their respective locations, but the player will occasionally be assigned chores that allow them to see the characters.<br style="clear: both" /></p>

</div>
<p>The first floor is the starting point of the game. When a player first creates their character or logs in to continue playing, they end up in the lobby section of this floor (new players have a short animated sequence of their friend leaving a bus and walking into the house). From the lobby, the other floors can be accessed by taking the stairs or the elevator. The basement can be accessed through a trapdoor in the kitchen. The outside of the mansion can be accessed from the front doors and a rear door in the lounge. Notable rooms on this floor include the lobby, the kitchen, the dining room, Mr. Herriman's office, the lounge, and the arcade room. The arcade room holds all the minigames that a player can access. The dining room is used for the player's birthday party.<br style="clear: both" /></p>

<p>The third floor is where the player's personal room is located. It is past the top-left door on the left side of the hall, marked with a large "My Room" sign. While the room itself is originally undecorated to the point where even the wallpaper is peeling off, it can be decorated with items won by playing the minigames. The furniture themes vary between minigames. Different furniture from different themes can be mixed and matched. The wardrobe room is past the top-right door on the left side of the hall. The file room is past the bottom-right door on the right side of the hall. Like the other floors, lower floors can be accessed through either the elevator or the stairs.

The various minigames.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the arcade room, there are 24 minigames available to the player. Two or three minigames are usually added each month. Each minigame has three different modes, referred to as "levels." Only two of the minigames, <i>Bloo's Brothers</i> and <i>Curse of the Bloo Pearl</i>, are unlocked to begin with. The former has two modes unlocked while the latter has one. To unlock more modes and other minigames, the player must do favors and complete adventures with Bloo to fill their popularity bar. When their popularity bar is full, the player can either unlock a new minigame or unlock a new mode on an active one. In either case, only one mode can be unlocked at a time.</p>
<p>Every game has no ending, only an ever-increasing difficulty level as the player progresses. Each level is also timed. The player's overall score is mostly based on how long they can play before losing. Various in-game elements can be also exploited for additional points, such as repeatedly killing a single, regenerating enemy (time permitting). The levels on each minigame mode tend to remain the same, albeit it with more enemies or distractions, but the higher game modes have extra elements added to make them more challenging.</p>
<p>Each minigame mode has a list of high scores by other imaginary friends from the show. Next to certain scores is an image of a present, indicating a reward should the player beat that score. Rewards can include pictures, extra clothing for the player, furniture for their room, and even background music. The buddies Goo is consistently seen with can also be earned through minigames. Players can also try to beat the high scores of other players, which are recorded by the site and updated weekly; however, this has no reward.</p>
<p>Unlike the normal gameplay, gameplay styles between each minigame vary. Some use the same style as the regular game, while others involve <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point-and-click.html" title="Point-and-click">point-and-click</a> actions using the mouse. On a side note, Bloo is in almost every game by the third level and tends to hinder the player when he appears. Like many online games, some of the minigames are based on other popular arcade games.</p>
