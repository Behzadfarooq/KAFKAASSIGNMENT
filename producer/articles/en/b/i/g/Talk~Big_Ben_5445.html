<p>I noticed that according to www.dictionary.com "big ben" or "Big Ben" is the clock in the clock tower not just the bell. It sites as its source WordNet® 2.0, © 2003 Princeton University.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yup, its just the bell. But as the article says, it is commonly mistakenly used to refer to the clock and even the whole clock tower. See also <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace_of_Westminster_357b.html" title="Palace of Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> which <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Emsworth_c212.html" title="User:Lord Emsworth">User:Lord Emsworth</a> has been doing a nice job of expanding recently.

<dd>It was originally the bell, but has it taken on a second larger meaning as well? I found numerous travel web pages that refer to the clock as big ben. A google image search for "big ben" returns hundreds of pictures of the clock, but in the first 400 of them or so I found only one picture of the bell. Do people in England use the phrase "big ben" only to refer to the bell and not the clock? The fact that there's a "little ben" which is a smaller clock not a smaller bell suggests to me that even in England the usage has evolved.</dd>

<dd><i>Do people in England use the phrase "big ben" only to refer to the bell</i> - Well no, most people in Britain make the same mistake as everyone else, although a fair percentage of them will point to the tower/clock calling it 'big ben' then correct themselves saying "well actually that's just the bell, but..." and then they get a bit confused because they have no idea what they are supposed to call the clock tower if it is not 'Big Ben'. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 20:35, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, the tower is formally known as St George's tower - but let's be honest - in reality it's called "Big Ben" in practice. The name of "Big Ben" for the tower originated from the name of the bell. However, "Big Ben" is so established as the common name of the tower that it would be perverse to say it is wrong to call the tower by that name. There'll always be the clever dick technocrats who like to stick their noses up, say na-na-na-na na-na, you're wrong - it's not called Big Ben - but they're really the ones that fail to see that <i>tempora mutant, et nos mutantur in illis</i>. In short - nowadays "Big Ben" is the name of the clock tower, and the name of the bell, but the clock tower also has a formal name that is sometimes used instead of "Big Ben", <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 20:44, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry Jguk, that's just not right. I'm sure it is still pretty much the case that all school children in the UK are taught that it is only correct to call the bell 'Big Ben'. The problem is that we are not generally taught the correct name for the clock tower. So we all know it is wrong, we just don't know what the right answer is. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 21:11, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not really sure what schoolchildren do get taught - if anything it will be what their teachers think. However, words mean what people use them to mean - and they can change meaning over time. Nowadays, Big Ben is used so frequently for St George's Tower that it can be taken to mean that (as well as the bell too, of course). To say it is "wrong" would not be recognising that language and usage change over time. There are loads of examples, this is just one, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 06:31, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ordinarily I'd be the first to agree with you. However, is this really true when it comes to proper names? If it were a person, they would be the only ones who could control what their real name is, even if most people know them by another one (I'd like to think of an example, like a stage name, but <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a> seems to have changed his name by deed poll). I'm not sure who gets to name bits of the Houses of Parliament, but the official/government web sites are all quite careful on naming the clock tower and the bell. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 07:59, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I beleive that the name of the tower is officially the Clock Tower, but if the tower has other designation in common usuage the article should reflect that without making value judgments on them. The article in fact does do this already with the designation "St George's tower" which the article point's out is not official but the article never claims that it is wrong for people to call it that. I think this pattern should be followed in the case of Big Ben used for the tower. The article should reflect that Big Ben is the name of a bell in the tower but that the name has become so closely associated with the tower itself that the tower it is now generally called Big Ben. It's fine to point out the the official name of the tower is still the Clock Tower but there's no reason to decree that it's wrong to call the tower Big Ben.</dd>

<dd>I'd imagine someone would set the clock forwards and backwards just like any other clock tower. I can't say for sure.--<a href="../../../j/c/v/User%7EJcvamp_7604.html" title="User:Jcvamp">Jcvamp</a> 15:07, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I read on the BBC clicking a few links on who maintains it, it was dated December 30th not sure what year (2002-2005) probably</dd>

<p>Since this page deals with a device designed to keep an accurate measurement, could people get over these little contradictions in metric/imperial units please? It would be great if something could be decided and kept that way right across all of WP, but maintaining the same units on one page would be a start! I for one feel anyone who makes imperial measurements the default in an encyclopedia is crazy. 124.168.242.221 13:48, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Isn't imperial the standard in America? Either way, it would be a good idea to use both American Imperial (or whatever its correct name is) with a note specifying that, and a conversion to decimal, again with a note.--<a href="../../../j/c/v/User%7EJcvamp_7604.html" title="User:Jcvamp">Jcvamp</a> 15:10, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"<b>Big Ben</b> was originally created so that people in England wouldn't need pocket watches. Also it is the bell of the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace_of_Westminster_357b.html" title="Palace of Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> also known as the Great Bell of Westminster, the largest bell in the tower and part of the Great Clock of Westminster. Many people refer to the whole tower as <i>Big Ben</i>, but the name properly refers only to the bell. The clock tower, St. Stephen's Tower, is at the north-eastern end of the building, the home of the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palace_of_Westminster_357b.html" title="Palace of Westminster">Houses of Parliament</a>, and contains the famous <a href="../../../s/t/r/Striking_clock.html" title="Striking clock">striking clock</a> and bell"</p>
<dl>
<dd>At least the first part of this paragraph doesn't come off as being either factual or competantly written 'Big Ben was originally created so that people in England wouldn't need pocket watches'? What on earth is that? I'll do a rough revision but it'll need a more professional edit soon. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingpin1055_d40b.html" title="User:Kingpin1055">Kingpin1055</a> 19:10, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So does the first strike indicate the start of the new hour, because on the Big Ben software I downloaded is programmed to start the chiming upon when my computer says the hour exactly, but then strikes 20 seconds later, apparently you have to put it forward. Does the clock itself go 20 seconds fast?</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that _anyone_ would type Big Ben into Wikipedia and not want to know about the clock (or maybe the bell). Surely the disambiguation page should be <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Ben_%28disambiguation%29_c1e5.html" title="Big Ben (disambiguation)">Big Ben (disambiguation)</a>?</p>
<p>Or have I missed the discussion on this somewhere else?</p>

<dd>Yes - its wrong.

Worse, they did a cut-n-paste page move which is just wrong, wrong, wrong. It'll take a bit of work to disentangle it and put it back to the way it should be. Wikipedia is running rather slowly for me at the moment, but I might get a chance to sort it out later. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a></dd>

<dd>I didn't move the page. I removed some of the content to make it look more like a disambiguation so that it wouldn't be confused with the real article. I agree that Big Ben should redirect to <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clock_Tower%2C_Palace_of_Westminster_deb4.html" title="Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster">Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster</a> with a link to this page at the top. <a href="../../../c/a/c/User%7ECacophony_1b6a.html" title="User:Cacophony">Cacophony</a> 18:35, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, looking into the problem more <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevouk_1568.html" title="User:Stevouk">User:Stevouk</a> removed most of the contents on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Ben&amp;oldid=72585606" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Ben&amp;oldid=72585606" rel="nofollow">August 29th</a>. To fix this issue, the current contents of the page need to be moved to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Ben_%28disambiguation%29_c1e5.html" title="Big Ben (disambiguation)">Big Ben (disambiguation)</a> (which currently redirects here). This page should redirect to Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster.</dd>

<dd>Sorry, my mistake. You are right. It looks like the edit by <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevouk_1568.html" title="User:Stevouk">User:Stevouk</a> on the 29th August was the root cause of the problem <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Ben&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72585606" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Ben&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=72585606" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. And since they removed the {cleanup} tag at the same time, I suspect they thought they were helping with tidying up the article.
