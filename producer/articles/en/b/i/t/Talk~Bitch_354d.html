<p>The word may very well be from Old Norse, but the Old Norse form should be corrected from 'bikkjuna' to 'bikkja'. 'bikkjuna' is the form in the accusative singular with the definite article -na. There is no need at all to cite such a form. And such an ending would, of course, not give OE -e.</p>

<p>Anome, I reverted your edit because the word "bitch" <i>can</i> be regarded as profanity. Dictionary.com defines profanity as "abusive, vulgar, or irreverent language." I think that there are many who would regard the word "bitch" as profanity. --<a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowellian_970e.html" title="User:Lowellian">Lowellian</a> 00:59, Apr 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is there any particular evidence of women "reclaiming" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word "bitch" any more than it reclaims the word "sinner."</p>
<p>Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph -- I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly?</p>

<dd>We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, "She's a Bitch". <a href="../../../h/y/a/User%7EHyacinth_44fa.html" title="User:Hyacinth">Hyacinth</a> 03:12, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>References are fine -- just the name "Missy Elliot" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned "reclaiming" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women/slurs more generally within hip-hop. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Mills_Hinkle_81e0.html" title="User:Thomas Mills Hinkle">Thomas Mills Hinkle</a> 11:35, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting "querolous", "spiteful", and "malicious" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERintrah_b987.html" title="User:Rintrah">Rintrah</a> 19:02, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_cbd0.html" title="The Handmaid's Tale">The Handmaid's Tale</a> the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. - <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a> 21:19, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like "bitch" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of "bitch" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it.</dd>

<dd>This is not a debate about whether or not it's possible to "reclaim" a pejorative in the traditional sense, of rendering it benign and even positive. Some might argue that the efforts of certain subcultures in the African American community to reclaim the word "nigger" are equally futile. The question is, whether an attempt to reclaim the word "bitch" exists, and if so, what the cultural connotations of it are.</dd>

<dd>The word "bitch" certainly has diffuse interpretations, which might be crudely divided into two groups, their meanings roughly inverse. One, "bitch" as an epithet for a dominant, aggressive woman, especially if that aggression is carried out against men; this is the meaning that the excerpt in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_cbd0.html" title="The Handmaid's Tale">The Handmaid's Tale</a> refers to, and the meaning usually associated with the verse from the song by <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meredith_Brooks_942b.html" title="Meredith Brooks">Meredith Brooks</a>. Two, "bitch" as a descriptor of weakness, as "my bitch" or "prison bitch" etc. and an epithet applied commonly to both men and women (possibly more commonly to men, where it might be argued the subtext is that even a strong, "bitchy" woman is a standard of weakness for men; but I digress).</dd>

<dd>I don't know which meaning surfaced earlier, or whether one of them is a reaction/adaptation of the other. However, the reclamation of the word "bitch" by feminists is usually attributed to the first meaning. It is an aspect of a greater argument about working women, women in positions of power and the general power dynamic of gender hierarchy. - <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a> 11:06, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, your apprehension of "bitch" is more exhaustive than mine; but, as to these two groups, they do not appear to be inverse, but contradictory. The import of bitch is weaker than values instilled in schools, and business policy as to rectruitment of women. Judgements upon the 'weakness' or 'usurpation' of women are usually based on reflection on women's position in society, i.e., how people regard women in their alloted roles; I believe people are less influenced by words in our language than this reflection. 'Bitch', in this context, is a symptom of the traditional stigma against women, but it has also become trivial due to its comically nebulous connotations. However, your comments on the meaning and importance of bitch are interesting — I am pleased I unwittingly started this "debate".</dd>

<dd>"Nigger", in my opinion, has been "reclaimed' within many black communities. Its inflammatory connotations stemmed from slave-traders' contempt; the word initially being a neutral designation. Ironically, it has now assumed the thuggish connotations proudly brandished by 'gangsta' rap.

<dd>The word "bitch" means different things to men and women, and that's probably the root of the misunderstanding. The subservience implied in calling a man a bitch has never been matched by a complementary merit, whereas for a woman, being a bitch implies an uncompromising strength that is increasingly understood as being a double-edged sword. Call it fourth-wave feminism, if you will. - <a href="../../../l/e/a/User%7ELeaHazel_4a1c.html" title="User:LeaHazel">LeaHazel</a> 15:45, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your propositions on "bitch" make sense; I see no reason to dispute them. As to fourth-wave feminism, I am unfamiliar with that too.

<dd>Sorry, the fourth-wave feminism was a backwards joke. Feminism is generally divided into three waves, so fourth-wave would be post-90s, post-<a href="../../../g/i/r/Girl_Power_1b32.html" title="Girl Power">Girl Power</a> feminism.

<dd>Ok. I don't think I could convince any feminist to embrace the Spice girls ethos, so I can see why the fourth movement would necessarily be post-Girl Power. And I think by journalists, you mean serious journalists, as there are journalists that write all kinds of refuse but without any effect on serious discourse. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERintrah_b987.html" title="User:Rintrah">Rintrah</a> 08:20, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not only about reclaiming the word. It's also about reviving the usage of the word "bitch" before Christianity took over Europe and reinventing the word "bitch" for modernity. "Bitch" gained a negative connotation as part of the Christian campaign to to marginalize those who hung on to goddess worship in the same way how words like "pagan", "witch", etc. gain a negative connotation. The reinvention is about non-conforming to historic stereotype of women and to promote individualism while protesting cultural norms. It's possible that the "sinner" reference is a word play on religious reference given how author consider the Christian concept of women as limiting. The way that how information is edited on this page constantly reminds people of Orwellian society. 3Laws 03:50, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I still haven't seen any clarification on the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some second wave feminists hold that bitch is a strong word because, in a patriarchy, women are supposed to be available for men's constant use. Becoming pregnant against a man's will would be an offense against this order.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I find this incomprehensible. Is the idea that bitches(namespace=dogs) are always sexually available? (this of course is untrue -- see <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estrus.html" title="Estrus">estrus</a>). It seems more likely to me that "bitch" is a strong word because it treats women as animals.</p>
<p>That said, perhaps there there <i>are</i> two lines of usage in bitch:</p>
<ol>
<li>A demeaning way to label a strident/complaining/upset woman that suggests her concerns are not worthwhile/serious</li>
<li>A way to label someone as sexually available/subservient (here I can only think of phrases like "be my bitch" or "prison bitch"</li>
</ol>
<p>Does this make sense? In that case, I could remove the confusing line about second wave feminists and add another section about usage of bitch to connote sexual availability/subservience (which combines with the "prison bitch" meaning). <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Mills_Hinkle_81e0.html" title="User:Thomas Mills Hinkle">Tom</a> 15:25, 15 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now, perhaps I'm a complete idiot, but I tend to think that people who're mean, insensitive, hard to get along with, or otherwise ill-behaved should not be feeling partiularly good about themselves, much less should they actually be proud of their glaring personality faults. Yes, I'm even talking about women here. I would think that if you're smart enough to recognize your own social ineptitudes the next logical thing would be to rectify them, not embrace them.</p>

<p>How about a reference to one of its other meanings; bitch is another name for a shotgun, as portrayed in the movie "Training Day." Denzel's character says, "Hand me the bitch."</p>
<p>If we go through all uses of the word bitch and simply replace it with the phrase "angry woman," all it's meanings will be obvious. (for when it doesn't make sense just shorten it to woman, this would use it as a subtitute for a substitute.) When Denzel's character says "Hand me the bitch" he's saying this for two reasons. 1. An angry woman will do more damage (than a not so angry woman) 2. Anyone who has ever shot a shotgun knows that it kicks like a bitch. 71.37.187.64 17:16, 24 September 2006 (UTC)Sheba</p>

<p>I have removed the bolded section and moved it all here. I assume this line means something like "Dahl used this term literally only in reference to animals, but some critics believe he was making a statement about women." I have, however, not read the story, and don't know if this is true or not. But even if it is true, is this even needed in the article? I don't think that it is.</p>

<p>The use of "bitchin'" as "cool" surely pre-dates the 1980's.

<dd>Also, "Riding bitch" is when two persons are riding on a 'motorcycle' the person in the back (that usually uses the removable seat back) is riding bitch. I think this derives from couples that ride together it is most common for the male to drive, and the female to ride behind him.

<p>The usage of "to bitch" as "to complain" needs to be spelled out- preferably in the first paragraph along with the (in my opinion, far less common) usage of the term as to subjugate or humiliate.

<p>I removed the reference to biatch being an example of African American Vernacular English as its link to rap music and black comedians suffice. AAVE is often mistakenly used as a blanket term to describe new words and phrases that are more correctly attributed to youth-oriented hip-hop culture. The fact that the overwhelming majority of the individuals who coin and popularize these new terms speak AAVE is incidental--if the word does not gain any traction amongst AAVE speakers who are not involved with the youth-oriented culture related to AAVE, it isn't descendent from it.</p>
<p>One could make a much better case for 'ho' being an AAVE word than for 'biatch', but I removed that reference as well as the comparison is fairly shallow. While ho is the (probable) AAVE equivalent of whore in SAE (Standard American English), biatch is simply a variation of bitch. In my experience people who use the word 'ho' often completely omit 'whore' from their vernacular while people who use the term 'biatch' often use the term 'bitch' to varying degree, sometimes even more frequently than 'biatch'.

<p>Agreed, the first paragraph about second-wave feminists reclaiming the word is valid, but the three paragraphs following it seem highly illogical to include in the article. I feel that a link or reference to a more relevant document would be better than explaining all the activities that women are doing to reclaim the word in an article that describes the general usage. Heck, there's even less explanation of its traditional use. 130.113.94.27 01:57, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"In colloquial use, the word bitch is often employed insultingly to describe a woman as malicious, spiteful, domineering, intrusive, unpleasant or sexually promiscuous (although the final connotation is mostly used in Continental European circles)"</p>
<p>Does anyone know what this means? Given that people in Continental Europe usually don't have English as their first language, does it refer to (a) a usage of the word "bitch" by people who learned English as a second language, (b) a usage of the word "bitch" in languages other than English, or (c) a usage of the word "bitch" by British people who are living abroad (in Spain etc)? -86.144.137.236 23:08, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I came to my attention that the term bitch was at one time used to describe the high preistess of Diana, the huntress. Obviously it is still a common breeding term and I personaly would prefer to be called a bitch than a dawg, as im female.

<p>"Bizzotch" gets mention, but what about "biatch" (or "biotch")? I'm not sure exactly who/when/where that was popularized, but it's very common now and should be mentioned.</p>
<p>On a different note, would it be appropriate to point out the irony in derisively comparing a woman to a dog when a dog is supposed to be <i>man's best friend?</i> -- <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunnyhat_e35c.html" title="User:Funnyhat">Funnyhat</a> 08:18, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: no, becuase this would enter into a moral discussion of the word, which is unnaturally digressive for an encyclopedia. It is not ironic: a bitch, even by its denotation, is a pet to man, so comparing a woman to a female pet is not ironic, it is offensive. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERintrah_b987.html" title="User:Rintrah">Rintrah</a> 11:18, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Shouldn't biatch get it's own entry, for the cultural impact? 65.34.171.108</p>

<dd>Not really. "Biatch" is indistinct from "bitch" except for its pronunciation. As for "cultural impact", there is none, other than white teenagers and rappers using it as "cool" vernacular, which is a hardly a notable encyclopedic topic. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERintrah_b987.html" title="User:Rintrah">Rintrah</a> 11:18, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
