<p>The <b>mouthpiece</b> is the part of a horse's <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_%28horse%29.html" title="Bit (horse)">bit</a> that goes into the mouth of a <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horse</a>, resting on the bars of the mouth in the sensitive interdental space where there are no <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_teeth.html" title="Horse teeth">teeth</a>. The mouthpiece is possibly the most important determinant in the severity and action of the bit. Therefore, it should be carefully considered when choosing a bit for a horse. Some mouthpieces are not allowed in <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dressage.html" title="Dressage">dressage</a> competition.</p>
<p>The other parts of the bit are the <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_ring.html" title="Bit ring">bit rings</a> on a <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snaffle.html" title="Snaffle">snaffle</a> bit, and the shanks on a <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curb_bit.html" title="Curb bit">curb bit</a>. These pieces do not go inside the mouth, but rather are the parts of a bit that are outside the mouth, where the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridle.html" title="Bridle">bridle</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/i/Rein.html" title="Rein">reins</a> attach.</p>
<p>Particular mouthpieces do not make a bit a <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snaffle.html" title="Snaffle">snaffle</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelham_bit.html" title="Pelham bit">pelham</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimberwicke.html" title="Kimberwicke">kimberwicke</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curb_bit.html" title="Curb bit">curb</a>, or <a href="../../../g/a/g/Gag_bit.html" title="Gag bit">gag bit</a>. Often, bits with "soft" mouthpieces, such as the single- or double-jointed, are incorrectly referred to as snaffles. Although some mouthpieces are marked as "severe" and others as "mild," this is all relative. A hard-handed rider can make even the mildest bit uncomfortable, and a skilled, light rider can ride in a much harsher mouthpiece without damaging the mouth or causing any distress in the horse. Additionally, the type of bit has a great impact on the action of the mouthpiece. Snaffles are generally considered the mildest, curbs and gags the harshest. It is difficult, therefore, to compare a harsher-type bit with a mild mouthpiece (such as a pelham with a rubber mullen mouth), and a milder-type bit with a harsher mouthpiece (like a snaffle with a slow twist). In general, however, the mouthpiece can have a marked difference on the severity. Snaffles with twisted wires are never considered mild, while a pelham with a low port may. In short, there are many factors in the bitting equation which must be considered to get a true estimate of the action and severity of a bit.</p>

Straight bar mouthpiece</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Types of Bits</b>: All types.</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: The mouthpiece is a straight bar of material, without any joints. In the mullen mouth, the bar has a slight bow to it, curving gently outwards towards the bottom of the horse's mouth.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: The mullen mouth and straight bar are very similar in action, placing pressure on the tongue, lips, and bars. The mullen provides extra space for the tongue, instead of constantly pushing into it, resulting in more tongue relief and making it more comfortable. This bit is generally considered a very mild mouthpiece, although this varies according to the type of bit (snaffle, pelham, etc.), and improper use may make it harsh, since the majority of the bit pressure will be applied on the sensitive tongue. However, it should be noted that this bit cannot be used one-sided, because if pressure is applied to one rein, it will cause some lightening on the other side of the bit.</p>
<p><b>Materials</b>: Rubber is very common, as is happy mouth material. Stainless steel is also a favorite, but copper and sweet iron are not as popular.</p>
<p><b>Uses</b>: Seen in all equestrian activities, although less commonly in <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dressage.html" title="Dressage">dressage</a>. Usually not as popular for snaffles or gags as for bits that use leverage (pelham, kimberwick, and curb). The straight bar is common in stallion showing and in-hand bits.</p>

A medium-height port on a <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curb_bit.html" title="Curb bit">curb bit</a>, offering room for the tongue without acting on the hard palate.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Types of Bits</b>: All types, including driving bits.</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: The middle of the mouthpiece has a "port," or curve, which may vary in size from "low" to "high." The port is different from the mullen mouth in that the curved portion does not extend the width of the mouthpiece, but is only an inch or two in the center of the bar.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Ported bits act on the lips, tongue, and roof of the mouth, and may apply extra pressure to the bars. The action of the port is directly related to its size. Low ports provide some tongue relief, similar to the mullen mouth, as they provide more space. Larger ports will press on the hard palate (roof of the mouth) when the reins are pulled, act as a fulcrum, and transfer that pressure onto the bars. Recent research has shown that the port must be 2-2.5" (5–6 cm) or more in height before it will touch the hard palate. Thus the mildest port height is not necessarily the lowest ported bit, as commonly believed; it can also be the highest port possible that will not come in contact with the hard palate.</p>
<p><b>Materials</b>: Always metal, often stainless steel but also may be sweet iron or copper.</p>
<p><b>Uses</b>: Very uncommon in snaffles and gags (although it can be found). One of the most common mouthpieces in pelhams, kimberwickes, and curbs. Very popular in the Western disciplines.</p>

Single-jointed snaffle, mouthpiece wrapped in rubber to make it milder</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Type of Bits</b>: Very common on <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snaffle.html" title="Snaffle">snaffles</a>, but seen on all bit families including <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimberwicke.html" title="Kimberwicke">kimberwickes</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelham_bit.html" title="Pelham bit">pelhams</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/g/Gag_bit.html" title="Gag bit">gags</a>, and <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curb_bit.html" title="Curb bit">curbs</a>.</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: The mouthpiece has one joint in its center. It "breaks" upward toward the top of the mouth with direct pressure, and outward toward the front of the mouth when used with leverage pressure from a <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_shank.html" title="Bit shank">bit shank</a>.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: The single-jointed mouthpiece applies pressure to the tongue, lips, and bars. Due to the V-shape of the bit when the mouthpiece is contracted, it causes a "nutcracker" action, which has a pinching effect on the bars. It also causes the joint of the bit to push into the sensitive roof of the mouth if used harshly. A single-jointed bit with a curved mouthpiece has a more "U" shape tends to decrease the pressure on the roof of the mouth.</p>
<p><b>Materials</b>: often stainless steel, but may be made of any bit metal (copper and sweet iron are both popular), happy mouth material, or have a rubber covering on each joint.</p>
<p><b>Uses</b>: This is one of the most common mouthpieces found on a snaffle, and is popular for all equestrian sports.</p>
<p><b>Cautions</b>: Curb bits with a single joint are often called <i>cowboy snaffle</i>, <i>Argentine snaffle</i>, or <i>Tom Thumb snaffle.</i> However, these bits all are actually <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curb_bit.html" title="Curb bit">curb bits</a> because they have <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_shank.html" title="Bit shank">shanks</a> and operate with leverage. Therefore, they can be harsh in the hands of an inexperienced rider.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_mouthpiece.html" title="Edit section: Double Jointed Bits">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Double Jointed Bits</span></h2>
<p>Double-jointed bits reduce the nutcracker effect because they conform better to the horse's "U" shaped mouth, instead of the "V" created by a single joint. In this respect they are milder, and many horses prefer a double-joint over a single joint.</p>
<p>Many of the double-jointed bits (especially the French link and Dr. Bristol) are occasionally "added to" by twisting the cannons of the mouthpiece. This greatly increases the severity of the bit, as these cannons act directly on the tongue and bars in addition to the regular action of the bit. A relatively "kind" French mouth can therefore be turned into a severe bit when the cannons are twisted and the mouthpiece is put onto a gag type bit. All references below are based on the cannons being smooth, not twisted.</p>

A French Link mouthpiece</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>Types of Bits</b>: snaffle, gag, pelham, curb (including driving bits)</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: The mouthpiece has two joints due to a central link. This link is flat and bone-shaped. It should not be rectangular.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: One of the mildest mouthpieces, the two joints reduces the nutcracker effect which is found in single-jointed bits, and encourage relaxation. Applies pressure to the lips, tongue, and bars of the mouth.</p>
<p><b>Materials</b>: Usually stainless steel, also copper (either just the link or the whole bit).</p>
<p><b>Use</b>: Commonly seen on snaffles, rather rare in gags, pelhams, or curbs. This is one of the most popular mouthpieces for dressage work. However, it is used in many English-styled disciplines. It is rarely used in the Western-styled disciplines.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_mouthpiece.html" title="Edit section: The Dr. Bristol">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Dr. Bristol</span></h3>
<p><b>Types of Bits</b>: snaffle, gag</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: The mouthpiece has two joints due to a central link. This link is flat and rectangular in shape, and does not have rounded edges like the French link.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: The double joint reduces the nutcracker effect found in single-jointed snaffles. However, the link is angled so that the thin edge of the rectangle presses into the tongue, creating a very small bearing surface. This makes it concentrate pressure on the tongue, although it also adds pressure to the bars and lips of the mouth.</p>
<p><b>Materials</b>: Usually stainless steel, also copper.</p>
<p><b>Use</b>: Commonly seen on snaffles, very rare in gags. This bit is seen in many of the English disciplines, but is very uncommon in Western disciplines. Not as common in <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dressage.html" title="Dressage">dressage</a> due to its severity, although it <i>is</i> permitted. Seen in many jumping disciplines.</p>

<p><b>What it is</b>: Similar to the French-link, except there is a round "ball" on the middle link.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: double joint reduces the nutcracker effect. The ball tends to concentrate pressure on the tongue. More severe than the French link, less than the Dr. Bristol. Also applies pressure to the lips and bars of the mouth.</p>

<p><b>Types of bits</b>: snaffles</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: Double jointed bit similar to a French link, except the middle link has a slight upward (toward the roof of the mouth) curve, like a port.</p>

<p><b>Types of Bits</b>: snaffles, usually with a Dee-ring</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: Similar to the ported link, except the middle link is much higher and makes a clear upside-down "U".</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Supposed to encourage the horse to soften and stay light in the bridle. The bottom of the "U" can be quite sharp, however, and can dig into the tongue to the point of cutting it. Therefore, they are best left to skilled riders with a very light contact.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_mouthpiece.html" title="Edit section: Waterford">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Waterford</span></h3>
<p><b>Type of Bits</b>: snaffle, pelham, gag, curb</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: The mouthpiece is made of 5-9 joints and is very flexible.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: Due to the many joints, the waterford has many bumps, which can act as pressure points. The idea is that the great flexibility will discourage the horse from leaning on it.</p>
<p><b>Materials</b>: Stainless steel.</p>
<p><b>Uses</b>: Most common in the English disciplines, especially <a href="../../../s/h/o/Show_jumping.html" title="Show jumping">show jumping</a> and <a href="../../../e/v/e/Eventing.html" title="Eventing">eventing</a>. Used mainly on strong horses. Not permitted in dressage, not commonly used in hunt seat riding. Rather rare in a pelham, very rare in a curb bit.</p>

<p><b>Types of bits</b>: gag, curb</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: As its name suggests, this mouthpiece is several links of chain.</p>
<p><b>Uses</b>: Seen in the Western disciplines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: There are some chain bits made of bicycle chain rather than link chain. These bits are considered by most horsemen to be too severe for use and many categorize them as cruel. These bits are not allowed in competition.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_mouthpiece.html" title="Edit section: Twisted/Serrated Bits">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Twisted/Serrated Bits</span></h2>
<p>All twisted mouthpieces are considered more severe than smooth mouthpieces. In general, they are not appropriate for novice riders or those with harsh or unskilled hands. Neither these nor any bits should be used to the point where they cause bleeding of the horse's mouth.</p>
<p>If a rider believes such a bit would benefit his horse, he should first look at the animal's training and his own skills. Many problems can be resolved through proper training, rather than harsher bitting. Usually, it is the less-skilled riders who find the need to use harsher bits, because they can't control their horses in anything else.</p>
<p>That being said, there are cases in which skilled riders can use such bits to their advantage, and improve the horse's training. These bits are NOT permitted in dressage competition, and are generally not used for schooling dressage horses.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_mouthpiece.html" title="Edit section: Slow Twist">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Slow Twist</span></h3>
<p><b>Types of Bits</b>: Snaffle, pelham, gag</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: A mouthpiece (usually single-jointed) with a slight twist in the cannons. Thicker and with fewer twists than a wire bit, has fewer edges than a corkscrew.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: The twist causes edges that result as pressure points in the horse's mouth. Increases pressure on the tongue and bars, also acts on the lips. Generally considered strong and fairly severe.</p>
<p><b>Materials</b>: Usually stainless steel</p>
<p><b>Uses</b>: Most commonly found on snaffles, quite rare on pelhams and gags. Usually seen in English disciplines. <i>Not</i> permitted in dressage competition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: The slow twist is often incorrectly used to refer to the corkscrew or a wire bit. These bits are <i>not</i> the same.</li>

<p><b>Types of Bits</b>: Snaffle, driving bits (curbs)</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: The mouthpiece (usually single-jointed) has many rounded edges. However, it is not actually "corkscrew" in shape, but more has a more "screw-like" mouthpiece with blunt edges. Thicker than a wire bit, thinner than a slow twist.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: The edges amplify pressure on the mouth, especially the bars and tongue. Considered severe.</p>
<p><b>Uses</b>: Mostly seen in English-type disciplines, and in driving. <i>Not</i> permitted in dressage.</p>

<p><b>Types of Bits</b>: snaffle, gag, curb</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: Mouthpiece is a single-jointed bit made of a thin twisted piece of wire for each joint.</p>
<p><b>Action</b>: The wire bit is extremely severe. It is not only very thin, but it has twists in it that cause pressure point.</p>
<p><b>Materials</b>: Stainless steel preferred for English disciplines, sweet iron and copper seen in Western disciplines.</p>
<p><b>Uses</b>: The twisted wire is <i>extremely</i> severe. It is <i>not</i> permitted for dressage. It is more commonly seen in the Western disciplines than the English, although the jumping disciplines occasionally feature wire bits. These bits are for strong horses that pull or take off. This bit is <i>very</i> severe, and should only be used by skilled riders with soft hands. Some people do not use these bits because they believe them to be cruel.</p>

<p><b>Types of bits</b>: snaffle, curb, gag, pelham</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>: A cricket is a single roller placed within the port of a <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curb_bit.html" title="Curb bit">curb bit</a>. The cherry roller bit has multiple rollers along its mouthpiece. The mouthpiece may be jointed or straight/mullen.

<p><b>Action</b>: Rollers are supposed to help a horse relax his jaw and accept the bit. They may also calm nervous horses or provide an outlet for nervous tongue movements. Rollers do not affect the severity of the bit.</p>
<p><b>Uses</b>: Crickets are very commonly seen on <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_riding.html" title="Western riding">western</a> curb bridles and are legal for <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_pleasure.html" title="Western pleasure">western pleasure</a> competition.

<p><b>Types of bits</b>: usually snaffle, sometimes pelham</p>
<p><b>What it is</b>:A flat piece of rubber that slides on a mullen mouth, or a metal bit that already has a flat piece in the center of the mouthpiece. The flat piece is wide and goes backwards in the mouth.</p>
<p><b>Uses</b>: the purpose of this bit is to prevent a horse from getting his tongue over it. It can be useful in retraining, and for horse's for whom this is a habit. This therefore gives the rider more control. Not permitted in dressage.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_mouthpiece.html" title="Edit section: Mouthpiece Thickness">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mouthpiece Thickness</span></h2>
<p>A standard mouthpiece is 3/8 inch in diameter, measured one inch out from the bit rings (the area that usually come in contact with the bars). The common belief is that a thinner mouthpiece increases the severity of the bit, because it decreases the bearing surface and makes the bit "sharper." However, many horses actually prefer a thinner mouthpiece to a thicker one because there is less metal in their mouth and therefore more room for their tongue. This is mostly true if the rider has soft hands.</p>
<p>On the other hand, very thin bits (such as the twisted wire bits) have a marked severity over thicker bits. Some wire bits may come in a thickness as low as 1/16 inch, making them <i>extremely</i> severe to the point where it is easy for any rider to cut and ruin the horse's mouth, especially the lips. Many horsemen, even the most skilled riders, will not put such a harsh bit in their horse's mouths. Many equestrian organizations do not allow a bit to be 1/4 inch or thinner in diameter.</p>
<p>If the rider gives crude aids, it is generally best to pick a bit mouthpiece that is thicker. This may also be true with some horses with relatively thin bars, such as some <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoroughbred.html" title="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbreds</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Stainless steel</b>: The most popular material for bits. It is strong, easy to clean, and doesn't rust. It is considered to be a "cold" metal that does not encourage or discourage salivation.</li>
<li><b>Copper</b>: Warms up quickly, but does not last as long as stainless steel. It is supposed to encourage the horse to salivate and accept the bit. There are some people who refuse to use copper bits because they believe them to be distasteful, and that to be the reason why some horses chew them so readily. Because these bits wear out fairly quickly, they should be checked regularly to make sure they are maintaining their integrity.</li>
<li><b>Copper alloy</b>: by combining copper with a harder metal, the bit lasts longer.</li>
<li><b>Sweet iron</b>: easily rusts, which supposedly encourages salivation from the horse and acceptance of the bit. This metal is used in many <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_riding.html" title="Western riding">Western riding</a> disciplines, and is not as popular in the English.</li>
<li><b>Brass alloy</b>: combination of brass, silicon, and aluminum. Is said to have some of the same qualities as copper, but is cheaper.</li>
<li><b>Rubber</b>: softens the action of the bit. All rubber bits are very gentle, but are easily chewed and destroyed. Bits that add rubber to an underlying metal mouthpiece last longer, but the rubber must be periodically replaced. A waterproof bandage product called Sealtex is often used to add rubber to a metal bit.</li>
<li><b>Aluminum</b>: Considered a very bad choice for a mothpiece as it tends to dry out the mouth and may be toxic. Occasionally seen in very cheap western-style bits. To be avoided.</li>
<li><b>Synthetics</b>: Any number of tough plastics are used for bit designs, combining the softness of rubber with more durability. The best are not easily destroyed by chewing.</li>
