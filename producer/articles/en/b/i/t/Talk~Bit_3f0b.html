	    <p>It is stated that decimal forms of the SI factors (10^2, 10^4..) are used when related to telecommunications. Thus we can agree that <b>56 kilobits per second</b> essentially means <b>56 000 bits per second</b>. That thus gives us <b>7 000 bytes per second</b>. However, when we carry on to convert to <i>kilobytes per second</i>, should we not use the binary form of the prefix, i.e. <b>7 000 bps = 7 000 / 1024 = 6.836 kilobytes per second</b>?</p>
<p><s>We should not. When talking about telecommunications, use powers of ten always.</s> -(struck by)<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 19:49, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regrettably, the orginal commentor was right. Both the binary forms of the SI factors and the standard ones are used. Bits are always measured in standard SI units, e.g. "10<sup>3</sup> = kilo", and bytes always on the "2<sup>10</sup> = kilo" etc scale. So 56kbits is 56000 bits, 7000 bytes and 6.84kbytes. See the <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_prefix.html" title="Binary prefix">binary prefix</a> page. Incidentally, this is the source of much confusion (in the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>) at least, about why people's 1Mbit connection only yields 125kB/sec - the B used by a <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Explorer_6bc1.html" title="Internet Explorer">certain browser</a> is in bytes, not bits. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 19:49, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Absolutely. I agree that the article should make some observation that it makes sense linguistically to shorten Binary Digit to bit because of the history in English of a bit representing one eighth of a whole, as Binary Digits represent one eighth of a byte.

<p>Though I've supported pop culture references in articles before, an arbitrary mention of the number of bits employed by the android from STTNG is far too much of a stretch here; any computer will have storage capacity measured in bits, and including one's particular favourite example just doesn't go. An article on "the bit" is extremely high-level by nature, because it's a fundamental concept of computation (and arguably, the universe). There's no natural place to include the Data mention (a "Trivia" heading doesn't count as natural), and that should have been a clue as to whether it was warranted in the first place. I'm afraid I'm going to have to revert the revert; please consider carefully before replacing the section. - <a href="../../../t/o/h/User%7EToh_d97d.html" title="User:Toh">toh</a> 02:03, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello! Define "natural" and arbitrary? Everything discussed therein is <i><a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial.html" title="Artificial">artificial</a></i>, fictional or not. I included mention of Data's storage capacity since it was directly cited in the episode "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Measure_of_a_Man_%28TNG_episode%29_0c81.html" title="The Measure of a Man (TNG episode)">The Measure of a Man</a>" ("800 quadrillion bits") – when his status as a being vis-à-vis mere repository of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a> was challenged – and may be interesting, even trivial, for those who 'compare' fundamental concepts of <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technology</a> with (fictional) "<a href="../../../t/r/e/Treknobabble.html" title="Treknobabble">technology</a>". Moreover, head on over to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, et al. for a description of concepts relating to said issues, and you'll see that its inclusion is completely relevant. This 'tid-bit' has also been classified as "trivia", so I do not see a reason to remove it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, Data's height nor his mass are stated (to my knowledge) and are not issues of point, so these points can't be noted in those articles which are – at least – <i>bona fide</i> basic <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> units. Perhaps superlatives for contemporary <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computers</a>, and not favourites, should also be included here?</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Many articles have other sections; if anything, as the topic of this article is such a "high-level" concept, this points to the deficiency of the current article and its need for expansion. Actually, perhaps such removals should be considered carefully (e.g., posing a request for comment here as was done after the fact) <i>before</i> doing so in the first place? Given the fact that this bit of info was around for quite some time before its removal, and my reasons above, I will be restoring this until compelling reasons are provided to remove it.

<dd>I also agree that the information is of such overwhelming triviality to this article that it needn't belong.

And what Wp policy excludes trivia from articles? To my knowledge: none. Actually, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is the one I cite. Perhaps if various users would spend more time and effort on making substantive contributions and beefing up the present article instead of debating trivia and wikilinks that add value to it, it is (on the contrary) this debate which is elevating the topic beyond trivial.

<dd>As others have already said, it is irrelevant to an article dealing with the abstract concept of a bit. The fictional storage capacity of one fictional computer is...well...of zero importance. Which, per the guidance in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html#Trivia_policy" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">Wikipedia:Trivia#Trivia policy</a> means it should get zero space in this article.

<dd>Thanks for the policy; not only is it helpful, but it proves my point. It is a matter, then, of what is "interesting" <i>and</i> of mild "importance", for reasons cited above (e.g., <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computers</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial.html" title="Artificial">artificial</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence.html" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a>): what's good for the goose isn't necessarily good for the gander. Your determination of <a href="../../../o/b/l/Oblivion.html" title="Oblivion">nothingness</a>, particularly regarding an abstract concept, is not mine; mine is at least <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, nor is its inclusion imbalanced which, if it were, would require edition or removal. In this respect, and in this article, this bit of information will remain until a <i>compelling</i> reason exists to remove it. Good day. E Pluribus Anthony 14:45, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm inclined to agree with Omegatron, Splash, and Toh. In general I don't think 'trivia' sections really belong in encyclopedia articles, and it's too much of a stretch to include the examples that E Pluribus Anthony has presented. By all means, discuss the information capacity of the human brain in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a>, and discussion Data's storage in <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_%28Star_Trek%29_6d8e.html" title="Data (Star Trek)">Data</a>.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Argh! This would not be so much of a grundging issue if it was addressed two months ago by various users, when the Data factoid was originally added. These bits of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a>, in this appropriate context, go to the very heart of what information is and how much of it readily apparent examples - us, and a popular sci-fi reference - exhibit. To do so now smacks of a 'fairweather', and slightly POV, attitude to this topic and the information presented thereof; in fact, the debate itself seems rather trivial and hypocritical, not the information in and of itself.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, if users spent more time and effort enhancing articles, they likely wouldn't be confronted with the presentation of what are characterised as 'trivial' elements to spartan "top-level" articles to begin with, as even a prior user tried to 'spice' this one up a bit.

<dd>I'm not exactly sure what you're arguing here. Removal of the trivia section can certainly be seen as 'enhancing' this article—the section has been criticized as unprofessional and disconnected. Writing isn't just about adding stuff; it's also about editing.</dd>
<dd>That the section remained in the article for an extended period of time doesn't grant it some sort of special dispensation or tenure. Looking at the article history, between the time the 'Data' passage was added and when it was removed the article received next to no attention beyond the addition of interlanguage links and reversion of simple vandalism. The fact that new editors can take time to stumble across an article means that low-profile, uncontroversial articles will evolve very slowly.</dd>
<dd>That <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_%28Star_Trek%29_6d8e.html" title="Data (Star Trek)">Data (Star Trek)</a> is a fond and familiar character for Wikipedians of a certain generation and scifi bent does not make him an exceedingly important fellow for a general-purpose encyclopedia article. The information is in Data's article where it belongs. A throwaway line created by some scriptwriter of a scifi TV series a decade or two ago doesn't really convey something useful about the concept of a 'bit'; it was just used as another chunk of technobabble filler. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 21:31, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm arguing that just because something is trivial (and this in accordance with cited policy, as being interesting <i>and</i> informative), does not obviate its inclusion here. I cite it as being potentially important to novice users who may not know a bit from a bite, or even a byte, and the examples put the definitions into context. I realise that its lengthy gestation on the page does not afford it special consideration but I think a true editor, given this forum, would find some way to incorporate it, morph it, or have it evolve within the article (as I also tried to do with an even more valid reference with the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a>), not to remove both outright; that seems questionable.</dd>

<dd>While a beloved character, Data is unimportant <i>per se</i>; what is important, though, are the implications that this information regarding capacity has on one's understanding of <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit.html" title="Bit">bit</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information.html" title="Information">information</a>, and <a href="../../../a/i/_/AI_0a40.html" title="AI">AI</a> to John Q.

<li>The information storage capacity of the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a> is somewhat subjective.

<li>Generally I think trivia should be excluded from scientific and technology articles, unless it can add some useful knowledge. Then I suppose it ceases to be trivia. My opinion is that the stuff about the human brain could be included, but that about a ficticious <a href="../../../a/n/d/Android.html" title="Android">android</a> should be excluded. --<a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a> 13:42, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I generally concur for reasons indicated by <a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELight_current_29d4.html" title="User:Light current">Light current</a>. Further to this, it may be prudent to include a superlative for contemporary <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computers</a> and, if possible, the number of bits in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">universe</a>, etc. (since it may be a 'top-level' all-encompassing concept). As well, since the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional.html" title="Fictional">fictional</a> reference is (albeit based on a little known 'throwaway' phrase) regarding a unique character in a popular <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_271d.html" title="TV">TV</a> series, it is nonetheless <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and provides a useful perspective about information pertaining to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial.html" title="Artificial">artificial</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence.html" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a> (<a href="../../../a/i/_/AI_0a40.html" title="AI">AI</a>); thus, I believe it too should be included for comparison.

<li>As noted, I don't think the Data mention has a place here. The ostensible storage capacity of the human brain doesn't either, in part because the article isn't about storage capacity (as noted) and in part because any figure you could put there would be pretty much as fictional as the ST one, as in fact is the whole notion. The brain can't be particularly usefully described that way, at least not at this point in the history of psychology, unless it's in the same way that a toaster or a rock can be (ie. by viewing the world through the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_theory.html" title="Information theory">information theory</a> lens, which is in fact something that could usefully be fleshed out a bit elsewhere in this article). I'd add that I'm dismayed that this particularly silly and obvious edit war has gone this far. Anthony, when you find this many people disagreeing with you on so many grounds (and there are several reasons the original note didn't fit the article which have nothing to do with its triviality), it's usually because you're mistaken, not because you're a lone visionary. I speak from experience.&#160;;) - <a href="../../../t/o/h/User%7EToh_d97d.html" title="User:Toh">toh</a> 08:58, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>We agree to disagree. Moreover, the last time I checked, the examples have not been reverted recently, so the edit 'war' is actually a <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detente.html" title="Detente">detente</a> pending this RfC. Lastly: while I will gladly admit potential error (as others should), viewing topics through a solitary lens can (to extend your visual metaphors) be construed as being <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myopia.html" title="Myopia">myopic</a>: another user (somewhat removed from prior discussion) has at least found value in the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain.html" title="Brain">brain</a> example, so the discussion isn't necessarily a fruitless one. I can deal with that ... and have very thick glasses to prove it.&#160;:) Take care! E Pluribus Anthony 10:16, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi all, I am just dropping in from the RfC page, so I am not sure I understand the nature of the dispute, but I do have a comment about one of the two examples suggested above. I suggest that you avoid mentioning <i>the information storage capacity of the human brain</i>, since this raises all kinds of presumably extraneous issues, such as
<ul>
<li>precisely how mammalian brains store/process information remains mysterious,</li>
<li>there are various possible definitions of <i>information</i>, and Shannon's may not always be the most appropriate one, particularly in biology. (For instance, biologists who ought to know better often refer without comment to "the information content of an E. Coli", apparently assuming this means something defined entirely in terms of the genome, without considering that the genome of an E. Coli cannot a bacteria make without some infrastructure such as cell membranes, raw materials, and the like, which suggests that something essential might be missing from any definition which only attempts to take account of the genome itself.)</li>
</ul>

<dd>You can probably find another example which makes your point without raising thorny issues like these.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 01:37, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the feedback; I think your concern is partially covered off with upfront notation/qualification of the factoid being "subjective" (perhaps the wording can be massaged). Further to that, the examples provided are ones that a general user can readily understand and can be verified; however, I'd invite, be willing, and able to incorporate other examples (popularly cited) and or discussions regarding notions that quantify information/bits <i>in toto</i> of any biological or other system (e.g., the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">universe</a>?). It is partially for these reasons that such examples are valid and should be included. Besides: what rose (and bits thereof) doesn't have thorns?&#160;:) That's my two ... bits worth.

While I believe that this should still be noted (but not necessarily expanded <i>per se</i>) in the current article, with detail in articles you cite et al., the majority (but <i>not</i> totality) of commenting users believe this information would be more appropriately placed elsewhere.

<p>A bit is a binary digit and I judge it to be essentially a mathematical concept for representing place values of a binary number - in the same way as decimal digits are a concept for representing the place values of a decimal number. So I do not think it is a storage concept, and agree with Ben's well put suggestion's on suitable articles for information about memory. Fuzzyslob 07:48, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"N-bit" in game consoles (and for that matter general-purpose computers) is often more of a marketing term than a technical one, but you're right that the article needs to talk about that popular usage, probably in a new section.

Some of it is also covered at <a href="../../../b/y/t/Byte.html" title="Byte">byte</a>, which is a value whose width has varied, but never as large as 64 bits.

<p>Isn't it more likely that the term comes from "Pieces of Eight"? Each "piece" was called a bit. A quarter was two bits.

Or is it that you think Tukey, a statistician who is credited with creating a fair number of terms, didn't make it up? Or that Tukey was just humming "Shave and a haircut, two bits" and decided to invent a short name for a binary digit and thought "I know, I'll call it a 'shave' – No, maybe 'bit' would be better"? You find hard to believe that BIT could be a contraction of BInary digiT?

<dd>It isn't a matter of not believing in the sense of thinking the guy lied. I remember an occasion on which I made a comment to a friend that was very funny and, I thought, very original. I later found that my comment was not original at all and was patterned on something I'd undoubtedly read before but had forgotten about, at lease consciously. In this case, bits are an eighth part of a Spanish coin. The coin, being gold, could be cut with a knife. You could cut it in half, you could cut the half in half and get a quarter, and you could cut the quarter in half and get what they called a bit. AIUI a bit was small enough that it could not easily be cut in half again. So, we've got something called a bit which is an eighth of a whole unit and which cannot be further subdivided. The word came into common usage as a term for an eighth of a dollar. Then, at a later date, we have a fellow who is said to have invented the word from BInary digiT and given it the meaning of an indivisible one eighth part of a whole unit. I guess I'd put the question back to you as to what's the more plausible origin of the word. I understand your argument, I just don't find that story likely. It seems clear to me that the word "bit" meaning an indivisible one eighth of something long predates Tukey and computers. Dduggan47 11:36, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem fundamentally confused about the meaning of 'bit' as it relates to the binary number system (the subject of the article). It has <i>nothing</i> to do with being "an eighth of a whole unit". One might as well claim a bit is a quarter of a whole unit or a thirteenth of a whole unit. A bit is not a fraction of any particular unit more than it is of any other unit. A bit is <i>a binary digit</i>, that is, a item of information that can take on exactly one of two values. This meaning of 'bit' is tightly coupled to the value 2, but has no standout relationship to the value 8 (certainly no more than 4, or 16, 32, 64, ...).</dd>
<dd>Also, Tukey did not give 'bit' the "meaning of an indivisible part of a whole unit". 'Bit' doesn't mean that any more than 'decimal digit' means "indivisible part of a whole unit". The meaning Tukey assigned to the existing word 'bit' was, please note, <i>"binary digit"</i>.</dd>
<dd>The word 'bit' had many meanings before it was first used to mean 'binary digit'. Yes, it was was used in the 1600's and later to mean a fraction of a [Spanish] dollar, variously an eighth, tenth, or sixteenth (<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>). But the word was used centuries before that to mean things like 'morsel' or 'small piece', and means many other things (<i>OED</i>). It's clearly a nice coincidence that the contraction 'bit' has overtones of "small thing", but that's less important than it's being a single syllable and being mnemonically related to "binary digit". -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._S._Shaw_abc4.html" title="User:R.

<dd>Thank you for your reply.</dd>
<dd>You are correct that despite the first sentence of the article, I persisted in thinking of the word in a computer sense rather than in a mathematical one. I've never encountered bit as a synonym for binary digit before. More often in my experience it's more like The Amercan Heritage Dictionary's "A fundamental unit of information having just two possible values, as either of the binary digits 0 or 1.". It's in the sense of being "a fundamental unit of information" that it's indivisible. So ... yes, as you point out, I was "fundamentally" confused about the usage here. (I don't have the Oxford Dictionary but the usage of bit as any specific fraction other than 1/8 is a new one on me too ... and I've looked. I'm not doubting you, I've just never seen it before.)</dd>
<dd>You've answered my original question and brought me most of the way to your view (which is the accepted etymology). I'll let it drop with just tone more word. I think a site called the Online Etymological Dictionary may have the best take on it (<a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bit" class="external free" title="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bit" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bit</a>). The non-mathemtatical definition ("small piece", money, etc.) is given and then definition 2 says it's a contraction of "binary digit" coined by Tukey "probably chosen for its identity with [the first definition]". In other words, Tukey did coin the term by contracting "bnary digit", but he also probably knew the history of the word he was coining. 70.20.24.129 21:46, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, etymonline's listing for "byte" is wrong, so I wouldn't trust them too far. They say "1964, Amer.Eng., see bit" but it was coined in July 1956 by Dr. Werner Buchholz. And the "pieces of eight" is purely speculation, and wrong. Bits have not always been 1/8 of a byte. The original meaning of "byte" was any small discrete unit made of a number of bits. Some systems had 6-bit bytes, for instance. Also, considering the word "bit" was coined in 1948 and "byte" was coined in 1956, byte is clearly an extension of "bit"; not the other way around. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 14:12, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bits are mentioned with reference to information theory as a measure of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_entropy.html" title="Information entropy">information entropy</a>, but are not defined for this use in the article. There is a difference between the use of "bit" in noting a 0 or 1, and the use of "bit" to measure information. If a file with 1000 0s and 1s <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lossless_compression.html" title="Lossless compression">losslessly compressed</a> to a file of 500 0s and 1s, then the original file, although having 1000 bits in the 0/1 sense, has at most 500 bits of information entropy, since information is not destroyed by lossless compression, and a file can have no more information theoretical bits than it can 0/1 bits. I'm not sure whether there needs to be a bit (information theory) article or another section here, but, as it is, the definition of bit here is incomplete. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalbaer_c1bc.html" title="User:Calbaer">Calbaer</a> 04:00, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's already been tagged as "citation needed", but as an (admittedly poor) electrical engineer, I must say that this section is misleading at best and possibly flat-out wrong. I suppose what the author was trying to get at was the difference between Emitter Coupled Logic (ECL) and CMOS or TTL, but the statement made about 0V rarely being used to represent a logical 0 is just plain false. Similarly, implying that "slightly older devices" (whatever that entirely unspecific statement means) are no longer used is incorrect as well. Devices like those in the <a href="../../../7/4/0/7400_series.html" title="7400 series">7400 series</a> are CMOS devices that definitely use a 0V-5V scheme and are certainly still widely used today. 65.96.178.66 06:15, 18 December 2006 (UTC)mmoskwa</p>
