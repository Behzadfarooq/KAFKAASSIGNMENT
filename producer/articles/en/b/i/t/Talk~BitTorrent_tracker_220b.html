	    <p>I think it needs a software to establish a tracker of bittorrent, doesn't it?</p>
<p>what are the programs??</p>
<p><br />
well... i know except trackerless connect..we need to connect to certain trackers whose site addresses are provided in the torrent file before we can start to download.</p>
<p>well... i don't know how to establish a tracker.</p>
<p>any references or tutorials?</p>
<p>i suppose we need a program to set up a tracker don't we? anybody?</p>
<p>who wrote this crap?? needs a lot of cleanup</p>
<ul>
<li>I have marked this page for cleanup, and have begun the process myself. It definitely needs some expansion. Also, while I kept the list of trackers in for now, I feel like that is not necessarily within the scope of this article. However, the article should definitely contain references to specific trackers (both historical and current) in a more encyclopedic context, i.e., discussion of legal troubles. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu">Kinu</a> 07:35, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'll start cleaning up this site now. One thing that the creators don't seem to understand is that BitTorrent trackers are totally different to BT indexes, although many sites perform both.</p>
<p>ISOhunt, for example, is NOT a tracker, although it is listed as such here. <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplintax_b5f9.html" title="User:Splintax"><b><span style="color: #666">splintax</span></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplintax_0443.html" title="User talk:Splintax"><span style="color: #888">(talk)</span></a></sup> 12:37, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Any discussion of bittorrent/filesharing/etc. has to be quite careful about using the word "illegal." This paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Trackers illegally tracking copyrighted content are often the targets of cease and desist lawsuits from copyright bodies such as the MPAA and RIAA, despite the fact that they do not actually supply any copyrighted data themselves. Usually these websites are located in countries that have lax copyright laws. The Pirate Bay (located in Sweden) is famous for publishing and making fun of legal threats.</dd>
</dl>
<p>... doesn't really make sense. it starts saying "Trackers illegally tracking copyrighted..." yet later says "these websites are located in countries that have lax laws"... thus what they are doing is not illegal (in the countries in which they operate). By opening with the word "illegal" it obscures the whole argument. It is, at present, very much debatable whether tracking copyrighted material is illegal or not. What is factual is that these websites have received cease and desist orders. The legality of what they are doing, however, is not so clear cut. I don't want to turn this into <i>yet another</i> filesharing-legality debate. However I believe the current wording is not valid.24.202.31.227 05:57, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/t/Talk%7EBitTorrent_tracker_220b.html" title="Edit section: Links to Trackers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Links to Trackers</span></h2>
<p>I restored the link to <a href="http://www.oggfrog.com/music/" class="external text" title="http://www.oggfrog.com/music/" rel="nofollow">Ogg Frog</a> just now, which had been deleted. Several others were deleted too, without comment. The only tracker link left was the Pirate Bay.</p>
<p>While Ogg Frog is not a large site, it is one of only a few offerring undoubtably legal, licensed content, which is otherwise hard to find. While I'm sure legal content can be had on some sites that also permit copyright infringement, the legality of a torrent is generally not made clear. I think that Wikipedia would do a service to the community by clarifying this distinction.</p>
<p>Again, while Ogg Frog isn't very big, it's important in that it's been MSN search's #1 hit for "music torrents" for almost two months now. This is likely due to the fact that many competing music sites get taken down when served with DMCA notices.</p>
<p>If one can make a rational argument for deleting Ogg Frog's link, I'm happy to debate it, but I think wholesale deletion of links, without comment, that favor just one prominent pirate site is Not Appropriate. MichaelCrawford 01:33, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed the links without comments but with edit summary:remove private trackers and non notable links.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BitTorrent_tracker&amp;diff=45697790&amp;oldid=45693200" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BitTorrent_tracker&amp;diff=45697790&amp;oldid=45693200" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Ogg Frog falls under non notable.

<p>I took the liberty of removing the whole External links section. It consisted only of links to individual BitTorrent indexing sites. Wikipedia External links sections are for linking to external material delving deeper into a topic than what the Wikipedia article itself does, for those readers with a special interest. It is <b>not</b> to act as a kind of mini link directory; there are other sites for that. Feel free to add any links explaining in greater detail how BitTorrent trackers work, etc. <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a> 17:53, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We should add a link to an external website with all those links to torrent trackers. It is a really good information and I use it a lot when I need to find a new tv episode, or something like that.</p>

<p>If we will be calling trackers "trackers" (as everyone else does) then we should also be calling "indexes" "indexers", reflecting purpose and not function.</p>
<p>Also, I have put in a list of Tracker scripts. This list took a while to put together, please don't delete it like the list of tracker sites got deleted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I realize now that you are adding the titles of software trackers, but at first I thought you were going to list public tracker sites. That was my misunderstanding, but it's really a better idea to initialize a section with content, not placeholder messages. At any rate, as I said in my edit comment, I was only going to revert your edit once and then step back.</p>
