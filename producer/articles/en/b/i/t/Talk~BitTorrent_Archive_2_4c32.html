<h2><span class="mw-headline">Leech section</span></h2>
<p>It currently says leeches are on <i>asynchronous</i> connections, but it seems like <i>asymmetric</i> makes more sense (i.e. download speed much faster than upload). Also another reason for accidental leeching might be firewall or port-mapping rules the user is unaware of, either in their Linksys-or-whatever router or a VoIP terminal adapter. However, I'm not clueful enough about the current state of the client software to know how well the clients deal with outgoing-initiated-only connections. <a href="../../../t/t/w/User%7ETtwaring_cfc3.html" title="User:Ttwaring">Ttwaring</a> 17:44, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Asymmetric is correct. From what I can see, you are no more likely to leech if you're unconnectable. That would just slow your upload <i>and</i> download down, since you can't connect to peers. (It's not like there are more connectable seeds than peers.. well, on average, that wouldn't be logical, though there could be some correlation between newbies not seeding and not being connectable..) <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplintax_b5f9.html" title="User:Splintax"><b><span style="color: #666">splintax</span></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplintax_0443.html" title="User talk:Splintax"><span style="color: #888">(talk)</span></a></sup> 13:03, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the definition of availability correct? From the definition, what i can understand is if there are only two peers with 50% of data each(both having same pieces) &amp; no seeds, then the availability is 1. But the actual availability is 0.500. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>

<p>First a Seeder is defined as a Peer who is sharing a complete copy, then in the Swarm section the size of the swarm is defined as the number of peers plus the number of Seeders.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Torrent links cut down too much</span></h2>
<p>The links to outside torrent sites have been consistently cut down, over and over, the past couple weeks. And it's way too short now. Some people objected to the links entirely for legality reasons, but most people seemed fine with them and said it was legal. Others objected to some of the links which explicitly mention copyright material, such as the Simpson's torrent. But in some cases, it seems like links were removed for no real reason, but I'm too lazy to go back through each page of the history to figure it out. I'm putting back up some of the links that were removed. If anyone has any idea why any of them shouldn't be put back up, say so here. 71.126.151.245 23:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Linking to sites like Demonoid is a clear violation of at least the spirit of <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">WP:C</a>, and, I contend, the fact of <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">WP:C</a>. Links should be good faith examined to determine if they infringe copyrights, with the assumption that a torrent of a copyrighted file infringes copyrights. I will once again remove those links which I know from good faith examinations to breach <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">WP:C</a>. <a href="../../../p/t/i/User%7EPti_b402.html" title="User:Pti">Pti</a> 14:57, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem, however, is that the site owners over there do not control the content. So, for instance, Wikipedia links to <a href="http://meta.anarchopedia.org/" class="external text" title="http://meta.anarchopedia.org/" rel="nofollow">Anarchopedia</a> in the "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not</a>" article. Technically, I could post copyrighted material on Anarchopedia right now, or many people could post tons of copyrighted material. The official bittorrent search engine contains copyrighted material. And heck, since Google and Archive.org index random sites and quotes text in them (as well as keeping cached copies), then they keep copyrighted material as well. I think that the difference is that if a site <b>EXPLICITLY</b> hosts copyrighted material, in the sense of openly encouraging it, that it's a violation of <a href="../../../c/_/_/WP%7EC_2f43.html" title="WP:C">WP:C</a>. So, yeah, some of the links should come down.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, I don't see why Demonoid should come down, but not others. I mean, Demonoid doesn't explicitly say it's for illegal filesharing. And there's just as much illegal content on Demonoid as there is on Empornium.us and The Pirate Bay, two links you didn't remove. One could even argue that The Pirate Bay should be removed too, because their name, the "PIRATE" bay directly implies that they're promoting illegal activity. Among other things that they've said and done. 71.126.139.169 16:23, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are (or were, the last time I looked and the last time I edited) internal links to wikipedia articles about the sites, rather than direct links to the sites. It's possible the articles contain links to the sites, but I'll leave those articles to someone else because I'm a bum.</dd>
<dd>I really do not buy the argument that e.g. demonoid does not control the content. A number of the sites I removed, I believe, claim that they remove copyrighted material when notified of it; however, they merely do this in an attempt to avoid legal consequences. They still knowingly participate in piracy.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Not entirely sure I understand your question, however in some torrent clients there are adjustable limits on how many peers it will connect to. Also, some peers will always be 'unconnectable' (usually behind a firewall or NAT box, and no TCP port forwarding has been configured). Two unconnectable peers can't communicate with each other. --<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzmosis_e28c.html" title="User:Ozzmosis">ozzmosis</a> 02:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>What do you mean by "they're all done manually"? BT uses the tracker to communicate with peers - the tracker gives you a list of <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_address_6ed9.html" title="IP address">IP addresses</a> to contact, and the BT client performs a <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handshaking.html" title="Handshaking">handshake</a> with them to initiate communication. <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplintax_b5f9.html" title="User:Splintax"><b><span style="color: #666">splintax</span></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplintax_0443.html" title="User talk:Splintax"><span style="color: #888">(talk)</span></a></sup> 14:27, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is probably a dumb question (Google didn't answer it for me, which is always a bad sign...):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Is Bluetooth limited to files transferred via the Internet? Strikes me there might be some benefit in implementing it in other file transfer situations such as e.g. Bluetooth. As I understand it, there are two useful characteristics to BT:
<dl>
<dd>i. distribution of data to reduce loads on servers</dd>
<dd>ii. the ability to stop and restart downloads without breaking</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let's say your gaming device has a Bluetooth version of BT built into it, which runs in the background. Place a few Bluetooth seeding points in e.g. train stations and provide users with free new movies, clips and games updates on the fly (kinda like an ongoing Easter egg feature). Allow users to watch the progress of the updates and charge them for downloads completed over the Internet (works as a teaser ad, like with movies).</p>

Anyway I was reading the article and I thought it would be good to have the new SXSW music package of 1000 mp3s added to the 'legal uses of BitTorrent' section. It counters the argument that BitTorrent cannot be used for the music industries benefit.. this allowed 1000 artists to be discovered for free and will help many unsigned bands get much exposure and many of them after attending the festival and having their song in this package have recieved record deals. This means that the record industry will profit off the back of a BitTorrent project effectively. The link was publicised on the BitTorrent.com homepage in association with SXSW and I am really enjoying the free tunes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.209.52.170 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.209.52.170_b1d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.209.52.170">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Complete Rewrite Of Etiquette Section Needed</span></h2>
<p>The Etiquette section discussing the theoretical impossibility of a 1.0 ratio on a single torrent is of no practical relevance to anyone and a pointless thought experiment. Therefore I suggest it be completely rewritten or simply removed. It is true that it is impossible for every member of a swarm on a single torrent to reach a 1.0 or higher ratio. However, noone asks you to since most people realize that it is impossible. Private trackers track only a global ratio which is the sum of anything a user uploads or downloads on any torrent he participates in. A user might not get the chance to seed back a specific torrent at all remaining with a 0.0 ratio for that torrent but then get a 2.0 ratio on another torrent which makes up for it. It is perfectly possible for all users of a tracker to have a 1.0 or higher global ratio, both in theory and pracice. Unless someone has major objections, I will rewrite the Etiquette section, removing the irrelevant discussion of ratio on a single torrent.</p>

<p>In particular this passage</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is perfectly possible for all users of a tracker to have a 1.0 or higher global ratio, both in theory and pracice.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In theory and practice, it is most certainly not.--Spinoza12 23:14, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, let me explain myself again: All of the maths in the topic above are based on one swarm of one torrent. They are correct and it is indeed impossible for everyone to have 1.0 ratio on that one torrent. Trackers which record and enforce ratio however track your global ratio across all torrents and not single torrent ratios. Now if a user joins a tracker and only ever leeched one torrent from that tracker, the calculations are applicable. Since he was never further interested in the tracker and only wanted to leech that one torrent, he obviously doesn't have to worry about the ratio rules anyway so this type of user is not interesting in a discussion on the possibility of everyone to have a 1.0 ratio.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the type of trackers we are talking about which track and enforce ratios are usually always private, i.e. they require going through a signup procedure or being invited. These procedures create a kind of Internet community, not unlike a forum community which in turn results in the great majority of users being active on the tracker. Some of these trackers also have policies to purge inactive user accounts. Now that we have established that the majority of users are active and leech and then seed back lots of different torrents, the calculations no longer apply. We now have many different swarms on many different torrents. The only ratio that is tracked and enforced is a global one across all those torrents a user participates in. Also consider that the whole thing is a highly dynamic system: New torrents get added constantly which create new swarms, users suddenly decide to leech an old torrent which gives whoever is still seeding that torrent a ratio boost. Some users even upload their own torrents which means they upload a lot of data while not having to download anything which increases a user's global ratio very fast.</p>
<p>To sum it up: On a single torrent with a single swarm there will always be peers which cannot get 1.0 local ratio on that specific torrent. On a tracker with x users and n torrents, all users get a chance to get 1.0 global ratio by participating in any of those n torrent swarms where, over time, the ratio discrepancies between users even themselves out.</p>
<p>Begin comments by --Spinoza12 08:27, 17 July 2006 (UTC) It <b>is</b> true that on a single torrent the 1.0 ratio is practically and theoretically impossible to enforce. And, if it is true for a single torrent then it <b>must</b> also be true for a collection of torrents.</p>
<p>If a tracker were to purge old and inactive accounts the global average ratio of the remaining accounts would probably increase. But by how much? And would it justify enforcing a 1.0 ratio for all remaining accounts? No one can tell. No one knows. However, if you were to purge all accounts with an average below 1.0 then you would get there eventually. But it would be very hard to get new members and get them to stay.</p>
<p>The gist of if it all is that enforcing global ratios even remotely close to 1.0 is dubious. If I had a tracker and wanted to enforce a close to a 1.0 ratio I would ban clients from uploading on a torrent as soon as each client reaches 1.0 on that torrent. Would that make my tracker better and more popular? Probably not.</p>
<p>What we need to understand is that there's always going to be people who have big and fast up-pipes who doesn't mind seeding for long times, and who would then be doing the swarm a favor but at the same time hurting everyone elses chance of reaching high ratios. This typically happens when new seeds are spawn on a fresh torrent. During the initial seeding phase, when there's only one seeder of a torrent, the tit-for-tat prisoners dilemma algorithm will ensure that clients who upload much also get to download much (and those who upload little get to download less). But this mechanism falls apart totally once there's more than one seed. The Tit-for-tat algorithm does not protect from defecting clients (clients not uploading) once there exists more than one seed.</p>
<p>Bittorrent seeds will then start uploading to the peers who have big download pipes with low latency irrespective of how much these peers upload themselves.</p>
<p>Enforcing ratios is social engineering designed to use bittorrent for something it is not quite so good at; Using it as a semi-permanent storage space. --Spinoza12 08:27, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Updates to "Downloading Torrents and Sharing Files"</span></h2>
<p>I recently updated this section. Apart from (attempting to) clarify some statements, the main changes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>replacing 'fragment' by 'piece';</li>
<li>replacing the section about 'rare fragments' (which should be downloaded first) by a section stating that clients download pieces (/fragments) in random order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both changes are based on the BitTorrent protocol specification <a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/protocol.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bittorrent.org/protocol.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, which mentions 'pieces' instead of 'fragments' exclusively, and also contains no mention of 'rare pieces', but does suggest downloading pieces in random order.</p>
<p>All my changes were reverted by <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a> claiming only that "'piece' is not in the bittorrent terminology". I have reverted back to my revision, and before the page is reverted again, I would like Haakon (or anyone else) to provide a source stating that 'fragment' is the proper term, even though the official specification uses the term 'piece'. In this case, please replace the terms in the current revision, instead of reverting it entirely. My contribution contains much more changes (again based on the official specification) than changing this term alone. 130.89.167.52 15:23, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Share ratio - trying to clarify</span></h2>
<p>The info on share ratio could be clearer, I think. I was trying to work out if each file being downloaded is treated separately, in terms of share ratio, or if having other files with a high share rating (acting as seeds) gives the user a better download global share ratio, and thus faster downloads. From the reference to a <i>global share ratio</i> on certain sites requiring registration, it seems that this is <i>not</i> the case in standard BitTorrent clients, but I'm not quite sure if I've understood this correctly. --<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingkong2005_96e7.html" title="User:Singkong2005">Singkong2005</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/i/n/User_talk%7ESingkong2005_cdc9.html" title="User talk:Singkong2005">talk</a></sup></small> 04:00, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Think of this the same way open source is licensed - people can use the BT mark subject to a polic and part of that policy is saying on first use that it is a trademark - if folks have no prpoblem with GPL then should not have a problem with this. Further in this cass I think it is important because the article gives the impression the BT is simply the name of a potocol, it's not. It's the name of a product and a company. We could approach it in the headers "This article is about the protocol for the client, see BitTorrent Clientsand for the company that owns the trademark "BitTorrent" see BitTorrent Inc" - does that work?

<p>One of the suggestions to come out of the Village Pump is to determine if the trademark status is encyclopedic in the sense that it's unexpected for some reason.
