<p>Emilio and Rosa Mia are a loving couple expecting their first child. Rosa Mia is an aspiring singer, working at cheap bars to earn a living while Emilio is security guard where Rosa Mia works. When the bar owner learns of their relationship and Rosa Mia’s pregnancy, talk show host fires them from the club leaving them jobless and destitute. But although poor, they remain optimistic about their future together.</p>
<p>One night, as Emilio was out job hunting, Rosa Mia starts to labor. With no one to help, she runs out in the pouring rain to get to the hospital. Fortunately, Emilio arrives and sees Rosa Mia struggling; but by then, it’s too late to go to the hospital and Rosa Mia gives birth to a baby girl out in the streets. They name the baby Emilia Rose.</p>
<p>Emilia Rose develops lung problems and this causes her to be sickly and be in and out of hospitals. Desperate because of rising hospital costs, Rosa Mia accepts a month-long singing engagement in Cebu, leaving Emilio to take care of the baby on his own. So when out on his new job as a security guard in another club, Emilio brings his baby with him.</p>
<p>But on one occasion, his boss sends him off to deliver a package in a different club. While on this errand, Emilio leaves the baby with an acquaintance because he can’t bring the baby inside with him. This is Adora, a rose vendor outside the clubs of Malate.</p>
<p>Adora agrees to take care of the baby for a few minutes, waiting outside the club for Emilio to return. Unknown to Adora, Emilio gets arrested inside the club because the package turns out to filled with drugs. Adora waits all night but Emilio never returns. Adora then brings the baby home with her.</p>
<p>The loss of Emilia Rose and Emilio’s subsequent imprisonment lead to bitterness and separation between Emilio and Rosa Mia. Adora on the other hand falls for the baby and decides to raise her as her own, calling her Adorina, Dorina for short.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the loss of her child, Rosa Mia pours herself in her singing until she gets discovered by Lauro Calma, a record producer. He develops Rosa Mia to be a star, asking her not to reveal to anyone that she’s married and had a child. Rosa Mia agrees. Soon Rosa Mia rises to fame, and becomes the Sensational Diva.</p>

<p>Dorina grows up to be happy child with Adora. They both enjoy music and are big fans of Rosa Mia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another up and coming singer emerges in the scene. She is Lavinia. Her ambitious mother, Barbara, tells Lavinia to befriend Rosa Mia to speed up her popularity. Lonely and vulnerable, Rosa Mia takes Lavinia under her wing, seeking a replacement for the daughter she pines for even after so many years.</p>
<p>With Rosa Mia’s help, Lavinia also becomes very popular. But it’s not enough for Barbara. She wants Lavinia to be on top. So Barbara connives with Larry Calma, the son of Rosa Mia’s manager, Lauro.</p>
<p>Larry wants to prove himself to his father so he handles Lavinia and connives with Barbara to knock off Rosa Mia from the top spot, leaving Lavinia as the ultimate and most popular singer. Through intrigue and character assassination, they succeed. Rosa Mia falls from grace and loses her reputation and popularty so she turns her back from showbusiness and returns to singing in small clubs.</p>
<p>Soon, Dorina begins to idolize Lavinia. She goes to her every concert, show and personal appearances to catch a glimpse of her idol and offer her <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sampaguita.html" title="Sampaguita">Sampaguita</a>. But Dorina also loves to sing. With the help of Adora and her bestfriend Oman, Dorina joins singing contests until she eventually wins in a nationwide and televised singing contest. She gains the attention of all, including Nico Escobar, the boyfriend of Lavinia.</p>

<p>Nico is in love with Lavinia. But it becomes clear that Lavinia is too involved in her career. She refuses to marry him for fear she won’t be as popular anymore.</p>
<p>Bitter and angry, Nico plans to show Lavinia that her career should not be the most important priority in her life so he plans to develop another singer to compete with Lavinia and knock her out of the top spot.</p>
<p>Nico uses Dorina to accomplish this. With his friend Zossimo, Nico puts up Zoni Records to develop Dorina’s singing career.</p>

<p>Soon after, Dorina finds herself admiring Nico and develops feelings for him, but she doesn’t know how Nico feels about her.Dorina’s interest in Nico comes as a blow for her bestfriend Oman and her band-mate Gary who are both in love with Dorina.</p>

<p>Soon, Dorina gains fame and Lavinia becomes threatened by this. After a big event, Lavinia becomes so enraged by Dorina’s great performance and attention of all that she attacks Dorina and calls her a copycat. This then spurs Dorina to fight back.</p>

<p>Nico and Zossimo find a song once composed by Rosa Mia before she left the music scene. They buy the song from Rosa Mia and ask her to help Dorina with her singing. At first, Rosa Mia refuses after what happened with Lavinia. But eventually she can’t resist Dorina and agrees to help her out. They soon become close, not knowing of their real relationship with each other.</p>

<p>Not long after, Emilio is released from prison with the goal of finding Adora and his daughter. He later succeeds and finds Adora, only to learn that his daughter is Dorina, the singer he’s been admiring even when still in prison. Emilio then decides not to tell Dorina of their real relationship for fear of destroying Dorina’s career and all that she has worked hard for. But to be close to his daughter, Emilio takes on a job as Dorina’s driver/bodyguard.</p>

<p>Things are falling into place. Dorina is unwittingly with her real parents, Emilio and Rosa Mia, and it is only a matter of time for the truth to surface.</p>

<p>A number of plot and character differences were introduced in the TV version, in part to extend the limited story line of the movie:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dorina's birth parents are new additions to the story</li>
<li>Lavinia's family (mother, sister) are also new additions</li>
<li>The TV version attempts to provide an explanation for Lavinia's evil ways; no explanation was provided in the movie</li>
<li>While the TV version stayed faithful to the fact that Nico made Dorina a star, it also shows that her career was helped by her joining a competition Star in a Million</li>
<li>The character of Oman is also a new addition</li>
<li>The TV version has three love triangles (Dorina-Oman-Gary, Lavinia-Nico-Larry and Dorina-Nico-Lavinia). In the movie version, the primary love triangle was between Dorina-Nico-Lavinia.</li>
<li>The TV version staged a <i>Grand Showdown</i>, dubbed as "<i>The Clash of the Divas</i>", between Dorina and Lavinia. The Grand Showdown scenes were taped in front of a live audience of more than 15,000 viewers on September 19, 2006 at the <a href="../../../a/r/a/Araneta_Coliseum_0ddc.html" title="Araneta Coliseum">Araneta Coliseum</a><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Selected scenes from the Grand Showdown were used in the show's final episodes.</li>
<li>The October 1, 2006 episode of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Buzz_0b32.html" title="The Buzz">The Buzz</a> interviewed Sarah Geronimo and Angelika Dela Cruz in their characters on the TV series as part of the show's promotion.

<ul>
<li>Writer Nerissa Cabral agreed to grant the rights to the TV version on two conditions:
<ul>
<li>that Sarah Geronimo portray the role of Dorina Pineda; and</li>
<li>that the story stay true to the fan-star relationship depicted in the original story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Actress Angelika dela Cruz was originally hesitant to accept the role of Lavinia, fearing that she would be typecasted in antagonist roles. She eventually decided to accept the role because (among other reasons) it gave her a chance to resume her singing career, which had been on hold for several years due to legal problems with her previous recording label.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Two rival entertainment reporters on the TV series (Oscar and Edith) are portrayed by real-life husband and wife Benjie Felipe and Lisa Andaya.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Grand Showdown that was taped at the Araneta Coliseum also held a post-finale concert, featuring several ABS-CBN Artists, with <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Muhlach_26e5.html" title="Aga Muhlach">Aga Muhlach</a> as the most important guest. The concert was majorly sponsored by <a href="../../../j/o/l/Jollibee.html" title="Jollibee">Jollibee</a> and was aired on ABS-CBN last October 15, 2006.</li>
