Danny fights back and sends them away, taking a small piece of ripped photo of his father from them afterwards. By the time he returns home, he misses his curfew, landing him in trouble. While Jack and Maddie lectures him, Jazz interrupts, stating the reason he refuses to speak with his parents about his problems is because of their lack of exposure of their own childhood to him. Jack uses this as an idea to take both Jazz and Danny to their 20th college reunion held in <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> in their old friend's home.</p>

Jack, Maddie, and Vlad 20 years younger</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>They take the Fenton RV to Vlad's manor, stopping to rest for the night where Jack relates the tale about his best friend Vlad Masters (whom Jazz recognize as a well known <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billionaire.html" title="Billionaire">billionaire</a>). 20 years in the past, Jack, Maddie, and Vlad had built a portable ghost portal in the works, but an accident on Jack's part caused Vlad to take the full blunt of the machine, causing him to have a severe case of ecto-acne (as well as his infamous white hair), hospitalizing him and killing his social life. After Jack finishes his story, he hopes that his friend would forgive him after so long.</p>
<p>They reach Vlad's manor the next day where Vlad warmly greets everyone but Jack. Inside, they notice he is a devoted <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Bay_Packers_4077.html" title="Green Bay Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> fan while Danny notice Vlad hitting on their mother (Jazz, however is more interested in the lavish <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manor_house.html" title="Manor house">manor</a>). Vlad convinces Jack to stay further by convincing him the ghost of the previous owner of the manor, the Dairy King, haunts the halls.</p>
<p>By nightfall, Jack stumbles to find the bathroom, the three vulture ghosts ready to kill him from behind. When he's ghost sense goes off, Danny rescues Jack and is ready to defeat said ghosts if not for the fact they run away in fear, leaving Danny to confront with another ghost: Vlad Plasimus. Vlad easily defeats Danny all the while as he taunts the boy's lack of skills, knocking him unconscious which quickly reverts him back to his human self. Vlad, also reverting to his human self, is shocked that Danny Phantom is Jack's son. Danny later wakes up his room where Vlad confronts him over the shouts he was making. Danny makes a small lie, which Vlad leaves on, secretly making new plans of his own.</p>
<p>The reunion comes the next night. Jazz refuses to join in the party, so Danny goes alone with his parents. Inside the main reunion room, Jack reminisces with others; including news reporter Harriet "Harry" Chin who has nothing but disrespect for the man. Vlad walks over to Danny and asks for a favor: to go to his lab to get Jack a present. Inside, Danny finds an old photo of his parents and Vlad. Taking out the photo of Jack he had previously, he puts two and two together. Before he could do anything though, he fights the ectopussess who comes out of nowhere, but loses his battle with Skulker who traps Danny inside a mechanical box, the Spectral Energy Neutralizer which takes away Danny's ghost power from inside. Before Skulker tries to kill Danny, Vlad sends him away and reveals to Danny that he is the ghost that he fought last night, visually transforming in front of him. He then makes an offer for Danny to join his side, to help teach him to better hone his powers as long as he renounces his father. Danny refuses, leaving Vlad to continue the rest of his plan by heading down to the party in hopes of changing his mind.</p>

Vlad confronts Danny.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There, Vlad possesses Jack, causing him to wreck havoc in the party to which Maddie discovers a ghost is overshadowing him. Harriet Chin, upon witnessing this, sees this as the story of a lifetime. She and Maddie head over to the Fenton RV, driving towards the ghost that possessed Jack. In the meantime, Danny is freed by the ghost of the Dairy King. He manages to fly over and remove Vlad from Jack, shoving him to the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">library</a> where they fight, all the while as Vlad tries to convince Danny to join his side. The Fenton RV rams it's way into the library where Vlad phases in and kidnaps Maddie. While Jack endlessly chases after his wife, Danny goes intangible and invisible, drives the RV to Vlad's direction and aims various weaponry towards Vlad until eventually the ectoplasmic goo finally hits him, making him drop Maddie (all the while as Harriet Chin watches in astonishment).</p>

<p>Danny quickly possesses Jack who dives in to save Maddie. After he sends her away to check up on Harriet, Danny grabs Vlad and threatens to expose both their secrets if he must unless they come to a truce. Vlad hopefully agrees, noticing the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackmail.html" title="Blackmail">blackmail</a> Danny utilized, which in his eyes he sees as a sign that he is slowly being influenced to his direction. He then dramatically makes his escape, vowing to return. Harriet afterwards apologizes to Jack for thinking him as a crackpot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Harry got fired for her stories on ghosts while Jack grows upset that Vlad is still angry with him. Danny however, cheers his father up as they drive home.</p>

<ul>
<li>The scene wherein Danny is trapped in a box that cancels ghost powers is similar to that of <i><a href="../../../l/o/i/Lois_and_Clark_8109.html" title="Lois and Clark">Lois and Clark</a>'</i>s Season One Finale, "<i>House of Luthor</i>" wherein <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> is placed in a cage with <a href="../../../k/r/y/Kryptonite.html" title="Kryptonite">kryptonite</a> bars that reduced his powers. Other things in common with this scene is that the hero is trapped by a villian who's worth billions; all inside a mansion while he aims for a woman close to the hero (To Superman, his love interest <a href="../../../l/o/i/Lois_Lane_5472.html" title="Lois Lane">Lois Lane</a>, to Danny his mother Maddie) whom he is vying for attention and romance towards.</li>
