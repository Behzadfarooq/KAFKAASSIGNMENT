<h2><span class="mw-headline">Opening comments</span></h2>
<p>I added "in many areas" to the text "Downloading of copyrighted material is ILLEGAL." - because downloading of copyrighted material IS not "universally" illegal - it is only illegal in "many"/"some" areas - US beeing one area I believe. In sweden (where I live) and many other european/african and asian countries it is currently NOT illegal to download copyrighted material without the copyright holders premission - it is ONLY illegal to upload/distribute copyrighted material - only the copyright-holder may distribute his/hers copyrighted material (or license that right to others).</p>
<p>For example, if I were to download say metallicas new album from someones ftp - I am not the one that is doing something illegal where I live - it is the person that owns the ftp. However some uploading might be okay, for example distributing copyrighted material, like metallicas new album, to family and friends fall under fair use in many countries.</p>
<p>There are also countries that has not signed the berne convention (or whichever it is) that deals with copyrights between countries, North Korea beeing one and Cuba another, I believe. (wich means that in those countries you can freely copy anything from the rest of the world).</p>
<p>However it is wrong to state that it IS illegal in a universal sence, and it is more correct to add "in many areas".</p>

<dd>Yes that is why I had ftp as an example and not bittorrent. However the sentence claimed that "downloading of copyrighted material is ILLEGAL", which is what i was objecting to. (it did not say that use of bittorrent to download material is illegal). However it is not certain that downloading of copyrighted material via bittorrent is illegal either - since we are allowed to redistribute small sections of copyrighted works to others (like 30 seconds of a song), or even entire songs/movies to friends and relatives. (fair use, maybe not in the USA). Further on, from the users perspective, he/she is pressing a link on a web-page and downloading a song/movie/software/whatever. So even in the case of bittorrent it is not certain that downloading of copyrighted material via bittorrent *IS* ILLEGAL (*everywhere*). It is simply not a fact. However I am happy with the current text "ILLEGAL in many countries".&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>The article says: "While initially created to distribute legal files, such as GNU/Linux distributions or large movie trailers, BitTorrent is also being used by some to download copyrighted music, movies, and software, similar to many other peer-to-peer networks." Just because software is copyrighted, doesn't mean it can't be distributed legally. The copyright holder has to grant you a license to distribute the license though. The GPL, under which GNU/Linux is distributed, does this. Read <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_General_Public_License_c529.html" title="GNU General Public License">GNU General Public License</a>: "The GPL protects, using copyright law, the following freedoms for users and developers of free software". It should be changed to "to illegally download music,...". I'm making this change right now. Hopefully this comment will explain my change to people without legal background.</dd>

<dd>I think there is something strange with the current wording of the article. It says "BitTorrent can also be used for legal purposes", thus implying that downloading copyrighted material is an illegal purpose. However, in Sweden this is entirely legal, and distribution among friends (such as the 30,000 members of The Piracy Burea) could very well also be legal. Even if it might be illegal to download a movie with BitTorrent (because of the redistribution) the purpose (obtaining the movie) could be legal. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilur_ec4f.html" title="User:Filur">Filur</a> 22:27, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont understand web seeding. If the dot torrent file says a copy of the FILE is available on website X. What is there to stop me from grabbing the file from the website instead of using a bittorrent client?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The server won't respond to the HTTP request for the file from a web browser. Server-side trackers are actually software running on top of the web server, and as such they can be configured to respond in specific ways to: improper requests, requests from banned IPs, and requests from unknown/unregistered IPs. You can also configure a tracker to do other non-torrent-related tasks such as recording upload/download statistics and making them available in realtime on a website. It can be written in just about any language, although perl, php, and other languages with native web-serving functionality are the easiest (and therefore most common) implementations. Maybe I'll merge some of this info into the main article. ----</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>The 'how it works' section ends with:</p>
<p><i>When there are no longer any nodes connected to the tracker server who possess the complete file (so-called "seeds" or "seeders"), the nodes cannot finish the download if they do not have a complete copy distributed amongst themselves.</i></p>
<p>1) This is a run-on sentence 2) Is it true? - It is saying if&#160;!exists(some(node with all parts)) whereas i think it should be saying if&#160;!(for all parts(exists(some node with that part))) 3) It implies that the tracker is not obliged to serve specific parts of the file on request. Is this true?</p>
<p>my rewording would be:</p>
<p><i>Download of the complete file is only possible if other nodes in your group can supply all the missing parts. The tracker, though in posession of the entire file, is not obliged to support requests for specific parts of the file.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>A BitTorrent tracker is not neccessarily in possession of the file. In fact, many simply have the IPs of the seeders/peers and information needed to verify the data. If a tracker is also seeding, it is a separate action.</dd>

<p>This should not be mentioned: "the standard eDonkey2000 protocol provides little "leech resistance" -- there are no benefits in providing upload bandwidth, just a UL:DL speed ratio when the upload speed is below 10 kB/s." This is not accurate! All edonkey supporting clients I know prioritize upload to people uploading to you, and try to validate clients as well. It does a lot more than BitTorrent to stop leeching and is a lot more efficient for large groups of files.</p>
<p>Ofcourse it *can* fully replace BitTorrent: if you make an edonkey server to share a small collection of files, and let people connect to it, that will do it. I wont get into technicality, but you can limit people from sharing their files, and you can get people to connect to a server by clicking a link, just like a .torrent file without actually having to download a file.</p>
<p>Further more about leech protection. In mldonkey, I *dont* upload to BitTorrent, since I think edonkey is more efficient. What does BitTorrent do to stop me leeching? But if I try not to upload to edonkey, my download speed drops significantly.</p>
<p>Also speaking about efficiency: have a look at this:</p>
<pre>
Client Downloaded  Uploaded
eMu 8376563  19087360
OVR 4239362  4359714
eDK 3151872  3502080
tML 1299456  1474560
sZA 359424  274432
</pre>
<p>This is just taken right now, from my upload list: 22:30pm, 30th June. What efficiency! -- I'm downloading 23 files, download maxed out at 60KB/sec, upload is set to 20KB/sec (bandwidth limit 26KB), also maxed out.</p>
<p>So please dont slander and say things like edonkey offers low leech protection, the original protocol was a little weak on leech protection, but it is of no relevance today. All ed2k clients now offer maximum leech protection, and older clients just get banned.</p>
<p>And as far as I know the only client that exploited the original edonkey protocol was mldonkey =&lt;1.16, the reputation kinda stuck :) -- ofcourse using that client today, gets you banned.</p>
<p>Anyway, please review the bias against edonkey in the article. Although I'm also biased against BitTorrent, I wouldnt post such information on a non discussion page.</p>
<p><br />
- Comment: I believe you would get different results in comparing edonkey to bittorrent if you where to try to max out the bandwidth of 10 mbit upload and 10 mbit download (which is a surprisingly common type of broadband in some countries) on a single file - for example the latest episode of a tv-show. For this bittorrent is, in my experience, superior.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think in that situation, it may win depending on the source number difference. At the very least, finding sources for a single file is indeed faster on bittorrent since there is a tracker that keeps a separate list of sources for each file. Hardly efficient for tens of millions of files though and on edonkey, you get the benefit of finding sources on *any* server, not limited to the current tracker.--User:Hackeron 22:35, 30 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>--Spinoza12: My objections to the discussion above is about details not the discussion in it self. In particular the speed between the clients and the leech resistance of them.</p>
<p>The speed of bittorrent above edonkey has nothing to do with share ratios or leech resistance (assuming the speed of the peers are the same between the two clients). It is rather a function the size of the chunks of data every client announces. Chunk sizes in a torrent file is on average somewhere between 128K and 512K whilst in an edonkey file the chunk size is always around the 9MB mark. Each of these two clients won't announce a chunk to the crowd of peers until it is downloaded locally. This makes the spreading of the complete file a function of it's chunk size primarily. The spreading is also affected by the frequency of the clients announcement of chunks.</p>
<p>One other consequence of this fact is that files tend to be available for longer periods of time on edonkey than bittorrent. This is simply because it takes longer to download a complete copy. One advantage of edonkey is however that the servers are searchable within the network without having to rely on separate servers for torrent announcements.</p>
<p>Finally, bittorrent is more leech proof during the initial seeding phase but that is about all. It is in no way, shape, or form more leech proof during the second phase after the which more seeds have sprouted. And neither is edonkey. --Spinoza12 22:44, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I believe the gif moves too fast anyways. Perhaps showing a small example with 10 or so leeches, then zooming out to hundreds, helping to seed them.

<dd>I find this picture straight forward and easy to understand. The machine at the bottom is the initial seed for the file. It distributes the whole file to the network of peers by alternatively giving them chunks of the file. The file is represented in the grey boxes that fill up with colored squares, each square representing a chunk . The process of transferring a chunk of the file is represented by a colored line corresponding to one of the chunks. Looking at the animation you can see the way the BitTorrent protocol schedules transfers between peers.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should this page have links to copyrighted content?</span></h2>
<p>In this page are many links to sites tracking specific copyrighted content, such as the South Park or Simpsons trackers. Is it legally appropriate for Wikipedia to provide links to sites which enable copyright violation?</p>
<dl>
<dd>As has been noted before, this is legal in many countries. Even in the US, I don't think there is any law preventing linking to a site that provides links to material which are protected under copyright. I suppose the question is rather whether it is appropriate for an encyclopedia to provide links to resources rather than links to other pages that describe the given topic. I think the links are helpful to anyone trying to understand what BitTorrent is. Many other wikipedia pages have external links like this. I say keep them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>i agree. the same argument (that wikipedia shouldn't provide information which can be used to infringe copyrights) holds for bittorent itself. i think it is critical that a distinction be made between <i>Italic text</i>infringing<i>Italic text</i> copyrights and providing the <i>Italic text</i>ability<i>Italic text</i> to do so, especially when the information provided can be used for legitimate purposes.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Speculation Article - for curious people (copied from somewhere)</span></h2>
<p>On several BitTorrent and P2P forums we have noticed reports that LokiTorrent actually has been holding out hoping that the MPAA will make an offer to shut them down rather then wage on with the expensive pending lawsuit. We have decided to research this rumor ourselves to see what this popular torrent site is up to. Original this was posted on p2pforum but has vanished... We are posting this story for the public awareness. Some things we have noticed about the popular bit torrent site Lokitorrent that have raised some red flags is that they started collecting a US$30,000 legal fund to defend their site before they even were being sued! Even more odd was once they were sued they raised this amount to US$30,000 per month in legal fees plus US$4000 per month in site costs. To us this all sounds kind of fishy. Our question is why? After several failed attempts to reach Lokitorrent site admins looking for answers we went and contacted the MPAA which was more than happy to state that yes Lokitorrent and the MPAA were in negotiations and that the current offer could not be disclosed nor could the terms if the deal were to be reached. We all know bit torrent site admins take pride in their grassroots, non-profit image however most sites make huge amounts of money. Suprnova which claims to have shutdown due to MPAA pressure and to finish working on their Exeem project for their client is completely just lies. Suprnova was making alot of money. Figure if they had 2,000,000 visitors per day (which is what lokitorrent claims to have, suprnova many estimate had closer to 5,000,000) they would have made close to US$90,000 per month just from per-click ads. Do the math, (all you blog site admins will be kicking yourself because you know this is true) if even only 1.5% (my blog site even gets about 6%, so 1.5% is really low estimate) click an ad, even if by mistake they get an average of $.10 per click so they would be making US$3000 per day times 30 days, not to mention those annoying high paying popups. So now you are asking why would Suprnova shutdown if they were making so much? Well the answer is simple, with Exeem they have much lower costs as their whole system can run on 2 or 3 servers and their effort to maintain those 2 or 3 servers is alot lower as well when you consider they had more then 25 servers going at their peak. Exeem also will make them a ton of money through Cydoor. Some estimate they can easily make $1 per user per day which would put them at close to US$300,000 per day with their current user base. Cydoor is a information harvesting company. They harvest the users info to either sell to marketing companies and spammers or to use your info to hit you with ads directly for their clients. By using Exeem these companies know everything about you just by monitoring your online actions. You go to your email, they now know your email address, you fill in a form they have your name and home address, the information they can harvest is limitless and it is totally legal because when you install Exeem the user license informs you of this if you were to actually read it. If you dont believe us click here and read the part about Cydoor carefully. So why do Lokitorrent and Suprnova care so much about the public knowing about all this? They care because if you knew about it their image as being modern day Robinhoods would be tarnished and they would not be able to sucker you their user into donating Thousands of dollars to them. Our prediction is this Lokitorrent will sign a deal with the MPAA to shutdown, they will claim to shutdown saying that do to lack of donations they ca not afford to fight the case. The Lokitorrent admins save face with the BitTorrent community and continue their mufftorrent porn site and everyone goes on thinking they were just underdogs that could not afford to fight. We would actually like to hear a reply from lokitorrent or suprnova on this actually and we welcome their reply. Again this is all just still brain food and speculation at this point.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Legality of BitTorrent search engines</span></h3>
<p>If BitTorrent search engines are to be chucked on grounds of dubious legality, I would like to see some greater argument as to why. I guess it is because these search engines actually store links to sites which violate copyright; but the same could be said of Google. A search engine simply lists what exists on the web, after all; it does not encourage users to search for particular individual terms. There are perfectly legitimate uses for a Torrent search engine; again, surely it is the users, not the provider, whose actions create issues of legality or illegality. -- <a href="../../../w/e/b/User%7EWebDrake_55ac.html" title="User:WebDrake">WebDrake</a> 17:33, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, the inclusion of the search engine on the BitTorrent home pages does not constitute endorsement of copyright infringement, see the search engine TOS at <a href="http://search.bittorrent.com/tos.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.bittorrent.com/tos.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Pay special attetion to sections 2 (agreement not to use the site to do illegal things, including copyright infringement), 4 (limitation of liablity), 5 (links are generated through an automated process, BitTorrent has no control), and 12 (<a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act_98fd.html" title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</a> safe harbor notification.) This clearly shows that BitTorrent is not marketed to encourage copyright violations. Also, you did not respond to any of my initial objections, and they are still valid.

<dd>OK, it's your POV that any concern over legal issues with BitTorrent is FUD.

<p>Since the Etiquette section mentioned it is considered to polite to upload as much data as you have downloaded, I added a paragraph on why many consider such a policy a bad idea. I didn't spend much time on it, so if someone wants to clean it up or better explain the math behind it, feel free. I think both items should stay because it is considered polite by many users of BT to seed until a 1.00 ratio but many users also are well aware that it is rather impossible to accomplish due to the math involved.</p>

<dd>Following section is phrased poorly: "BitTorrent, like any other computer tool capable of copying files, can be used to copy files without the permission of the copyright holder. Indeed, some might say that BitTorrent has become famous for its ability to do just that." First of all, BitTorrent itself isn't capable of copying anything - it is a file transfer protocol. For the same reason it isn't a tool <i>Italic text</i>per se<i>Italic text</i>, unless we're talking about the client. Something like "BitTorrent, like any other file transfer protocol, can be used to distribute files without the permission of the copyright holder. This ethically questionable use of the protocol is the main reason for its success." I removed the weasel "some might say" bit too.

<dd>They're no more vulnerable than any other method of file transfer. The one critisim against BitTorrent which actually has some truth in it is that a file cannot be scanned for viruses or spyware until it has been fully downloaded, whereas with traditiona peer-to-peer downloads files often can be scanned if only a portion has been received. However any good virus scanner or antispyware program will scan all files on opening/execution, making BitTorrent no more secure or insecure than the operating system itself.</dd>
<dd>On the plus side, due to the SHA hashing it is extremely unlikely a malevolent party can offer files through BitTorrent which are undistinguishable from the real deal. <a href="../../../a/n/%C3%A1/User%7EAn%C3%A1rion_c250.html" title="User:Anárion">Jordi</a>·<a href="../../../a/n/%C3%A1/User_talk%7EAn%C3%A1rion_e6d6.html" title="User talk:Anárion">✆</a> 21:43, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nevertheless, I think this is an important topic that should be addressed in the article. Such software in my experience is often banned from university networks (and this ban is heavily policed!), partly to stave off lawsuits in cases of copyright infringement but also on security grounds. The precise quote from one sysadmin stating this policy was, "If you use these programs under Windows you expose yourself to viruses and malware, thus jeopardizing our whole network. You may "by mistake" or on purpose download material that is not free, which can result in economical consequences for you, the Institute or the University." It's therefore necessary for the article to have a clear statement of what the risks are and how best to avoid them.</dd>

<dd>One particular clarification: you cite the SHA hashing as providing protection but of course this is only as good as the honesty of the original provider. If someone deliberately sets up a Torrent with a virus included in the original data, the SHA hashing will let this go through just fine, right? I would imagine this must be quite a risk, particularly with respect to those naughty, naughty people who specialise in hosting copyright-protected data they should not be sharing. -- <a href="../../../w/e/b/User%7EWebDrake_55ac.html" title="User:WebDrake">WebDrake</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rephrasing Eitquette section</span></h2>
<p>The etiquette section contains a few "strained" sentances. I would like to propose a rephrase of it, but first I would like to clear up some facts. The section currently says the following among other things:</p>
<p>"Additionally, this means that those who give back more data than they downloaded are hurting everyone else and since most torrents rely on users uploading more than they have downloaded to counteract users who logged off too early discouraging them from uploading is usually a bad idea."</p>
<p>This seems misleading at best, and incorrect at worst. Exactly how would one be 'hurting' anything by contributing more than one has downloaded? The only interpretation of the above I can think of, is that it is 'hurtful' with respect to attaining the 'perfect' swarm, as described before it. That is, if one is looking to distribute a file in a way that minimizes the overhead for all parties involved, everyone should share exactly as much as they have downloaded. One would be 'hurting' the perfection of the distribution process by contributing 'too much'. Is this what the author meant?</p>
<p>But beyond that I cannot see how it is correct in the general case. In practice, contributing to a swarm (in the general case) by seeding is never going to have any kind of negative impact on the average download speed of the swarm, regardless of whether other people are leechers or not. The above makes it sound like contributing more than 1:1 would be a bad thing even if everyone had the capability and will to contribute exactly 1:1.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is incorrect. I can't even understand what the author of that passage is basing it on, but I'm sure it's not bittorrent.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problems with this article</span></h2>
<p>I'm not disputing that this article is pretty well-written or factually most likely correct, but from the way it is written it seems to only explain BitTorrent to an audience of people who have a pretty good idea of what BitTorrent is in the first place. Otherwise it is extremely confusing, and doesn't really provide a simply overview for other users:</p>
<p>"Downloading with BitTorrent is straightforward. Each person who wants to download the file first downloads the torrent and opens it in the BitTorrent client software. The torrent file tells the client the address of the tracker, which, in turn, maintains a log of which users are downloading the file and where the file and its fragments reside. For each available source, the client considers which blocks of the file are available and then requests the rarest block it does not yet have. This makes it more likely that peers will have blocks to exchange. As soon as the client finishes importing a block, it hashes it to make sure that the block matches what the torrent file said it should be. Then it begins looking for someone to upload the block to."</p>
<p>I think what is needed with this and many other technical (especially internet-related articles) is a simple overview section that non-technical people can understand. This is not a personal request - I'm a programmer and have little problem with this article, but I imagine most users would have no idea what BitTorrent actually is, and the steps required to use it: 1. Download the Application 2. Find a BitTorrent file to download (how?) 3. Open the file Understand the meaning of Seed, Peer. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacgruder_34c8.html" title="User:Macgruder">Macgruder</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Etiquette - maths</span></h2>
<p>Could someone explain why the 1.00 everywhere except the last two at 0.50 is "better" than an even spread of the share ratios (put another way, isn't this breaching NPOV)? That is to say, if you have a seed who uploads 1 full copy of the file and then retires, with <i>n</i> downloaders, then the <i>n</i> downloaders will download <i>n</i> copies of the file and upload <i>n</i>-1 copies, all told. You get (an average) share ratio of (<i>n</i>-1)/<i>n</i>, or 1 - 1/<i>n</i> each, which is definitely below 1.00, assuming no-one else seeds until necessary. (This also strikes me as being a far more intuitive way of approaching the maths required, and shows what I think is a counter-intuitive result: the more clients on the network, the more those clients need to upload.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your math looks more correct.</dd>
</dl>
<p>81.132.61.108 16:37, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is because it <i>is</i> correct. Parts of the post above should be merged into the main article. I am thinking specifically about this part:</p>
<dl>
<dd>[...] if you have a seed who uploads 1 full copy of the file and then retires, with <i>n</i> downloaders, then the <i>n</i> downloaders will download <i>n</i> copies of the file and upload <i>n</i>-1 copies, all told. You get (an average) share ratio of (<i>n</i>-1)/<i>n</i>, or 1 - 1/<i>n</i> each, which is definitely below 1.00 [...]</dd>
</dl>
<p>That part is correct.</p>
<dl>
<dd>[...]assuming no-one else seeds until necessary[...]</dd>
</dl>
<p>But I do have objections. The <i>average</i> in this example is calculated for the <i>n</i> and is not affected by anyones additional seeding among the <i>n</i>. The individual ratio for the clients in the <i>n</i> swarm is though. If someone seeds indefinately (or because of asymmetrical upload speeds becomes an early seeder) and exceeds the average for the swarm, the average for the rest of the swarm (the peers minus the new seeds remaining) will sink. It will tend to approach zero if this process of recalculationg the average for the remainder of the swarm each time a new seed is created, unless the torrent continues indefinately, and unless the number of peers never decrease, something it will never ever do.</p>
<p>All in all, ratios are in my opinion an effort to use torrents as a permanent storage space, something it was <b>never</b> intended to do. Maintaining unrealistic share ratios is dubious at best and harmful to the swarm at worst. In my opinion the only realistic share ratio to monitor would be 0.5. Certainly not 1.0. And 0.5 would correspond to a torrent with one seed and two peers. The average among the peers would be 0.5 in this case. However, the two may have an individual share ratio different from 0.5 depending on upload/download speeds. The extreme case would be one client at 1.0 and the other at 0.0. I hope this expansion of this topic has enlightened the unenlightened few and got someone pumped up to correct the main page.</p>

<dd>BitTorrent is still free.

<p>"Sharing Files" and "How BitTorrent Works", the first two sections of the article, contain a great amount of material that is identical. Almost three full paragraphs worth.</p>
<p>I'm sure that's not intentional - and as I'm not an authority on BitTorrent, nor am I much of a wikier, I'm leaving it, but I felt I should put something here.</p>

<dd>I think it's changing way too fast to follow the individual "arrows". Animation speed should be around 5 to 10 times slower. -- anon, 2 Apr 2006</dd>

<dd>I think the speed of the picture is irrelevant. The point is that the viewer can see that at the end of all of the actions, every peer has a complete copy of the data.--Swuster 01:39, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the image is fine at its present speed, once you understand what it's meant to show. Look, for example at the seeder through one run, and you see how little it has to send (just each chunk once). Look at any other node and you see it getting its data from all over the place and sending out known chunks likewise. You don't need to think about each connection and each chunk - that's what BitTorrent does for you: it sorts all that out. I'm not sure if its allowed on WP, but a JavaScript animation like they use for some on-line weather sequences might be fun because you can set the animation speed, the re-start delay, and pause and single-step the whole thing. But I think that's unnecessary, just add some labels and an explanantion underneath, as a caption, IMHO. --<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigelj_f250.html" title="User:Nigelj">Nigelj</a> 18:24, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the animation image; why is it gone? IMO it was nice in ilustrating the whole thing. (but indeed it was a bit fast) so if someone with wikiexperience could a) bring it back and b) make the distributing streams a tiny bit slower?! I'm a bit lazy and not experienced enough to do it myself at this time. Pictureupdater 07:33, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes the message does get across - but it could get across a bit more conveniently if it was a bit slower (heh, bit) and I wouldn't have to watch it repeatedly to, y'know, soak it in. Just a bit speedy, that's all. But if it's too much work to tweak, I can totally understand. ~Falos 128.187.80.2 19:58, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here it is with the time intervals doubled, so the speed is halved, any better? <a href="http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/9245/torrentcomprevisedxz1.gif" class="external free" title="http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/9245/torrentcomprevisedxz1.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/9245/torrentcomprevisedxz1.gif</a> (Matt 13:01, 25 October 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Infinitely better. If it could be slowed down even further for that one very complex image that's just a rat's nest of lines, it'd be better than infinitely better! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.81.115.4_357d.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.81.115.4">207.81.115.4</a> (talk) 21:52, 18 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>I think that that is better If people are having trouble understanding it, but the current image is fine just as a simple explnation. <a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPenguinSamurai64_7c0f.html" title="User:PenguinSamurai64">PenguinSamurai64</a> 23:50, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, much better. Any chance you can make it show which client initiates the connection, by (say) drawing a connection in several steps that make it longer? -<a href="../../../p/g/a/User%7EPgan002_fb49.html" title="User:Pgan002">Pgan002</a> 01:52, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It already shows that, to some degree. If you look closely at the ends of the lines, there are small arrows. There are also small "arrow ends" at the beginnings of the lines. I agree that it could be better, but I think it's good enough to get an idea of what's happening. <a href="../../../i/c/h/User%7EIChrisI_0a2e.html" title="User:IChrisI">IChrisI</a> (<a href="../../../i/c/h/User_talk%7EIChrisI_46cd.html" title="User talk:IChrisI">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_IChrisI_7165.html" title="Special:Contributions/IChrisI">C</a>) 00:47, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Slowing it down should help some but I think it would also help if the arrows were more obvious. I wasn't aware that the lines had arrows until I read it here. <a href="../../../c/e/r/User%7ECerevox_2f78.html" title="User:Cerevox">Cerevox</a> 04:18, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
