<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kumanovo dispute</span></h2>
<p>This is your only warning. If you revert to the copyvio again you will be blocked for 24 hours. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">freestylefrappe</a> 17:33, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bitola, what freestylefrappe is rather tersely saying is that you can't arbitrarily copy text from other sources and paste it into Wikipedia. Your contribution to an article needs to be either something you yourself wrote, or something you got explicit permission to insert -- otherwise you're violating the author's copyright. Glenn Willen (<a href="../../../g/l/e/User_talk%7EGlenn_Willen_5772.html" title="User talk:Glenn Willen">Talk</a>) 17:50, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Glenn, first of all the Freestylefrappe is not TERSELY saying, he has already blocked me without any warning. Have you seen his version of Kumanovo article? He is talking only about murdering, blood, terrorism and nothing about the city normal life. Of course, there were moments in the Kumanovo’s history when a terrorist attacks took place, but Kumanovo is most of the time a quiet ordinary Macedonian town that doesn’t deserve such descriptions. It is the same as if you write an article about London not mentioning St Paul’s catedral, Westminster, Tower bridge.. and writing only about recent terrorist attacks in the London underground. Talking about copyvios, I noticed that FreeStyleFrappe is using text written by Christopher Deliso.
<dl>
<dd>Bitola -- First of all, I understand your concerns about the articles. But please be careful how you use the word 'vandalism'. Freestylefrappe is making good-faith edits to add what he feels is useful information to articles. As a general rule, wholesale removal of information from an article is frowned upon on Wikipedia, no matter how much you don't think it belongs. Calling an article 'unacceptable' sounds like you believe you get to define what's OK in a Wikipedia article. No individual editor has that decision. Try to see things from his perspective here -- he's been adding what he thinks is useful information, and you've been removing it with basically no comment, and then adding copyright-violating (and thus illegal) material in its place. (As a sidenote, I wanted to write this first, but I'm still looking at the material he added to see if what you say is true. If some specific text of his is a copyvio, could you give me a more specific pointer, e.g. a link to a diff on wikipedia, and the first few words of the paragraph on the other site so I can find it more easily? I'll still look, but it'll be faster if you can show me.) Glenn Willen (<a href="../../../g/l/e/User_talk%7EGlenn_Willen_5772.html" title="User talk:Glenn Willen">Talk</a>) 18:44, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Glenn, it is not true that I’m removing FreeStyleFrappe’s additions all the time. You can simply check this if you visit the History tab on Kumanovo article. His “version” of the page and my info only appended to his info is commented with the following text: OK FreestyleFrappe, I will leave your "violence" texts, yet I'm not sure why it is so important to you to have only bombs, blood and killing in an article for a normal town like Kumanovo). I meant that the things were fine than, but on 8 December 2005 FreestyleFrappe again removed all my additions. I’m trying to understand that everybody has different view on the same thing, but still I cannot understand how somebody wants to describe Kumanovo with the following paragraphs: Econony, Violence, Narcotics!? Not to mention the following “FreestyleFrappe version” sentence: Also notable is the private practice "Otodent", located in Goce Delcev suburb, which offers different medical services like ENT and dentistry. The founder and the director is Dr. Milenko Trendafilovski. (you can simply check this on the current version of Kumanovo article) Does he know how many private dentistry services are present in Kumanovo? Is that npov? Just for your information, I’m now blocked user by his majesty FreestyleFrappe (just because I write similar comment as my first reply to you). Please understand that I’m normal citizen of Macedonia, I have many friends in Kumanovo, they live, study and work there and they are really surprised how his native town is described on Wikipedia.
<dl>
<dd>Bitola, there are two separate issues here. First of all, Wikipedia is hosted in the United States, and you should understand that using someone else's text without their permission is a violation of US law. That is what freestylefrappe means when he says "copyvio". So regardless of the status of his text about drugs and violence, yours can't be used by Wikipedia because you didn't write it. So if he didn't remove it, someone else would have had to do so. If you want to add facts about the town you can do that, but the writing has to be yours. As far as his contributions go, I would suggest you write (once you are unblocked) a comment on the article's talk page about them. Wikipedia is not a fast-paced place. It will hurt nobody if the article contains an offensive (to you) description of the town for a few days, or even weeks. Take some time to get other people to agree with you, and come up with some alternative to freestylefrappe's text. If the two of you just revert back and forth, you will argue forever and get nowhere. Again, I understand that the article may be offensive to you, but you will get it fixed more readily by discussion that by immediate action, which will just get reverted (especially if you are deleting lots of text -- Wikipedia frowns on deleting other people's writing.) Glenn Willen (<a href="../../../g/l/e/User_talk%7EGlenn_Willen_5772.html" title="User talk:Glenn Willen">Talk</a>) 20:00, 12 December 2005 (UTC) Oh, also (and I know you might not know the answer to this), do you know if there's any place that I can go to see that you're blocked, when it happened and who did it? (If Wikipedia gives you a page telling that you're blocked when you try to edit, that page might have a link you could send to me which would indicate how you were blocked and when.) Do you know why you were blocked -- did you edit the article after you were warned about copyright violation? (It doesn't look like it, so what did you do that caused him to decide to block you?)

<dd>Sorry, but I don’t know what are you talking about. My only bigger adds to the Republic of Macedonia article are these: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=32871872&amp;oldid=32867145" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=32871872&amp;oldid=32867145" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=32872572&amp;oldid=32872264" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=32872572&amp;oldid=32872264" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I added very little text and 3 pictures made by myself. I also did another edits after that, but that was done in order to incorporate the pictures in the article (these edits are marked with bolded “m” because are minor edits).My last edit was on 08:57, 28 December 2005 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=32978072&amp;oldid=32975169" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=32978072&amp;oldid=32975169" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Since then, I didn’t make any single new edit to the page! I know that the same day someone made a large input to the page using the following anonymous address:212.110.79.199 (If you doubt that I anonymously made these adds, please make any neccessary checks in order to verify that the anonymous address is different from the one I used before). I also noticed the large input to the page but I decided not to involve in the edit war. I just added the following observation on the article talk page:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=33013933&amp;oldid=33013879" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Republic_of_Macedonia&amp;diff=33013933&amp;oldid=33013879" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>

<dd>Thanks Rex. I really don’t know why some Greek editors are so hostile to the Greece neighboring countries, especially Macedonia and I fear we cannot change much about it. However, I hope they will eventually realize that their way of thinking is old-fashioned and that nobody (especially their neighbors) is their enemy.<a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitola_dffb.html" title="User:Bitola">Bitola</a> 16:09, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually they think that all countries in the Balkans except Greece are full of communist propaganda. I have been to Bitola and Lerin: while they speak Macedonian in Bitola and Greek in Lerin, the cities were very similar. They don't get that we are all the same and that under the Turks we <b>were</b> the same!

<h3><span class="mw-headline">How to link to sections</span></h3>
<p>In order to link to a section of a page, one inserts a hash sign and then the name of the section in the link. [[User talk:Bitola#Amazing photo of Ohrid]] will produce <a href="../../../b/i/t/User_talk%7EBitola_95bd.html#Amazing_photo_of_Ohrid" title="User talk:Bitola">User talk:Bitola#Amazing photo of Ohrid</a>. Clicking on that should take someone to the specific section. I've noticed, however, that this is not entirely reliable. It doesn't work at all in redirect pages, and sometimes fails on very long pages, at least on my browser. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 18:23, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wonder if I misunderstood what you were looking for. When one using "section editing" on an article, the name of the section automatically shows up in the edit summary. When I clicked on the "Edit" button next to <i>How to link to sections</i> here on your talk page, my Edit Summary box was immediately filled with "/* How to link to sections */". <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 19:11, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>it was nice reading your thought Bitola in the Talk:Macedonians page.u generally seem to have clear views...But i guess u have not found the 'real' reason for the dispute...most of the greeks do not really have a problem weather to consider FYROM been part of the geographical region of Macedonia,nor wheather its people would be called 'Macedonians' or not.the problem derives from the attempt to show that the ancient macedonians were not greeks.cause,although,as u said,there are historians who say that they were not,the majority of them have always said and say that they are.this is the real problem...i can call u however u like,IF u do not have demands from me...that's all.bye for now--<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 01:28, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
