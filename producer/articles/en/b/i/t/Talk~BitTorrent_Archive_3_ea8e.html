<p>BitTorrent uses TCP/IP as the underlying transport and network protocols. This is mentioned nowhere in the article. Neither are the default ports mentioned (e.g. 6969 for the tracker). I would add this information myself, but I don't know where to put it. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAragorn2_5642.html" title="User:Aragorn2">Aragorn2</a> 19:15, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. I came here looking to find out what ports this protocol uses - which seems a pretty basic piece of information for any internet protocl - and yet "port" appears nowhere in the article. A brief discussion of the technology seems appropriate. The article does point to <a href="http://www.dessent.net/btfaq/" class="external free" title="http://www.dessent.net/btfaq/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dessent.net/btfaq/</a> , which does discuss some of this stuff. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Mahoney_75d4.html" title="User:Jim Mahoney">Jim Mahoney</a> 01:05, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>BitTorrent may also use UDP, and port 80 may be used for the tracker port. -expert01 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.196.146.68 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.196.146.68_e458.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.196.146.68">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>Actually the protocol itself has no defined ports. The tracker url (with port) is specified in the .torrent file and the actual ports used by the clients are entirely arbitrary since they announce themselves to the tracker. So while it does use TCP there are no defiend ports. <a href="../../../j/p/e/User%7EJpettitt_4202.html" title="User:Jpettitt">Trapper</a> 19:21, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I have been trying for some time now to consolidate all information in piracy into one comprehensive article. Originally this was through significant additions to the article on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_infringement.html" title="Copyright infringement">copyright infringement</a>, but piracy lies somewhat beyond the scope of that article. I just discovered the article on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_infringement_of_software.html" title="Copyright infringement of software">copyright infringement of software</a>, and <a href="../../../v/c/d/VCD_peddler_0658.html" title="VCD peddler">VCD peddler</a> yesterday. As well, you can find significant discussions in the articles on <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bittorrent.html" title="Bittorrent">Bittorrent</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_104b.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a> and related articles. I was in the process of creating a <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrigueBlue_Piracy_%28information%29_08c1.html" title="User:IntrigueBlue/Piracy (information)">proposed article</a> in my user namespace to be at <b>Piracy (information)</b>, but in light of the widespread discussion of this issue I've realized that this is not something that I can do alone.</p>
<p>So, I'm asking for help, or at least discussion of ways to clear up the present situation. Please comment on the proposed article's <a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EIntrigueBlue_Piracy_%28information%29_a25a.html" title="User talk:IntrigueBlue/Piracy (information)">talk page</a>, so that we can keep discussion centralized... despite the insanity that attempts to cover this rather complex topic. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntrigueBlue_1722.html" title="User:IntrigueBlue">IntrigueBlue</a> 06:46, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I too think it's too long - perhaps time for a split.

<p>Clients incorporate mechanisms to optimize their download and upload rates, for example using a tit for tat scheme. Peers download pieces in a random order, to increase the opportunity to exchange data. This is both BS and ill worded. tit for tat brings up a battle strategy which is vastly unrelated to sharing, saying it uses a trading scheme is much better. Second, I know enough about the protocol to say that peers download baised on avaliability, if a particular section is only one one seeder then the primary effort of the protocol would be get that section onto other peers. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 131.247.242.76 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_131.247.242.76_2f1a.html" title="Special:Contributions/131.247.242.76">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Not you guys! But I knew I would get your attention. Do you think that if the owner of an intellectual property has pulled it from distribution due to having violated copyright in creating it (i.e. he created something that he cannot legally distribute), that wikipedia should mention in the article on the property that torrents are available? The torrent being illegal of course and against the stated wishes of the rights owner. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 19:21, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article says "BitTorrent transfers are typically very fast, because all nodes in a group concentrate on transferring a single file or collection of files." -- what is the comparison? I think few would dispute that a Bittorrent download is actually incredibly slow compared to a webserver. Indeed, it doesn't actually get "fast" until after a very long ramping period, and it doesn't stay "fast" up to the very end (speed ramps down to a crawl toward the end and it often says "ETA: 1 hour" for several hours straight). When its speed is actually measured objectively (total bytes / total time), even for the most well-seeded file, it's rarely fast at all. Furthermore, is it actually any faster than Kazaa or eMule or any other P2P platform? Is there any data to support this claim? And finally, the reasoning given for why it's supposedly fast doesn't make sense: nothing prevents nodes from participating in multiple simultaneous downloads, and thus this reasoning holds for BitTorrent no more than other P2P services. I'd propose a clarification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After a moderate ramping period, BitTorrent transfers of well-seeded files can achieve very high speeds, though this speed falls off toward the end of the transfer.</p>

<dd>Actually if a client implements the fast extensions (see bittorrent.org) it will start up much faster and if it's well designed will not slow at the end (that's a client issue not a protocol issue) <a href="../../../j/p/e/User%7EJpettitt_4202.html" title="User:Jpettitt">Trapper</a> 09:02, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, that's cool. However, "much faster" still isn't that fast. A good webserver (say, Akamai) "starts up" incredibly fast and remains that way all the way to the end of the file. It should be made clear that BitTorrent behaves in a very different way (ie, starts slow, ramps up to fast, and then falls off to slow again). <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuinthar_c810.html" title="User:Quinthar">Quinthar</a> 03:09, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no reason a P2P download can't be as fast or faster than a webserver. Given enough peers, you should be able to saturate any downlink. But really, while the cost-savings of BitTorrent and whether it would be possible to build a P2P network faster than a webserver are interesting topics, they're separate to my core point that BitTorrent is fundamentally slower than a good webserver, and the article should state as much. I think we agree on this point, and I haven't heard any dispute on this point, so I'm going to update the main article. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuinthar_c810.html" title="User:Quinthar">Quinthar</a> 20:23, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>cut from article: Though both ultimately transfer files over a network, BitTorrent differs from HTTP in several fundamental ways. First, BitTorrent makes many small P2P requests over different TCP sockets, while HTTP makes a single request over a single TCP socket. Second, the BitTorrent protocol limits a client's download speed to roughly its upload speed, while HTTP gives no preferential treatment to cooperative nodes. And third, BitTorrent downloads in a random or "rarest-first" approach that ensures high availability, while HTTP downloads in a contiguous manner. Taken together, BitTorrent achieves much lower cost, much higher redundancy, and much greater resistance to abuse or "flash crowds" than a regular HTTP server. However, this protection comes at a cost: downloads take time to ramp up to full speed because these many peer connections take time to establish, and it takes time for a node to get sufficient data to become an effective uploader. As such, a typical BitTorrent download will gradually ramp up to very high speeds, and then slowly ramp back down toward the end of the download. This contrasts with an HTTP server that, while more vulnerable to overload and abuse, ramps up to full speed very quickly and maintains this speed throughout. Furthermore, BitTorrent's non-contiguous download methods prevent it from supporting "progressive downloads" or "streaming playback", as is possible with HTTP.</p>
<dl>
<dd>removed this section. You can also use the http protocol to download a file from multiple mirrors in multiple pieces. Getright did this a long time ago. This confuses the client and the behaviour again. A comparison whit a traditional sequential download can be made, be it either ftp or http, but the current text is just not correct.&#160;:<a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuk_he_d36c.html" title="User:Leuk he">Leuk he</a> 12:06, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What specifically is incorrect, and how would you correct it? That's a fair point that it oversimplifies HTTP and discounts the possible use of Range-Requests for non-contiguous downloads. With this in mind, how about we clarify the first sentence with: "Though both ultimately transfer files over a network, a BitTorrent download differs <i>from a classic full-file HTTP request</i> in several fundamental ways." I've gone ahead and re-added the section with this and other clarifications. Rather than yanking it back out again, can you just correct it in place? <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuinthar_c810.html" title="User:Quinthar">Quinthar</a> 07:15, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree It might be time for a split. Maybe BitTorrent (protocol) can keep the introduction and headings 1, 2, a (very) small part of 3 (just note the fact that is is used that way), 5, 6, 7 and 8, and move the rest to something like BitTorrent legal issues. That page would require some work including a new introduction, and could include the headings I just left out.

<p>Supposedly, total down = total up. I've set up bittorrent for maybe 5 friends, and we all get 100-200 down, and 10-30 up. Why can't this article explain that? It's possible, but I seriously doubt for everyone like me, there's someone getting 10 down and 200 up. What's the deal?

<dl>
<dd>Though "total down = total up" is true across the whole network (after all, every byte received must have been sent by somebody), it won't necessarily be true for every individual download. In particular, if you join a torrent that has many seeds and few leachers, then most of the people you're connected to already have the file and don't need anything from you (thus the low upstream). However, if you join a torrent that has very few seeders and very many leachers, then all of your peers will want data back from you, and thus you'll find that "up = down" more regularly. Does this make sense? <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuinthar_c810.html" title="User:Quinthar">Quinthar</a> 23:41, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It makes sense, but I would like to learn about whoever is uploading way more than they download. Maybe the internet connections are different in Europe or Asia, where they can easily upload at speeds much greater than in the US. I've had experience with US dsl and cable modems, and if everyone had that type of connection, it seems the download would max out around 25. I guess I want to know where the bits are coming from, because they aren't coming from people like me with a comcast cable connection. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 00:07, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>It's common sense. There isn't a need for a legitimate source. In regards to bit torrent, there are two factors that will determine your upload speed. First, how fast your internet service provider will let you upload. Especially in the United States, your download will be much more faster than your upload. Charter, in my hometown for an example, allows a 400kB/s download, and a 30kB/s upload. Second, it depends on the amount of seeders/leechers. If your internet provider lets you upload at 1MB/s, but there's 1,000 seeders and only 2 leechers, the chances of you uploading at the full 1MB/s is very unlikely, unless you're the only individual connected to the leecher. This article need not explain bandwidth limitations, because that isn't what it is about. It's about a form of downloading. The situation your describing isn't uncommon. Look into your internet service provider, and find out the information on the bandwidth services they provide. That will hold the key to your answer. <a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBleu%60dove_15ca.html" title="User:Bleu`dove">Bleu`dove</a> 01:29, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Think of the total torrent swarm as a large pool that has bits added to it by every participant and bits taken out of it by every downloader. In theory you could have a case where all participants have exactly one piece of the file and everybody will end up with all of the file - in that case the average download will equal the average upload. However in real life there are often many clients who have completed their download and are just uploading (seeds) - those clients contribute bits to the pool but don't consume so the average upload rate is higher. Things get confused further by the heuristics of some clinets (such as the official BitTorrent client) which when seeding tend to favor peers that can download fast. Modeling the behavior is further complicated by the fact that many users have asymetric connnections (*cable, adsl) and are often downloading multiple torrents. All of these effects interact to create a very complex model. The math get realy interesting really fast. <a href="../../../j/p/e/User%7EJpettitt_4202.html" title="User:Jpettitt">Trapper</a> 06:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm pretty certain there's nothing anywhere that demands the torrent file be named anything in particular.

<p>The first reference, cited in the opening paragraph in support of "CableLabs...believes that BitTorrent represents 55% of the upstream traffic on the cable company's access network", actually says:</p>

<p>and is refering to a simulation based on a small sample of BitTorrent behavior. It is not an actual traffic measurement as is implied, and my reading is that the "10 BitTorrent users...per neighborhood node" is pure supposition - if the actual number of users is unknown, the simulation does not reveal the extent to which links will be saturated. Surely someone must have some up-to-date measured figures - even if it is only from one typical ISP?

<p>Today the 18% number in the article was changed to 18% carries the bittorrent files to initiate. The above source looks indeed like it is only the bittorrent files. Unfortunately, the source is not very clear on it. I hope someone can fish up the actual paper to check what it says exactly, and we'll be out of this pickle for a while. I won't change it straight away, but I propose a change to "the estimates on the amount of bandwith used range between 18% and 55%" or something similar, untill someone finds the paper itself. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartijn_Hoekstra_7825.html" title="User:Martijn Hoekstra">Martijn Hoekstra</a> 19:58, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
