<p><b>The History of Bitton Gloucestershire - Including Upton Cheyney - Swineford - Kelston</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bristolhistory.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.bristolhistory.com/" rel="nofollow">Memories of Bitton Gloucestershire England</a></p>
<p>Bitton is the most extensive parish in the rural district. Bitton covers the whole south eastern area, bounded by the River Avon in the south and Siston Brook on the west and north.</p>
<p>It lies on the northern border of Somerset. The River Boyd wends its way through the Parish and creates the beautiful Golden Valley; the village takes its name from the river, being originally Boyd Town. Present day engineering has altered the bed of the river owing to flooding in the village in 1968.</p>
<p>Bitton village stands on the ‘Via Julia’, which was the old Roman road from Bath to the Severn. Originally the parish extended to Hanham and included Kingswood Forest, where dwelt the infamous ‘Cock Road Gang’ during past generations.</p>
<p>Many parishes have been developed from this original and now Bitton South appears to be the most rural. Its always been an important place many people can trace their roots back to this village. The beautiful Parish Church which lies to the south of the village is well worth a visit, it is a known landmark for the surrounding countryside. Entering the Church a visitor realises its beauty with its exceptionally long aisle and timbered roof. Incidentally, this roof is made of timber from a shipwreck in the Bristol Channel during the incumbency of Canon Ellacombe.</p>
<p>The history of Bitton can be traced to the time of the Roman occupation being, as it was, an important crossing point of the River Boyd.</p>
<p>Although a limited amount of scholarly narration has been written about the area, very little social history has been recorded let alone kept.</p>
<p>However, during 1895 a day visit was made to the local paper mill which had originally started out around 1705 as part of John Champion’s brass mill enterprise, where pans and dishes were beaten out of brass plate by tilt hammers powered by the River Boyd, which had been dammed to create a regulated supply of power. Sometime during the early 1830’s, the fashioning of brass plate came to an end on this site, and the premises were purchased by Thomas Beavan and it was he who converted them into a paper mill.</p>
<p>After a disastrous fire in 1849, Beavan sold out to the Sommerville’s, who are believed to have originated from Scotland, as at that time two Scottish brothers named Torrance set up a millwright business near the mill and were contracted to repair and maintain the equipment in the mill.</p>
<p>Although another serious fire occurred during 1875, the mill was rebuilt and enlarged, and set out below is a description of that visit in 1895:</p>
<p>Having followed the high road over Kelston from Bath we arrived in the middle of the village with a turning to our right taking us to the celebrated paper mills and the Golden Valley beyond.</p>
<p>The building itself is very graceful, and being situated alongside the picturesque Boyd brook, it is difficult to conceive that there is such a busy hive of industry inside. Thanks to the kindness of Mr. W. Sommerville I spent a very enjoyable hour going over the factory and seeing the paper made in all its stages.</p>
<p>Paper being one of my useful servants, it was all the more interesting to me, especially as cartridge and writing paper are both manufactured here. First of all I went into the rag store roam, in which are a large number of bales from floor to ceiling.</p>
<p>Adjoining this was the room containing Spanish esparto grass, obtained from Carthagena, Tunis and other places. This grass is mixed with rags.</p>
<p>Another material now used for the better quality of paper is the wood pulp brought from Norway. Then we went to the boiler roam, and steam boilers were at work, consuming from 200 to 300 tons of coal per week.</p>
<p>Our next visit was to the rag-cutting room, where a number of young girls were engaged in cutting. In front of each girl is a broad, curved knife like the pointed end of a scythe.</p>
<p>The rag is then drawn sharply across the bottom of the blade several times, which shakes out much of the dust. She then places the rag across the upper end of the blade and rips it into long shreds.</p>
<p>The shredded rags are then placed into the hands of sorters whose duty is to classify them.</p>
<p>We next went in to the "duster", or as it is commonly known "the devil", which is a long cylinder of network and as it revolves throws the rags about and practically sweeps them clean, or comparatively so.</p>
<p>Having gone through this process, rags which had previously been separated between linen and cotton, are put into three immense oblong sphencal boilers, together with a good deal of soda ash and caustic, with each of the boilers holding a ton of rags.</p>
<p>The separation is necessary due to the fact that the linen rags require a much more active treatment in the boiler than the cotton; in addition an independent boiler is kept for the esparto grass.</p>
<p>The rags are then boiled by steam in a revolving drum for about twelve hours, after which time the rags are rinsed in a long perforated machine tuming in a bed of water.</p>
<p>From here the rags are put into an iron trough called a washing engine or breaker, containing a revolving set of steel knives which work in conjunction with knives fixed to the bottom of the trough to gently tear the rags into shreds and ultimately into pulp.</p>
<p>In the same trough is a cylinder covered with wire, which scoops out the dirty water at one end whilst the clean water enters at the other.</p>
<p>This process of washing lasts about two hours, when the pulp is emptied into another container and mixed with chloride of lime to thoroughly bleach it, before being returned to the washing engine.</p>
<p>On this occasion, the pulp is reduced to the proper length of fibre to make paper and then emptied into large vats, having been sieved through finely cut brass plates to take out any knots, dirt or other impurities.</p>
<p>The paper making room is, by far, the most interesting, but possibly the most difficult to describe. The pulp descends in a regular stream through pipes, and is directed upon a mould about 10 feet in length, and is capable, by an ingenious mechanical arrangement, of receiving sufficient pulp to make paper a maximum of 70 inches in width, or as narrow as merchants desire.</p>
<p>A "deckle strap" - an endless band of vulcanised india rubber, which, being held down by rollers forms a sort of never-ending boundary - marks the limits beyond which the liquid pulp cannot flow.</p>
<p>The mould itself consists of an endless web of fine wire cloth, which is constantly moving forward above a series of revolving rollers, while a vibratory motion from side to side is given to it in order to distribute the fluid evenly, and thoroughly mix the fibrous textures.</p>
<p>Travelling at the rate of about 70 feet per minute, the water is continually drained from the pulp to become an absorbent paper by the time that it reaches the first pair of rollers.</p>
<p>At this point, the paper is impressed with a water-mark, and is then sized, before being rolled on to the drying machine. Once dried, the paper is taken into the cutting room to be cut to size.</p>
<p>The "Salle" is the last stage where employees, called "runners down" are engaged in making a final examination sheet by sheet; the worst being discarded and re-made into paper, the remainder being divided into first and second quality.</p>
<p>The paper is then glazed, folded and packed. From six o’clock on Monday morning to six o’clock on Saturday evening, the machinery is at work day and night, with around 450 men and women kept in constant employment.</p>
<p>At the time of the visit the mill was owned by William Sommerville, but was transferred to the King-Smith family around 1900.</p>
<p>Thirty years later the business was formed into a limited company and became known as the Golden Valley Paper Mills, operating through to closure during the 1960’s. For a number of years until 1932, the mills generated the electricity supply for the village.</p>
<p>Unlike today, Bitton used to be an important working area, with coal having been mined for hundreds of years; the brass/paper mill as described, plus the development of the village smithy into a substantial foundry business known as Bush and Wilton, plus the manufacture of furniture by the Caisley company.</p>
<p>It is said that history is all around us and a village walk will enable the reader to find Church Farm, the original manor house built around 1286; the Grange, part of many manors in Gloucestershire transferred as part of a bribe from the Abbot of Westminster to Thomas Seymour, brother of Jane who married Henry VIII and was the mother of Edward VI.</p>
<p>The there is Meadow Farm, built with money levied to skate on the adjoining flooded common land. Whilst in the High Street is an eighteenth century property once the village Poor House, adjoining the pin factory, where the local paupers would twist fine wire around a rod and, after removing the wire coil, it was, together with many others placed in an iron ladle, put over an open fire until red hot, before being plunged into a bucket of cold water, the pin heads were individually placed into a pin block, then with the use of levers and heavy weights the head was crushed onto the pin shank.</p>
<p>Although today few people give mass-produced pins a second thought, previously, pins were regarded as an item of luxury available only to the wealthy where it became the custom for gentlemen to give the ladies of the household, money specifically for the purpose of purchasing pins, a custom which ultimately led to the expression used by those who are trying to gather a little extra money for themselves as "pin money".</p>
<p>To the left is a smaller property once the village constables house with attached lockup. Moving towards Willsbridge and down a narrow lane is Fieldgrove Farm, built for Francis Harrington around 1585.</p>
<p>Further along the main road is the hamlet of Willsbridge split into two halves by the Keynsham Road. In the middle of this junction there once stood the old turnpike gate house, which was subsequently converted into a shop, an off licence, and a ladies hairdressing salon.</p>
<p>There are some splendid houses along the road to Keynsham including Londonderry Farm, a Queen Anne style house, whilst back at the junction is the site of Willsbridge Wharf where once coal wagons and their contents were sorted and graded for onward shipment by barge to Bristol or Bath, having been brought along the dramway through the nearby tunnel, (used as an air-raid shelter during the war).</p>
<p>The journey then continues up the hill to Willsbridge House, built around 1730 for John Pearsall.</p>

<p>A fund had been opened to build a gallery in Bitton Church. Numerous people contributed, a few of whom are listed below: Richard Barry, the vicar - Berkeley Seymour, esquire Thomas Coster, esquire - William Edwards, esquire Thomas Winstone, esquire - Richard Hart, esquire Henry Creswick, esquire - Mr Ones. Tyndal Mr Thomas Whittington - Mr Edward Parker Mr Benjamin Perrott each of these contributed a guinea.</p>
<p>Among the ten shilling contributors were Mr William Atkins &amp; Mr Thomas Ross, the churchwardens, and Mrs Mary Wear. At five shillings, there are some well known names: Mr Lamorack Flower, Mr Samuel Whittock, Mr Joseph Whittock, Mr Samuel Tippett, Mr Francis Tippett, Mrs Woodward.</p>
<p>Further down still are tradesmen, without any handle to their names, donating 3s 6d, among then Abraham Battman and Jonathon Robbins. A great many more gave half a crown each including Henry Brain, Moses Strange the younger, and John Taylor, the smith. Another smith, William Atkins, also gave 2 shillings. (It is intriguing that the two smiths are the only people whose occupation was stated.)</p>
<p>Among the shilling contributors were John Smith of the Way House and Nathaniel Williams of the Common. Those who threw sixpence into the hat included Chappells, tovells, Leonards, Brains and Peacocks,and Ruddle. The work commenced in July, and it is amusing to note that a few of the contributors saw a return for their money. William Atkins did some work, as did Abraham Battman, who worked 21 days at 8d per day, and also put in a bill for �2 16s 6d for "Work and timber for the gallery". Jonathon Robbins did 22 days, also at 8d a day, and "his man" worked another 15 days.</p>
<p>Samuel Brooks and William Lydiard, five shilling contributors likewise profited, Brooks charged 14s 6d for "turning the Ballisters for the Gallery" and Lydiard fifteen shillings for writing a letter for the church. Out of pocket was Thomas Gunning, who gave five shillings but only made two shillings "for hauling freestone from Lansdown.</p>

<p>Settlement Examination, Bitton: Benjamin Summerill, aged about 35 years saith that as his parents told him, was born in Bitton where he lived until he was three and twenty years of age and served his apprenticeship to his father Stephen Summerill of Bitton, felt-maker, and about twelve years since he was lawfully married to his present wife Mary in the parish of Doynton, by whom he hath now living four children,</p>
<p>Mary aged about 11 years, Sarah about 8 years, Benjamin about 4 years and Hannah aged about two years. About seven years since he and his wife Mary went and lived in the parish of Bustleton, alias Brislington, in the County of Somerset where he occupied for �15 a year for 5 years and one half successively, money there which he had in the right of his wife and the other half he paid rent for.</p>
<p>At the same time for one year he rented an estate of Sir William Cann, Baronet, in the same parish of �9 a year, and further saith he paid taxes for the �15 a year, and served as Surveyor of the Highways in Brislington and that about three years since he came and resided in Bitton, since which he sold his right to the estate at Brislington and brought the sum of �40 into the said parish, it being part of the money that he received for the estate.</p>
<p>Sworn before Henry Creswicke and Richard Hart and signed Benjamin He would have rued the day he left Brislington, for there there was a sorry sequel to the above: in an undated note in the Ellacombe Manuscripts, we read: "Harrington Davis conveyed Benjamin and Stephen Summerill to Gloucester Gaol, at a cost of �4 - expenses to be divided equally between Oldland and Bitton." Worse would follow in 1737.</p>

<p>The Assizes at Gloucester, and Benjamin and Stephen Summerill were found guilty of the theft of 11 dozen hats. They were transported for life to the plantations of Virginia. Benjamin Summerill was baptised at Bitton in 1702, the son of Stephen Summerill. He married Mary Little at Doynton in 1723.</p>
<p>Although, he had a brother, also called Stephen, seven years his senior, it appears to be father and son who were transported, for it is known that Stephen junior who joined the army appeared again later. Their fate at hard labour in the colony is unknown. Benjamin Summerill junior, son and grandson of Benjamin and Stephen, who was referred to in his father's settlement examination of 1736, returned to Brislington where he was put out as a pauper apprentice. In time, like his uncle, he joined the army, and deserted his family. The sad wanderings of his wife and children are chronicled in Brislington Bulletins Number 4.</p>

<p>Ann, the wife of Charles Brooks died aged 68 and was buried at Bitton. On her tombstone were the words "They lived 44 Years a Married Life" 'considered a remarkable achievement in those days of high mortality. Charles survived her twenty years, and was buried in the same grave aged 86. Cennick's group continued their alfresco meetings, and the following year, during a mission to Wiltshire, they were attacked in a field belonging to a Farmer Lee at Foxham.</p>
<p>One of Lee's workmen who enthusiastically joined the fray, Cennick tells us, was later condemned for horse stealing. Cennick went to see him in prison, where "He damned himself to Hell for disturbing us. I said 'My dear Man. You should not curse so. You don't know what it is to go to Hell.' He said 'I want to go there that I may call Old Burges to account,</p>
<p>Who cheated me before he died. But I heard before he was executed he became very sorry and altered his mind." (One of Cennick's chief concerns was "the widespread indifference to the terrors of sin", and he was mainly interested in saving this man's soul. It never occurred to him to question whether death was a suitable punishment for the theft of a horse.)</p>
<p>Like the unnamed horse thief, many others who spoke out or acted against the group were, according to Cennick, struck down in various ways, though it might be pointed out this was scarcely a Christian attitude. Farmer Lee of Foxham was, Cennick writes "a wealthy man, but several of his best horses died, his swine were bitten by a mad dog, and all things made against him until he was ruined and obliged to abscond." And in a final irony: "His house fell into the brethren's hands." In more Divine retribution four men were said to have expired from nosebleeds.</p>
<p>One of them, Sylvester Keene, bled until "his bowels corrupted, and so he ended his life cursing those who had encouraged him to meddle with us." Another man died a lingering death after falling from his horse which stumbled when a gun accidentally discharged.</p>
<p>As his relatives could not agree who was responsible for the funeral arrangements, he was left unburied, "until the stench grew too much." Charles Gay, a tailor and Thomas Perry, a breeches maker, "narrowly escaped the gallows", and Thomas Locker, a soap-boiler and Thomas Holliday, a labourer, were publicly whipped for stealing fowls.</p>
<p>In July, a Mr Hollis, arriving for work with his hay-makers at Segry, was not best pleased to find the field occupied and a prayer meeting in full swing. An altercation ensued and Mr Hollis "cursed me and my doctrines exceedingly, and while he continued to blaspheme, he sank down, and was carried to his house deprived of the use of his limbs, and there he recovered no more until he died", in November.</p>
<p>(Some of these "plagues of Egypt" must surely have been exaggerated and passed on to Cennick by those eager to win his approval.) As a magistrate, Henry Creswicke dealt with all manner of petty crime, both on the bench at Lawford's Gate and nearer to home at Bitton.</p>
<p>During this year, a woman variously known as Ruth Phipps, Beard, or Weston came to see him, and told an extraordinary story. She said that about eleven years before, she was married to Henry Beard, otherwise Weston, at Bitton church, and he was her first and only husband. Shortly afterwards, her husband SOLD her to a collier called Nicholas Reed, of Hanham.</p>
<p>They went off together to Bath, where they went through a bigamous marriage ceremony conducted by "a lawless minister", a Parson Grey. She had lived with Nicholas until he died, three years ago last May, but was now very poor and unable to maintain herself, "and the inevitable must happen unless she is relieved." Henry's judgement has unfortunately not survived.</p>

<p>Berkeley Seymour who was murdered by his brother William was buried at Bitton on this day. The circumstances were related many years later to the Reverend Ellacombe at Bitton: "Robert Newman of Oldland Common told me this day, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_24.html" title="November 24">November 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/2/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a> that he perfectly remembers the murder at the Parsonage when William Seymour murdered his brother he saw the corpse lying in a room there, one shot hole on one side and two on the other side of his body produced by two bullets.</p>
<p>Berkeley had sold some oxen in Bristol and returned home with the money. William shot him in his bed and afterwards he and his brother scuffled with each other in the bedroom and the adjoining large room where he fell and died. He saw blood and brains about the large room. William then robbed his pockets and rode off to Bristol, and to pay for something he needed, he rendered a guinea with a hole in it, that afterwards the person who bought the oxen swore to having paid with that holey guinea among others which proved him guilty.</p>
<p>That Berkeley Seymour was a steady man, about 25 to 30 years old. That William was a drunken, idle fellow about 40 or 50, that William had one illegitimate child by Sarah Bright, the clerk's daughter, and that this child, a boy, was always called Seymour and worked at the Swineford Copper Mills. A Miss Seymour lived with her two brothers. Before the murder she married a Mr Padmore or Padmer. There was another brother John who kept the Swan Inn at Swineford and before that an Inn at Stouts Hill where he was a sort of horse jockey. Another brother, Edward, was a freestone mason who lived and died in Bath. He believes the daughter was the youngest and that her name was Martha. He knows nothing of Colonel Seymour or the father of the murderer.</p>
<p>According to another account, William's escape was impeded by a hard frost, and his horse�s hooves slipped around so much that he was obliged to knock up a blacksmith to rough the horseshoes. He paid the man with a guinea which had a hole in it. The Seymours had once been one of the "Great" families of Bitton, and were believed descended from Edward Seymour, brother of Jane Seymour, the third wife of Henry VIII, and Lord Protector of England During the reign of the boy king Edward VI until he was executed in 1552. It has proved an impossible task both for Reverend Ellacombe and for me to fit the Parsonage family on to the grand Family Tree of the Seymours, hence the allusion to Colonel Seymour, a noted soldier.</p>
<p>As neither of the brothers appear to have been baptised at Bitton, Mr Newman's account is helpful in establishing their approximate dates of birth: Berkeley born 1712 -1717? William born 1692-1702? Although the Parsonage where they lived was rated highest in Bitton, the impression is that they had declined financially.</p>
<p>Braine makes much of the Seymours in The History of Kingswood Forest, but fails to mention the murder. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">1 April</a>, William Seymour was executed and "persisted his innocence till the last". He was buried at Bitton - "under the Communion Table in an old vault there" and apparently beside his brother, according to "Old John Holbin" another of Ellacombe's informants.</p>

<p>Settlement Examination of "Sarah Morris, now residing in Bitton, widow or wife of James Morris, late of St Philip and St Jacob's in Bristol. This informant saith that about fourteen days before Christmas last, near ten years since, she was married to her late husband, James Morris, of Wick and Abson, horsedriver at a Publick House going down the Hill into Bath but cannot remember the sign by a person unknown to her, but who she believes was the person that kept the Publick House, that said person reading over that part of the ceremony used in the Church of England which relates to the man's taking the woman to wife and the woman's taking the man to her husband, and this informant and her said husband made the usual answers thereto and also the ceremony with the ring was performed betwixt her and her said husband immediately after she returned to her place of residence and her husband went elsewhere, but about fourteen days after, they co-habited as man and wife, and lay together as such several nights.</p>

<p>Bitton turnpike was blown up with gunpowder taken from the coalworks, and the Somerset people, farmers and colliers, were greatly relieved by this apparent solidarity with their cause. It was also put about that the Kingswood men had promised to rescue the prisoners who were in Newgate.</p>
<p>For the most part however, Kingswood had little heart for an affair in which it was not directly involved, and action was left to a very small, but violently persuasive minority who "went to the Cupola's and oblig'd all the workmen they could lay hands on to join them. They did the like from Coal-work to Coal-work and from house to house round the country for some miles. Those who were at work under Ground and refus'd joining them were compelled to it, by being threaten'd to have their Ropes cut and the Pitts fill'd over their Heads" - after which they went to their old favourite Turnpike at Toghill, and chopped it down. A party which went over to Brislington to gather support was sent packing by the "respectable colliers" there.</p>

<p>The champions Milsom and Maggs were growing old and their title days were long gone. In 1714, a new star emerged, Benjamin Brain, born Bitton in 1756. Six feet four and weighing 16 stone, he was known to all as Big Ben" (the clock was named after him!). A Kingswood coalminer, he won his first battle against his fellow collier, Bob Harris. He went on to defeat Clayton the Shropshire champion. He became Champion of England in 1791. He died suddenly in 1794 when in training for a fight against Will Wood. He was said to be a mild good-looking fellow who never let a day go by without reading his Bible.</p>

<p>"Died Samuel Webb, esquire, of Beach Farm in Bitton Parish - late of the Corporate. Body of the City of Bristol, within the compass of three days from the death of his wife; an honest man and a useful citizen. The frequent infirmities of his body and consequential avocations of mind subjected him to immeasurable calamity not unknown in the mercantile -world. The latter years of his life (from a principle of being serviceable to mankind in general and the Navy in particular to which. he was bred) he employed in the arduous task of finding the longitude, an undertaking to which he approved himself not unequal. He died with the pleasing consciousness that his generous creditors- would not be involved in the misfortune which fell on himself alone".</p>
<p>Below is the- obituary of his wife Ann aged 73, who he barely survived, a truly just, amiable and good woman; honoured and respected in life and very sincerely lamented. Ann was formerly Miss Weare, descended from the Weares of Dyrham, from whom were drawn council members, Merchant Venturers and a Mayor of Bristol. Samuel, himself a former Sheriff, of Bristol, became bankrupt. Beach Farm was heavily mortgaged to Samuel Peach, a wealthy merchant and father in law to Bristol's Whig M.P., the New Yorker, Henry Cruger. The unravelling of Samuel's affairs was still being attempted on New Year's Eve 1785 when creditors were summed to a meeting in the Rummer Tavern in Bristol. Ann Webb's will is fiercely protective of her husband, who had evidently withdrawn from business affairs into an arcane world of his own.</p>

<p>1787</p>
<p>16th April</p>
<p>Nineteen years old Joseph Fry and Samuel Ward, aged 20, lay fettered in Gloucester Gaol under sentence of death. Said the Gloucester Journal: "They are part of the Cock Road Gang, formerly headed by the noted Cayford who was hanged at Oxford. There are twelve more of this gang left. They hold the neighbourhood in so much dread that people there are accustomed to hand over annual bounty of 10s 6d or 5s 0d to avoid their felonious attentions. In the hut where dwelt the family of the Frys, a cave was discovered which was entered by a trap door and here the father used to conceal the sons when any search was made for them."</p>
<p>This protection racket scam (also quoted in Bristol Gazette] was quite different from the original indictment which, as we have seen, was burglary at the premises of Messrs Williams and Gibbs. Perhaps these two householders had bravely declined to pay their "insurance ~ The Gloucester Journal report is remarkable in several ways. It gave birth to the legend of "The Cock Road Gang" which endured through necessarily changing, though never formal, membership all the way up to the 1850s. There had been groups in Kingswood certainly since the beginning of the 18th century, some criminal, some engaging in political protest and the two are often confused, but this is the first time, as far as I am aware, that a collective name was coined, and I believe it was conjured by our reporter himself as ginger to his story.</p>
<p>Secondly, he goes on, sensationally, to say that the execution of Fry and Yard ' there was evidently no hope of a reprieve ' would make the number of persons from the parish of Bitton who had died on the gallows within the last three years up to ten. The "ten within three years~ quotation, unattributed, but used by both Ellacombe (History of Bitton) and Braine, (History of Kingswood Forest) is dutifully trotted out every time any material is published on the subject of criminality at Kingswood, the majority of which crimes, I need not point out, would rate hardly a mention- in modern times. I would be grateful indeed if anybody can supply the ten names. Of the local men who had been executed within the previous three years, I know only James Bryant, 1783, George Ward &amp; Benjamin Webb, 1784, who together with Joseph Fry and Samuel Ward make five.</p>
<p>Kitley and Blancher were sentenced in 1783, but Kitley died in gaol of natural causes and Blancher was reprieved. Stallard's execution was outside the time limit, and Mangotsfield is not Bitton. John Jenkins had not yet been hanged and in any case cannot have been known to the Gloucester Journal's reporter. Reverend Henry Ellacombe, vicar of Bitton, from scribbled notes left in his "manuscripts", evidently agonised over the infamous ten and failed to solve the mystery, yet could not resist including the newspaper's exciting version in his 'History without coming clean about his doubts. It has to be remembered that Ellacombe�s notes are not contemporaneous with the newspaper report and were made more than thirty years later.</p>
<p>He did not become curate of Bitton until 1817 and was not born locally. His evidence is from the memories of his parishioners, which like all our memories are faulty and selective. The remembrance that Webb or Kayford's son had only one arm is typical. The jottings read: "George Dagger alias Ward (crossed out) John Ward hanged with Jack Dagger alias Benjamin Kayford for robbing at Mr Walker's new budget at Glos. Benjamin Webb or Kayford (father of one arm men). George Ward or Dagger Joseph Fry a cram hand at Glos. George Fry Samuel Dagger and Jack Toby for robbing at Glos. Whiting."</p>
<p>If these are counted separately they do indeed make ten persons. However, the use of numerous aliases seem to mean that some of the men were counted twice if this is taken as the source. For instance, Benjamin Webb and Benjamin Kayford, the noted Cayford, hanged at Oxford" of the newspaper report are apparently the same man.</p>
<p>All the Wards seem to have had the nickname "Dagger" as far back as 1781 and it is possible that "Samuel Dagger and Jack Toby" refer to John Ward alias Jack Dagger, and John Read, alias Toby, indeed hanged at Gloucester for robbery. John and George Ward have been totally confused. George Fry, brother of Joseph, despite being listed appears to have been acquitted of the burglary and freed. He may ironically, have been the same George Fry, killed in a pit at Mangotsfield in 1789. It is worth noting that Ellacombe records Joseph Fry was "a scram hand" or a left handed person.</p>
<p>Left handedness (eg sinister!) was long considered to denote criminal tendencies, though undoubtedly all the rest were right handed which surely defeats any scientific theory on the subject! Mark Whiting, who appears in Ellacombe's Jottings has no place amongst the rest. His tragedy was In a different era, forty years later. Our imaginative newspaper hack would have been pleased to know that brains were being racked concerning his excesses two centuries after his story first appeared. There is just one more possibility that he was not an embroiderer at all.</p>
<p>The original report specifies "persons" which means both men and women. Could the remainder of Bitton�s infamous ten have been women? Desperate "criminals" driven perhaps to infanticide by the mores of the times like those in 1794? Alas in 1786 there is no coroner's book to help us.</p>
<p>The next week our reporter is still in deepest purple, covering the mass execution of no less than nine men, (first names omitted): Crew, Chapman, already wearing his shroud, Matthews and Alloway in the first cart and in the second Whittick, Fry, Ward, Russ and Davis, It was thought that more than 10,000 people from about twenty miles around witnessed the grotesquerie at the scaffold when the two carts were set in motion simultaneously and whereupon the poor wretches fell, the whole crowd seemed with one content to utter a groan of commiseration. Just as the malefactors were turned off, two strong flashes of lightning burst from a cloud attended by thunder.</p>
<p>1788</p>
<p>25th April</p>
<p>Sarah Elwes, the wife of the vicar and Henry Creswicke's daughter was buried at Bitton.</p>
<p>1789</p>
<p>4th October</p>
<p>Betty Wilkins, a servant of Mr G. Robbins, miller of Willsbridge died in suspicious circumstances. The coroner was called and her body was opened. There was as expected, a large quantity of arsenic in her stomach. She was also pregnant. Although a married woman, she had not lived with her husband for sometime and being pregnant as supposed to some other man it is thought that was the cause of her committing this rash act."</p>
<p>The verdict was "feb de se" - that is "self-murder" and she was ordered to be buried not in the consecrated ground of the churchyard but at the cross roads. (not known) (Presumably with a stake driven through her heart. It is worth comparing Betty's terrified solution with those of other women similarly placed in a society where unwanted pregnancy was "a fate worse than death.)</p>
<p>20th December</p>
<p>Another of the same: "I Samuel Rogers, collier of the parish of Bitton have been afflicted with the Dropsy for seven years, a little by degrees and it hath swelled all over my body. I tried several Gentlemen of the Faculty for relief without success but seeing of Doctor Brunswick's arrival in Bristol, I applied to him and in four weeks he made a perfect cure of me without Tapping, bringing the Swelling down by internal medicines only. The truth of the above may be known by applying to me or any other person in Bitton, the place where I live. The mark X of Samuel Rogers, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">March 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/8/1788.html" title="1788">1788</a>."</p>
<p>1792</p>
<p>17th January</p>
<p>On this day, Benjamin Brain, a Kingswood collier became champion of the English Prize Ring by beating the holder Tom Johnson at Wrotham in Kent. Ben, the son of Aaron Brain was christened at Bitton on 28th November 1756. Known as 'Big Ben ' and sufficiently famous for his surname to be dropped altogether ' he was of relatively moderate size by today's standards, being 5 feet eleven inches tall and weighing 14 stones.</p>
<p>He was 'a mild good looking fellow, sociable in his demeanour, never presuming on his qualities as a boxer" and who "never let a day go by without reading his Bible". In 1774 he beat Bob Harris, his fellow collier, the champion of Kingswood and then Jack Clayton, the Shropshire Champion. Success followed on success and in 1786 he triumphed over Ned Boone, "the fighting Grenadier"; in 1788, overcame Corbally, the Irish Champion and the next year Jack Jacombs succumbed at Banbury. He came to the notice of the Prince of Wales, later George IV when he beat Tom Tring, a 17 stone porter at Carlton House.</p>
<p>The prince lost heavily on the fight. Ben's next bout was a farce. He put down Bill Hooper in the first round, though Hooper was able to stagger to his knees. Whenever Ben moved towards him, he sank down to a squatting position. His orders were to save the fight under any circumstances! This nonsense continued over three and a half hours and because in those days fights had to conclude with a knock out of either man, the match was eventually judged a draw! Even with this setback, "the Fancy" had spied a worthy challenger to the Champion of England, Tom Johnson and a match was made with Ben sponsored by the Duke of Hamilton. About 20,000 people surged round the open air raised platform. A mighty roar went up as the protagonists entered the ring, with the Duke, in Ben's corner, splendidly clad in Russian sables.</p>
<p>They were evenly matched as to height and weight, though at 38, Ben was the elder by six years. Challenger knocked down champion in the first and second but in the third round, was put down himself. The slogging continued, blow for blow until the 18th when a final punch from Ben knocked the champion senseless. A few days later, showing that he had not become over proud, he acted as a second in a bout between Ward and Mendoza. So the championship came to Bristol where it would remain for eighteen years.</p>
<p>(Henry Pearce, Jem Belcher, Tom Cribb and John Gully were all born in or around Bristol). Ben Brain rested on his laurels after his bout with Johnson for lack of a challenger but was coaxed out of retirement to fight William Wood. The fight was cancelled due to Ben's illness and he died on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_8.html" title="April 8">April 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/9/1794.html" title="1794">1794</a>, still undefeated. It is tempting to wonder whether another famous "Big Ben was named after Kingswood's modest and unassuming champion!</p>
<p>22nd January</p>
<p>Two bodies were found in a Bitton field, a man and a boy, supposed drowned by the sudden overflowing of the River Avon.</p>
<p>1795</p>
<p>11th January</p>
<p>"On Saturday last as several boys were at play round the mouth of a coalpit at Bitton, where they were roasting crab apples, one William Bush ran away with one of the apples which did not belong to him and the other boys pursuing him with such velocity that be fell into the pit and lived only four hours after he was taken out." and on the same day: "A few days ago, a man in the same parish and near the same place on receiving a skip of coal, fell 42 yards perpendicular and was instantly killed."</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">15 March</a></p>
<p>Was reported on this day the marriage of the widowed vicar of Bitton, Rev Mr Elwes to Mrs Naylor of Park Street, Bristol, the widow of Mr John Naylor "an eminent distiller of this City".</p>
<p>1796</p>
<p>7th February</p>
<p>The workshop of William Bateman, a Bitton carpenter caught fire and was entirely destroyed, along with working tools, chair, table, bedsteads, mahogany etc. Bateman, an industrious young man, working by candlelight, escaped with his life.</p>
<p>9th February</p>
<p>Abraham Whittuck, aged 40, one of the proprietors of Bitton coalworks was thrown from his horse when returning from Bristol at about 9 pm. Apparently concussed, he sadly fell into the river Boyd near the copper works and was drowned.</p>
