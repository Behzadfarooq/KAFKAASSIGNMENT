<p>I have personally conducted experiments at a University as an undergrad project with professor supervision that confirms that the ion-wind effect generates enough thrust to completely account for the lift produced.

<p>I personally built a lifter in 1990 while in the USAF, on my personal time. The observed 'wind' was completely insufficient to explain the amount of thrust generated. A <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ekpworld/doc/EKP_satellite_maneuvering.doc" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/ekpworld/doc/EKP_satellite_maneuvering.doc" rel="nofollow">recent paper</a> confirms my observation and demonstrates mathematically that it is impossible for the ion-wind effects to explain even a fraction of the observed thrust. Furthermore, NASA has recently obtained <a href="http://l2.espacenet.com/dips/bnsviewer?CY=ep&amp;LG=en&amp;DB=EPD&amp;PN=US6317310&amp;ID=US+++6317310B1+I+" class="external text" title="http://l2.espacenet.com/dips/bnsviewer?CY=ep&amp;LG=en&amp;DB=EPD&amp;PN=US6317310&amp;ID=US+++6317310B1+I+" rel="nofollow">a patent</a> for a 'propellantless' thruster using the same principle. <a href="http://jlnlabs.imars.com/lifters/act/html/omptv1.htm" class="external text" title="http://jlnlabs.imars.com/lifters/act/html/omptv1.htm" rel="nofollow">JL Naudin</a> has an excellent website with videos demonstrating that he has physically isolated each electrode from each other's atmosphere and still generated thrust, which would be impossible if it were an ion-wind effect.<a href="../../../m/l/o/User%7EMlorrey_0a99.html" title="User:Mlorrey">Mike Lorrey</a> 19:24, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "recent paper" (not, as far as I can tell, peer-reviewed, or in fact reviewed in any way the would remove spelling errors) linked above totally ignores the possibility of air entraiment by the ion wind, which is the standard explanation. It describes a single experiment, conducted in air, and claims that vacuum experiments are unnecessary (in reality, vacuum experiments show no force).</dd>
<dd>That patent is almost certainly speculative; it is almost certainly invalidated by prior art, since the original discoverers of the effect patented it (speculatively), and since there's been many articles published on the subject since.</dd>

<dd>Sorry, Andrew, but you aren't looking. I highly suggest you delve deeper into Naudin's "Lifter Project" pages. BTW: Speaking of spelling errors, the *entrainment* I observed was insufficient in my own experiments to explain the amount of thrust observed.</dd>

<p>I completely agree with <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> and I have looked at the Naudin pages and a lot of other pages and did the necessary calculations myself (as I was forced to, due to similiar discussions on de.wikipedia). --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a></p>

This seems to say that the effect will not work in a vacuum. (Which is exactly what vacuum experiments demonstrate).</dd>
<dd>The site full of videos vaguely describes three experiments that involve a physical partition between the electrodes. Two of them are simply understood by electrostatic attraction (this is not mentioned on their pages, but is alluded to on the page of the third. The third is more interesting. It uses three light bulbs (calling them vaccum tubes; I have no idea what the internal pressure is, but normal light bulbs do not operate in a vacuum) as one electrode, and the usual sheet of metal as the other. The videos show motion when power is applied. No information is provided about current draw or force. One simple explanation is that the tubes themselves may be being raised to a high voltage and serving as electrodes. Without actual data, it's impossible to tell what's going on.</dd>

<pre>
          -(May 3, 2006)-
</pre>
<p>In experiments I performed myself, the following web page has photos and video of a "tubular lifter" I built which clearly shows aluminum tubes, freely hanging on wooden struts, resting on the wooden struts with the HV power supply off, but when power is supplied, the tubes LIFT UPWARD toward the high voltage wire. This ship lifts. If ion wind is the cause for lifting this ship upwards, why are the tubes lifted upwards rather than pushed down by the ion wind coming off the upper wire? Here's the link: <a href="http://www.skidmore.edu/academics/music/aholland/ScienceExperiments.html" class="external free" title="http://www.skidmore.edu/academics/music/aholland/ScienceExperiments.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skidmore.edu/academics/music/aholland/ScienceExperiments.html</a> (see the tubular lifter photos and video) Also: JLNaudin's website clearly shows this technology working while immersed in oil. If there are any ions at all being generated in that oil (seems unlikely becuase Tesla used oil as an insulator in his large capacitors) I don't think there would be enough ion "wind" within the oil to move the lifter, yet, it moves while submerged in oil. Explain that, Ion wind proponents. Ion Wind clearly is not the primary lifting factor. Those who say that lifters do not work in vacuum have not actually tried it (read the book by Sigma Rho which includes a letter from TT Brown clearly indicating the effect still works in vacuum and was done in at least three different labs) or have not used enough voltage. TT Brown clearly indicates that his high voltage power supply was variable between 100KV-250Kv. Nobody's working at that level yet, though recently some of us have acquired 100Kv power supplies and are working on lifters in vacuum experiments. The problem is that HV in vaccum generates Xrays (which they don't do in air) and it becomes costly to provide high vaccum and protect against Xrays, but this is only a matter of time. Do the research and you'll see Brown clearly indicated the effect not only works in vacuum but also varies according to some "unknown universal constant" which he initially attributed to astronomical cycles".

<p>I'm quite surprised at the lack of attention solid-dielectric thrusters are recieving, and also at the ignorance of some people that don't realize that the lifter is a capacitor with an air-dielectric. I belive the reason for the vacuum experiments showing poor results is a sad attempt to discredit the lifter as a reliable means of propulsion. I really wish someone would perform some solid-dielectric tests in vacuum (mind you, the NASA tests resulted in a power supply problem, not a thruster malfunction), and if another person finds such tests, would you post a link on the wiki page? This is only my opinion, if you can discredit or support me, do so.</p>

<dd>I think the vacuum experiments are trying to rule out the possibility of using a lifter as a source of propulsion <i>in space</i>. In air, it's an interesting but highly power-intensive way to move air, akin to fans, propellers, and <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetohydrodynamic_drive.html" title="Magnetohydrodynamic drive">magnetohydrodynamic drives</a>. If it actually works in space, it could be useful as a form of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spacecraft_propulsion.html" title="Spacecraft propulsion">spacecraft propulsion</a>. Every known mechanism by which it could operate in space, though, makes it pretty unsatisfactory as a propulsion method.</dd>
<dd>If the solid-dielectric phenomenon you allude to is the same phenomenon, and you can point us to some reliable information about it, I'm sure somebody would work it into the article.</dd>

<dd>Let's not forget that NASA has filed and GOT some patents for using the Biefeld-Brown effect for thrusters.

<p>You're right, it's not a great idea to insult people if you want positive attention, but I thought it would motivate someone to find it themselves. Jean-Louis Naudin has some replications of the NASA experiments if you'd like to see the solid-dielectric capacitors. Don't forget, transdimesional's lifter is an air-dielectric capacitor, and it's not exactly a phenomenon how it works.

<p>I can't find much on the wiki about ion wind in general. I deleted <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion_wind.html" title="Ion wind">ion wind</a>, which just redirected here. I'm specifically curious about those "ionic air cleaner" things, which should have an article, but I can't find one.

<p>The biefeld-brown effect and electro hydrodynamics are two different effects. One of the outside links which links to www.blazelabs.com links you to their lifters page, which goes on to explain how lifters cannot work inside a vacuum. That's great, except for one problem; BlazeLabs acknowledges the Biefeld-Brown effect and electro hydrodynamics are two different phenomena, the site has a seperate page for the biefeld-brown effect, which states it does work in a vacuum. It goes far enough to say the only reliable tests for this effect are only inside a vacuum, because the air ions interfere with the capacitor’s electrical charge, creating a variable that cannot be allowed.

<p>I just wanted to support the action taken by the moderator in protecting the page. I am the guy who added the ionic patent numbers, and uploaded the original Hagen image. Lifters / Biefield-Brown is an ionic effect that was extensively researched in the 1960s by major American aerospace companies. They were apparently unable to figure out a way to get useful thrust from the apparatus, and interest lapsed. I uploaded the Hagen image, because contributors seemed unable to grasp the simple fact that 'Lifters' were invented in the 1960s, and all JLN labs did was re-create 40 year old patent documented research. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 15:35, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the basis of software running at a site I don't control.

<p>Freakofnuture replied that the IPs in question do not represent an <i>open proxy</i>. Rather, he says, this is an ordinary AOL user with a prosaic <i>dynamic IP</i> (i.e. each of his login sessions will usually be associated with a distinct IP address, which at other times might be temporarily assigned to someone else entirely). He says the range includes millions of addresses, so a block is essentially impossible. I understand that this is a long standing problem with AOL users who make questionable edits (or even flagrant vandalism) of the WP. I think the only viable solution is to continue what we've been doing anyway. I agree that geolocations might be all but useless in this case, but in general, geolocations even of dynamic IPs <i>can</i> certainly be useful and valid.---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 03:03, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article reads nicely, presents information in a way that can be understood, specifies the effect as a "phoenonema" without attempting to get into its scientific validity, acceptance, or "theory". The first part of the article, anyway, that I read looks good and makes sense and Mr. Lightening Rod is vandalizing instead of making the effort necessary to present any additional evidence of such an effect not happening under similar physical setup.
