<p>Fr. Nebres also worked to establish the Center for Community Services and the first conscientization and politicalization programs of the Ateneo de Manila in the 1970's. The students from these programs have become major contributors to social development in the Philippines. He also helped in the political programs of various parties and groups during the years of forming alternatives to the <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Marcos_0f3a.html" title="Ferdinand Marcos">Ferdinand Marcos</a> martial law regime. As Provincial Superior of the Jesuits in the Philippines from 1983 to 1989, much of his work was to support and coordinate efforts on the part of the Church in the years prior to and immediately after the 1986 revolution. In 2006, Fr. Nebres merged the Center for Community Services with the Ateneo School of Government.</p>
