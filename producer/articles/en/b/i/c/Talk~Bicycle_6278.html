<p>I have a very very short story in an textbook about a bicycle for elementary English learners and I am looking for more or other expressions used with riding the bicycle. I would like to bring the students a short story about it as an enhancement of the language and an amusement as well.</p>
<p>I would invite extracts from literature by known authors about a bicycle to be included as another aspect of the item investigated. So, I suggest to add a chapter: Bicycle in literature(arts)</p>

<p>There's a paragraph that reads "In English-speaking countries, but also elsewhere". This phrase is essentialy saying nothing. If it also applies to "elsewhere", why is it relevant that it applies to English-speaking countries?

<dd>Probably doesn't matter, however compared with many other countries the bicycle has very little cultural significance in the modern US. As a citizen of a country (Ireland) that speaks International/British English and has historically had a robust cycling culture - it feels strange to have an international article on bicycles written in the style/spelling of the state that has brought the practice of car culture to its most extreme forms.

Otherwise we risk making it unsearchable for certain groups of people. Of course this will make the article less elegant, but if a Brit wants to use the article for other purposes, then the person can just run a search/replace. Same with an American.

<p>I understand that non-standard units are also provided (in second term) for readers that might lack the understanding of the information in standard units. Also, usage of hours in km/h is so common that I would also find it acceptable. However, things like:</p>
<pre>
 - kJ/h -- This is weird and not easily understandable.  What is wrong with Watts (i.e. J/s) to express power?  Equivalency would be: 1 kJ/h == 1000 J / 3600 s == 1/3.6 W
 - kJ/km -- This is strictly correct, but redundant.  The base units are joules and metres.  Adding a 1000/1000 factor doesn't provide any extra information, so why not just J/m ?
 - kJ/(km∙kg) -- Same here.  Why not J/(m*kg) instead?

<dd>Desegregating a public facility only modifies the basis upon which an individual's use of that facility is regulated. Instead of separating or banning travelers by class or group, the government can restrict the use of a public facility by a person when that individual's operation of a heavy vehicle (such as a car) in a public facility (such as a path) poses an extraordinary danger to others (such as children) or their property. Since the government has this option for protecting the rights of others, segregation of public transportation facilities (as I defined above) is not only an unfair infringement on the personal liberty of some travelers, it is also unnecessary. --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruce_Rosar_87f3.html" title="User:Bruce Rosar">Bwileyr</a> 20:00, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a "bike path" is a public facility that is intended to separate people on a basis other than their own personal merit or performance, then it is a segregated facility that (IMHO) deserves to be boycotted. The government has the option of protecting the public without resorting to such segregation by restricting a given person's travel when it poses an extraordinary danger to others or their property. BTW, there are some motor vehicles which aren't heavy enough to pose such a level of danger (usually those which don't require a license to operate). --<a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruce_Rosar_87f3.html" title="User:Bruce Rosar">Bwileyr</a> 22:30, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can take it off. It is very likely to happen to someone if they ride 8 hours a day, several days a week and don't angle there seat down. I just thought I would mention so less people would have to live the rest of their life with a feeling of their testes being on fire.

<p>It is more likely to occur when someone doesn't angle their seat down. I gave references. Where else would this info go? Yes it is rare? No it isn't that rare if the seat isn't angled down. What other article should we put it in. No one will hear about this until after they get it because you took it off. I know several people who are in chronic pain all with the similar symptons who used to ride several hours a day several hours a week. I just want people to know to angle their seat down. Why would you take that off? Why should I have to sign on? I prefer to be anonymous. Do you have stock in bicycles, do you think I am a liar, or that it is too rare to mention? Here is another journal. Am J Phys Med Rehabil. 2003 Jun;82(6):479-84. They dismissed, deleted the links, and put up some link saying that goes away if someone stops riding. They just don't know. Misinformed. Sometimes it goes away for some people. -Sincerely sufferer</p>

<dd>A bicycle, or bike, is a pedal-driven land vehicle with two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. First introduced in 19th-century Europe, bicycles evolved quickly into their familiar, current design. Numbering over 1,000,000,000 in the world today, bicycles provide the principal means of transportation in many regions and a popular form of recreational transport in others. To distinguish a bicycle from a motorcycle, it is also called a push-bike.</dd>

<p>In the Vicrotian era a "push bike" did not have pedals. It was pushed along as if the rider was actually walking. The bicycle as we know it should I guess be referred to a "pedal bike" but who is going to say that?</p>

<p>Copied from the article:</p>
<p>"A rider stays upright on a bicycle by steering the bicycle so that the point where the wheels touch the ground stays underneath the center of gravity. Once underway, this effort is largely replaced by physical forces generated by the rotation of the wheels which produce a remarkable "self-steering" effect. The angular momentum of the wheels and the torque applied to them by the ground generates a phenomenon called precession, by which the wheel turns, or trails, toward whichever side the bicycle tilts. Like the rider's steering adjustments, this motion automatically returns the contact point of the wheel directly under the center of gravity. These forces, perhaps aided at very high speeds by the gyroscopic effect of the spinning wheels,4 are sufficiently strong that a riderless bicycle going down a slope will stay upright by itself."</p>
<p>The effect described in sentences 2, 3, and 4 above IS the gyroscopic effect, so to say in sentence 5 that it is perhaps aided by the gyroscopic effect is confusing. The more important effect, according to Jones and others, is that of trail, described in the third paragraph of the 'Bicycle physics' section. <a href="../../../r/r/a/User%7ERracecarr_f69e.html" title="User:Rracecarr">Rracecarr</a> 18:54, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree. In fact, 2, 3, and 4 are far too vague. They are only valid for a particular range of forward speeds and only for bikes that have the necessary geometry and mass distribution. "The wheel" should be identified as "the front wheel". Using "trail" to describe this phenomenon begs confusion with "trail" described below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Andy Townsend's article (note #4) gives a poor analysis of the mechanics involved. There is no 'gyroscopic "resistance" to change in lean angle' no mater how fast the wheels are turning.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, "are sufficiently strong that a riderless bicycle going down a slope will stay upright by itself" is only true within a certain speed range and for bikes with the necessary geometry and mass distribution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, in the second paragraph, the last sentence shows that the gyroscopic effects are "unnecessary to ride a bicycle", not necessarily "unimportant". <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 21:34, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>All of these issues were corrected by me back in February. On May 5 someone reverted the entire article back a few months. Even the first sentence here is poor. The goal isn't just to keep the centre of gravity over the line between the wheels -- the rider also wishes to drive the bike where he wants it to go. While turning, the centre of gravity must lean into the turn (not stay over the wheels) or the bike will tip over. - <a href="../../../j/e/t/User%7EJethroElfman_fe81.html" title="User:JethroElfman">JethroElfman</a> 16:26, 15 May 2006 (UTC) Okay, I restored the section. Perhaps someone would like to restore the entire article. The physics section could be tinkered with further. For instance, the "geometry of the front forks" has two components. One is how the contact of the tire to the road trails where the steering axis intersects the road. The second is the angle of attack of the steering axis. The exaggerated angle of a chopper is less stable, yet it is presumably advantageous to have the slight angle of a regular bike. I don't understand why it isn't perpendicular like a furniture caster. The length of trail is 1.5" for standard use, and up to 2.5" for racing duty. Increased distance adds stability for hands-free or aero bar operation, but makes cornering stiff. The speed-wobble section could be reworded. I don't think the comparison to a shopping-cart wheel is entirely accurate in this case. <a href="../../../j/e/t/User%7EJethroElfman_fe81.html" title="User:JethroElfman">JethroElfman</a> 16:43, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've gone ahead and made some major changes. I clarified self-stability vs rider control and what role gyroscopic effects play. I added a diagram to clarify head angle, rake, and trail.

<p>I think you are putting too much emphasis on precession. I thought that the Jones article settled that precession isn't such a big deal for bicycles.</p>
<dl>
<dd>My reading is that he established that is isn't necessary. I don't mean to emphasize it. I could put it last. It is still significant because it varies with speed and so contributes to the low and high speed instabilities that usually bracket the self-stable range. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 18:18, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>In that regard, the rear wheel is restrained from precessing because it is rigidly attached to the frame, whereas the front wheel can turn the head axis.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And the frame is constrained because it is attached to two wheels that touch the ground. I just mention the friction of the wheels with the ground, but could add text to include the frame necessary to transmit the force to the rear wheel. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 18:18, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Even so, as the bike turns through the corner, the rear wheel is thereby allowed to precess and thus aid in turning the mass of the bike.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nope. Still constrained by the frame, wheels, and friction with the ground, as above. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 18:18, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The first paragraph offends my memories of grade 10 physics class. Inertia is not a force. Its effects are applied to the bike through the tire contact to the road.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Depends on the reference frame used, as I mention. See <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centrifugal_force.html" title="Centrifugal force">Centrifugal force</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 18:18, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think your descriptions of trail and head angle are still too intertwined. Trail turns the wheel by gravity when the bike is leaning. Head angle generates a gravitational force to turn the wheel when the wheel is turned off centre, even if the bike is perfectly vertical.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but I don't follow you here at all. I specifically do not understand what you mean by "Trail turns the wheel by gravity" and "Head angle generates a gravitational force". Could you clarify? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 02:15, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If trail is kept to zero, a leaning bike's wheel won't turn regardless of the head angle (you have to extend the curvature of the forks forward to do this).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not true. With zero trail, it won't turn due to the ground reaction force, but if the CG of the entire steering mechanism, including front wheel, fork, stem, handlebars, brake levers, shifters, basket, rack, etc., is forward of the steering axis, as is common, then it will turn into the lean. If it is behind, then it will turn away from the lean. Either case effects self-stability, of course. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 02:15, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh, and Jones claims that negative trail makes a bike entirely unrideable, so what's your reference that says it's rideable but difficult?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll have to reread. It may be a matter of degree. Rear steering with negative trail is very unstable, but people do learn to ride fixed-gear bikes backwards as a trick. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 18:18, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The exact quote, from the second to last paragraph of the article, is "I made URB IV by moving the front wheel of my bicycle just four inches ahead of its normal position [giving it negative trial, as seen in FIG. 1 of the article], setting the system well into the unstable region.

<p>I still don't understand why head angle isn't just 90 degrees. Is it to keep the rider from going over the handlebars when braking perhaps?</p>
<dl>

<p>In the new diagram, things are labeled differently from how I learned them. I thought rake was the angle of the steering axis from vertical, which in the diagram is labeled "head angle" (well, 90 degrees minus what I thought was rake is so labeled). Someone on wikipediea appears to agree with me: <a href="../../../r/a/k/Rake_and_trail.html" title="Rake and trail">rake and trail</a>.

<dd>Perhaps things are different in the motor cycle world, but go to any bicycle manufacterer's web site (<a href="http://www.lemondbikes.com" class="external text" title="http://www.lemondbikes.com" rel="nofollow">LeMond</a>, for example), head angle is given in degrees from the horizontal (73°, for example), and rake is give as the offset in milimeters of the front hub from the steering axis (45mm, for example). These two parameters, along with wheel radius, define trail. That's how <a href="http://www.velonews.com/tech/report/articles/7322.0.html" class="external text" title="http://www.velonews.com/tech/report/articles/7322.0.html" rel="nofollow">Zinn</a> defines them, too. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 21:39, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure enough, all the motorcycle manufactures specs I found use 'rake' for head angle. At the same time, bicycle fork manufacturers seem to use either offset or rake. Meanwhile, the Wikipedia <a href="../../../r/a/k/Rake_and_trail.html" title="Rake and trail">rake and trail</a> article was actually "nominated for deletion on 2 April 2006" and the WIkipedia [Bicycle fork] article mentions neither rake nor offset.<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 02:01, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I did some sketches and see what you mean about the recumbent. If the wheel rather than projecting forward of the forks, is mounted rearwards, the centre-of-mass makes it steer the opposite way.</dd>

<dd>Actually, the one I used has a normal fork, but a long boom to bring the handlebars back to the rider.

<dd>What I meant about precession is that you put an awful lot of verbage covering it, when everything I've read, including the rake-and-trail and caster-angle articles says that it's trail that makes the bike stable. Angle provides damping in respect to trail. The one motorcycle reference though, says that precession makes a motorcycle corner.

<dd>I think the paragraphs on countersteering are too absolute concerning it. The very fact that you can ride and negotiate a corner with no hands makes it look to me like you don't necessarily have to employ the technique.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just because you don't have your hands on the handlebars, doesn't mean you don't countersteer. You do steer in the direction of a turn as necessary, right? If the bike starts to lean, you do steer the wheels back under the center of gravity, right? I get that one can have quite a lot of control over the steering of a bike without the use of hands. The issue is lean angle, however. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 03:56, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On a motorcycle sure, since the bike outweighs the rider. On a bicycle, since the rider is so much heavier (and manoevreable compared to being on a motorcycle seat) the rider can shift his weight to produce lean.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, but leaning the bicycle does not move the combined center of gravity of the bicycle and rider to the side. It just lowers it in most cases. If the combined center of gravity is not leaned into the turn, the bicycle and rider will fall over as soon as the turn is initiated due to centrifigul force, or, if you prefer, because they continue straight as the wheels begin to accelerate around the center of the turn. There simply is no other way to initiate a lean, short of some external influence. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 03:56, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the rider tightly grips the handlebars to rigidly keep the wheel straight, the bike will lean just by gravity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, yes, you could continue riding in a straight line until an inevitable purturbation tips you in the desired direction. Then, override the natural righting tendency inherent in the bicycle design until the necessary lean angle is achieved. However, if you want to turn when you want to turn, your only alternative is countersteering. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 03:56, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To feel the effect of shifting weight, try riding by standing with your left foot on the right pedal. The bike leans greatly left, and you must torque the handlebars right to go in a straight line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>True, due mostly to trail, and not related to the issue except as an extreme example of moving the combined center of gravity far from the vertical axis of the bike. If you let the bike steer to the left, you'd better have leaned the combined center of mass appropriately. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 03:56, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Likewise, I still dispute the precession contribution of the rear wheel. If the frame is constraining the wheel to not precess, the wheel is conversely applying the same rotational moment back onto the frame in the direction of the turn. Hence the spinning rear wheel is applying a yaw torque to aid the yaw torque coming from the friction of the road on the front wheel. Will you say naw to that?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is that unless the precession induced in the rear wheel by leaning the bike has enough torque to skid the front wheel (say 100ft-lbs or more for an adult rider on an average bike with rubber tires on pavement), then it has no effect on the yaw of the bike. The front wheel of a bicycle does not skid in the direction of the turn, and so applies a torque through the frame on the rear wheel about the vertical axis. If you follow the right-hand rule, you find that this torque induces a precession in the rear wheel about the longitudinal axis of the bike causing it to lean in the same direction as the bike is leaning. You can verify this with much more rigor by applying Euler's Equations for 3D rigid body motion. You can also demonstrate it with a toy gyroscope. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewDressel_ca84.html" title="User:AndrewDressel">AndrewDressel</a> 03:56, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm a bit sceptical about the reported efficiency for the drive train, especially for internal gearing. Most internal hubs have one direct drive gear, in which all the planetary gearing is effectively locked. Shouldn'd that be as efficient as the best external gearing or even a single-speed (given that the chain line should be optimal)? Moreover, Rohloff claims 95-99% efficieny for the Speedhub 500/14, and claims that to be "totally comparable with those of a high-quality derailleur gear system"<a href="http://www.rohloff.de/en/info/faq/faq_detail/article/652/284/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rohloff.de/en/info/faq/faq_detail/article/652/284/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 21:53, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arguably. I just included it so the braking paragraph wouldn't be only one sentence. I should have included a link to the stoppie article.

<dd>I think this version loses the point that self stability occurs only under certain conditions. The geometry and mass distribution of the bike need to be correct, and the bike needs to be travelling at the necessary forward speed.

<p>One goal to keep in mind for this brief section is to keep it brief. See the discussion above about the whole bicycle article being too long.

<p>I would suggest helmets are not a bicycle accessory as they are not fitted on the bike itself, or are used directly on the bike in the way tools are eg pumps, tyre levers etc. Instead they are an item of clothing and should be classed as a <i>cycling accessory</i>. <a href="../../../l/d/h/User%7ELDHan_af5b.html" title="User:LDHan">LDHan</a> 08:30, 13 September 2006</p>

<p>A short paragraph on BMX bicycles was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.8.163.165_fd58.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.8.163.165">195.8.163.165</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.8.163.165.html" title="User talk:195.8.163.165">talk</a>). This was then quickly removed by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reaves_5821.html" title="User:John Reaves">John Reaves</a> with the comment "there's a separate article for BMX".</p>
<p>This seems a little harsh, but I see we are already on a slippery slope. The existing main article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bicycle_types.html" title="List of bicycle types">list of bicycle types</a> does included a section on BMX with a link to the <a href="../../../b/m/x/BMX_aa44.html" title="BMX">BMX</a> article, but the same is true for Racing bicycles, touring bicycles, tandems, etc, and they do all receive mention in the main bicycle article. It seems a little snobbish at this point to exclude BMX.</p>
<p>Since the bicycle article itself is already too long, I suggest that we remove the entire bulleted list of bicycle types and let the reader follow the link to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bicycle_types.html" title="List of bicycle types">list of bicycle types</a> article for details.

<dd>I have never seen any bullhorn bars that are any better for resting forearms on than straight or drop bars.

<dd>This is a contentious claim that is refuted quite well in the recumbent article.

Drela in 1998 confirmed "that there was no significant difference in power output between recumbent and conventional bicycling.""
