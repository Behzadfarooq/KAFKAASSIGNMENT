<p>I have put this piece in here so it doesn’t break the overall flow of the main text - however as you will see below I think the main editor is mistaken about a few points of our history</p>
<p>X-mass - As far as I am aware the event named by the above editor Bicon 4 was called the 4th national bisexual conference. It was only with the Seventh conference which called it self BiCon 7:The Seventh National Bisexual Conference was the name BiCon used. Since the organisers of the seventh previously ran SF and gaming Cons they called the event BiCon inside the organising group and this accidentally got used as the title. The organisers of BiCon 7 also chose to copy the SF and gaming Con style of event, going for accommodation on the same site as the workshops with events in the evening also on the same site. Also that year a group lead by someone who objected to the format of BiCon 7 held an alternative event the 1st International Bisexual Conference in London. Both prior to this and for the next two conferences after, the conferences were based on offering workshops in the day, possibly an off site disco in the evening and crashing/sleeping on friends floors. It was only with the 10th and 11th National conferences that the more modern format became established - a Friday, Saturday and Sunday event, called BiCon and using on-site accommodation, this led a much more extended vacation atmosphere as people knew that everybody was only 5 or 10 minutes away X-mass {editor is kate who was part of the team for Bicon 7, 13icon, and 2000)</p>
<p><br />
--Lovingboth - They're right about the name of #4 and #7 being the first to use the name 'BiCon'. My memory is that it was for the venue's benefit too: they'd had SF cons there, but Kay (mhw@LJ) is the person to ask.</p>
<p>The bit about IBC1 is wrong - this was Fritz Klein proding his friends in the Netherlands. It was in 1991.</p>
<p><i>X-mass</i> - Kay isnt the person to ask about site liasion as despite being in coventry I did the actual site liasion. I think we might have described the event to the site as like an SF con or may be later as BiCon I cant recall as I think kay had held Koancon there before. But I do remember haveing this big fight with Joy about calling the event BiCon 7 on the adversiing, and I think she was later outvoted by me and kay.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's right, you did indeed do the site liaison because you had far more conrunning experience than I did. KoanCon had indeed been held at Coventry Poly, I think the year before, when Alex Z., Matt H and I were on the organising team; the reason it was called KoanCon was that its mascot was the Koan sculpture outside the Senate building at Warwick University, where KoanCon 1 had been held the previous year. As I remember, you and I picked 'BiCon' as a name because 1) it followed the 'xxxCon' format from SF/media cons; 2) it was much less of a mouthful than the 'full name' at the time; and 3)it just sounded good, like 'icon'. Ah, history! <a href="../../../k/a/y/User%7EKay_Dekker_b934.html" title="User:Kay Dekker">Kay Dekker</a> 22:32, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>My memory say that there was another Bicon organised against us that year, I can remember the organiser of it kept telling people in london not to come to coventry and how we were dsetroying BiCon, or at least thats the reports we heared. And I thought it was IBC1 that he ran maybe it was ebc1? it was one day event in a hall in london and the main organiser was pretty much univerally hated and subsquently left the community. I remember Liz and Giles being on the team and organising the after event party in a hall somewhere with a load of beer on sale or return. I also remember a bunch of T-shirts at the back with things like Byke written on them as opposed to dyke</p>
<dl>
<dd>You may be confusing several events. The event run by the universally hated organiser, with Liz, User:Lovingboth and myself on the team among others, was IBC2, and it was in 1992, the same year as BiCon 10. Giles wasn't on the team; he just helped save the day at the last minute sorting out the sale or return. IBC2 was never billed as competition with BiCon 10, but the UHO disliked the BiCon 10 team and didn't cooperate with them. BiCon 7 was before my time but this is the first I've heard of a rival event.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes your right I am confused. However the said person did harrange us for not running BiCon correctly and tried to persude people from london not to come. But yes your right about IBC2 (and thanks for correcting me)</dd>

<dd>Incidentally, can I encourage you to create a Wikipedia account? It's easy and quick, and polite especially when you're taking part in potentially contentious edits. — <a href="../../../c/i/p/User%7ECiphergoth_5225.html" title="User:Ciphergoth">ciphergoth</a> 12:25, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>thanyou your right and it was easy</dd>

<dd>Yep, although the drinks weren't on sale or return! He and I went round to a local off-licence, after UHO (who didn't like anything he didn't control: he was miffed at 1991 too) told the other organisers, an hour or so before the start of the social event, at the end of the two days, that the bar he was supposed to have organised wasn't going to happen. My subsequent Bifrost article included how much we sold and my memory is telling me what was left was used at the LBG because the bar at the event had already made a profit.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>UHO was also a reason for BiCon7's publicity being so ishy - he had the LBG's crucial card index file of people's names and addresses and wanted money - I'm not sure whether for himself, the people who'd do the addressing and stuffing of envelopes or for the LBG, who with the burden of a loss-making Bi-Monthly needed it - to do a mailshot. — Lovingboth 13:13, September 8, 2005 (UTC) (getting better with some of the markup commands)</dd>

<p>Is BiFest really rightly described as an offshoot focusing on one aspect of BiCon? I'd say it was a deliberate attempt to get people into the bi community and to hear the 'bi is valid' message that wouldn't be going to BiCon?</p>
<p>I'd create a page for it but Wikipedia scares me. Adjectivemarcus 16:27, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>--X-mass I hacked a BiFest page from the BiCon (UK) page please go and edit it! Please!!!!!!</p>
