<p>The <b>gearing</b> on a <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle.html" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a> is the selection of appropriate gear ratios for optimum efficiency or comfort. Different gears and ranges of gears are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances, e.g. it may be comfortable to use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill.</p>
<p>On a bicycle, power is transmitted from the rider's legs to the rear wheel via the <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_pedal.html" title="Bicycle pedal">pedals</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crankset.html" title="Crankset">crankset</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_chain.html" title="Bicycle chain">chain</a>, and rear hub. A cyclist's legs produce power optimally within a narrow pedalling speed range. Gearing is optimized to use this narrow range as best as possible. As in other types of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmission_%28mechanics%29.html" title="Transmission (mechanics)">transmissions</a>, the <a href="../../../g/e/a/Gear_ratio.html" title="Gear ratio">gear ratio</a> is closely related to the <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_advantage.html" title="Mechanical advantage">mechanical advantage</a> of the drivetrain of the bicycle. On <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single-speed_bicycle.html" title="Single-speed bicycle">single-speed bicycles</a> and multi-speed bicycles using <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derailleur_gears.html" title="Derailleur gears">derailleur gears</a>, the gear ratio is the ratio of the number of teeth on the chainring of the crankset and the rear cog or sprocket. In the case of a derailleur-equipped bicycle, this sprocket is one of several comprising the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassette_%28bicycle_part%29.html" title="Cassette (bicycle part)">cassette</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../h/u/b/Hub_gear.html" title="Hub gear">hub gears</a> the ratio is determined by the internal <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetary_gear.html" title="Planetary gear">planetary gears</a> within the hub.</p>
<p>For the same speed, or more accurately, power output at the rear wheel, a lower gear (larger mechanical advantage) will require the rider to pedal at a faster <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadence_%28cycling%29.html" title="Cadence (cycling)">cadence</a>, but with less force. Conversely, a higher gear (smaller mechanical advantage) allows a higher speed for a given cadence, but requiring greater force. Different cyclists may have different preferences for cadence and pedalling force. Prolonged exertion of too much force in too high a gear at too low a speed can increase the chance of knee damage.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_gearing.html" title="Edit section: General considerations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">General considerations</span></h2>
<p>The gearing supplied by the manufacturer on a new bicycle is selected to be useful to the majority of people. Some cyclists choose to fine-tune the gearing to better suit their strength, level of fitness, and expected usage. When buying from specialist cycle shops, it may be less expensive to get the gears altered before delivery rather than at some later date. Modern crankset chainrings can be swapped out, as can <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassette_%28bicycle_part%29.html" title="Cassette (bicycle part)">cassettes</a>.</p>
<p>As far as a cyclist's legs are concerned, when changing gears, the relative difference between two gears is more important than the absolute difference between gears. This relative change, from a lower gear to a higher gear, is normally expressed as a percentage. This measure is independent of what system is used to measure the gears. Cycling tends to feel more comfortable if nearly all gear changes have more or less the same percentage difference; a larger percentage difference may be acceptable for lower gears where the absolute difference is not too large. Thus, the absolute gear ratios should be in logarithmic progression.</p>
<p>Racing cyclists often have close-range gears with a difference of around 7%. Many general-purpose gears have a difference of around 15%. Differences of 25% or more require a very substantial change in <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadence_%28cycling%29.html" title="Cadence (cycling)">cadence</a> and often feel excessive. A step of 7% corresponds to a 1-tooth change from a 14-tooth <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cog.html" title="Cog">cog</a> to a 15-tooth cog, while a step of 15% corresponds to a 2-tooth change from a 13-tooth cog to a 15-tooth cog.</p>
<p>By contrast, car engines deliver power over a much larger range of speeds than do cyclist's legs, so relative differences of 30% or more are common for car <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmission_%28mechanics%29.html" title="Transmission (mechanics)">gearboxes</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_gearing.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Bicycles and their predecessors were directly driven by the feet. The <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny-farthing.html" title="Penny-farthing">penny-farthing</a> used a large driven front wheel to increase the top speed. The <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safety_bicycle.html" title="Safety bicycle">safety bicycle</a> introduced driving the rear wheel via a chain.</p>
<p>An early multi-speed bicycle used a double-sided rear wheel, with different-sized sprockets on each side. To change gears, the rider would stop and dismount, remove the rear wheel and reinstall it in the reverse direction. One example of this type of bicycle is in the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_Museum_%28London%29_7b82.html" title="Science Museum (London)">Science Museum (London, UK)</a>.</p>
<p>Derailleur systems were first developed in the late 1800s, but the modern cable-operated parallelogram derailleur was invented in the 1950s.</p>

<p><i>External gearing</i> utilizes <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derailleur_gear.html" title="Derailleur gear">derailleurs</a>, which can be placed on both the front <i>chainring</i> and on the rear <i>cluster</i> or <i>cassette</i>, to push the chain to either side, derailing it from one sprocket to a neighboring sprocket. The sides of the sprockets may be sculpted to help catch the chain, pulling it up onto their teeth to change gears. There may be 1 to 3 chainrings, and 5 to 10 sprockets on the cassette or freewheel. Derailleur type mechanisms of a typical mid-range product (of the sort used by serious amateurs) achieve between 88% and 99% mechanical efficiency at 100W. In derailleur mechanisms the highest efficiency is achieved by the larger cogs. Efficiency generally decreases with smaller cog and chainwheel sizes. <sup id="_ref-whitt_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-whitt" title="">[1]</a></sup> Derailleur efficiency is also compromised with <i>cross-chaining</i>, or running large-ring to large-cog or small-ring to small-cog. This also results in increased wear because of the lateral deflection of the chain.</p>

Rear hub gears may offer 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, or 14 speeds. Bottom bracket fittings offer a choice of 2 speeds, and are generally foot-operated. Internal hub gears are immune to adverse weather conditions that affect derailleurs, and often last longer and require less maintenance. However, they may be heavier and/or more expensive, and often do not offer the same range or number of gears. Internal hub gearing still predominates in some regions, particularly on utility bikes, whereas in other regions, such as the USA, external derailleur systems predominate. In a typical hub gear mechanism the mechanical efficiency will be between 82% and 92% depending on the ratio selected. Which ratios are <i>best</i> and <i>worst</i> depends on the specific model of hub gear.</p>

<p><a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-gear_bicycle.html" title="Fixed-gear bicycle">Fixed-gear</a> track racing bikes can achieve transmission efficiencies of over 99% (nearly all the energy put in at the pedals ends up at the wheel). Biomechanical factors however determine that a human can deliver maximum power only over a narrow range of crank rotational speed or <i>cadence.</i> To match the power source with the load under varying conditions, a variable gear ratio is needed, and they work very well, though at the expense of mechanical efficiency. The efficiency varies considerably with the gear ratio being used.</p>

<p>There have been, and still are, drivetrains that are quite different from those above:</p>

<li>Other bicycles of that era dispensed with the chain entirely and used an enclosed driveshaft and bevel gears. These <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaft-driven_bicycle.html" title="Shaft-driven bicycle">shaft-driven bicycle</a> were strongly built but were not mechanically efficient. They were primarily marketed to women, as the enclosed gears would not entangle clothing.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_gearing.html" title="Edit section: Measuring gears">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Measuring gears</span></h2>
<p>With a derailleur-based multi-speed bicycle, the gears can be denoted by the number of teeth on the front chainring and rear sprocket, for example the highest gear on a racing bicycle might be 53x11. For a road-racing cyclist, this is useful because of the standard size of the <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_wheel.html" title="Bicycle wheel">wheel</a>. However, this measure is limited because it does not specify other aspects of the system. <i><a href="../../../g/e/a/Gear_inches.html" title="Gear inches">Gear inches</a></i> and <i>metres of development</i> are related measures that include the diameter of the rear wheel. <i>Gain ratio</i> is a measure which also takes the length of the <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crankset.html" title="Crankset">crankarms</a> into account.</p>
<p>With a hub gear, gear ratios are given directly.</p>
<p>Gear inches and meters of development of a gear combination are defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gear inches = <b>Diameter</b> of <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drive_wheel.html" title="Drive wheel">drive wheel</a> in inches × number of teeth in front chainring / number of teeth in rear cog.</li>
<li>Metres of development = <b>Circumference</b> of drive wheel in meters × number of teeth in front chainring / number of teeth in rear cog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Metres of development corresponds to the distance (in metres) traveled by the bicycle for one rotation of the pedals. Gear inches has no current physical significance; it corresponds to the diameter of the main wheel of an old-fashioned <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny-farthing.html" title="Penny-farthing">penny-farthing</a> bicycle with equivalent gearing.</p>
<p>The following table compares gear inches, metres of development, and gain ratio for 170 mm cranks and 700c wheels (diameter 70 cm). Speeds for several <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadence_%28cycling%29.html" title="Cadence (cycling)">cadences</a> in revolutions per minute are also given.</p>

<p>Only those who want to go really fast will need a gear much above 100, though gears as high as 250 have been reported for specialist racing. Cyclists who are fit and strong will find that a low gear of around 40 gear-inches is quite adequate for almost all on-road use (racing cyclists generally have a low gear of around 44 ~ 39x23). Those who cycle mainly on relatively flat roads may find that a low gear of around 50 is satisfactory. Other cyclists may prefer a somewhat lower gear, perhaps around 20 or 30. The lowest feasible non-specialist gear (as of 2005) is around 15. Tricycles can be bought with gears as low as 8, but such low gears are not really suitable for bicycles due to the problems of balancing at very slow speeds.</p>
<p>As a person ages, their necessary low gear may change. Suppose a cyclist at age 40 regularly <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_commuting.html" title="Bicycle commuting">commutes</a> by bicycle 11 miles each way without doing any other cycling or exercise. He might need a low gear of 45 for the 58-mile <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_to_Brighton_events_085d.html" title="London to Brighton events">London to Brighton</a> charity bike ride, with no need to stand on the pedals even over <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sussex.html" title="Sussex">Ditchling Beacon</a>. Twenty years later the same cyclist (then commuting only 5 miles each way) might need a low gear of 27 for the ride. Another five years later the same cyclist (then commuting 7 miles each way) might feel happier with a low gear of 19 for the ride.</p>
<p>Several gear ratio calculators are <a href="#External_links" title="">linked below</a>. Such calculators are more useful if they show the percentage difference between gears as well as the nominal gear ratios. These calculators require the number of teeth on each gear wheel on the bicycle and the diameter of the back wheel. Standard road wheels, labeled 700c are 70 cm in diameter with the tyre; the smaller 650c wheels are 65 cm in diameter. Mountain, cruiser, and most other types of wheel are 26 inches with tyre.</p>
<p>For gain ratios they also need to know the length of the pedal cranks in millimetres (crank lengths are normally some multiple of 2.5 mm). If the bicycle has an enclosed gear system (hub or bottom bracket), then details of these gears are also needed (make and model is enough for some calculators).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_gearing.html" title="Edit section: Key Considerations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Key Considerations</span></h2>
<p>Any three of the following four questions determine the desired gears:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the desired top gear?</li>
<li>What is the desired bottom gear?</li>
<li>What step is desired between gears?</li>
<li>How many gears are desired?</li>
</ul>
<p>Because gear wheels must have a whole number of teeth, it is usually not possible to meet the requirements exactly. In particular, the step between gears may vary by 3% or so.</p>
<p>If it turns out that only a smallish number of gears are required (say 3 to 7), then enclosed hub gears are well worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>long lasting,</li>
<li>reduced maintenance,</li>
<li>can change gear while stationary.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several possibilities if more gears are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>fairly expensive 12 or 14-speed hub gear</li>
<li>single chainring with 9 or 10-cog cassette</li>
<li>multiple chainrings with 7 to 10-cog cassette</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of multiple chainrings introduces further complications. For example, a combination of 3 chainrings and an 8-cog cassette does not result in 24 usable gears. Instead it provides 3 overlapping ranges of 7, 8, and 7 gears (the extremes big-big and little-little should not be used - diagonal chain angles reduce efficiency and cause excessive chain wear). Due to the overlap, there may well be some duplicates or near-duplicates, so that there might only be 16 or 18 distinct gears. It may not be feasible to use these distinct gears in strict low-high sequence anyway due to the complicated shifting patterns involved (e.g. simultaneous double or triple shift on the rear derailleur and a single shift on the front derailleur). In the worst case there could be only 10 distinct gears, if the percentage step between chainrings is the same as the step between cogs.</p>

<p>The following gear ratios were calculated using a 700c rear wheel. Similar ratios can be obtained for any size wheel by adjusting the size of the chainring and/or the rear sprocket.</p>
<p>It is possible to get almost any combination of chainwheel sizes and cog sizes, but it is much cheaper to use standard combinations.</p>

<p>Scenario: Speed is important, strength is assumed.</p>
<p>Desired gears: low around 45, high around 125, step around 8%.</p>
<p>A modern <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racing_bicycle.html" title="Racing bicycle">racing bicycle</a> is often equipped with a double-chainring crankset at the front and a 9-speed or 10-speed cassette at the back. Since wheel size is standardized, the gearing system is often described by stating the number of teeth in the chainrings and cogs. For example, the front chainring gearing is denoted "53/39", meaning that it has 53- and 39-tooth chainrings on the crankset. The rear cassette is denoted by its smallest and its largest. For example, a "12-25" means that the smallest has 12 teeth, and the largest has 25 teeth. Nowadays 9- and 10-speed cassettes are commonplace, which make the choice of intermediate gears less important than when there were only 5 cogs available in a cassette. These cassettes typically have a 7% step on the top 6 or 7 gears, and an 11% step on the lower gears.</p>
<p>Except in special circumstances, most professionals use a combination of a 53/39 front gearing. Some <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprinting_specialist_%28cycling%29.html" title="Sprinting specialist (cycling)">sprinters</a> like to use a larger chainring at the front, up to 54t or 55t. In some races involving steep climbs, some professionals opt for a triple chainring at the front to accommodate a smaller gear. Recent popularity of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_drivetrain.html" title="Compact drivetrain">compact drivetrain</a> allows the use of smaller chainrings at the front, usually a 50/34 or 50/36 combination. This allows the use of a double-chainring drivetrain and having the lower gearing needed for the climbs.</p>
