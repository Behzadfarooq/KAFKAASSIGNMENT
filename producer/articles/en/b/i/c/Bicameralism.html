<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicameralism.html" title="Edit section: Theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theory</span></h2>
<p>Although the ideas on which bicameralism is based can be traced back to the theories developed in Ancient Sumer and later <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Greece_e4c9.html" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_India_d42c.html" title="History of India">ancient India</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Rome</a>, recognizable bicameral institutions first arose in medieval Europe where they were associated with separate representation of different estates of the realm.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../f/o/u/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States_f0d4.html" title="Founding Fathers of the United States">Founding Fathers of the United States</a> eschewed any notion of separate representation for aristocracy, but they accepted the prevailing disposition towards bicameralism. However, as part of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Compromise_5207.html" title="Great Compromise">Great Compromise</a> between large states and small states, they invented a new rationale for bicameralism in which the upper house would have states represented equally and the lower house would have them represented by population.</p>
<p>In subsequent constitution making, federal states have often adopted bicameralism, and the solution remains popular when regional differences or sensitivities require more explicit representation, with the second chamber representing the constituent states. Nevertheless, the older justification for second chambers — providing opportunities for second thoughts about legislation — has survived. A trend towards <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unicameralism.html" title="Unicameralism">unicameralism</a> in the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> appears now to have been halted.</p>
<p>Growing awareness of the complexity of the notion of representation and the multifunctional nature of modern legislatures may be affording incipient new rationales for second chambers, though these do generally remain contested institutions in ways that first chambers are not. An example of political controversy regarding a second chamber has been the debate over the powers of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Senate_c1b3.html" title="Canadian Senate">Canadian Senate</a>.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two chambers varies; in some cases, they have equal power, while in others, one chamber is clearly superior in its powers. The first tends to be the case in federal systems and those with presidential governments. The latter tends to be the case in unitary states with <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_system.html" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary systems</a>.</p>
<p>Some political scientists believe that bicameralism makes meaningful political reforms more difficult to achieve and increases the risk of deadlock (particularly in cases where both chambers have similar powers). Others argue strongly for the merits of the '<a href="../../../c/h/e/Checks_and_balances.html" title="Checks and balances">checks and balances</a>' provided by the bicameral model, which they believe helps prevent the passage into law of ill-considered legislation.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicameralism.html" title="Edit section: Federalism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Federalism</span></h3>
<p>Some countries, such as <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaysia.html" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> link their bicameral systems to their <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation.html" title="Federation">federal</a> political structure.</p>
<p>In the United States, Australia and Brazil, for example, each state is given the same number of seats in the legislature's upper house. This takes no account of population differences between states — it is designed to ensure that smaller states are not overshadowed by more populous ones. (In the United States, the deal that ensured this arrangement is known as the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut_Compromise_45d6.html" title="Connecticut Compromise">Connecticut Compromise</a>.) In the lower houses of each country, these provisions do not apply, and seats are allocated based purely on population. The bicameral system, therefore, is a method of combining the principle of democratic equality with the principle of federalism — all citizens are equal in the lower houses, while all states are equal in the upper houses.</p>
<p>In Canada, the country as a whole is divided into a number of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Senate_Divisions_ab58.html" title="Canadian Senate Divisions">Senate Divisions</a>, each with a different number of Senators, based on a number of factors. These Divisions are <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Canada_90a7.html" title="Western Canada">Western Provinces</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Maritimes_1b58.html" title="The Maritimes">the Maritimes</a>, each with 24 Senators, <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukon.html" title="Yukon">Yukon</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Territories_ca27.html" title="Northwest Territories">Northwest Territories</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nunavut.html" title="Nunavut">Nunavut</a>, each with 1 Senator, and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_4e85.html" title="Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a> has 6 Senators, making for a total of 105 Senators.</p>
<p>In the German, Indian, and Pakistani systems, the upper houses (the <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bundesrat_%28Germany%29_d07d.html" title="Bundesrat (Germany)">Bundesrat</a>, the <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajya_Sabha_68c5.html" title="Rajya Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_of_Pakistan_d2e1.html" title="Senate of Pakistan">Pakistani Senate</a> respectively) are even more closely linked with the federal system, being appointed or elected directly by the governments of each <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_of_Germany_65c0.html" title="States of Germany">German Bundesland</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_and_territories_of_India_8e19.html" title="States and territories of India">Indian State</a>, or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_Pakistan_91e3.html" title="Provinces of Pakistan">Pakistani Province</a>. (This was also the case in the United States before the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_64b7.html" title="Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">17th Amendment</a>.)</p>
<p>There are also instances of bicameralism in countries that are not federations, but which have upper houses with representation on a terrritorial basis. For example in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Council_of_Provinces_096f.html" title="National Council of Provinces">National Council of Provinces</a> (and before <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_of_South_Africa_0581.html" title="Senate of South Africa">Senate</a>) has its members chosen by each <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provinces_of_South_Africa_995d.html" title="Provinces of South Africa">Province</a>'s legislature.</p>
<p>In Spain the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Senate_f628.html" title="Spanish Senate">Spanish Senate</a> functions as a <i>de facto</i> territorial-based upper house, and there has been some pressure from the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomous_Communities_d878.html" title="Autonomous Communities">Autonomous Communities</a> to reform it into a strictly territorial chamber.</p>
<p><a name="Aristocratic" id="Aristocratic"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicameralism.html" title="Edit section: Aristocratic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aristocratic</span></h3>
<p>In a few countries, bicameralism involves the juxtaposition of democratic and aristocratic elements.</p>
<p>The best known example is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>, which includes a number of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary_peer.html" title="Hereditary peer">hereditary peers</a>. The House of Lords represents a vestige of the aristocratic system which once predominated in British politics, while the other house, the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, is entirely elected. Over the years, there have been proposals to reform the House of Lords, some of which have been at least partly successful — the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_Act_1999_f0bb.html" title="House of Lords Act 1999">House of Lords Act 1999</a> limited the number of hereditary peers (as opposed to <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_peer.html" title="Life peer">life peers</a>, appointed by the government) to 92, down from around 700. The ability of the House of Lords to block legislation is curtailed by the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_Act_6934.html" title="Parliament Act">Parliament Act</a>. Further reform of the Lords is planned; said reform would almost certainly include the removal of the remaining hereditary peers.</p>
<p>Another example of aristocratic bicameralism was the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Peers_10c7.html" title="House of Peers">House of Peers</a>, abolished after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and replaced with the present <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Councillors_c76c.html" title="House of Councillors">House of Councillors</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Unitary_states" id="Unitary_states"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicameralism.html" title="Edit section: Unitary states">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Unitary states</span></h3>
<p>Many bicameral systems are not connected with either federalism or an aristocracy, however. <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>, the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, the <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czech_Republic_12a4.html" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>, the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Ireland_10e7.html" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romania.html" title="Romania">Romania</a> are examples of bicameral systems existing in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitary_state.html" title="Unitary state">unitary states</a>. In countries such as these, the upper house generally exists solely for the purpose of scrutinising and possibly vetoing the decisions of the lower house.</p>
<p>In some of these countries, the upper house is indirectly elected. Members of France's <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Senate_b553.html" title="French Senate">Senate</a>, Ireland's <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seanad_%C3%89ireann_a7e0.html" title="Seanad Éireann">Seanad Éireann</a> are chosen by <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_college.html" title="Electoral college">electoral colleges</a> consisting of members of the lower house and local councillors, while the Netherlands' <a href="../../../e/e/r/Eerste_Kamer_98d9.html" title="Eerste Kamer">First Chamber</a> is chosen by members of provincial assemblies.</p>
<p><a name="Subnational_entities" id="Subnational_entities"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicameralism.html" title="Edit section: Subnational entities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Subnational entities</span></h3>
<p>In some countries with federal systems, individual states (like those of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/States_and_territories_of_Australia_07c2.html" title="States and territories of Australia">Australia</a>) may also have bicameral legislatures. Only two such states, <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska.html" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> in the US and <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a> in Australia, have adopted unicameral systems.</p>
<p>However, in early <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States</a> history, unicameral <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_legislatures.html" title="State legislatures">state legislatures</a> were not totally uncommon: even though twelve of the original thirteen States (<a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> being the only exception) had a bicameral legislature at the time of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Convention_df28.html" title="Philadelphia Convention">Philadelphia Convention</a>, some of the new States didn't immediately adopt such system. It was not until <a href="../../../1/8/3/1836.html" title="1836">1836</a>, for example, that <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermont.html" title="Vermont">Vermont</a> finally created a Senate.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>, the Legislature of the State of Nebraska was reduced from <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicameral.html" title="Bicameral">bicameral</a> to unicameral with the 43 members that once comprised that state's Senate. One of the arguments used to sell the idea at the time to Nebraska voters was that by adopting a unicameral system, the perceived evils of the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Conference_committee.html" title="Conference committee">conference committee</a>" process would be eliminated.</p>
<p>A conference committee is appointed when the two chambers cannot agree on the same wording of a proposal, and consists of a small number of legislators from each chamber. This tends to place much power in the hands of only a small number of legislators. Whatever legislation, if any, the conference committee finalizes must then be approved in an unamendable "take-it-or-leave-it" manner by both chambers.</p>
<p>During his term as <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor.html" title="Governor">Governor</a> of the State of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota.html" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Ventura_0ea7.html" title="Jesse Ventura">Jesse Ventura</a> proposed converting the Minnesotan legislature to a single chamber with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proportional_representation.html" title="Proportional representation">proportional representation</a>, as a reform that he felt would solve many legislative difficulties and impinge upon legislative corruption. In his book on political issues, <i>Do I Stand Alone?</i>, Ventura argued that bicameral legislatures for provincial and local areas were excessive and unnecessary, and discussed unicameralism as a reform that could address many legislative and budgetary problems for states.</p>
<p>In Australian states the lower house was traditionally elected based on the one-vote-one-value principle, whereas the upper house was partially appointed and elected, with a bias towards country voters. In Queensland, the appointed <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland_Legislative_Council_cf6c.html" title="Queensland Legislative Council">upper house</a> was abolished in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, while <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_238d.html" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> there were similar attempts at abolition, before the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council_e58b.html" title="New South Wales Legislative Council">upper house</a> was reformed in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> to provide for direct election. Nowadays, the upper house is elected using proportional voting and the lower house through preferential voting, except in <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmania.html" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, where proportional voting is used for the lower house, and preferential voting for the upper house.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.cfr.org/pdf/Arab_Democracy_TF.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.cfr.org/pdf/Arab_Democracy_TF.pdf" rel="nofollow">2005 report</a> on democratic reform in the Arab world by the US <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_on_Foreign_Relations_1730.html" title="Council on Foreign Relations">Council on Foreign Relations</a> co-sponsored by former Secretary of State <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madeleine_Albright_11f8.html" title="Madeleine Albright">Madeleine Albright</a> urged Arab states to adopt bicameralism, with upper chambers appointed on a 'specialised basis'. The Council claimed that this would protect against the 'tyranny of the majority', expressing concerns that without a system of checks and balances extremists would use the single chamber parliaments to restrict the rights of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minority.html" title="Minority">minority</a> groups.</p>
<p>In 2002, <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahrain.html" title="Bahrain">Bahrain</a> adopted a bicameral system with an elected lower chamber and an appointed upper house. This led to a boycott of parliamentary elections that year by the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Wefaq_7889.html" title="Al Wefaq">Al Wefaq</a> party, who said that the government would use the upper house to veto their plans. Many secular critics of bicameralism were won round to its benefits in 2005, after many MPs in the lower house voted for the introduction of so-called 'morality police'.</p>
