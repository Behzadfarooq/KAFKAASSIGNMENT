<p>the page says: The highest speed ever attained on the flat, without riding behind a wind-block, is by Canadian Sam Whittingham, who in 2001 set a 80.55 mph or 142.51 km/h</p>
<p>but, 80.55 mph is in fact 129.63 km/h and 142.51 km/h is 88.55 mph i think that who wrote this mistyped the 88.55 mph, and the 142.51 km/h is right. but i'm not sure, that's why i didn't made a correction yet</p>

<p>Should this section not cover or link techniques for integrating bike use with car use by sharing lanes where necessary, such as those favoured by Johns Franklin (UK) and Forrester (US)? I don't mean a reiteration, more a summary and an explanation of why such a technique might be used. What about something like:</p>
<p><i>Some cyclists favour the encouragement of good technique among adult cyclists when on the road over the widespread introduction of on- and off-road cycle trails, tracks and lanes. Their arguments are that such facilities are often poor and unswept compared to the main road network, and that in most jurisdictions the rider of a bicyle is treated in law as a road user with the full rights and responsibilities of any road vehicle user. Such cyclists often encourage a style of roadcraft involving the use of full road lanes by cyclists where the cyclist's own safety benefits from this, and where other road users are not needlessly impeded by the slower vehicle.</i></p>

<p>Amended false claim regarding "virtually all" North American cyclists using helmets. I have been unable to find any source that would support such a claim. The pro-helmet "Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute" puts their best guess at 25% <a href="http://www.helmets.org/stats.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.helmets.org/stats.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.helmets.org/stats.htm</a> --<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 13:32, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A university study from Detroit reported that between 60% (on short rides) and 100 % (on longer rides) of American bicyclists were observed to wear helmets. A Canadian study showed &gt;3/4ths of B.C. cyclists, without regard to whether they were on organized trips, were helmeted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The BHSI spokesman described his 25% as a "wild guess", which is way off both the statistics displayed further down that website (which as was pointed out is politically motivated ... and wisely so, I believe) and personal observations. Until recently I was usually the sole unhelmeted maverick on many bicycle outings, until my boss's husband died from head injuries in a low-speed crash a couple of years ago. In suburban Washington, DC it is RARE to see a cyclist without a helmet on anything longer than a ride to the neighborhood store.<a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 23:08, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I cannot dispute your assertions as to helmet wearing rates in your local area - however what income groups are represented? What colour is their skin?. What is the wearing rate in poorer districts? I think it would be unwise to extrapolate this local rate to the entire North Americian continent. As for the BC wearing rates they have a local helmet law therefore this rate cannot be reasonably extrapolated to cover areas without such laws. Also if we are talking North America - where does that leave Mexico or do they count? --<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 11:26, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Who knows about Mexico, but I ride in a blue-collar county (predominantly African-american, though I don't see how that is rlvnt) where most cycliists are helmeted. On group rides a cyclist without a helmet stands out like a cigar smoker in church. i got to think that 25% and 'virtully all' are opposite extremes. It's probably more like seatbelt use; on highways it's &gt;95% and on back roads who knows. My guess for helmets in Eng-spkng N.A. on trips over a couple of miles is ... 80%. srf</dd>
</dl>
<p>The end of the "activism" section of "bicycle" sounds controversial. I've heard some studies, which purported to show huge safety gains from using helmets, criticized for ignoring the possibility that helmet laws reduced the number of cyclists and this then caused the reduced head injuries. But ... and I ask this naively ... are some groups really claiming that helmet use INCREASES the rate of head injuries? And, is the current wiki article endorsing this view ... or just reporting on it? It's not clear which from the text.<a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 04:08, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dealing with the last first: yes there is evidence suggesting that helmet laws and helmet promotion has being accompanied by increases in risk of injury. As to the skin colour etc argument this is entirely relevant. In short, one of the most prominent US claims for "huge safety gains" from helmets was obtained by comparing the injury severities of mainly white, middle class, children cycling in parks under parental supervision and comparing these with mainly black, city centre kids cycling unsupervised on city streets. The differences in injury patterns were attributed to the higher helmet wearing rate in the former group. In my view, much of what passes for helmet research in the US is at best <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junk_science.html" title="Junk science">junk science</a> and at worst <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_misconduct.html" title="Scientific misconduct">scientific misconduct</a>, certainly the whole issue has raised serious questions regarding the peer review procedures operated by some journals.

<dd>Interesting stuff, especially the commentary on the Brit.Med.Assn link from the "bicycle helmet" page. Curiously, I've been a lone voice arguing against the humongous helmets used in (American) football, which not only apply as much force as they absorb, but also subject the wearer to much more torque than would occur say, in rugby, which I played in college. We got lots of busted noses, but head and neck injuries were much less common than in football. There must be a HUGE difference "across the pond" on this issue, since you would only rarely get an argument here from a cyclist (I used to get berated for riding bareheaded on group trips), and NEVER from a medical person, on the advisability of helmeting. Myself, I think the protective effect (many claim 80% fewer head injuries!) is exagerrated by the American studies, but opponents' claims of INCREASED injuries, and the reasons cited in those links for them, are spurious.<a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 23:04, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The POV stuff on helmets in "bicycle" is now better, as it is stated as the opinion of the anti-helmet lobby, so this beyond the point, but briefly: the claims that more will be injured as the # of cyclists falls below some critical mass is bizarre, as it would take a ton of quitters to accomplish this; suggesting that helmet lids will increase torque and cause injuries is like saying that seatbelts in cars is bad because someone once drowned (vs. thousands saved) when he couldn't get out of his belt; claims that the helmets "grab" the concrete harder are way outdated and irrelevant to the new plastic helmets; helmets making some lunkheads do crazy things has no relevance to increasing MY safety by wearing one; and on and on. Don't get me wrong on this. I am talking about encouraging, not requiring, helmets. I think for better or worse they will become in Europe what they have become here (and in bike racing I imagine are most everywhere): better and accepted.<a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 00:17, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Really...? I went to university in the UK, and the police would frown (if not stop) you if you were riding without a helmet. Also, the biggest helmet users seemed to be the 'pro' cyclists. However, my experiences in France and Belgium indicate that, in other parts of Europe, wearing a helmet is far more uncommon.

<dd>It seems that the more accurate statement would be something along the lines of:</dd>
<dd><i>In the United States helmet use is governed by local regulations. In most instances helmet use is mandatory for children and infants, and in some locales it is also mandatory for adults. Among the utility cyclists the view on helmet use varies, but most hobbyists and competitive cyclists are proponents of helmet use. The [<a href="http://www.usacycling.org/forms/2005_USCF_rulebook.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.usacycling.org/forms/2005_USCF_rulebook.pdf" rel="nofollow">USCF rulebook</a>] even strongly states that "At all times when participating in an event held under a USA Cycling event permit, including club rides, any rider on a bicycle or motorcycle shall wear a protective, securely fastened helmet that satisfies the standards specified in USA Cycling Policies. (See Policy I, Sections 1 and 2.) [disqualification and a $20 fine for failure to wear or for removing such a helmet during a race. The fine is also applicable if the rider is not racing, but is participating in the event as described below]. 'Participating in an event' means riding a bicycle in the vicinity of a race at any time between the beginning of registration and the last awarding of prizes, but does not apply to riding rollers or stationary trainers in order to warm up. "</i></dd>
<dd>By contrast, the UCI did not make helmet use <b>in racing</b> mandatory until 2003-2004. And there is not helmet rule for riding outside of UCI races. In Europe you see many racer-types train without wearing a helmet, while in the US most wear a helmet. Cultural difference.</dd>
<dd>So we should make a distinction between the different cycling "cultures" to be more accurate and not overly generalize. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulius.kusuma_e7e3.html" title="User:Julius.kusuma">Julius.kusuma</a> 18:59, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Questions regarding specific regulations for racing cyclists are best left to pages that concern racing cycling. Similarly detailed discussions of general US <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle_helmet.html" title="Bicycle helmet">Bicycle helmet</a> regulations should go on that page. The UK is only one country out of 20+ European countries and even within the UK helmet use varies considerably from area to area. Also since the levels of cycling in the UK are quite low the number of adult utility cyclists in the UK is only a fraction of the European total. Hence it could be argued that one persons isolated experience of cycling in the UK does not negate the general European experience --<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 11:18, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Further to this, a recent national survey of helmet wearing among the UK subset of the European cycling population found as follows: Cycle helmet use on major built up roads was 25%, on minor build up roads the wearing rate was found to be 9.5% (27,164 cyclists observed) Source: <a href="http://www.trl.co.uk/static/dtlr/cycling/578summary.pd" class="external text" title="http://www.trl.co.uk/static/dtlr/cycling/578summary.pd" rel="nofollow">TRL Report 578 Cycle Helmet Wearing in 2002</a> --<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 12:41, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gyroscope</span></h2>
<p>This is just nonsense:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Once underway, a bicycle's upright position is largely maintained by gyroscopic forces generated by the rotation of its wheels. Physicists refer to this phenomenon as <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precession.html" title="Precession">precession</a>, the effect of which also stabilizes a spinning top.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Bicycles stay upright by making small steering movements to keep the wheels under the centre of gravity. The geometry of the bicycle frame assists with these movements by turning the front wheel towards the side to which the bike is leaning.</p>
<p>Any cyclist can tell you that staying upright does not get harder as you slow down. You can come almost to a stop without any difficulty, although the slow speed means that the steering movements become bigger. If gyroscopic forces were at work then balance would get harder as you slowed down. <a href="../../../g/d/r/User%7EGdr_e4cb.html" title="User:Gdr">Gdr</a> 23:36, 2004 Oct 28 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This objection is all wet. Any fool can roll a coin upright across the floor and see that the spinning motion is what keeps it upright, while it immediately falls flat when it slows. Anyone who has been on a bicycle knows you need "little steering motions" at first, but that you can easily ride "no hands" once you get over 5 mph, and you can not balance at all ... hands or no ... while standing still. Bike mechanics like to get a wheel spinning, then pull it off the axle and demonstrate the surprising pull toward the perpendicular when they hold it spinning between their hands. And physicists have named all this "precession".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>When this article was first proposed for "featured status", one critic asked for more info on this phenomenon. I did the research, and included it. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 00:44, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was the critic who objected to the featured article status because of the missing explanation why a bicycle remains upright. The <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precession.html" title="Precession">precession</a> explanation is, as far as I know, generally accepted. I think that the sentence should be re-inserted. The precession explanation may not be the whole story though. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:33, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The sentence should not be included, because it is wrong. A correct explanation of how a bicycle remains upright would look something like this:
<dl>
<dd><i>A rider stays upright on a bicycle by steering the bicycle so that the point where the wheels touch the ground stays underneath the center of gravity. When the rider find himself leaning slightly to the left, he steers the bicycle to the left to counteract the fall; when he finds himself leaning to the right he steers to the right. The faster the bicycle is going the quicker the bicycle comes back under the center of gravity and hence the smaller the steering needs to be; at speeds over about 10&#160;km/h the steering movements are quite imperceptible to the rider, but they are clear when the track of the wheels is traced along the ground. A feature of bicycle geometry — known as</i> trail <i>— assists the rider with steering: the contact point of the front wheel with the ground is behind the line of the steering axis. Trail means that when the bicycle leans to one side, the wheel turns to that side — exactly the motion needed to correct the lean. This "self-steering" effect is sufficiently strong that a riderless bicycle going down a slope will stay upright by itself. Gyroscopic forces generated by the spinning wheels also contribute to the self-steering effect, though their contribution is small, as the self-steering effect can be demonstrated at low speeds when the gyroscopic forces are negligible. Some people (reference needed here) believe that gyroscopic forces help balance a bicycle directly, but this is not the case: a bicycle with counter-rotating wheels canceling any gyroscopic forces is no harder to ride than an ordinary bicycle (David Jones, "The Stability of the Bicycle", Physics Today (April 1970): 34-40.)</i></dd>

<p>The gyroscope myth seems very commonly held. Let me see if I can disabuse you of it by some simple plausibility arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>No matter how fast you go, you still make steering motions. Examine the track left by a bicycle tyre on the pavement. It is not a straight line, but makes shallow curves to the left and right. The movements become smaller as you go faster, because at higher speeds it takes less time to move the bicycle back underneath your centre of gravity and so you don't need to steer so much to get the same effect.</li>
<li>When you ride "no hands" you still make steering movements, just not by pushing on the handlebars. Again, you can check this by looking at the track.</li>
<li>If gyroscopic forces were the main element in balance, then bicycles would be as easy to ride on ice as they are on dry pavement.</li>
<li>Children have to learn to ride bicycles.</li>
<li>Trick bicycles with the steering connected the wrong way round are impossible for experienced cyclists to ride at first.</li>
<li>You can balance a bicycle at very slow speeds: I checked today and I was easily able to balance at one rotation every 10 seconds (about 0.8 km/h). The gyroscopic forces are negligible at this speed compared to the force exterted by my weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>And a reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Bicycling Science</i> by Frank Whitt and David Wilson cites a study by David Jones, who cancelled the gyroscopic forces in the wheel with a counterrotating wheel to try to make an unridable bicycle. The modified bicycle was no harder to balance than the original.</li>

<ul>
<li>Whoever started this off with the "this is nonsense" comment is doing this forum a disservice. The only issue here is at what point gyroscopic precession and related physical phenomena which have nothing to do with the rider kick in and contribute substantially to maintenance of the upright position. I agree with most physicists that this is sooner rather than later. The child argument above is irrelevant. Of course, it takes practice to get started, but once going (?5,?10,?15m(m.or km.)/hr) physics clearly kicks in, and the youngster looks like he's been cycling for years. The tire marks on the ground are also irrelevant - they will be observed whether the bicycle is rider-controlled or simply running down a hill on its own, which it will do forever because of the physics of precession and angular momentum which not only keep the bike upright but also tend to direct the wheels straight ahead. Try to slide a skate upright across a hockey rink ... it will tip right over just as if it were standing still. In any event, the "nonsense" comment at the start of this otherwise civilized discussion is, in the view of any (of the many) physicists and bicyclists I know, inaccurate at best. As the starting point of a discussion, it is offensive and immature. srf</li>

<p>Yes, I had several problems: 1. see above re human/biological efficiency vs. mechanical efficiency, which were added to this article long ago by other writers and which refer to two separate things. the "as measured" phrases made this clear, as does reading the footnotes. 2. for the reasons i gave, i think "precession" has lots to do with stabilizing a fast-moving bicycle. interestingly, this section originated from a suggestion by a prior "featured article" reviewer. i read up on it, tested it, discussed it with a department head physicist, and included it with the proviso that it was in play only after initial balancing (such as the child mentioned above learns) got the rider started, and that it only 'helps to maintain' the upright position. roll a wheel down a hill. it doesn't tip over until it stops. perhaps a compromise statement would suffice, rather than ones simply erasing it. 3. someone butchered the section on "lighting" while apparently trying to link "halogen" lighting. 4.the "penny farthing" is described later in the article. these are unfamiliar terms to non-U.K. readers, so i chose the more commonly-used "Ordinary" for the main text. 5. re the top picture: this, unfortunately is the most common bike seen on streets in North America. i actually sent out work for a picture of a "European" style bicycle but got nothing suitable.

<p>"Man, unaided by any tool, gets around quite efficiently. He carries one gram of his weight over a kilometer in ten minutes by expending 0.75 calories. Man on his feet is thermodynamically more efficient than any motorized vehicle and most animals. For his weight, he performs more work in locomotion than rats or oxen, less than horses or sturgeon. At this rate of efficiency man settled the world and made its history. At this rate peasant societies spend less than 5 per cent and nomads less than 8 per cent of their respective social time budgets outside the home or the encampment."</p>
<p>"Man on a bicycle can go three or four times faster than the pedestrian, but uses five times less energy in the process. He carries one gram of his weight over a kilometer of flat road at an expense of only 0.15 calories. The bicycle is the perfect transducer to match man's metabolic energy to the impedance of locomotion. Equipped with this tool, man outstrips the efficiency of not only all machines but all other animals as well."</p>
<p>"Bicycles are not only thermodynamically efficient, they are also cheap. With his much lower salary, the Chinese acquires his durable bicycle in a fraction of the working hours an American devotes to the purchase of his obsolescent car. The cost of public utilities needed to facilitate bicycle traffic versus the price of an infrastructure tailored to high speeds is proportionately even less than the price differential of the vehicles used in the two systems. In the bicycle system, engineered roads are necessary only at certain points of dense traffic, and people who live far from the surfaced path are not thereby automatically isolated as they would be if they depended on cars or trains. The bicycle has extended man's radius without shunting him onto roads he cannot walk. Where he cannot ride his bike, he can usually push it."</p>
<p>"The bicycle also uses little space. Eighteen bikes can be parked in the place of one car, thirty of them can move along in the space devoured by a single automobile. It takes three lanes of a given size to move 40,000 people across a bridge in one hour by using automated trains, four to move them on buses, twelve to move them in their cars, and only two lanes for them to pedal across on bicycles. Of all these vehicles, only the bicycle really allows people to go from door to door without walking. The cyclist can reach new destinations of his choice without his tool creating new locations from which he is barred."</p>
<p>"Bicycles let people move with greater speed without taking up significant amounts of scarce space, energy, or time. They can spend fewer hours on each mile and still travel more miles in a year. They can get the benefit of technological breakthroughs without putting undue claims on the schedules, energy, or space of others. They become masters of their own movements without blocking those of their fellows. Their new tool creates only those demands which it can also satisfy. Every increase in motorized speed creates new demands on space and time. The use of the bicycle is self-limiting. It allows people to create a new relationship between their life-space and their life-time, between their territory and the pulse of their being, without destroying their inherited balance. The advantages of modern self-powered traffic are obvious, and ignored. That better traffic runs faster is asserted, but never proved. Before they ask people to pay for it, those who propose acceleration should try to display the evidence for their claim."</p>

<p>Query this claim regarding self-steer. It is my understanding that the self-steer or "steerability" phenomenon with bicycles is primarily related to the relative positions of the front axle with relation to the steering axis of the forks and the angle of that steering axis. That is why the forks tend to be at an angle to the ground and why the forks are usually swept forward of the steering axis. (Objective is actually to counteract self-steer)--<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 11:03, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Somewhere in this "discussion", Gdr explained the significance of both forking the front wheel forward and the contact point of wheel with ground being positioned slightly behind the turning radius of the wheel. I believe that these contribute ... and perhaps even are vital to ... this whole <i>trail</i> phenomenon which self-steers the thing. The article is already 30kb though, and I don't think any more space should go to the physics stuff. I hope to better "internationalize" the political section, which others wrote long before I got there, today. BTW, I changed the "brakes" section too, re sf's objection. And, finally, I hope this generally excellent article makes it through this process. People will actually READ this one, as opposed to some of the goofy articles (Pepsi can stove?) that get to "feature" status unscathed.<a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 16:49, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">brakes</span></h2>
<p>I don't like a lot of the seciton on brakes.</p>
<p>"The larger tires on mountain bicycles present a braking problem, since they are not accommodated by the usual calipers." Millions of department store bikes were built with wide tires and standard calipers. They work, although poorly. I think this unfortunate fact should be recognised by saying "since a standard caliper big enough to fit has extremely poor performance, and this is frequently made even worse by the use of steel rims" or something similar, rather than pretending bikes aren't built this way.</p>
<p>The advantage of V brakes over cantilevers is greatly overstated. Properly set up, V and cantis are equal in performance. Since there is a seperate article on bike brakes, comparison of V to canti should probably go there.</p>
<p>In most cases disks aren't used for increased stopping power, but rather for better handling of adverse conditions like mud. Again, other than acknowleging their existance, specifics probalby belong in the bike brakes article.</p>

<p>This page is getting way long (hip U.S.-speak for "very long"). Although much was accomplished here, now that the "feature" nomination went down (narrowly, with 8 supporters, 2 objectors) it is now mostly outdated. If there are no objections in the next couple of days, does anyone mind if I delete down to today's comments re brakes?

There is a lot of weird new (and misspelled) detail in the history section, too much detail on brakes (as someone pointed out above) which would better go in the "brake system" place, and a long passage on "modal design" (?) which is pretty far out for an article on "bicycle". srf</dd>

<p>The passage on police use of bikes needs to come out of the <i>war</i> section. The use of bicycles for policing is well-established and probably predates any military use. Similarly the postal systems of many countries relied and still rely on bicycle delivery, a huge economic and social impact which isn't yet acknowledged. --<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 10:43, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Time to break away some sections into new articles?</span></h2>
<p>This article is starting to get slightly longer than recomended. This may not really be an issue and it is a diverse topic that needs a balanced treatment. However, there are sections that might be good candidates for movement to their own articles e.g. (as suggestions) the list of bicycle types/clasifications and possibly the Bicycles and War section. The latter probably deserves broader treatment anyway but is not, in my view, a particularly key aspect of general bicycle history.--<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 17:48, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've said this already, but I believe that, if brief enough, each of the current sections is relevant ... even if mainly as an invitation for readers to go to a more detailed section. The main overreach now is the "Modal design" section, most of which belongs in another, extant article, such as "auto-free zones", "bicycling", etc.<a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 00:02, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The correct term is "modal share" and is a standard description used in the international literature concerning the relative participation rates of various forms of transport. The presence or absence of "auto free zones" or "pedestrian areas" is not an accurate predictor of the likely extent of the modal share enjoyed by bicycles in the wider vehicle mix. The term "bicycling", as I understand it to be used in US English, relates primarily to the use of bicycles for sport or recreational purposes. The standard English term "cycle" or "cycling" has a more catholic application. Hence "bicycling" would seem to be inappropriate to discussions regarding the use of bicycles as transport vehicles. The idea that disussions of "courting radius" should stay here while discussions of the bicycle's role in transportation should go elsewhere, would in my view, be very hard to defend.--<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 14:40, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Before I nominated this article for "feature" status, I deleted or sanitized a lot of goofy stuff that others had written (such as the silly "gene pool" comment) but left some marginal things which I wouldn't myself have included, such as "courting radius". This is of course a communal effort. I don't think the presence of one (or more) marginal bits of info. justifies adding others. I don't believe an encyc. article on "bicycle" ... and I read the Britannica one recently ... would have a passage like "modal". The war section, too, is overlong, but I didn't write it ... in fact I whittled it down and corrected it in places in response to others' suggestions. It is interesting, and since no one objected to its being included, I left it there. I think I will, though, shorten it. Feel free to dl "courting radius". <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a> 00:05, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, i don't like having good info deleted so i've reverted <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfahey_e531.html" title="User:Sfahey">Sfahey</a>'s deletions and moved the section to a new article, <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycles_in_warfare.html" title="Bicycles in warfare">Bicycles in warfare</a>. If there were any corrections you made in that last change you might have to do them again. I've left a skeleton section in the <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle.html" title="Bicycle">Bicycle</a> article, but it reads like it was written for "the amazing world of military bicycles" or something. Some more general statements might be better. Also I've moved the bit about police with bicycles together with the rest, but it doesn't really fit the heading "Bicycles in warfare". Not sure what to do with it. Hope the change isn't too disruptive. --<a href="../../../p/e/n/User%7EPengo_70fc.html" title="User:Pengo">Pengo</a> 04:08, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Old car lobby/environmental lobby trick</span></h2>
<p>User 206.191.1.215 put in a reference to community surveys in the activism section. There are those who would view this as an old car lobby/ environmental lobby propaganda trick. The sequence goes something like this.</p>
<p>A) Initiate a media and political campaign to promote the idea that the main obstacle to cycling participation is a lack of "cycling facilities".</p>
<p>B) Play this up in the media - release statements talking about how dangerous the roads are without "cycle facilities" and condemning the failure of politicians to implement this obvious measure. The object is to play to the lowest commmon denominator by reducing the issue of cycling safety to one single issue by excluding/ignoring all the other awkward issues such as speeding, road design, town layouts, parking, education etc etc.</p>
<p>C) After a sustained campaign, commission a survey to ask uninformed members of the public "what they need" to be able to cycle more. If required use carefully filtered multiple-choice type questions. If you've done your job properly (from a marketing perspective) the public will repeat your initial message back to you.</p>
<p>D) You will now have survey "evidence" confirming the message being pushed at point A) and which can then be fed back into the system.</p>
<p>Of course the important point is that the survey is irrelevent as an indicator of the actual effect of the proposed cycling facilities in increasing cycling. There are numerous case studies testing this hypothesis from actual towns and cities - in many cases the hypothesis has proven false. --<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 15:03, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmmm... In the PHYSICS section, it is inaccurate to say that the ground applies "torque" to the wheels. At least in this context, referring to the rake/trail of a fork and its self-balancing tendency. In this scenario there is only the FRICTION FORCE between tire and pavement. The only torque that exists between tire and pavement is during the rotation of the front wheel, which is minimal during pedaling at any significant speed. I would like to propose better text but no time tonight...</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">mph vs km/h error</span></h2>
<p>Under "Performance" the claim is that it takes around 500 watts to ride at 30 km/h. Unless you have the cross-section of a blimp, this is incorrect. It would take in the neighborhood of 500 watts to ride at 30 <b>mph</b> not 30 <b>km/h</b>. For a normal-sized rider it takes less than 200 watts to ride at 30 km/h.</p>
<p>In addition, when comparing the tops of the distributions, top women riders do not have a higher power-to-weight ratio than top men riders.
