<p>I am pretty confident the vandal was Steven M Scharf (scharf.steven). He does not like dynamo (generator) lights and (as usual when he gets a fixed idea) is very dogmatic about it. There have been long arguments on rec.bicycles.* not helped by the fact that Scharf rather immodestly styles himself "one of Earth's leading experts on bicycle lighting" - and on a number of other topics. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 08:24, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The statement that the US is "noted for permitting unlit cycling" is not true. Every US state requires that a bicycle operated at night be equipped with a red tail light and a white headlight, and cyclists can be fined for cycling at night without proper lights. It is extremely common for US cyclists to cycle without lights, and a very high percentage of American cyclists have no idea that lights are required. The widespread perception that bicycles are toys and not real vehicles is partly to blame for this situation, as is the widespread belief that the reflectors installed on bicycles sold in the US satisfy the law and provide adequate visibility.</p>
<p><br />
Checked on this, I am given to understand that in the US, the Uniform Vehicle Code (UVC) historically only specified a white front light, and a red rear reflector. I believe the UVC was recently changed to include a rear red light requirement for bicycles. As I understand it, the UVC is only an aggreed model for traffic legislation and has no legal force in and of itself. As I understand it, many states still reflect the "whit light/red reflector" requirement only but may also "permit" cyclists to use a red light as well or as an alternative. --<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 10:11, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Had a thought about putting in a breakdown of night versus day fatality rates by way of explaining the rationale behind "the generally considered unsafe to cycle without lights" issue. Plus maybe something to give a bit more of the flavour of the conspicuity versus perspicuity debate. etc. However, I intend being up a mountain for the next week or more so it won't be my edit in the immediate future. --<a href="../../../s/f/_/User%7ESf_523f.html" title="User:Sf">Sf</a> 15:56, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would think that there should be some note that there are three basic types of dynamos: bottle, bottom bracket, and hub.

<p>With the development of high power LED front lights that rival 10W halogen lights, the last sentence that suggested they were suitable only for occasional or emergency use is clearly incorrect. I have modified it to read "Self-contained LED front lights have reached a stage where some are viable alternatives to conventional bicycle lights although the majority are more suitable for being seen or emergency use only."</p>

<p>I added the paragraph "Most cycling organisations advocate the use of lights for night riding although, surprisingly, there is no reliable published evidence that lights make a measurable difference to safety in an urban context." - it has been tagged with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} a couple of times.</p>
<p>I am a cycle activist, and take a close interest in safety issues. I amke a habit of looking for and reading published evidence, and I have a number of friends who help me in this. I have looked long and hard for evidence in respect of lighting, this search has been largely fruitless. I have found references to one paper which states that retro-reflective material on the arms increases passing distances, b ut no evidence that shows any meausurable effect from the use of lights or other conspicuity aids.</p>
<p>According to the scientific method, scepticism is the default. In other words, before we can state in the article that lighting is important to safety (which we seem to do) we must first prove it. I cannot do that, although I have tried, but my literature bases are not good on that subject (much better on helmets).</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned we can either state that organisations such as CTC advocate use of lights, but intellectual honesty requires that we own up to lacking prof that it makes any difference. The dynamo pictures were of my bikes, I have spent more on lights for each of my bikes than most people spend on the entire bike, I am an enthusiastic advocate of lights, but I do not know of any evidence to back this position.

<li>Thank you for that explanation. Since the claim that "... there is no reliable published evidence ..." is based on original research, that portion of the new material does not comply with the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a> policy. To avoid losing the other points that you made, I've incorporated the following derived material into the Safety section:
<ul>
<li>"...almost all cycling organizations unconditionally advocate using a headlight at night..."</li>
<li>"...the majority of unlit cyclists are riding in urban areas with many streetlights.... the additional conspicuousness afforded by bicycle lights may not always provide a significant safety benefit under those conditions,..."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>Both of those are original research as well. It is not OR to say that no evidence is known; that is an inference drawn from the lack of available material and is therefore based on the published evidence base (i.e: none). Seriously. I've tried again. The problem is that the article had text which drew novel inferences or represented uncited opinion; I know fomr past experience that evidecne is elusive, and I think intellectual honesty demands that we say so, even while nnoting that every reliable authority strongly recommends light use. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:48, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Great article, there are some incorrect statements however.</p>
<p><i>The brightest type is the high power High Intensity Discharge (H.I.D) light, which requires special circuitry and a powerful battery</i> - Is incorrect.</p>
<p><b>Firstly</b>, currently the most powerful HID lamp is an over charged 10 watt, which will produce the equivalent of a 40 watt lamp (roughly). The brightest lights are infact Halogen lamps. The reason they are not mentioned is that they draw so much power they drain batteries very quickly. The point is however that the "brightest type is..." high power halogen lamps, not HID.</p>
<p><b>Secondly</b>, HID lamps as stated above draw 10 watts making them surprisingly efficient. Therefore they do not need powerful batteries.</p>
<p>The is some concern around the <i>legal requirements</i> the author breezes over the change in UK law about flashing LEDs. This was one of the industries pivotal moments, this should be stressed. Secondly, the author completely omits any reference to BSI standards, which in the UK stipulates what is road legal or not. BSI specifies, horizontal angle from ground level and beam divergence to the sides (thus preventing blinding of oncoming traffic and ensuring safety from the sides).</p>
<p><b>The external link is extremely concerning</b>. It links to a bike light manufacturer in Germany. <b>By German law these lights are illigal</b> (law stipulates that bicycle lights be "dynamo systems" which these are not). <b>Secondly not one of these systems meets the BSI standards</b>. Thirdly the page demonstrates only systems the manufacturers' produce, this is <b>blatant advertising</b>. Very bad news. <b>Remove it</b>.</p>

<p>Modern Ni-MH batteries should last just as long as an Alkline battery, so I am deleting the paragraph stating that recharagable batteries don't last very long.</p>
