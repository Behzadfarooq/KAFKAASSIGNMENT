<p>We could use some help at <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_A._Yeagley_0940.html" title="David A. Yeagley">David A. Yeagley</a>, where at least two anon IPs have repeatedly blanked the entire article and substitute a "hatchet job" bio containing negative unsourced statements. It's been going on for some time now and has escalated to the point of edit warring. I have left messages on the discussion pages of the anons, but in vain; they refuse to use "discussion" or edit in good faith without blanking the original text.</p>
<p>The offending editors are 64.238.136.39 and 216.177.172.11, with very similar edits having also been made by <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrent_Michael_Davids_3b51.html" title="User:Brent Michael Davids">User:Brent Michael Davids</a>, User:Verity Truth, and 162.83.249.112. An IP check is probably in order due to possible sock puppet activity to avoid 3RR or repercussions on the registered user names.</p>

<p>This article has been created by Ken Avidor. Ken Avidor is a known opponent (with few scruples) of Dr. Anderson's lifelong goals. I scanned the article and found at least one case of taking a quote out of context. The article focuses on local Minneapolis politics, which is not necessarily appropriate to a discussion of Dr. Anderson's achievements. In order to prevent a minor recurrence of the Siegenthaler incident I suggest a rigorous review of this article. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDunning_3955.html" title="User:Dunning">Bob</a> 04:47, 10 December 2006 (UTC) (moved from <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 05:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>I saw this while lurking AN/I, and took a look. Not only does the article suffer from a number of mis- or non-contextualized ironic statements, which standing alone present the appearance of a man who changes his opinion on his life's work with the wind, but it also features a large amount of redundant linking, which initially served to look like there was a LOT of opposition to his ideas. I took a whack at cutting the fat, and contetualizing some of it, but one quote absolutely had to go. I have NEVER heard of this guy before, but it's clean there's a LOT of POV-pushing going on at that article. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 05:45, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is it possible to block someone for willful POV pushing by creating an article about their enemy? I know there was the famous case where Wikipedia had to block the whole House and Senate because people kept on defacing their opponents' pages. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">edits</a></sup> 06:03, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have a long (one year) history with Ken Avidor, both here (see <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersonal_rapid_transit_Avidor_e31e.html" title="Talk:Personal rapid transit/Avidor">Talk:Personal rapid transit/Avidor</a>) and off-wiki. He is <i>virulently</i> against PRT, and he has ridiculed PRT proponents on his web pages and blogs (<a href="http://www.roadkillbill.com/PRTisaJoke.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roadkillbill.com/PRTisaJoke.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://dumpmarkolson.blogspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://dumpmarkolson.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). He commonly refers to Anderson as a "PRTista" and the "wacky professor". His anti-PRT campaign is so famous and widespread among the PRT community that there are two blogs devoted to debunking Avidor's claims (<a href="http://innovative-transit.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://innovative-transit.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://weinerwatch.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://weinerwatch.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> - this one created by yours truly).</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Having said all that, I've read the Anderson article and, compared to Avidor's typical work, it's actually not too bad. His opinions on this topic are so extreme that I honestly believe that this article is about as neutral as he is capable of producing on someone like Anderson. This is <i>not</i> to say the article is acceptable (ThuranX has already improved it significantly, and it still has a lot of issues), but rather, I don't think the POV pushing was necessarily "willful", or a sign of bad faith. I think it's entirely possible that this is his idea of neutral.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>The question now is, will he fight changes to the article? He has already predicted (off-wiki) that <a href="http://dumpmarkolson.blogspot.com/2006/12/like-his-prt-pal-gary-dean-zimmermann.html" class="external text" title="http://dumpmarkolson.blogspot.com/2006/12/like-his-prt-pal-gary-dean-zimmermann.html" rel="nofollow"><i>"PRTistas (will) take a meat-axe to it..."</i></a>. So I think it would be best for those of us whom he views as proponents (<a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Grant_0b5a.html" title="User:Mr Grant">User:Mr Grant</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDunning_3955.html" title="User:Dunning">User:Dunning</a>, and me) to avoid editing the article - maybe someone not associated with PRT can work on it instead? There's actually a lot of information there, and most of it seems pretty accurate, so it's really just a matter of toning it down.<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 09:45, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note that we are citing quite selectively from that article. For example, the reporter describe some outrageous claims made against Prem Rawat by Mishler such as that he engaged in practices to "subdue the ego" that included "stripping devotees, pouring abrasive chemicals on their bodies, and into their mouths, administering drugs, having them beaten with a stick or thrown into swimming pools", that are obviously sensationalists lies (and that even the most staunch detractors will attest to these being lies). I would say that the reason why, whoever added that selective quote did not add the other sensationalist material, may because undoubtedly demonstrates the lack of credibility of these protagonists and of the source. As exceptional claims require exceptional evidence, one could argue that this one-only source is in this case a "poor source" as per WP:BLP. Also note that these sensationalist allegations were never described in any secondary sources, probably because of lack of credibility. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 00:41, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The claims that you classify are as exceptional are not in the entry nor does anyone currently wants to add them, so I think that your comments are irrelevant. I omitted adding that part of the Washtington Post article to the entry because I could find no corroboration, in contrast to the claims of heavy drinking. I cannot know whether the excerpts that you quote are sensationalist lies or not because I was not there, though again, I do not intend to add them to the entry. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 00:55, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Selective quoting from one article, based on your presumption of lack of corroboration for the part you did not quote, but omitting the fact that there is lack of corroboration for the part you did include, is violating NOR and demonstrates a lack of good editorial judgment in assessing the reliability of a source. Any editor reading the whole quote will know that this is sensationalist BS and will avoiding touching that source in a BLP as being "poorly sourced". <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 03:42, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

An editor can make the assessment that as these extraordinary allegations are not reported in <i>any</i> other source, and given that there are hundreds of scholarly sources on the subject that do not mention any of that, these cab be assessed to be extraordinary claims that do not have the necessary support to be considered anything than a "poor source", in particular given the context in which these were made.

<dd>I will try: The article describes the opinion of Misher, saying that in a radio interview he said that PR "had tremendous problems of anxiety which he combatted with alcohol". The same article describes him as saying that PR engaged in "stripping devotees, pouring abrasive chemicals on their bodies, and into their mouths, administering drugs, having them beaten with a stick or thrown into swimming pools". These explosive allegations are not mentioned <b>in any other source besides this article</b>. None of the scholarly sources describe these traits even these sources that containing highly critical material, such as these from your favorite Dutch scholars. So, as a responsible editor, and given this is a BLP, we can safely assert that this source does not meet the threshold for being a high quality reference: <i>Be very firm about high quality references, particularly about details of personal lives</i>, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> advises us. And we should listen to that advise, not dismiss it on the basis of one's knowledge of "somewhat doubtful or non-reputable sources". <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 04:39, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jossi, the media articles were never retracted by the magazines.

<dd>You can keep saying "untrue" until you get blue in the face, Andries. But the fact is that there are many notable individuals about which there is abundant sources describing their life-work, and do not have a biography with an "extensive description of their lives". That does not mean that there is no material about their lives to serve as the basis for article about them in Wikipedia, and furthermore, that does not mean that we should use material that is unsuitable (as per the arguments I made above), just because there is not such biography available. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 17:07, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(unindent)As one coming fresh to this dispute, I see the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> as a fine example of a reliable source. Further, there is absolutely no requirement that an associate of the subject be a medical doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist to observe that he was anxious or stressed and that he drank a lot to deal with it. We as the readers can note that the quote is from a former associate and not from the man's doctor, who would in any event be forbidden from releasing such information by the strictures of medical ethics. The quote should be attributed to the person who said it, and should be complete enough that it is not taken out of context. Claiming that it is a "minority view" violating Wikipedia policy since most of the man's other followers have not described him as anxious or a heavy drinker is a red herring. The quote appears well sourced and should be included. If the other editors have a quote wherein a follower said in a reliable publication that he was not a drinker and was not anxious, they should add that. That is how a NPOV treatment of a subject works. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 00:29, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Jossi is mistaken when he writes as I may sunmarize his way of reasoning that a reputable source completely stops being a reputable source if it makes an uncorroborated implausible statement. Yes, may be he is right that we should omit mentioning in the Wikipedia entry the uncorroborated statement that he considers implausible (which I did). But of course, we can still use the corroborated statements from the reputable source for the Wikipedia entry. I think Jossi's reasoning "demonstrates a lack of good editorial judgment in assessing the reliability of a source", to use his own words. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 14:41, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you Edison, for your comments. Note that the discussion was not about about if the Washington Post is a reliable source or not, or if the comment made by these persons in the article can be attributed to them. The question was about the <i>selective quoting</i> from that source to avoid giving readers the possibility to understand the context in which they made these comments. Any sensible reader will most probably dismiss these outrageous allegations, if the have the opportunity to read all what they said. Andries decided to just add a specific allegatiion that <i>in his opinion</i> is plausible, while omitting others that are, in his opinion, implausible. My contention is that when you cite you cannot make these "editorial decisions", as you are engaging in a clear attempt to enhance the reputability of the source by selectively omitting material that shatters the credibility of the source. So, either we, as responsible editors do not use that source in a BLP, or we cite the comments of these people without selectively omitting other material. My opinion is that we should not use that source on the basis of it being "poorly sourced" in a BLP. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 22:02, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jossi, I consciously added only material from the Washington Post that is corroborated and omitting that is what uncorroborated. I often leave out uncorroborated statements from reputable sources or statements that I consider implausible. I am not going to change my habit in this regard of making good editorial decisions. Feel free to add more information from the Washington Post that will allow the reader to make an informed decision about the accusations. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 09:10, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An exceptional, sensationalst claim that is negative and uncorrororated from a biased, ex-employer who died in the 70's is unacceptable in a biography of a living person.

<dd>No, I think it is a non-exceptional claim voiced in a reputable source (<a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a>) that is more or less corroborated by other reputable sources such as Sophia Collier's book <i>Soul Rush</i> and by another inner circle member i.e. Dettmers (in among others an article by John Macgregor <i>Blinded by the Light</i> that appeared in Good Weekend The Sydney Morning Herald (Sydney) August 31, 2002). In addition it is corroborated by yet another inner circle member in a non-reputable source.

<dd>Straw man argument, Andries. The Washington Post article includes material from the same person that is my all means and "extraordinary claim". You decided to "censor" that material and leave other material that <i>you</i> consider to be not extraordinary, when it is when taken as a whole. John McGregor's legal imbroglio, and subsequent ruling by a judge coupled with his apology renders that source to be of the same quality: "poorly sourced". As per BLP, that material has no place in a WP article. Your continuous efforts to keep a partially censored reference to that Washington Post article, without addressing other editor's concerns about that material is a case of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 16:54, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Untrue. Again, there is not a single scholarly reputable article let alone book that treats Prem Rawat extensively. If you think otherwise then please provide such a source, as I had already requested to Jossi without result. In the absence of such sources, it is perfectly okay to use secondary source material from reputable newspapers, such as the article in the Washington Post. I would agree with Momento that if multiple scholarly reputable biographies are available, like in the case of Adolf Hitler then it would not be okay to use secondary source material from newsapers. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 19:04, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Untrue? There are nearly 100 notes and nearly 50 references cited for the Prem Rawat article and not a single one repeats Mishler's claim. We know Melton was aware of Mishler's sensationalist claims (and probably all PR scholars) but he quite rightly ignored them. Your suggestion that in the absence of any negative evidence from the dozens of reserarched and scholarly articles, editors should include negative material from a biased, ex-employee would turn Wikipedia into a gossip column.<a href="../../../m/o/m/User%7EMomento_b078.html" title="User:Momento">Momento</a> 21:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Read the entire discussion related to the blogs, Ekajati, not just what you want to read. You claim Cohen's blog is inherently permissable because he is the subject, but what is being said is that to the extent Cohen's blog and associated blogged statement of "Integrity" in response to critic's charges, which does really not meet the criteria for use because it contentious; unduly self-serving or self-aggrandizing; and makes claims about third parties and their motives for criticism; and whose claims are to be treated with caution per wikipedia; is being cited, then a critical blog containing responses to those charges by named subjects of Cohen's criticism should be referred also to retain NPOV. If as an alternative material from neither blog is mentioned, or the mere fact that Cohen and named critics have both established blogs advocating their respective positions without further information is mentioned, then you do not have, as you try and suggest, an issue with <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> that justifies your claims here. Your actual statment that:</dd>

<dd>"Also, please note that the use of the <i>subject's</i> blog <i>is</i> permitted, but only in an article about the subject. Do not attempt to retaliate by removing reference to and links to Cohen's blog. That could also result in administrative action."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>not only mistates the actual policies for when a subject's blogs are not suitable, but does not adequately justify keeping reference to Cohen's blog entries based on wikipedia criteria just because you desire to retain the blog, and does not justify your a priori assumption of bad faith and "retaliation", and threats of adminstrative action based on claimed "retaliation". It is not "retaliation" to respond to your assumptions and POV editing. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 06:20, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your assumption that I am working from a POV is incorrect. I have nothing to do with Cohen whatsover. I am attempting to apply <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> as written and intended. It is you who have a POV issue, and don't seem to be able to allow <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> to take precedent over your apparent need to smear the subject. <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkajati_914d.html" title="User:Ekajati">Ekajati</a> (<a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkajati_e47b.html" title="User talk:Ekajati">yakity-yak</a>) 19:26, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You openly consider editors who disagree with you to be apparently motivated by "smearing" the subject, an admission of a biased and unsubstatiated judgement which proves the POV you deny. Ekajati, Wikipedia has three content policies: <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. Since the policies complement each other, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should try to familiarize themselves with all three. Your POV edits do not take this into account. It is you making personal attacks, issuing threats of blocking and talking about "reprisals" when your one sided, POV edits are challenged. Your repeated explanation for your edits, that "blogs are not permitted per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>", is not what <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> actually says, and therefore your edits will be evaluated accordingly. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 02:04, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In summary, his own blog is permitted as an external link, and his own blog may be used as a source for NPOV biographical facts. No other blog may be, for BLP. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:17, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I assume from this summary you may not have read the full discussion here and in the article and considered it carefully as it is written. What I object to is use of selective cites from <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> and applying them to <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:ELwithout</a> considering all applicable guidance, the impact on NPOV, and the discussion of other editors who already know all that. Per WP:LIVING, if it were true that "information" from the blog was was being cited in the article, it would not be permitted. And per WP:EL, if were true that Cohen's blog did not include "information" including criteria that WP:EL sites as an exception to using material from Cohen's self-published blog, that is being contentious, self serving/aggrandizing, and making unsubstantiated charges about third parties, it would be permitted, either if information was used in the article as Ekajati proposes, or simply kept as a link. But that is not the case. And, this does not mean as Ekajati alleges "links to blogs are not permitted per WP:EL". Rather, WP does not prohibit links where the blog is authoritative and when the link improves the overall article (in this case NPOV). It does not mean Cohen's blog and/or statements from it MUST be referenced or links or face charges of "retaliation" when it skews NPOV and is not really biographical in nature. Further, none of the proposals we were current disputing were to cite information from the critical blog in the article, but simply to identify the existence of (relative to Cohen) the best critical and authoritative link on a reply to Cohen's assertions, whether to provide the link or just reference that it exists, thus WP is not providing derogatory information in the article. Whereas Ekajati proposes to leave as information not even just that Cohen has responded to critics on his blog, to which there is no objection, but that he is quote "setting the record straight" regarding his critics which is a matter of judgement, not fact, while excluding even the fact that critics have responded to his claims when there was no attempt to include information on what those responses were. WP also says both the claims of religious partisans and their critics are to be considered carefully. The intent here is not to put WP in the middle of the dispute or cite poorly sourced information in the article, but simply point out in neutral language the NPOV fact that the dispute exists, and leave it at that. Ideally, true NPOV considers both sides cautiously, and since both sides are using blogs, NPOV would be crafting a way of simply saying something along the lines of Cohen makes assertions on his blog about his actions and critics, and named critics have made assertions about his actions and responded to his assertions about critics on their blog, which keeps to the verfiable facts and without implying Wikipedia has taken a position on this particular issue, which omission of either side would. The only concern here of the editors in question preserving NPOV within the framework of BLP, and avoding liability, of course. --<a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDseer_123d.html" title="User:Dseer">Dseer</a> 03:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ekajati, who brought this unjustified complaint against other editors here rather than engage in dialogue, has been banned for repeated sockpuppetry. Ekajati, A Ramachandran, and Hanuman Das, who have been tag teaming in making similar complaints about editors in various articles, are in fact the same person, along with other "socks". A Ramachandran and Hanuman were confirmed to be sockpuppets of Ekajati.

<p>This has been changed a few times to libel another person with a similar name. An admin has removed these changes once (Thanks FCYTravis), but the anonymous user has reinstated libelous claims. Can you prevent this sort of libel permanently? It is clear that the anonymous user is just doing this for sport and not out of a genuine belief in these unsourced claims.Bollobas 19:34, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I tried removing the offending material because the source is from a work of fiction, and there is considerable doubt as to whether the event actually took place. Other editors have also tried removing the text for the same reason. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonmei_2f1b.html" title="User:Yonmei">Yonmei</a> continues to insert the libelous account, which is undoubtedly a personal attack on the biographical subject. The confusion lies in that Harlan touts this story as being true, as often fiction writers are want to do.</p>
<p>The source for the libelous account is from the story SCENES FROM THE REAL WORLD: I, THE 3 MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE, which appeared in a collection of fiction from STALKING THE NIGHTMARE copyright © 1982 The Kilimanjaro Corporation. From the dusk jacket of that book: ".... For the first time the author has embodied his belief that <b>fantasy and reality have switched places in our time</b> by including four essays he calls SCENES FROM THE REAL WORLD...." From Stephen King foreword from the same book: ".... one can almost see 'The 3 Most Important Things in Life' as a stand-up comedy routine (it's a job, by the way, that Harlan knows, having done it for a while in his flaming youth)...."</p>
<p>If we cannot be sure the events took place from a likely work of fiction, then how can we include this fictional anecdote as fact? The entire entry should be removed. 70.81.7.65 00:56, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am following the procedure:</p>
<dl>
<dd>This article must adhere to the policy on biographies of living persons. Controversial material of any kind that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous. If such material is repeatedly inserted or there are other concerns relative to this policy, report it on the living persons biographies noticeboard.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following in the article has been repeatedly reinserted.</p>
<p>I have to report it here, since the rule is being violated by two admins, FeloniousMonk and JoshuaZ, who have a strong ideological bias against the subject of the article, and are breaking this clear rule and the one against original research, and are hiding behind arbcom diktats to punish editors with opposing ideologies. How can we expect justice when it's admins who are guilty and heavy handed, unless we go above their heads?</p>
<dl>
<dd>He also accuses many origin of life researchers, such as David Bartel of MIT and Gerald Joyce of the Scripps Research Institute, of having a religious kind of faith,[19] [OK this is sourced, just provided for content]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>although those scientists do not demonstrate any manifestation of religious faith. [This is not sourced]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He also misrepresents the work of ribozyme evolution. [This is is a blatantly POV accusation and unsourced] For example, he argued that the mutagenesis of those experiments employed high error rates, which would cause error catastrophe, but high mutation rates were needed in those experiments simply to reduce the amount of time it would take to satisfactorially mutate a population of ribozymes to a significant extent, as opposed to using normal PCR techniques.[20] This link is just an ibid, so refers to [19] which is Sarfati's own article, which would not support this critical paragraph. So this paragraph is unsourced and counts as <i>original research</i> as defined:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>"Original research is a term used in Wikipedia to refer to material that has not been published by a reliable source. It includes unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position. ... It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position; It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;" <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. 58.162.2.122 15:11, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite repeated warnings user Tvoz has repeatedly violated the WP:Living rule regarding the <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Rockefeller_e416.html" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> entry. At the time of Rockefeller's death in 1979 there was much speculation, but no facts, regarding what happened. Tvoz had made multiple attempts to add salacious rumors to the effect there was a young women (he names her) involved, she had an adulterous relationship (this story follows details on his marriage), she helped cause his death from heart attack during sex, she had a motive for seeing him dead (named in his will), and she tried to cover up the episode and mislead police. There was no official report or criminal charge or lawsuit and no witnesses--it's all gossip--and it clearly violates our policy about negative statements and insinuations about living people (the women is in her mid 50s now). <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 06:55, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my attempts at mediation, I have addressed these concerns on the article's talk page. However, I believe that Rjensen is not representing the case accurately. A quick flip through the history of this article confirms this: the user in question, Tvoz, has inserted citations from reliable sources to document the controversy that arose after Rockefeller's death. She has not made the claim that Rockefeller and Ms. Marshak were sexually involved, nor has she said that she had "motive". (The fact that Marshak was named as a beneficiary in Rockefeller's will shows only that they had some kind of relationship: it could very easily have been a platonic one.) Her edits have been to improve the neutrality of the information and to provide sources for the claims, and thus I do not believe that it is in any way a violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. I will continue to monitor the situation. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope"><b><font color="#3D59AB">Merope</font></b></a> 14:48, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Rjensen's comments above amount to a malicious <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a> on Tvoz, as she did none of the things described. Take a look at what Tvoz did add to the article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelson_Rockefeller&amp;diff=93341832&amp;oldid=93320739" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelson_Rockefeller&amp;diff=93341832&amp;oldid=93320739" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> (her subsequent edits have added even more references and refined the text). Nelson Rockefeller died under unusual circumstances, something that gained wide press coverage at the time (for example, it was the subject of a <i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> skit [see snltranscripts.jt.org/78/78kbelushi.phtml]). Note that although it was widely assumed that Rockefeller died during sex with Marshack (such as in this <a href="../../../c/b/c/CBC_d905.html" title="CBC">CBC</a> editorial <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_omalley/20020118.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_omalley/20020118.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>), the Wikipedia article has never said so, and has followed an editorial line similar to that of <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine, among others (<a href="http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920096,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,920096,00.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>), scrupulously adhering to <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> in regard to Marshack.

<dd>The article is essentially a recapitulation of the book, with a lengthy quotations for most chapters (that is, for each liberal person being attacked by the author). For example, the section (in the Wikipedia article) that discusses the book chapter on Barbara Steisand is over 500 words long. It contains sentences like <i>Although she claims that the working men and women of America deserve higher wages, her production company, Barwood Films, usually films in Canada, where she can pay lower wages and receive tax breaks that she cannot get in the United States.</i></dd>
<dd>I don't think that the article about the book could <i>possibly</i> be considered NPOV unless it summarized each chapter in three sentences or so; what's there is way too much like mini-articles that present only one point of view (the author's). <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 22:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Would someone mind checking this out? I've read a reasonably reputable synopsis of this dude, so can't bring myself to remove stuff I know is accurate, but I suspect it is in a poor state. If not, let me know so I can stop worrying. Thanx 68.39.174.238 06:33, 13 December 2006 (UTC) (PS. I don't have on hand the source I'm referring to, so I can't use it to source this... ARGH!)</p>

<p>It is potentially <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libellous</a> allegations without any any citations which I have asked for.The wording are not encyclopedic. 1: Periyar being likened to Hitler is potentially libellous as Hitler was responsible for millions of deaths whereas Periyar was not guilty of even one.Further no evidence or citation is given this comment.Periyar turned the offer to become the head of the Madras Presidency in 1939 after the Congress quit but he turned it down now to compare Hitler is wrong.</p>
<p>2:Brahmins:comments like The population of Brahmins in Tamil Nadu, which was about 10% in the 1920s, is today less than 3% as a result of persecution by EVR and his followers are strange as not even a Single Brahmin has been killed in the entire Dravidan movement. Further Rajaji,Jayalaitha and Janaki who were Chief Minsiters were Brahmins and ruled Tamil Nadu longer than any other single community and these statements are not backed by citations or evidence which are required.Jayalalitha is the head of a Dravidan Party</p>
<p>3: And the wording should be encyclopedic none emotional and contraversial lines like Within a span of 20 years, the Brahmins of Tamil Nadu, who had been living there for more than 2000 years, were turned into alien immigrants by the DK's propaganda. The speeches called for the elimination of Brahmins from Tamil Nadu, and the enslavement of Brahmin women. The speeches harkened back to an ancient Tamil glory, similar to Hitler's revival of ancient Germanic culture are not abcked by citations or Evidence</p>
<p>4:Further some one blanked His Childhood and Education.Even today there was mass deletion by 192.223.243.6 which was reverted</p>
<p>5:Only 1 name needs to be used either Periyar or EVR not 2 creates confusion to readers particularly foriegners.Periyar is how he is known.<a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_Nadu_d7a5.html" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> Government refers to him as Periyar.<a href="http://www.tn.gov.in/government.htm.He" class="external free" title="http://www.tn.gov.in/government.htm.He" rel="nofollow">http://www.tn.gov.in/government.htm.He</a> is refered as Periyar in Tamil Nadu Government. Periyar University is called named after him and Also, convention suggests that the most common name be used as far as possible in the text of the article Vandalism is done by 80.195.10.170 who vandalised the page 3 times .<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarlowraman_1a9e.html" title="User:Harlowraman">Harlowraman</a> 10:00, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
