<li>"The intellectual is constantly betrayed by his vanity. Godlike he blandly assumes that he can express everything in words; whereas the things one loves, lives, and dies for are not, in the last analysis completely expressible in words." ~ <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Morrow_Lindbergh_2da8.html" title="Anne Morrow Lindbergh">Anne Morrow Lindbergh</a></li>

<ul>
<li>"It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it." ~ <a href="../../../a/u/n/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi_2fe9.html" title="Aung San Suu Kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Some would say that it is too idealistic to believe in a society based on tolerance and the sanctity of human life, where borders, nationalities and ideologies are of marginal importance. To those I say, this is not idealism, but rather realism, because history has taught us that war rarely resolves our differences. Force does not heal old wounds; it opens new ones." ~ <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohamed_ElBaradei_528f.html" title="Mohamed ElBaradei">Mohamed ElBaradei</a></li>

<li>"The longest day must have its close — the gloomiest night will wear on to a morning.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>"It is difficult to know yourself if you do not know others. To all Ways there are side-tracks. If you study a Way daily, and your spirit diverges, you may think you are obeying a good way, but objectively it is not the true Way. If you are following the true Way and diverge a little, this will later become a large divergence. You must realise this." ~ <a href="../../../m/i/y/Miyamoto_Musashi_737c.html" title="Miyamoto Musashi">Miyamoto Musashi</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"If one is but secure at the foundation, he will not be pained by departure from minor details or affairs that are contrary to expectation. But in the end, the details of a matter are important.

Of the sadness of your once valiant gaiety.</i><br />

<li>"Nations, like stars, are entitled to eclipse. All is well, provided the light returns and the eclipse does not become endless night. Dawn and resurrection are synonymous. The reappearance of the light is the same as the survival of the soul." ~ <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Hugo_5093.html" title="Victor Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> in <i><a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables_16cd.html" title="Les Misérables">Les Misérables</a></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"It's a bumper sticker culture. People have to get it like that, and if they don't, if it takes three seconds to make them understand, you're off their radar screen.

<ul>
<li>"Surprise becomes effective when we suddenly face the enemy at one point with far more troops than he expected.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>"I bow before the authority of special men because it is imposed on me by my own reason. I am conscious of my own inability to grasp, in all its detail, and positive development, any very large portion of human knowledge. The greatest intelligence would not be equal to a comprehension of the whole... I receive and I give — such is human life. Each directs and is directed in his turn. Therefore there is no fixed and constant authority, but a continual exchange of mutual, temporary, and, above all, voluntary authority and subordination." ~ <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Bakunin_11a1.html" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith. Reason is itself a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all." ~ <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._K._Chesterton_dbf7.html" title="G. K. Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"What I do know for certain is that what is regarded as success in a rational materialistic society only impresses superficial minds. It amounts to nothing and will not help us rout the destructive forces threatening us today. What may be our salvation is the discovery of the identity hidden deep in any one of us, and which may be found in even the most desperate individual, if he cares to search the spiritual womb which contains the embryo of what can be one's personal contribution to truth and life." ~ <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_White_5517.html" title="Patrick White">Patrick White</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Don't start an argument with somebody who has a microphone when you don't. They'll make you look like chopped liver." ~ <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlan_Ellison_e540.html" title="Harlan Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"When you get in situations where you cannot afford to make a mistake, it's very hard to do the right thing. So if you're trying to do the right thing, the right thing might be to eliminate the cost of making a mistake rather than try to guess what's right." ~ <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Cunningham_d473.html" title="Ward Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>

When me they fly, I am the wings;<br />

<ul>
<li><i>A little Learning is a dang'rous Thing;<br />
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring:<br />
There shallow Draughts intoxicate the Brain,<br />
And drinking largely sobers us again.</i><br />

<ul>
<li>"A man should never be ashamed to own he has been in the wrong, which is but saying, in other words, that he is wiser today than he was yesterday." ~ <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pope_8096.html" title="Alexander Pope">Alexander Pope</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Love is like some fresh spring, first a stream and then a river, changing its aspect and its nature as it flows to plunge itself in some boundless ocean, where restricted natures only find monotony, but where great souls are engulfed in endless contemplation." ~ <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac_3b42.html" title="Honoré de Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Faith is a continuum, and we each fall on that line where we may. By attempting to rigidly classify ethereal concepts like faith, we end up debating semantics to the point where we entirely miss the obvious — that is, that we are all trying to decipher life's big mysteries, and we're each following our own paths of enlightenment." ~ <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Brown_5a02.html" title="Dan Brown">Dan Brown</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,<br />
A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread — and Thou<br />
Beside me singing in the Wilderness —<br />
Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!</i><br />

</ul>
<ul>
<li>"There is no formula to it because writing every song, for me, is a little journey... It's everything. It's the walk you take in the morning, it's the night before, the meeting with people, landscapes, the chats, all of that evolves in some way into melody, but I'm not sure how it's going to happen. I'm dealing with the unknown all the time and that is exciting." ~ <a href="../../../e/n/y/Enya.html" title="Enya">Enya</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"I like quoting Einstein. Know why? Because nobody dares contradict you." ~ <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studs_Terkel_db5b.html" title="Studs Terkel">Studs Terkel</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"The voice of the individual artist may seem perhaps of no more consequence than the whirring of a cricket in the grass, but the arts do live continuously, and they live literally by faith; their names and their shapes and their uses and their basic meanings survive unchanged in all that matters through times of interruption, diminishment, neglect; they outlive governments and creeds and the societies, even the very civilization that produced them. They cannot be destroyed altogether because they represent the substance of faith and the only reality. They are what we find again when the ruins are cleared away." ~ <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Anne_Porter_df5c.html" title="Katherine Anne Porter">Katherine Anne Porter</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"It is confidently expected that the period is at hand, when man, through ignorance, shall not much longer inflict unnecessary misery on man; because the mass of mankind will become enlightened, and will clearly discern that by so acting they will inevitably create misery to themselves." ~ <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Owen_a7c4.html" title="Robert Owen">Robert Owen</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"'Fire' does not matter, 'earth' and 'air' and 'water' do not matter. 'I' do not matter. No word matters. But man forgets reality and remembers words." ~ <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Zelazny_9262.html" title="Roger Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a> in <i><a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_Light_7654.html" title="Lord of Light">Lord of Light</a></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Duty, Honor, Country</i> — those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be. They are your rallying point to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes forlorn." ~ <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_MacArthur_cfde.html" title="Douglas MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Positive vibrations man. That's what makes it work. That's reggae music. You can't look away because it's real.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>"While in the physical sciences the investigator will be able to measure what, on the basis of a <i>prima facie</i> theory, he thinks important, in the social sciences often that is treated as important which happens to be accessible to measurement. This is sometimes carried to the point where it is demanded that our theories must be formulated in such terms that they refer only to measurable magnitudes." ~ <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Hayek_7651.html" title="Friedrich Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"The meaning of the living words that come out of the experiences of great hearts can never be exhausted by any one system of logical interpretation. They have to be endlessly explained by the commentaries of individual lives, and they gain an added mystery in each new revelation." ~ <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabindranath_Tagore_9e00.html" title="Rabindranath Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>"Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.

<li>"I react pragmatically. Where the market works, I'm for that. Where the government is necessary, I'm for that. I'm deeply suspicious of somebody who says, 'I'm in favor of privatization,' or, 'I'm deeply in favor of public ownership.'

<ul>
<li>"Despite the best that has been done by everyone — the gallant fighting of the military and naval forces, the diligence and assiduity of Our servants of the State, and the devoted service of Our one hundred million people — the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest." ~ <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hirohito.html" title="Hirohito">Hirohito</a></li>
