Clearly the prenatal hormonal theories (which contradict the choice crowd) do not belong on the same page, the genetics and hormones are more appropriately pasted together under the umbrella of biology. I also suggest that all contributions from this point forward be required to have footnote citation similar to that seen on intelligent design.

<dd>Varilux is certainly correct: "Counfound" is a widely used noun in scientific writing. It's roughly short for "counfounding factor". I have no opinion on whether the sentence where it occurs should be changed, but it should not be changed only because the word allegedly does not exist. Maybe lay audiences will not know the noun though (might wikify the word rather than change it). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 16:07, 2005 September 9 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm familiar with the term as well, but I'd consider it jargon. Changed to "confounding factor", and wikified.

<p>I would have thought that anyone who has been introduced to the term "confounding variable" would also know that an alternative word for this is simply "confound". So yeah I don't think it matters which is used, as long as it is linked to make it clear for those who don't know what a confounding variable is. --Nzbassist 07:06, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Active vs. Passive Philosophies about Sexual Choices</b><br /></dd>
<dd>Certain conventional dialogue about sexual orientation can be seen as an example of a human tendency to use the passive voice when speaking of sexual choices they have made ("Hormones made me do it" ). While supporting self-definition, and taking no stand on the nature vs. nurture debate, some critics view this aspect of the debate as a way to mystify responsibility and another example of a cultural reluctance to view sexual choices as conscious choices. The portrayal of sexual choices as instinct forced by the brain structure, genetics, etc. is seen as a stylistic convention to avoid describing the role of the voluntary in sex, which would be culturally taboo. This is an accepting view, and a different position from maintaining that the sexual orientation of particular individuals is a choice that should be challenged or subject to change.</dd>

<p>I have some strong reservations about the inclusion of Neil and Briar Whitehead's reference on NPOV grounds. While Neil Whitehead is a microbiologist, he is not a geneticist, and the veracity of his relevant research expertise was challenged at a New Zealand Justice Select Committee submission hearing on civil unions. Moreover, he repeatedly cites <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Cameron_817e.html" title="Paul Cameron">Paul Cameron</a> in his research bibliographies. Moreover, his "My Genes Made Me Do It" was not issued by a mainstream publishing house, but the conservative Christian and conspiratorial Huntington House, in Lafayette, Louisiana, instead of a mainstream university academic imprint.</p>
<p>I suggest that Whitehead's reference should be deleted.</p>

<dd>That Whitehead is a microbiologist and not a geneticist is of no real consequence, and I'm not sure that the New Zealand Justice Select Committee matters much as a challenge to it's presence here (it might be more worthwhile to include the substance of the debate than to argue that it ought not be included). If the substance of Whitehead's thesis is to be challenged it should be done by presenting verifyable sources that come to an opposite conclusion. I deleted the reference because 1) it was listed in the biblographic sources but not cited in the text 2) it had two links, both of which were 404 so I can't judge anything but the title of the piece. The title appeared to deal with twin studies, its my understanding that there are a fair number of good twin studies examining sexual orientation in the peer reviewed literature that ought to serve as better references. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 02:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Many objections to the idea of an innate cause of homosexuality come from religious groups and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_conservatism.html" title="Social conservatism">conservatives</a> who focus on a moral rather than medical interpretation of sexual orientation, and seeing an individual's sexuality as a matter of personal choice or upbringing.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p>It's clearly opinion: there is conflicting data, there are also instances of data that is "bent" to fit with preferred interpretations. The medical interpretations of homosexual individuals is that there are a lot of health issues with it, while mental-health organizations vary broadly across a spectrum of possible conclusions, everywhere from the APA to NARTH, and everywhere in between.<a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfinitelink_6866.html" title="User:Infinitelink">Infinitelink</a> 10:40, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The opinion is relevant. No one knows what "causes" homosexual desire or orientation. Currently the most popular explanations are:
<ol>
<li>physical - i.e., something biological like genes</li>
<li>upbringing - i.e., child rearing, etc.</li>
<li>choices made - i.e., decisions to "try" sex with same gender</li>
</ol>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia doesn't know whether the medical interpretation is correct, so it's better to list all the ideas.

<dd>IMHO, to call it the "medical" model implies a value-laden POV that sexual orientation is a disease. I'd rather we follow the psychological community's thinking and don't do that. I also think that to divide the options into "physical", "upbringing" and "choices made" is unwise. Scientific understanding of this topic has long since abandoned pitting nature and nurture against each other as dichotomous choices. Also, "choices" are presumably predicated on something, a "choice" try one thing or another has to have an explanation, it's a description of behaviour rather than an explanation of it's cause. IMHO this article strongly underplays the evidence supporting a biological basis of sexual orientation. That most phenotypic variation remains unexplained does not mean that the whole thing is a totally open question. 68.148.40.121 20:43, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the biological hypothesis of sexual orientation really restricted to industralized societies as this article suggests in its opening sentences? Could a citation be made?

<dd>Please sign your contributions to talk pages by adding -~~~~ at the end, even if you don't have an account. I dunno. It seems as if, in the West, preindustrialized cultures tended to view homosexuality as neither born nor made, but as a temptation for everyone. Talk of sin aside for a moment, in the West and elsewhere it doesn't seem to me as if people cared much about the why before the 19th century. But that's an interesting question - do you have any materials on the subject that provoked it? -<a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESethmahoney_aefd.html" title="User:Sethmahoney">Seth Mahoney</a> 18:06, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If alternate adaptive phenotypes in suppressive societies are responsible for the persistence of genes that result in homosexuality in western society, then the modern culture of open tolerance may be the death knell of those genes. However, even in modern society the genes may be adaptive and more widespread than homosexuality. Heterosexuality may be the predominate phenotype of these genes, and homosexuality only slightly more likely than in those without the genes.--<a href="../../../p/o/o/User%7EPoodleboy_d461.html" title="User:Poodleboy">Poodleboy</a> 10:50, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The discussion is almost solely centred on the possible Biological determinants for hetero or homosexuality, and where bisexuality is mentioned, it is treated as no more than an offshoot of, or simply an alternative word for, homosexuality. Is this a result of narrow scientific inquiry - as a genetic determinant seems to suggest an either/or situation? As an article on 'sexual orientation' - it seems to subscribe to the narrow bipolar understanding of sexuality. It would not only be interesting, but I think it is required for an article on 'sexual orientation' to consider how the argument for a biological determinant deals with/explains/explores those who fall between the two poles, or, if there is no exploration of this, than a mention of a lack of research in this area would be appropriate.--81.107.19.168 02:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Having recently done a review of research on the biological determinants of homosexuality, there is a shortage of research on bisexuality because the small numbers of people who identify as bisexual make it difficult for research carried out to have sufficient statistical power to make broad conclusions. Another issue is that the majority of past research has focused only on male homosexuality, and has largely ignored female homosexuality. --Nzbassist 07:10, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another strong vote here for establishing in the article a clear distinction between exclusive homosexuality and same-sex components of bisexuality. Too much of this matter is obscured, severely affecting/confounding both scientific research and social convictions, by the fact many people can't tell the two apart and only acknowledge a dichotomous polarity of either heterosexuality OR homosexuality. --TlatoSMD 01:07, 24 June 2006 (CEST)</p>

<p>According to this view, if homosexual desires are developed rather than being innate, then they are changeable. A person can, of course, choose <b>not</b> to change. But if they choose to change, they should be welcomed and aided.</p>

<p>Alison, if there are religious leaders who have said explicitly that people choose to have homosexual desires, then we should quote them in the article. I did not mean to deny that such statements have been made. However, I wonder if your statement is based on actual quotes from religious leaders, or is an inference you've drawn from a quote.</p>
<p>What I've seen from religious leaders about "choice" and "homosexual desires" is the assertion that a person who realizes that they have homosexual desires has a choice to act in accordance with them or to resist them. For example, a person on a diet probably cannot decide to "feel hungry" but they can choose whether to eat pizza or celery.</p>
<p>Pete, I don't know what non-starter means, but everything I've read about the science of homosexuality has focussed on one main question: is homosexual desire innate or developed? As far as I know, science has not yet come out with a definitive Yes it's nature or No it's nurture.

<dd>"everything I've read about the science of homosexuality has focussed on one main question: is homosexual desire innate or developed?" yes, that's a very common question in the popular press, it's got a great deal of intuitive appeal, but ... "science has not yet come out with a definitive Yes it's nature or No it's nurture" Well, yes and no, there are clear answers, but they will never answer this question. Any 1st year undergrad psychology textbook will have a thick section on why "most modern psychologists consider the nature-nurture issue to be a relic of outdated knowledge about behaviour" (as the one closest to hand --Carlson et al2005, Psychology: the science of behaviour 3rd Canadian edition-- puts it). <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenotypic_plasticity.html" title="Phenotypic plasticity">Phenotypic plasticity</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritability.html" title="Heritability">heritability</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene-environment_interaction.html" title="Gene-environment interaction">Gene-environment interaction</a> are all prerequisites for understanding current scientific views on this topic, and necessary to avoid pointless <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_versus_nurture.html" title="Nature versus nurture">Nature versus nurture</a> discussions. The science on sexual orientation is pretty clear, the heritability is fairly high, genetic variation has a lot to do with variation in sexual orientation (more so in men than women) there are also clear environmental effects (there are also large non-shared environmental effects) and maternal effects (but not necessarily in the sense described in the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Maternal_effect.html" title="Maternal effect">maternal effect</a> article) due to things such as <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraternal_birth_order.html" title="Fraternal birth order">Fraternal birth order</a> (which is an environmental effect --well depends whether broad-sense or narrow-sense-- but would probably fall under the broad unbrella of "nature" rather than "nurture" if one thinks that way, since it's on the "born that way" end of "environmental" effects). There is no "gay gene" because sexual orientation is a "complex trait" (<a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygenic_inheritance.html" title="Polygenic inheritance">Polygenic inheritance</a>) in which many genes act. Search for genes via <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantitative_trait_locus.html" title="Quantitative trait locus">Quantitative trait locus</a> studies (e.g. Mustanski et al.) will identify genes, their effects on sexual orientation will not necessarily be simple (and <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleiotropy.html" title="Pleiotropy">pleiotropic</a> effects will make things all the more interesting) but they have significant effects. In conclusion, having an article which attempts to answer the nature v nurture question will notcome close to reflecting the scientific understanding of this topic, and should be discouraged in favor of more lucid treatment of the real story.

I can't see any reason why being a closeted gay person who carries on a marriage for "cover" would reduce one's chances of reproduction.

<p>Actually, evolution does not and can not take place at the individual level. The population is the smallest unit upon which evolution can act. This was stated with unambiguously in a university-level lecture last week. This section needs to be changed:</p>
<p>Another theory in support of positive adaptiveness of homosexuality and bisexuality is that these sexual orientations provide some benefit to the local community in general. Communities that are so supported would be stronger and more likely to survive in the future. [citation needed] The primary criticism of this theory is that genetic evolution works on the level of individuals, not communities. If heterosexuals have an individual reproductive advantage over homosexuals and bisexuals in a given community, after a very long period of time, the community should be composed solely of heterosexuals, regardless of how this affects the community as a whole.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether that invalidates the criticism of the theory or not, but "genetic evolution" (which should be evolution. adding genetic is redundant) does not act on the individual - only on the population. Whoever wrote this must have intended to say population. A community involves several species, which is irrelevant here.</p>

<p>I have a problem with this statement and I am wondering if others agree with me -</p>
<p><b>Yet homosexuality does not appear to be adaptive from an evolutionary standpoint because homosexual sex does not produce children. If there is a biological involvement, how could it be engineered by evolution?</b></p>
<p>I suppose one could argue that children are born homosexual for some evolutionary reason, inherited from their parents.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, this is a rather silly statement to have at the start of the article, since the article discusses scientific evidence, not opinions.....</p>
<p>Considering the sensitivity of the subject matter, I figured it should be discussed before it is taken out.</p>

<dd>It's a topic for a whole article in itself.

<dd>I noticed that, too. The current sentence, <i>"Yet homosexuality does not appear to be adaptive from an evolutionary standpoint because homosexual sex does not produce children."</i> Still seems a bit too certain, especially with the 2004 journal article from Camperio-Ciani backing up a link to female fecundity and a potential explanation of how it is explained through evolution. "...does not appear to be" sounds a bit too much like a judgement on the available sources--more prescriptive than descriptive, which is what our job really is here. The whole intro needs a good rewrite. --<a href="../../../r/k/i/User%7ERkitko_dc61.html" title="User:Rkitko">Rkitko</a> 06:28, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Seeing homosexuality as a "medical" rather than a "moral" issue does not guarantee better treatment for homosexuals. Indeed, many medical explanations of the innateness of sexual orientation have pathologised homosexuality and bisexuality as a kind of disability, and if a "gay gene" was discovered, parents might choose to screen and terminate embryos that carry the gene.</dd>

<p>I happen to agree with this opinion, but I think it should be a citation or reference, rather than being asserted as fact. Can someone help me find a source, please? --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 15:00, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I tend to agree. Maybe Michel Foucault's History of Sexuality, this seemed a thesis of his. Also, Sartre's Portrait of the Anti-Semite (sometimes "Antisemite and Jew?") has a discussion of homosexuality along these lines. Thomas B 21:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that the heading <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environment%2C_choice%2C_and_sexual_orientation.html" title="Environment, choice, and sexual orientation">Environment, choice, and sexual orientation</a> now redirects to this one, and I see that it has supposedly been merged into this one. However, vast amounts of information that used to be in the other article do not appear here, and have simply been deleted from Wikipedia entirely by the deletion of the other article. Can we please review the merger and reconsider how to make available the information that was in the <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environment%2C_choice%2C_and_sexual_orientation.html" title="Environment, choice, and sexual orientation">Environment, choice, and sexual orientation</a> article?</p>
<p>As it stands currently, the effect of the deletion and so-called merger is just to remove the vast majority of the information that had previously served to counter-balance this article. This article treats the causes of sexual orientation as something that can be studied only or overwhelmingly primarily by looking at genetic research for and against. But the <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environment%2C_choice%2C_and_sexual_orientation.html" title="Environment, choice, and sexual orientation">Environment, choice, and sexual orientation</a> article provided a very different approach which focused primarily on social science research and social identity-development theories. Most of the information on the relevant social science appears to have disappeared completely rather than being merged into any other Wikipedia article.</p>
