	    <p>In class right now, we are studying biographies. The wiki page on Biographies says "While a biography may focus on a subject of fiction or non-fiction, the term is usually in reference to non-fiction." Wikipedia is the only source we have found that says a biography can be fiction. Can it be? Is this wrong? Please reply. Thanks from all of us!</p>

<p>Australia has an Annual National Biography Award (AU $20,00). You may consider adding this information to the site. URL to access requisite details is <a href="http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/awards/biog.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/awards/biog.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/awards/biog.cfm</a></p>
<p>Is Biography really the name of an academic, scholarly discipline? Academics do, of course, write biographies, but is the writing of biographies properly considered a <i>discipline</i> itself? For example, philosophers write biographies of philosophers; historians write biographies of political figures; ordinary writers and scholars of pop culture write biographies of pop figures; art historians write biographies of artists; etc.</p>
<p>If biography really is properly considered a discipline unto itself, then, it follows, you could explain on <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biography.html" title="Biography">biography</a> exactly why it deserves to be so considered. Does it have its own journals (like?)? Its own scholarly standards (such as?)? Its experts (who?)? --<a href="../../../l/m/s/LMS_66a8.html" title="LMS">LMS</a></p>
<hr />
<p>His future wife is Taylor Lynn Cook. Soon she will be Mrs. Brandon Dicamillo. I don't know if it is a "discipline" or a "subdiscipline" of history or a "literary genre", but the work being invested into writing biographies is different from other work that the same people do. What does it take to be qualified as a "discipline"? Is there a wikipedia entry that explains what a discipline is?</p>
<p>Links to biography should be found from <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">History</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">Literature</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some of the entries linked to from the Biography page are plurals, other are singulars. It is natural to write that Einstein was a physicist (singular) and make it a link to the page of physicists (plural). Should we make it a convention of Wikipedia always to use the plural for such entries? In that case, maybe the bio page should be "biographies" (plural) as opposed to the "discipline" (or art) of Biography.</p>

<p>An interesting book might be:</p>

<p>I am not sure that considering the Jewish Holy Scriptures as a collection of particularly old biographies is a particularly scientific point of view. The dating for the Holy Scriptures has been continuously sliding downward; I think giving, say, Genesis a date of authorship of 1000bc is very optimistic at this point in time. By this time, we have many other biographies, e.g. Metjen of Egypt, etc. Despite what people like to think, it has been very difficult to prove that Jewish Holy Scriptures are old.</p>

<p>I'm not exactly sure which date to give, but to place the start of the Middle Ages at 350 AD is <b>very inaccurate</b>. Generally, the <i>Dark Ages</i> are regarded as sometime around 410-1000, and the Middle Ages as sometime around 1000-1400. I realize these numbers are poor, but they are much better than what is in the article. I don't know enough about these periods, but I do know the numbers in the article are wrong.</p>
<dl>
<dd>350 is clearly wrong; Theodosius reigned in the 380s and he is clearly not a Medieval emperor. I would go with something later. It is usually conventient to give something that the contemporaries felt was a turning point. For example, the sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoth chief Alaric and his men was considered an absolute disaster for anyone inside the Roman Empire, an occurrence of the unthinkable. Go with 410.</dd>

<p>I added this badly needed section and provided material with references. It has an Anglo-American bias and needs to be supplemented by a discussion of what was/is going on vis-a-vis biography in the rest of the world. soverman 01:17 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I would very much like to get a page on the life of Nuhanovic. He comes from the balkan somewhere, he is a muslim and are/where working for a nonviolent solution on the muslim-west conflict. Among other things i understand he has been working in Pakistan around 2001-2003 to get the Pakistani consumers to stop buying coca-cola and start buying alternate muslim coke brands.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Talk%7EBiography_fad5.html" title="Edit section: Complex insight">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Complex insight</span></h2>
<p>I added a fact tag to the assertion that biographies develop complex insight because at the very least it is clear that many biographies develop no insight at all. I have read biographies which provided some insight, but not of a kind that seemed at all complex. Most information in biographies is trivial. A spectacular example of that is Peter Parker's biography of <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._R._Ackerley_46d1.html" title="J. R. Ackerley">J. R. Ackerley</a>, which actually prevents insight into the man. Most information in biographies is simply irrelevant. In Phillip Marchand's biography of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_McLuhan_b107.html" title="Marshall McLuhan">McLuhan</a> we learn that he believed he was directly inspired by the Blessed Virgin Mary – I don't see how that helps me understand either the man or his ideas (nor does Mr. Marchand claim that it should). And then there are biographies of popular musicians, which are generally a load of old codswallop.</p>
<p>In short, what I'm arguing is that either some evidence that biography <i>as a genre</i> promotes complex insight should be provided or that the assertion should be toned down a bit – by saying, for example, that it may be an attempt, however questionable, to develop complex insight into a person. Or something. Obviously historical biographies may develop complex insight into an era or event, but that doesn't seem to be what is implied in the assertion in the article, which goes on to talk about understanding of personality (as if there were such a thing).</p>
<p>I'm open to being persuaded I'm wrong, by the way. For one thing, I would then know why this genre is considered so important. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 13:17, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I propose that "develops complex insight and highlights different textures of personality including intimate details of experiences" be replaced by "develops a complex analysis of personality, highlighting different aspects of it and including intimate details of experiences." If someone could explain what a texture of personality is we could leave that in. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 16:50, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
