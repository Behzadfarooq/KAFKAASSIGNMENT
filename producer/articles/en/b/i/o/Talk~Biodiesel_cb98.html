<li>Mississippi University uses ultrasonication to improve transesterification of oil to biodiesel. Higher yield will enhance the environmental effect of biodiesel. [see: <a href="http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/02/researchers_use.html" class="external free" title="http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/02/researchers_use.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.greencarcongress.com/2007/02/researchers_use.html</a>]</li>
<li>Include statistics on world production of biodiesel - what are the top producing, consuming countries? How much is produced each year?</li>
<li>Note the amount of land required to produce a reasonable quantity of Biodiesel. Total world oil consumption is ~4*10e12 kg/yr. Using Soya yielding 1000kg/ha, this would require ~4*10e7 sq km of land to be devoted to Biodiesel production. (Stats taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_resources_and_consumption" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_resources_and_consumption" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_resources_and_consumption</a>) This is 4 times the surface area of the US. It should be made clear to the non-scientific reader that this is impractical in terms of available fertile land. 'We can eat, or we can have biofuels, but we can't do both.'</li>
<li>Note, I changed the Chinese Tallow data to reflect a newer study.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also I believe the scientific name of chinese tallow has changed to Triadica Sebifera, from Sapium Sebiferum. Using the old name in google results in outdated links.</p>
<ul>
<li>More careful description needs to be given on how biodiesel is actually produced commercially; how are vegtable oils esterfied and what futher processing is required.</li>
<li>Whilst extensive, this article totally ignores the strength of opposition from prominent scientists, environmentalists and journalists such as George Monbiot who warn of the potential threat of the mass production of biodiesel crops. May I suggest you expand or produce a new section outlining some of the major arguments against such as the displacement of communities and (often biodiverse) forest to grow biodiesel crops, the draining of wetland and subsequent release of Co2 from dried out peat bogs, the environmental problems of any monoculture such as pesticide build-up or nutrient depletion, and most strikingly of all the loss of space for food production. A useful resource might be: <a href="http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2005/12/06/worse-than-fossil-fuel/" class="external free" title="http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2005/12/06/worse-than-fossil-fuel/" rel="nofollow">http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2005/12/06/worse-than-fossil-fuel/</a></li>
<li>check the flash point; it is stated as 150 and 160 °C. I dont buy the reducing cancer by 94 % thing. Particulates from exhaust pipes only make up for approx. 5 % of the total. So gettin rid of those cant possibly reduce any risk by 94 percent. nice article thoug.</li>
<li><s>Add more citations, and put more of the sources that are used in the proper form in the references section</s> Make citations consistent throughout. (Done by SEWilcoBot: There were a couple of URL-only links and some notes were out of order.)</li>
<li><s>Better structure and consistency for most of the sections after History</s></li>
<li><s>Discuss the total vegetable oil and fat production numbers</s></li>
<li><s>Not as widely tested in B100 form for actual use</s></li>
<li><s>Note the toxicity comparison to table salt (10x less) and the LD50 of &gt;50ml/KG, which is more than 3 liters for a 60KG human</s></li>
<li>Expand production cost discussion. currently more expensive, that could reduce with economies of scale, focused production, innovation, and use of better crops.</li>
<li>Explain biodiesel taxation</li>
<li>Trim external links section down significantly (Wikipedia is not a link repository) (Trimmed the English links. Many repeat the same information. Some are not particularly objective --137.132.3.12 17:34, 14 April 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><s>Clarify relationship to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_vegetable_oil.html" title="Straight vegetable oil">straight vegetable oil</a></s></li>
<li>It's odd that biodiesel is described as 'hydrophilic' and also stated that 'water and oil separate'. Aren't those opposite claims? Is it just meant that in practice it's often contaminated with undissolved water, or is the small amount of dissolved water itself a problem?</li>
<li>Adjust notation of many volumetric amounts. IE, "230,000 million US Gallons" is simply 230 billion US Gallons. Problems like this exist all throughout the article.</li>
<li>The Czech Rebublic does not produce 299,929,999,940 km^3 of biofuel. How big is the sun?</li>
</ul>
<p>European biodiesel standard is now accepted as EN14214</p>
<ul>
<li>The article says that biodiesel is non-toxic. It seems to imply that conventional diesel fuel <i>is</i> toxic. Is this true?</li>
</ul>
<p>Diesel is a mixture of petroleum distillates (b.p. 250 - 380 C). The paraffins are generally not very toxic, but the aromatic compounds normally present are expected to be carcinogenic. Also, there are additives used which may or may not be toxic. A useful link: <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/sci/chem-faq/part6/" class="external free" title="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/sci/chem-faq/part6/" rel="nofollow">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/sci/chem-faq/part6/</a> search for "diesel" --<a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERifleman_82_610c.html" title="User:Rifleman 82">Rifleman 82</a> 08:11, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are there wildly differing prices quoted, some higher and some lower than for conventional diesel?</li>
<li>A usefull link: <a href="http://www.gbev.org/biodiesel.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.gbev.org/biodiesel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gbev.org/biodiesel.htm</a> an explanation about what biodiesel is and how it can be used.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bold text</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Check the figures on the yield 95,000 litres oil/ha per year from an algae farm. There are no such farms in existence. One company GreenFuel is currently proving the concept at the Redhawk power station in Arizona. Check an article: Biofuel made from power plant CO2</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.newscientisttech.com/channel/tech/mg19225725.600-biofuel-made-from-power-plant-cosub2sub.html" class="external free" title="http://www.newscientisttech.com/channel/tech/mg19225725.600-biofuel-made-from-power-plant-cosub2sub.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newscientisttech.com/channel/tech/mg19225725.600-biofuel-made-from-power-plant-cosub2sub.html</a> They estimate that a farm of between 8 - 16 square kilometers (8000 - 16000 ha) will yield 150 million litres of biodiesel plus 190 million litres of ethanol per year. Total fuel 21,250 - 42,500 litres per year. I have done some calculations that make me feel that even these values may be a bit optimistic. The 21,250 value is getting close to the limits discussed in: <a href="http://www.upei.ca/~physics/p261/Content/Sources_Conversion/Photo-_synthesis/photo-_synthesis.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.upei.ca/~physics/p261/Content/Sources_Conversion/Photo-_synthesis/photo-_synthesis.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.upei.ca/~physics/p261/Content/Sources_Conversion/Photo-_synthesis/photo-_synthesis.htm</a> "At least eight photons are required to store one molecule of CO2 which means 1665 kJ of light energy are required to store 477 kJ in the plant. Max efficiency is 28.6 %. Only light in the range 400-700 nm can be used. This amounts to 43% of total solar incident radiation." Thus before other considerations the limit is 12.23%. They go on to take into account other factors like energy lost in respiration and set a limit of 6.6% in crops. In practice crop farming yields are very much lower than 6.6% in agreement with your table.</p>
<p>In my view if you lump the ethanol in with the biodiesel, the 21,250 litres/ha is a possible but unproven value. This is still 21 times Rapeseed, and 4 times Palm oil.</p>

<p>This article is just crazy in places. For example, anything related to the safe use of biodiesel in particular is just assinine. Who the hell is some anonymous guy on Wikipedia to tell a person with a diesel vehicle that his or her seals should have been replaced long ago? Furthermore, since when is volkswagen an independant firm? Since it's established earlier in the article that volkswagen is one of the few companies whose motors generally are capable of running B100, it seems to me that they'd have a very good reason to have a bias, just as the petrol companies do. Could someone with all the facts remove some of the bias and creeping POV? 204.112.165.3 03:41, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

The NRDC has always favored ethanol over biodiesel even though ethenol has a lower energy balance. Cellulosic has potential to be better of course.

<p>These statements puzzle me and seem contradictory "It is practically immiscible with water." and "Biodiesel is hydrophilic. Some of the water present is residual to processing, and some comes from storage tank condensation." It does not seem like both can be true.</p>
<hr />
<p>This paragraph puzzles me:</p>
<p>"The issue is economic: one of the exceptions <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nassau_Senior_7c9d.html" title="Nassau Senior">Nassau Senior</a> noted to the idea that machines aren't harmful to wages is, where the machines themselves make demands on resources that would have gone into food production. So the important question isn't whether biodiesel can be produced as whether that it is the most efficient use of resources, and the expense of biodiesel in comparison to traditional forms of diesel suggests that the answer is no."</p>
<p>Is it badly written or some kind of economic theory (not my strong suit)? Can anyone elucidate? <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 16:24, 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I didn't write it, but I believe it is a response to critics of biofuels. Two common cricisism are: (1) it is said that there is no net gain because more than a gallon fossil fuel is used in production of a gallon of biodiesel; (2) biofuels are bad because they displace food production, and everyone knows we don't have nearly enough soybeans as evidenced by their high price. I don't buy into either of these arguments, especially not (2). The paragraph in question appears to be an attempt to address one or the other or both. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKat_9c8a.html" title="User:Kat">Kat</a> 17:13, 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If 1 is correct it needs to be added to the article but I don't know if it can be. Certainly the debate should be clarified. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 17:16, 6 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>As for (1), why isn't the negative net gain for biofuel research from David Pimentel (Cornell University) and Tad W. Patzek (Berkeley) not brought up in the article? The news link from Cornell is here: <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/ethanol.toocostly.ssl.html" class="external free" title="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/ethanol.toocostly.ssl.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/ethanol.toocostly.ssl.html</a></p>
<p>Summary: This research indicates that using plants for fuel sources results in a net energy loss, e.g. system wide, it takes more energy to create biofuel than the resultant biofuel contatins.</p>
<hr />
<p>To the frequent editor with no username: Please provide evidence where biodiesel is cheaper than petrodiesel. As I have added to the article it is still more expensive in the U.S. (but getting closer all the time). A different tax structure in another country could easily make up this difference. Also the sentence you keep adding is trying to change a necessary rebuttal paragraph into another advocacy paragraph. The article has to present an balanced point of view (NPOV). If you can find evidence, please put it in the appropriate place. By the way, in the U.S. at least diesel and gas are cheaper in real and inflation-adjusted dollars now than at the time of the gas crisis. And the wars (which?) have never produced a permanent price change. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 18:29, Aug 8, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The U.S. is not the only country in the world, for sure (wikipedia is world neutral, not national encyclopedia). But you don´t see the historic movement. Biodiesel wasn´t used in the original diesel engine, but VEGOIL (peanut vegetable oil). Ones say the change from vegoi ( not biodiesel, read, no biodiesel, no biodiesel) was because of a conspiration, and another because of the cheaper petroleum prices.</dd>
</dl>
<p>But this nowadays is no true. Vegetable oil is cheaper than petroleum ( the original fight was between vegoil , read again vegoil, and petroleum).</p>
<p>Is vegetable oil cheaper than petroleum? . For sure:</p>
<ul>
<li>" ... if you want to use waste vegetable oil, which is <b>often free</b>... (<a href="http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_svo.html" class="external free" title="http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_svo.html" rel="nofollow">http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_svo.html</a>)</li>
<li>And for biodiesel&#160;: There are already a few small scale producers of bio-diesel in the country, selling their product for a few pence cheaper than normal diesel ( <a href="http://www.sciencenet.org.uk/news/2003/0103/lpg.html" class="external free" title="http://www.sciencenet.org.uk/news/2003/0103/lpg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencenet.org.uk/news/2003/0103/lpg.html</a>)</li>
<li>The alternative fuel, made by chemically separating glycerin from fat or vegetable oil, is cheaper and burns much cleaner than diesel (<a href="http://www.bbiethanol.com/news/view.cgi?article=808" class="external free" title="http://www.bbiethanol.com/news/view.cgi?article=808" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbiethanol.com/news/view.cgi?article=808</a>)</li>
<li>Jacobs said biodiesel performed better and was cheaper than petroleum diesel (<a href="http://www.suntimes.co.za/2001/12/16/news/news22.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.suntimes.co.za/2001/12/16/news/news22.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.suntimes.co.za/2001/12/16/news/news22.asp</a>)</li>

<li>And biodiesel process: the process, Leue notes on his Web site, is far simpler and cheaper than what's needed to refine petroleum (<a href="http://www.spinninglobe.net/connbio.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.spinninglobe.net/connbio.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spinninglobe.net/connbio.htm</a>).</li>

<dd>The problem with those web pages is that they contradict direct experience. In the United States, diesel currently costs about $1.50/gallon and about a third of that is tax. Home fuel oil is about $0.90/gallon. Vegetable oil here costs about $4.00/gallon from a supermarket. If you can show me some actual price quotes where fuel vegetable oil is cheaper than diesel, I would be appreciative.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also waste vegetable oil is nowhere near free. It's about $1.00/gallon. There is heavy demand for waste oil to make animal feed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>In the midwestern US, where soybean oil is produced, biodiesel is still more costly than fossil fuel. I can get price quotes, or you can ring the local petroleum dealer if you want. And biodiesel production is subsidized where fossil fuel production is not. Some of the animal tallow based formulations are showing more potential for low cost, since the tallow is cheaper than soybean oil.</p>
<p>I must say that I am skeptical of claims regarding biodiesel made from waste oil sources. The fiddly engineering problems in waste oil processing affect transesterification just as they do building a burner or engine. To my knowledge, they have not been solved in an economically effective way. Can you cite any sources--newspaper, magazine, etc-- to back up your claims? <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKat_9c8a.html" title="User:Kat">Kat</a> 01:41, 9 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry I didn't read here first, but that article was practically the first thing I'd ever read about biodiesel. It is very good and back up by government study data. I have already included links to it in the article. The article still has many mentions of "facts" that are now wrong when taking into account the data in that study. I'll try to edit the article for consistency, but I could use some help.

<p>I think there should at least be a seperate section on algal Biodiesel and the Aquatic Species program if not a seperate page. It is important to mention (UNH doesn't), that the aquatic species program involved feeding the algae CO2. Anyway If I don't hear back I will start a page on the aquatic species program.--63.206.118.188 04:00, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the best thing if you want to cover more on the topic would be to create Biodiesel from algae. The aqautic species program itself is defunct, so a focused article on algal biodiesel in general would be better than an article on the program. I don't think this article should have a separate section for algal biodiesel, because there is currently no biodiesel produced from it, just some research going on into how to commercialize it. This is the general article on biodiesel so it should cover the whole topic and each sub topic in relation to their importance. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 14:29, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I participated a discussion on this topic on sci.energy recently. Lots of points were discuted, and here is a summary&#160;:</p>
<p>- Among the best suited species are giant Diatoms from the Indian Oncean.</p>
<p>- These algaes contain up to 50% (dry mass) of natural oil. The remaining part, mainly proteins, could be used in various way, especially as fuel to make the algae "farm" independant of external (purshased) energy source (eg, oil, natural gas, electricity).</p>
<p>- The "farm" could be a closed are at sea, for instance a pool separated from the ocean by a "U" shaped seawall on a low-slope beach. In could also be built in a desert.</p>
<p>- PROBLEM&#160;: other lifeforms could contaminate the pool.</p>
<p>- There is no need for freshwater, at that's good news, since freshwater is increasingly scarse and precious in many parts of the world. The algae grow in saltwater, but a permanent supply is needed to compensate evaporation.</p>
<p>- In or near the sea, seawater can be used. Most deserts have underlaying aquifers that can provide saltwater.</p>
<p>- PROBLEM&#160;: if saltwater is added to replace evaporated water, the salinity in the pool will rise, and will finally excess the tolerable level for the algae. So a solution must be found to remove excess salt.</p>
<p>- The oil/biodiesel plant would adjoin the pools. Algae-loaded water would be pumped and algae would be extracted (filtrated?). So very little energy and labour would be used for harvesting.</p>
<p>- Some "farms" already grow algae like spirulla for health and food products. They could provide usefull informations.</p>
<p>- to get high yield, the algeae must be fed with CO2. They could "recycle" carbon from a power plant.</p>
<p>US DoE made a study on biodiesel from algae, here is the report&#160;: www.eere.energy.gov/biomass/ pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf</p>
<p>see also&#160;: <a href="http://www.masshightech.com/displayarticledetail.asp?Art_ID=69103" class="external free" title="http://www.masshightech.com/displayarticledetail.asp?Art_ID=69103" rel="nofollow">http://www.masshightech.com/displayarticledetail.asp?Art_ID=69103</a></p>

<p>The section on algae indicates that it would be possible to produce 95,000 Litres/hectare of biodiesel per year vs. 5,800 Litres/hectare for Palm Oil the next most productive source. This simply is not possible due to the amount of sunlight energy available and limitations on the efficiency of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>I believe that Algae farms will yield significantly more than Palm, and that this could be one of the most significant developments for solving the problem of declining oil supplies and CO2 emissions. However it is important to be objective about the prospects.</p>
<p>The 95,000 figure seems to be implicit in one of the references: <a href="http://oakhavenpc.org/cultivating_algae.htm" class="external free" title="http://oakhavenpc.org/cultivating_algae.htm" rel="nofollow">http://oakhavenpc.org/cultivating_algae.htm</a> where the author referring to the Aquatic Species Close Out Report (<a href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24190.pdf</a>) states that one of the conclusions was that: "One quad (10^15 BTU or 7.5 billion gal.) of biodiesel could be produced on 200,000 ha of desert land". In fact no where in the report does it imply these numbers. One of the conclusions of the ASP report was that the price of land particularly in the US South West would not be an issue and that the limiting factor would be the cost of setting up the farms and running them.</p>
<p>The 10^15 BTU per 200,000 ha implies 5 billion BTU per ha per year = 5,275,276 mega joules per ha per year = 5,275 mega joules per square meter per year. This is 1465.35 kilowatt hours per square meter per year.</p>
<p>The economics of solar power are well understood. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics</a> we have a table: Kilowatt-hours per peak kilowatts per year at various locations. The highest value given anywhere is 2,410. At that location, 1465.35 kilowatt hours per square meter per year implies a peak solar energy capture of 608.03 watts per square meter. In photovoltaics we usually assume the peak power from the SUN is 1,000 watts per square meter, so this would imply an energy capture efficiency of 60.8%. This is not credible for reasons I will outline shortly.</p>
<p>Before doing so I should point out that the peak power from the SUN is actually about 1,300 watts per square meter. The reason we use 1,000 in Photovoltaics is that we assume the solar panels are at a fixed orientation. They will only reach their peak in March and September, at other times they will not be face on at midday and this lowers the average daily peak.</p>
<p>Also note that the shadow area or footprint of a tilted solar array is greater than the area exposed to the SUN. This reduces the power yield by the Cosine of the given latitude.</p>
<p>Now about that 60.8% efficiency: most solar cells are rated at 12% or less. The theoretical maximum efficiency is about 70%, so 60.8% would be truly remarkable if it were true. The number is however unreasonable.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.upei.ca/~physics/p261/Content/Sources_Conversion/Photo-_synthesis/photo-_synthesis.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.upei.ca/~physics/p261/Content/Sources_Conversion/Photo-_synthesis/photo-_synthesis.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.upei.ca/~physics/p261/Content/Sources_Conversion/Photo-_synthesis/photo-_synthesis.htm</a>.</p>
<p>I quote: "At least eight photons are required to store one molecule of CO2 which means 1665 kJ of light energy are required to store 477 kJ in the plant. This issue alone gives a maximum efficiency of 0.286 or 28.6%. Additionally only light in the range 400-700 nm can be used (in photosynthesis). This amounts to 43% of total solar incident radiation. Combining these two factors means that the solar efficiency cannot exceed 12.23%".</p>
<p>They then go on to take into account two other factors that limit solar efficiency in plants: Respiration losses and Canopy losses. This implies plants at best will achieve an efficiency of 6.6%. Very likely these two factors do not apply to algae. One of the biggest losses during respiration is a reaction between oxygen and RuBisCO that releases some of the captured energy. Since algae farms proposed will use flue gasses rich in CO2 and depleted in oxygen, the effect will be much less, but will still be a problem since the algae will be releasing oxygen into the gas feed.</p>
<p>If we assume that an algae farm can achieve a solar energy capture efficiency of 12.23% this would reduce the yield of oil from 95,000 Litres/hectare per year to 19,109 Litres/hectare per year, and this would only be attainable near the equator.</p>
<p>As an aside, the stated value for Palm oil 5,800 Litres/hectare per year implies a solar efficiency of 3.71% assuming we are again talking about an equatorial farm, this is within range of 6.6%. Differences could be attributed to various factors. Only desert regions have high Kilowatt-hours per peak kilowatts per year, typical locations where Palms grow tend to be cloudy. Also Palms like other plants close their stomata to limit water loss through evaporation, particularly when there has been no rain. This limits input of CO2 and reduces photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I think we need to reduce the 95,000 Litres/hectare per year to 19,109 Litres/hectare per year for equatorial based algae farms. There are no real references cases, although the GreenFuel trail at Redhawk may provide some numbers in 2007.</p>
<p>I also think that reference cases need to take into account latitude, perhaps showing an actual as well as a normalised yield, and the Kilowatt-hours per peak kilowatts per year at the location of the reference, again factored into the normalised yield.</p>

<dd>The number is supposed to be a unit conversion from the number in the UNH study cited in the article. The article should accurately reflect the claims in the paper, and not make it look like it's been achieved already. Probably could use some work on that. For the rest, your analysis is non trivial, and can't be included directly as such in the article. We have to reflect what published sources have stated about biodiesel. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 13:30, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Taxman, I have not requested rights to edit the page, and I don’t think I am appropriate person to do so. I am an investment banker, my skills are in numerical analysis, and I simply could have not written the original page as I do not have the immediate knowledge of all of those aspects on biodiesel.</p>
<p>My concern is however that the number you quoted for algal biodiesel at 95,000 liters / ha / year simply did not add up. It used to be that wikipedia users when they spotted errors could simply correct them, but it seems those days have long since gone.</p>
<p>Precisely who is it who claims the 95,000 figure? Even if it was derived from a quoted reference, readers will view the fact that wikipedia decided to publish it as wikipedia adding their reputation to that of the quoted publisher. If there is no link to any quoted source, then readers will view this as a situation where wikipedia are staking their reputation on the number.</p>
<p>You seem to imply that the number came from a UNH article, yet I cannot find this in either of the two UNH articles: <a href="http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html" class="external free" title="http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html</a> and <a href="http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/pdf/algae_salton_sea.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/pdf/algae_salton_sea.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/pdf/algae_salton_sea.pdf</a> and so I attribute the claim to wikipedia alone.</p>
<p>The only reference I can find anywhere where a practical test has been done to determine the yield of CO2 fed algae is in <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf</a>. This was an article looking back on the aquatic species program, and they state that in relation to real tests conducted in Hawaii and New Mexico: “Single day productivities reported over the course of one year were as high as 50 grams of algae per square meter per day, a long-term target for the program”.</p>
<p>If we convert this number as follows: 50 grams of algae per square meter per day = 18.2625 kilograms per square meter per year = 18.2625 metric tons per hectare per year. Now assuming 1191.17 liters of biomass per metric ton of biomass (density = 0.84 grams per cc), we get 21,753.68 liters of biomass per hectare per year. This is not out of line with my calculations involving photosynthesis efficiency and available sunlight.</p>
<p>Perhaps you got your numbers from the second UNH article where on page 4 in relation to setting up an algae farm to provide biomass to fuel a power station they state: “Assuming an average productivity of 33 g/m2/day, or 120 mt/ha/yr (a lower productivity than assumed in some studies) …”. The 120 mt/ha-yr is roughly equivalent to 142,940 liters biomass/ha/year, and maybe you calculated 95,000 liters of biodiesel could be extracted?</p>
<p>Can you spot the mathematical error?</p>
<p>33 g/m2/day = 12,053.25 g/m2/year = 12.05325 kg/m2/year = 12,053 kg/ha/year = 12.05 mt/ha/yr (not 120 mt/ha-yr). It would seem UNH are out by a factor of 10.</p>
<p>This article presented a pessimistic view on the economics of using the algal biomass as a feedstock for a local power station. They determined that the biomass electricity would cost 2-3 times more than fossil fuel electricity. Consequently I believe this article received a lot less peer review than it would have if it had presented an optimistic view.</p>
<p>In my view, using biomass to generate electricity is a particularly stupid idea given that the existing thermal power stations have efficiencies of about 30%. If you combine this with the low efficiencies of solar energy capture evidenced in energy crops so far, the possibility seems somewhat remote. Using biomass, particularly algae, to produce transportation fuels does however look promising.</p>
<p>While you are looking into your 95,000 liters/ha/year number, you might like to also look at the following reference: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algaculture#_note-BiodieselFromAlgae" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algaculture#_note-BiodieselFromAlgae" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algaculture#_note-BiodieselFromAlgae</a>; where you estimate 5,000 to 20,000 gallons of biodiesel per acre, per year. This equates to 46,769.78 to 187,079.13 liters per hectare per year, and again there is no reference to track the quoted figure and again way too optimistic.</p>
<p>You might also like to review the following links where your claims are being discussed externally:</p>
<p>Arizona Utility Recycles Smokestack Exhaust to make Biofuel (<a href="http://technocrat.net/d/2006/12/23/12545" class="external free" title="http://technocrat.net/d/2006/12/23/12545" rel="nofollow">http://technocrat.net/d/2006/12/23/12545</a> )</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>bi-ker-shi</p>
<hr />
<p>Ooops looks like I dropped a naught in my calculations, how embarrassing. At least your readers won’t know the voice behind Mr. Ed. My problem is that I am not familiar with hectares and was using 1000 m2 per hectare not 10,000.</p>
<p>Reworking some of my previous calculations:</p>
<p>The 10^15 BTU per 200,000 ha implies 5 billion BTU per ha per year = 5,275,276 mega joules per ha per year = 527.5 mega joules per square meter per year. This is 146.535 kilowatt hours per square meter per year. This implies an energy capture efficiency of 6.08% not 60.8%</p>
<p>So it seems that 95,000 liters/ha/year of biodiesel is indeed quite reasonable as 6.08% is within the limits set by the efficiency of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Another place where I made the same mistake in relation to the Salton Sea:</p>
<p>33 g/m2/day = 12,053.25 g/m2/year = 12.05325 kg/m2/year = 120,530 kg/ha/year = 120.5 mt/ha/yr UNH were correct, my apologies.</p>
<p>I still think the main page could do with some improvement as it is very hard to track where the numbers are coming from, and the fact that in the case of algae, the yields still need to be proven.</p>

<dd>A few things, per your account they were not using biodiesel. "mixing cooking oil with methanol" is not biodiesel. Second is that you didn't make sure to narratively fit what you wrote in with what came before it. Third is any country will try to enforce the fuel tax on any fuel for road use, whether produced by a big refinery or by a town. That tax pays for the roads. It's not a fine for using biodiesel, it is a fine for tax evasion. So what you added has very little relevance to biodiesel. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 12:17, Aug 4, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did try to fit it in nicely. I'm a journalist and used to doing that kind of thing thank you very much.</p>
<p>And thirdly they were fined for using biodiesel, and avoiding the tax on it - not just one person but a whole bunch of them. To me that makes it relevant to biodiesel.

<dd>The study that number is quoted from is the lifecycle analysis one referenced in the article. I believe it takes into account the carbon released from using fossil fuel to produce the methanol needed for the reaction, but I haven't re-read the paper in a while. Currently it is more efficient to use methanol produced from fossil fuel. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 22:57, Aug 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not an expert on fuel technologies, but these statistics appear biased to me and undermine the article. In common usage, a claim that product x reduces emissions vs. product y implies a measurement at the tailpipe. Not the lifecycle measurement. In fact, the energy to grow, process, and transport a soybean product, for example, certainly generates some amount of CO2 emission to offset the amount claimed captured by the soybean. Also, growing, harvesting, processing/refining soybeans is certainly more energy-intensive than drilling for oil or gas. Consequently, as a layperson, I find the claims of reduced emissions disingenuous at best. --[User:Guest]] 22:59, Jun 7, 2005</p>

<dd>Well, the number is directly from the 1998 NREL lifecycle study, and that is far better than us trying to come up with a number, or original research to explain the issue. Now that you point it out though, it would be better to create a citation in the text to the study and note that the number is on a lifecycle basis, so I'll do that.

<p>The article states: "Some environmental groups, notably NRDC object to the vast amount of farming and the resulting over-fertilization, pesticide use, and land use conversion that would be needed to produce the additional vegetable oil."</p>
<p>I'd like to see references to flesh out this point. My own search of the NRDC web site does not substantiate this idea. It's an important point, though, which is why I'd like to get more information.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wrote that. I didn't cite a reference because the NRDC's position papers are not published, so it would just be a website. I should have linked the position paper anyway. If you have something that shows them as less negative on biodiesel I would be interested too. Basically the position paper that I read from them was against biodiesel for the above reasons, and also because it is usually mixed with petroleum diesel in actual usage. Their position was that this allows people to not switch to even better, cleaner options. That is odd because they seemed to support CNG, which is a fossil fuel. They also seem to be on the ethanol bandwagon even though ethanol has a much poorer energy balance than biodiesel currently. Another bit that made their position odd. <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/air/transportation/hdiesel.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.nrdc.org/air/transportation/hdiesel.asp" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is one link were they oppose diesel, but don't even consider biodiesel over CNG. <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/air/transportation/oilsecurity/da2003.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.nrdc.org/air/transportation/oilsecurity/da2003.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is another where every alternative is considered except biodiesel. Another point is that a search for biodiesel on their site leads to almost nothing, while a search for CNG gets lots. I cannot find the original research paper that I found the point in the article, but read the link provided in the above section, it basically supports the same farm problem idea. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 13:01, Dec 9, 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I too have searched the NRDC web site, and have found nothing but neutral to positive statements on biodiesel. The <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/air/transportation/hdiesel.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.nrdc.org/air/transportation/hdiesel.asp" rel="nofollow">article</a> concerning diesel you reference does not explicitly mention biodiesel, though it very quietly suggests it is superior to CNG: "NRDC has helped show that compressed natural gas is an affordable, cleaner alternative fuel for buses and some trucks.... A more far-reaching solution: change the chemistry of diesel fuel itself. ... Reducing sulfur levels in diesel fuel to near-zero levels ... will make an enormous positive impact on public health by enabling the use of advanced pollution-control devices in diesel vehicles that can make them more than 90 percent cleaner." Biodiesel of course contains a zero or near-zero level of sulfur <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> and offers an almost across the board reduction in emissions. Other pages on the site (<a href="http://www.nrdc.org/media/pressreleases/030219.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.nrdc.org/media/pressreleases/030219.asp" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/onearth/03fal/heroes1.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.nrdc.org/onearth/03fal/heroes1.asp" rel="nofollow">2</a> <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/air/transportation/retrofit/retrofit.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.nrdc.org/air/transportation/retrofit/retrofit.pdf" rel="nofollow">3</a>) mention biodiesel in a positive light or talk of the benefits of reducing sulfur levels, explicitly mentioning biodiesel. No doubt many environmentalist groups object to the practices of conventional and industrial agriculture, but it is possible to increase biodiesel production without over-fertilization or pesticide use (using organic methods in their stead) or land conversion (e.g. if demand for the soybeans currently being grown was reduced due to a mass conversion to vegetarianism or an EPA ban on trans fatty acids)--indeed even without using land or fresh water as stated elsewhere in the Wikipedia article--so without a reference to an environmental group that actually opposes biodiesel, I feel the sentence should be reworked or removed. --M.R.</dd>

<dd>Well I guess this article could be made clearer on that point yes. Part of the problem is that no matter how clear we are in this article people will still have their pre conceived notions and be confused anyway. That is because there is already a lot of confusion out there about the two concepts with lots of uninformed people calling unrefined vegetable oil biodiesel because it is from biological sources and it can be burnt in a diesel engine as SVO. Biodiesel, is what meets various standards for a motor fuel, and correctly speaking is always the transesterified stuff. SVO is related and is the very common term used to distinguish between proper biodiesel and unrefined vegetable oil. So there is not another term for it, SVO is the common one. Yes this article talks about peanut oil in the history, but it is just talking about the history of using vegetable oil sources, but never says they were transesterified. I hope I cleared that one up a bit. I'll try and think of how to make the intro more clear on this point to avoid the disambig message. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 23:07, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The one complaint I have is the reference to 3 million gallons annual in America of WVO. Other sources on the web (such as biodiesel.org and Willie Nelson's BioWillie) state a much higher number at 3 billion. I am not sure if the poster had a typo or what. Currently millions (if not billions) of gallons of WVO are being dumped into landfills. Can someone confirm?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well I got that 3 million gallons figure from one of the sources I used. I should really mark more of these because I can't recall which one now. In any case the <i>Business Management for Biodiesel Producers</i> reference does include some recent numbers for total vegetable oil production in the US which does work out to 3 billion(US) gallons a year. This is apparently the number those you refer to are using. Now certainly not all of this is wasted, since some is consumed, some is made into animal feed etc. The EPA number is the number that only <i>restaurants</i> produce as <i>waste</i>, ignoring every other user of vegetable oil, so that makes the two numbers measurements of two very different things. That said the 3 million number sounds low, but it is from the source I had, so that is what I went with. If you don't agree with it please do try to find a more accurate source. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 01:56, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If further references are needed - please let me know. A more interesting reference from a University - <a href="http://www.me.iastate.edu/biodiesel/Pages/bio1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.me.iastate.edu/biodiesel/Pages/bio1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.me.iastate.edu/biodiesel/Pages/bio1.html</a>. I think Im getting into Wiki now - so I better sign up - TW. I signed up and the reference from Iowa State approximates to 2.95 billion gallons per year of vegetable oil, close to the 3 billion mark. Check the Iowa State reference. It seems as if all the million reference points should be billion (3 billion gallons, 23 billion lbs of vegetable/animal oil etc). And the Iowa state link has references itself, albeit from 2002 or 2003. Taxman can you update it?</p>
<dl>
<dd>More importantly, welcome to the Wiki, you'll be an addict soon.&#160;:) But on topic, I don't think it is prudent to update the numbers yet because: 1) You've missed the distinction I noted above between total vegetable oil produced, and that wasted (by restaurants and total) 2) You're not being careful with the difference between pounds and gallons in your first calculation 3) Neither of those are reliable sources for the amount of wasted vegetable oil (that is oil that is used in some way but is still oil) that is dumped or otherwise disposed of. Again, the number for total vegetable oil produced is not the same as the amount that becomes waste. The sticking point is a lot of people and sources confused those issues, so it is important to find a source that is well aware of the distinction. So if a reliable source can be found for the amount that is wasted that differs from the source I had, I'd be more than happy to update the article. I have noticed the number I put for vegetable oil is actually the total fat number so I need to fix that.(done) - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 13:21, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have read that WVO is sold on the commodities market as "yellow grease" which may provide another way to track down the amount. I also think 3 million is too low. <a href="../../../r/m/h/User%7ERmhermen_d338.html" title="User:Rmhermen">Rmhermen</a> 17:50, Apr 15, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, yellow grease is animal fat, not vegetable oil. The Van Gerpen reference shows that. Anyway, I found a pilot demonstration paper from an EPA office that gives a more reasonable sounding number than 3 million gallons. It lists 2.5 billion pounds, which works out to about 300 million gallons. The reason I don't find that source overly reliable is that a report from the same office puts the number at over 3 billion gallons, which is impossible since that is 100% of the countries' total production. Now the 2.5 billion number is the collected number, so the actual waste is some (probably small) percentage higher due to amounts that are not properly disposed. For a restaurant or potato chip factory for ex., improper disposal is a waste violation, so it is probably not too large, but who knows. This also only covers restaurant, not home use and waste, either down the drain or in the trash. I've not seen any studies or source that actually try to accurately estimate all sources of actual waste vegetable oil, so the article can't go into speculation, which is why I limited it to what information the source actually says. What we do know is the 3 billion gallon figure a lot of people claim is wrong, since not all vegetable oil produced in the country is wasted. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 14:44, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'm going to try to do the restructuring over the next few days. The goal is to have the article be more cohesive, less US focused, and cover the whole Biodiesel topic comprehensively, cover the important details well, and not give too much space to less important details. I plan on keeping most of the material in the current article, so some of the outline bits may be confusing, but let me know what you think.

<p>What about using fat obtained via <a href="../../../l/i/p/Liposuction.html" title="Liposuction">Liposuction</a> to produce biodiesel? Think about all of the fat lazy americans who drive two blocks to the corner "convenience store" for a pack of cigarettes, a bag of potato chips, a box of ho-ho's and a rack of cheap "beer". If they got liposuction and we turned the fat into biodiesel, then they actually walked to the corner gymnasium, it would save tons.</p>
<p>Perhaps a scented oil should be added to biodiesel, to make it smell nice when it's burned, similar to scented lamp oil you can get for 'kerosene' lamps?</p>

<p>North Carolina State University had a pilot project on the use of the black soldier fly for hog waste reduction. Sprinkling maggots into the hog waste, they found the flies would ingest vast quantities of hog waste, and at the right moment in their life cycle, would "self harvest" by climbing up runways and falling into chutes where they could be easily crushed. The resultant oil, which was black and smelled horrible, was sent to the Becon Center at Iowa State University to be reacted into biodiesel. That never happened. And the pilot ended.

<dd>Most are from the Journey to forever site which cites other sources I believe. The algae one is from Briggs. The yields vary of course on a lot of factors such as methods, soil quality, specific plant variety, etc. The JTF numbers are a bit out of date, but no comprehensive source I have seen has more up to date numbers. Biodiesel is a burgeoning industry so now instead of publicly funded research, much of the research now now seems to be proprietary in the R&amp;D labs of companies looking to commercialize. That's probably partly a good thing since mass production of biodiesel is going to require efficent sources of lipids. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 14:58, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you notice the restructuring section above, I've been planning a reworking of the article because I believe it needs it. But I've even reworked that outline again into a format I think is even better, but I didn't post it because making a wiki outline is a pain. I have though assembled hundreds of source materials totalling umpteen thousands of pages (most of which I've read or skimmed), and unfortunately haven't been able to allocate the time to do the actual rewriting. I could figure out a way to make them all available to you if you wanted to go for it, and I will certainly try to upload my reworked outline, which I would appreciate if you would comment on. As for the two referencing styles, I split them into a notes section for the in line citations left the general references I used in the references section. That's a fairly common way to do it, but it could still use some clean up for consistency, as I've used Harvard references in places. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 13:58, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Great! Yeah, I'd be happy to take a crack at filling in your (new) outline. The concept of reading through "umpteen thousands of pages" shockingly doesn't strike me as a fun thing to do—perhaps you could send me the updated online and a short-list of the most useful sources (max: about 10 pages). I can use that to draft a revamped article which we can use the rest of the sources to build on as necessary.</dd>
<dd>What's the best way to pass contact info across Wikipedia? Describing an email address on a page which is accessible to anyone and will always exist strikes me as a Bad Idea. —<a href="../../../j/w/a/User%7EJwanders_e4e6.html" title="User:Jwanders">Jwanders</a> 15:21, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I found the original sentence shown below a little confusing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to government subsidization, Biodiesel is generally more expensive to purchase than petroleum diesel, although this differential may diminish due to economies of scale, the rising cost of petroleum, and legislation favoring the use of Biodiesel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I altered it slightly and added an <a href="http://www.greencarcongress.com/2004/10/biodiesel_tax_c.html" class="external text" title="http://www.greencarcongress.com/2004/10/biodiesel_tax_c.html" rel="nofollow">endnote</a> to give an example of direct subsidies being applied to biodiesel (as opposed to indirect ones like general farm subsidies) to make it a little more clear, balanced, and accurate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biodiesel is generally more expensive to purchase than petroleum diesel, although this differential may diminish due to economies of scale, the rising cost of petroleum, and government subsidization favoring the use of biodiesel.</p>

<p>The marketing of biodiesel has been so successful that it is difficult to find critiques of it buried in all of the hype. The sites that sell or promote biodiesel are the wrong places to go to find unbiased data. Here is an article in <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2005/12/11/185731/22" class="external text" title="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2005/12/11/185731/22" rel="nofollow">Grist</a> that summarizes some of the growing awareness that biofuels may do untold damage to the planet. There was also an article in <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18825265.400" class="external text" title="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18825265.400" rel="nofollow">New Scientist</a> pointing out the same thing.</p>
<p>Another point to keep in mind is the confusion over different blends of biodiesel. For example, A B100 (100% biodiesel) blend is partially carbon neutral, but gets 15% worse gas mileage than diesel and increases NOx emissions 110% over gasoline cars. A B20 blend is far from carbon neutral. Biodiesel is also not 78% carbon neutral. Its neutrality is dependent on the plant being used. The 78% figure quoted in Wiki is for Soybeans and even that number appears to be biased. I can show you the sources if you want.</p>
<p>Claims that biodiesel can impact CO2 emissions are misleading as are claims that it will make a meaningful difference in foreign oil dependency. Let me know if you want to see the sources and math.</p>
<p>Farming is not environmentally friendly. It is a necessary evil to grow food. It usurps vast areas of land and water and requires billions of tons of pesticides and fertilizers. A cornfield is one species away from being just as biologically impoverished as a mall parking lot. Environmentally friendly biodiesel is an oxymoron.</p>
<p>When one considers that, next to burning fossil fuels, deforestation is the second leading cause of global warming, one has to stop and ask: should the world be cutting down rainforests and plowing under its conservation reserves to grow biofuels?</p>
<p>I think this article needs a criticisms section similar to the one found on the Precautionary Principle. I would be happy to submit one for your critique. Sarann 03:40, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Folks, there is nothing short of giving up farming completely and going back to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle that would "save the planet". Algae is the way to go because it does not use farmland, doesn't need fresh water, and can actually result in a net reduction of greenhouse gases we're putting into the atmosphere if we use the CO2 emitted by power plants. No, it's not a perfect fuel. But we don't live in a perfect world. --JSleeper 08:41, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recent changes refer to various studies supporting the added info but do not actually cite them. The one that caught my eye was that government studies supported the less toxic than table salt. That seems like an uncareful attribution to a source as that's not the type of thing the government sources would explicitly say. I'm tempted to revert, but I thought it was better to ask for explicit sources before doing so. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 23:22, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry for not posting my sources, I am new to this process.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The four additions that I made to the, "environmental benefits in comparison to petroleum based fuels," were quoted from a pamphlet entitled, "Biodiesel: The Intelligent Solution to Today's Energy Security and Environmental Issues," produced by The National Biodiesel Board (www.biodiesel.org).
<dl>
<dd>Right, then the problem is proper attribution to the source. Using the NBB source to say another source says something is not good from a verifiability standpoint. Best citation practices call for having the actual source and citing it. Most of the government reports the NBB pamplet is referring to are available for download too. Do you have the direct link to the pamphlet your referring to? I didn't immediately see it. See <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing sources</a> for more information on citing sources. There's no firm rule on what citation form you have to use, but it's generally best to follow a consistent style within an article. You can use either Harvard style referencing (Briggs 2004) like this one does or footnotes to cite specific facts to specific sources.

<p>Moved in from <a href="../../../a/l/g/Talk%7EAlgae_2f2d.html" title="Talk:Algae">Talk:Algae</a>: Hi, i'm writing this to get some information about <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiesel.html" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> production from algae. I first got interested in biodiesel when i came across some do-it-yourself tutorials on how to make your own biodiesel, using waste vegetable oil. I was very interested in this, especially since the tutorials said that you could get the WVO for free from fast food resturaunts. But with energy shortages, the high price of gas, and the lack of significant public transportation, once fast food chains and slaughterhouses see their waste being used to produce something valuable it seems that it will only be a matter of time until that free-supply will be taken away, either by no longer giving the oil away, but selling it, or having it contracted out,(which seems more likely once ultra-low sulfur requirements go into effect for regular <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel.html" title="Diesel">diesel</a>). Without a stable supply of oil, any investment into a biodiesel system,(a proccessor, a diesel car, diesel generators for electricity), seem dangerous. I started looking at oil crops, and was surprised by the yields, you hear so much about soy-biodiesel, but it turns out to be one of the worst of the oil producing crops. There were a couple of crops that were slightly better than the rest,(jatropa, and palm), but they're both regional, and no good unless you live in those areas. Then I see the next leap, from 635gpa for palm oil, to 5,000 to 20,000gpa for some types of <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algae_culture.html" title="Algae culture">algae</a>. The implications of something like that seemed amazing, a single family doesn't use anywhere near the equivalent of 10-20 thousand gallons per acre of oil, and to meet their energy needs could set up a system at a tenth of that size, or use a swimming pool, and essentially be energy independent. But then there was no information about it. After searching around the internet I found the <a href="../../../d/o/e/DOE_85d0.html" title="DOE">DOE</a>'s Aquatic Species Program <a href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.eere.energy.gov/biomass/pdfs/biodiesel_from_algae.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.eere.energy.gov</a>, and I found the University of New Hampshires; Widescale Biodiesel Production from Algae page <a href="http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html." class="external text" title="http://www.unh.edu/p2/biodiesel/article_alge.html." rel="nofollow">www.unh.edu</a> The DOE's report presented alot of information that I didn't know before, but overall it seemed to describe a program that didn't work, at least for a cost-efficient means for producing biodiesel. And then there was the UNH page, which gave the same numbers, but then went on to talk about how great such a system would be, and presented next to nothing about details. Since then I've been searching the internet for anything about algal cultivation, harvesting, or processing, and have found out alot about <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algae_culture.html" title="Algae culture">algae</a>; it's use in CO2 mitigation, for the production of hydrogen, as a health food, for dyes and medicines, but most all of the information that i've found for the production of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiesel.html" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> seems to be rehashed, always citing the same few papers. Every once in awhile I find some specific information about an aspect of production, but i haven't found anything about an integrated, fully functioning system that is successfully producing anywhere near the quantities that have been estimated, i've gotten the impression that there is alot of private research going on, but i can't find any specifics about it.</p>
<p><br />
For the efficient cultivation of algae for the production of biodiesel, this is a list of specific questions that i am tring to find answers to:</p>
<p><br />
what algal species are proving most successful for producing the largest amounts of oil, including the whole process, cultivation, harvesting, and extraction of oil.(much of the information i've found will cite a species that only performs well in one aspect, ie. it will grow well, but is expensive to harvest, or it's easy to harvest, but has a lower oil content.)</p>
<p>what temperature range do they do best in</p>
<p>is there an optimum depth for a tank or pond(ie- 4 inches of water, 5 feet, etc), in which the algae grow best, or is it more a matter of light penetration</p>
<p>do freshwater, or saltwater species seem to be more promising</p>
<p>if saltwater, does the salt you put into the water get consumed, needing to be replaced often, or is it a one-time thing</p>
<p>where can you inexpensively obtain specific species of algae,(i know of the university of Hawaii, i was looking for cheaper sources, perhaps someone doing research themselves within the connected U.S.)</p>
<p>what are the most cost-efficient means that are being used to harvest high-oil content algae, (i know of microscreens, flocculation, and centrifugation.)</p>
<p>how do you extract oil from algae(the only method i've seen is to dry it and then press it out)</p>
<p>what is the most efficient means of growing algae, open-pond, photobioreactor, green-house pond, polyethylene sleeves, tanks.</p>
<p>where do you get the nutrients for the algae, aside from expensive "fresh" fertilizer used for food crops,(i know about waste water, and fertilizer runoff, but i'm looking for efficient sources for if you don't live by a stream, or a sewage plant)</p>
<p>i've read that algae need only 1/10 the amount of light they recieve to grow, and was wondering whether it can be grow successfully using florecents, i don't know what spectrum light algae need to grow</p>
<p>how do you get CO2 into the water of an algae system,(do you have to compress it and pump it in, or some type of permeable membrane?)</p>
<p>how do you collect or seperate CO2, from the air, or from smoke, like in a coal plant</p>
<p>could a modification of a septic tank be used as an algae pond, the human waste being used as nutrient for the algae</p>
<p>what scientific equipment do you need to start an oil-producing algae pond, for a basic, home system(microscopes, ph-meter, etc)</p>
<p>could the exhaust from a wood stove be used to supply a pond with CO2</p>
<p>do you know of anyone, -university, corporation, individual-, who is currently doing research on biodiesel production from algae, espescially actual working systems.</p>

<dd>Moved to bottom of talk page as per standard convention. Well, this is the main article about biodiesel. It's not appropriate to go into a detailed discussion in the article about biodiesel production from algae because there is so much else that needs to be covered. Further detail could be covered in an article dedicated to the topic such as Algal biodiesel. But remember Wikipedia is a place centered around collaboratively building reference material, not to discuss how to's. I'm also not sure why you left a long list of questions and also a long list of links. If you already have the links, why are you posting them for us if they don't have your answers? But to answer your overall question, it is not yet publicly known if there's going to be a cost efficient way to produce oil from algae. The current research into it seems to be being done by private companies that are trying to commericallize the method so they're not releasing details in order to try to gain a competitive advantage. So basically most of your questions are not publicly known. And registration here does require cookies, but they don't do anything sneaky with them and it actually allows more privacy by not making your IP address public. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 22:20, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In case somebody manages to have the time, I found an article which may give extra material for either this article, or the Algal biodiesel article proposed above. Essentially a company in NZ has managed to produce biodiesel using a variety of algae commonly found in sewage ponds.

<p><i>Biodiesel reduces emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) by approximately 50 % and carbon dioxide by 78 % on a net lifecycle basis because the carbon in biodiesel emissions is recycled from carbon that was already in the atmosphere, rather than being new carbon from petroleum that was sequestered in the earth's crust. (Sheehan, 1998)</i></p>
<p>Does anyone have a link to the source matireal for this?</p>
<p><br />
This statement only works if the crops that you get your oil from were organically grown, otherwise you're discounting the all the CO, and CO2 that went into the production of the chemical fertilizers, which are made from petroleum sequestered in the earth's crust. If chemical fertilizers are made specifically for the production of oil crops for biodiesel, then chemical fertilizers are part of the "lifecycle" productiion of biodiesel</p>
<p>If the statement is just about the emissions of biodiesel from a diesel engine, then it may be true, but that isn't a "lifecycle" estimate.</p>

<p>I am not an expert on biodiesel, but a few points in this article seem to be flawed in my opinion. In the case of biodiesel made from oilseed, certain energy and environmental costs are not mentioned in the article.</p>
<p><br />
The article does not mention the following environmental costs:</p>
<p>1) the cost of clear-cutting natural ecosystems to produce any significant percentage of current diesel in use</p>
<p>2) the cost of monoculture crops on biodiversity</p>
<p>3) the cost of fertilizers used on watershed quality</p>
<p>4) the costs of soil fertility depletion by industrial agricultural practices</p>
<p><br />
In the case of efficiency, the TVA study by Van Dyne and Raymer does not look convincing for the following reasons:</p>
<p><br />
1) The energy inputted seems unreasonably low. This would make sense if it only included on-farm consumption of liquid fuel. A true look at energy return on investment would include all of the energy inputted to produce, transport and process the involved fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the energy inputted to process the oilseed. The energy efficiency ratios included in this article are better than that for extracting light crude oil, which seems absolutely impossible. As far as I know, there has been no comprehensive study looking at the energy efficiency of biodiesel. One such study has been done for ethanol by David Pimentel, which shows ethanol to be an energy-negative fuel.</p>
<p>2) Different crops require different energy inputs due to their specific needs and cultivation time requirements. The study is reported to just provide a national average, rather than being specific to oilseed crops</p>
<p>3) There is no reference for the study (neither citation nor year), and a Google search yielded only citations by biodiesel advocacy groups, in exactly the same language as this article. <a href="../../../j/f/e/User%7EJfeldman_edfb.html" title="User:Jfeldman">Jfeldman</a> Feb. 20, 2006</p>

<dd>I moved your comment to the bottom because that's where new conversations go by convention. A few points. 1) I'd be fine taking out the whole bit referring to Van Dayne and Raymer because I don't think it adds anything not already covered with specific sources. Pimental's study is not taken seriously by anyone in the scientific community. It was easily shown that he used old numbers and poor methods. It seems his piece wasn't about getting at the truth. There are plenty of studies looking at the energy efficiency, read the sources cited in the article. 2) If you want to cover the environmental costs find high quality studies on them and cite them or point them out here for discussion.

<dd>I restored some edits of mine concerning land use for palm oil production that were removed by an anon editor in January and replaced with the following: "Palm oil so far proved to be efficient as biodiesel." I don't think this new edit was particularly informative. The restored paragraph refers to a report by Friends of the Earth and a column by George Montbiot. These are not (especially the Montbiot column) primary sources. But, they do cover the ongoing debate in the environmental community over the net benefits of biofuels. Any better sources would, of course, help.

<p>A number of paragraphs in the above discussion and the associated wiki entry claim that biodiesel is sulfur free without providing evidence. Sulfur is common in nature and is part of many biological substances, such as amino acids. Some biodiesel manufacturers use sulfuric acid and other sulfur containing species as a catalyst, and the sulfur is not recovered. Also, the term "sulfur-free" is highly subjective. Do you consider less than 10 ppm sulfur free? 1 ppm sulfur is enough to degrade fuel cells. 10 ppm or less may deactivate certain catalysts over time. UPDATE: I found a page on Pacific Biodiesel's site that shows nominal sulfur content: <a href="http://www.biodiesel.com/why_biodiesel.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.biodiesel.com/why_biodiesel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.biodiesel.com/why_biodiesel.htm</a> According to this, it is typically between 0.012 and 0.023% by weight, between 33% and 66% the sulfur content of low sulfur diesel. Clearly this is not sulfur free. I notice Willie Nelson's biodiesel site claims that biodiesel reduces sulfur emissions by 100%. It seems this misinformation is widespread. According to Chevron, 0.05% sulfur diesel is currently in use in the US, and starting in 2007, we will be switching to 0.015% Sulfur diesel (ULSD). So based on current Diesel fuel, it is only a 50-75% decrease in Sulfur, and based on next year's diesel it is anywhere from a 20% decrease, to a 60% increase in Sulfur. This indicates that not all biodiesel is ULSD. I don't believe the Pacific Biodiesel numbers include sulfur added from sulfur containing catalysts. It seems most claims on the internet of biodiesel being sulfur free are based purely on speculation and not fact.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good catch. In fact lots of promotional information about biodiesel is just repeated from other promotional material without checking. I've tried to rectify that for everything in this article, but I haven't gotten to the whole thing. Soy biodiesel does have nearly negligible sulfur unless treated with sulfuric acid, and that would only be done if acid esterification is needed to reduce the FFAs to an acceptable level. Virgin vegetable oil feedstocks wouldn't need that. I did find a paper <i>Biodiesel Performance, Costs, and Use</i> by Anthony Radich that notes "Yellow grease biodiesel may have up to 24 parts per million sulfur, which exceeds the limit for ultra-low-sulfur diesel." There isn't much yellow grease biodiesel produced due to it's cold flow properties though. In addition the sulfur could be processed out of course. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 20:48, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just noticed a miscalculation I made in the ULSD numbers. The sulfur content for S500, and S15 (ULSD) is 500 ppmw and 15 ppmw respectively, which would correspond to 0.05% and 0.0015% sulfur by weight. Now, if the Pacific Diesel website is correct, biodiesel contains between 120 and 230 ppmw of sulfur. From what I've seen, the sulfur content of the fuel has a somewhat exponential relationship with catalyst life, so these sulfur levels would render catalytic converters inoperable in a short amount of time, possibly within several thousand miles/km. It is interesting the numbers you found for the yellow grease. That is about an order of magnitude less than the Pacific Biodiesel's numbers. I am curious whether there are any papers out there with the results of running biodiesel through a gas chromatograph to measure sulfur. I know the content of petrodiesel can vary by more than an order of magnitude from one barrel to the next, and I would imagine the same might be true of biodiesel. And it leaves the question of how will the economics of biodiesel be impacted if its necessary to perform hydrodesulfurization to keep the sulfur levels in check. If anyone finds any other sources which have measured sulfur levels, please do post them! Smilla0 12:56, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just found another source, Brownfield Biodiesel. They say "Biodiesel typically contains less than 15 parts per million (ppm) sulfur (sometimes as low as zero). Some biodiesel produced today may exceed 15 ppm sulfur, and those producers will be required to reduce those levels by 2006 if the biodiesel is sold into on-road markets."

Yet on the same page the text declares it to be under 15 ppm.

<dd>It takes <i>energy</i> to extract hydrogen and/or compress air and they make poor general transportation fuels because of limited range. The energy in biodiesel comes from the sun. The recent (new) design diesels do not smoke. The new (fed mandated) limits on sulfur allow catalytic converters which limit nox. Replacing petrodiesel with biodiesel reduces the country's need for foreign oil and reduces the net amount of co2 that gets added to the atmosphere. Biodiesel is about 7 times more effective at reducing our need for foreign oil than corn-ethanol. 4.232.3.96 16:58, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The goal of an encyclopedia article is to describe the topic, not critique it. Unlike biodiesel, hydrogen is not an energy source -- it consumes energy. You must get energy from somewhere else -- petroleum, coal, nuclear, wind, solar -- to make hydrogen. It's not practical to make sufficient quantities of hydrogen via electrolysis from solar or wind power to power a significant fraction of the world vehicle fleet. Anybody can do the math:</dd>

<dd>World transportation energy consumption is 100 quadrillion BTU per year (2.93E16 watt hours). Average solar cell efficiency (including aging, environmental, and transmission losses) is about 10%. Also you can't use crystalline cells on a huge industrial level, but must use less efficient amorphous or other PV technologies. Hydrogen electrolysis is about 70% efficient, transport 90% efficient, vehicle/depot storage about 80% efficient, fuel cells about 70% efficient, electric motors about 92% efficient, for total end-to-end efficiency of about 32%. Average annual solar insolation at mid-North America latitudes is about 4500 watt hrs per square meter per day, or 133,225 watt hrs per year: <a href="http://www.windsun.com/Solar_Basics/Solar_maps.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.windsun.com/Solar_Basics/Solar_maps.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.windsun.com/Solar_Basics/Solar_maps.htm</a></dd>

<dd>I forgot to add liquefaction efficiency, which is only about 70%. You've got to liquefy or compress hydrogen to move it somewhere, so the end-to-end chain efficiency is 22% or less. That increases the required solar PV area to at least 5 million square km, or about 2/3 of the continental U.S, to supply only 1/2 of world transportation energy need. Those are very rough numbers and don't consider savings from fuel cell vehicle efficiency.

<p>I'm having problems adding a footnote, if anybody could help I'd appreciate it. I tried using proper web cite reference format, and it looks OK in preview. However when saving the page, there are duplicate A and B backpointers in each footnote ref at article bottom. I tried switching to an in-line external link, still same problem. Finally gave up and totally removed the link, still same problem. Copied and pasted entire article to my sandbox and experimented with deleting various article portions; couldn't isolate problem. Duplicate A/B refs still appear with article truncated to just one line with one footnote reference. Would appreciate any help or advice. Sorry about the problem if I did something wrong. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoema_807b.html" title="User:Joema">Joema</a> 13:55, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Joema, I think there must be a problem with the rendering engine today -- I tried looking at every version through the history, both looking at individual versions and at each diff, and couldn't see the problem you mentioned. I experimented to try and replicate it with various edits and to my surprise, I couldn't even replicate a known problem that I've seen before (the one that happens when someone forgets the slash in a &lt;/ref&gt; tag) which truncates just after a footnote. Then clicking the "Article" button showed me the exact problem you described. And, in the time I've been writing this, it has changed again, because refreshing produces a perfectly well-formatted article with no footnote problems -- even though it's the same article version. My suspicion is that someone was trying something new to fix the problem I described, and end up breaking more than they fixed, so they undid the fix. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC) (Late edit: and apparently the problem's known...) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:02, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I confirm there's still a problem with footnotes. Even the most simple footnote reference using <b>&lt;ref&gt; and &lt;/ref&gt;</b> isn't working right. A single new footnote reference creates multiple reference links under the <b>&lt;references/&gt;</b> section. It doesn't happen for preview, only when you save the page. I'm giving up for now and just added the footnote as an external link at article bottom. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoema_807b.html" title="User:Joema">Joema</a> 23:26, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I've got a good idea. Why doesn't Wikipedia hand all external links over to dmoz. That would stop any argument ever over them. So let's remove the Edit facility from the External links because it's not needed any more seeing as that section's now dmoz.

<p>Crazy idea, and maybe it's even based on my once hearing something about this (though a Google search turned up nothing.), but I was wondering if the heavy economic toll of the <a href="../../../z/e/b/Zebra_mussel.html" title="Zebra mussel">Zebra mussel</a> invasion could be partly compensated by turning the mussels they remove into biodiesel. I'm not suggesting that it's any kind of solution to the problems of the Zebra mussel invasion and biodiesel supply, just that if they are removing large quantities of mussels from ships and infastructure, would it be a good idea to convert the biomass into biodiesel? The alternative is it being thrown away and not used at all. Could such an endeavor possibly break even once the animal-remains-to-biodiesel infastructure is in place?</p>

<dd>Certainly a interesting idea. There are existing rendering facilities for most livestock. The yields would be pretty low, however. IIRC, the triglyceride content of typical livestock ranges between 15% and 30%. I would expect shellfish to be near the bottom of this scale, if not significantly below it, since they are mostly shell and muscle. As the price of oil increases, niche products like this will become more and more viable.<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillgiant_f017.html" title="User:Hillgiant">Hillgiant</a> 15:04, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Talk%7EBiodiesel_cb98.html" title="Edit section: Re: Water contamination">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Re: Water contamination</span></h2>
<p>The first line of this section was recently changed (Oct. 3) to state that biodiesel is <b>"hydrophobic"</b>. Previously, it had stated that biodiesel is "hydrophilic" -- the opposite of hydrophobic. (This change was made several days after a question was raised in the "To-do list" -- the original statement seems to have gone unchallenged for a considerable period of time.) The change to "hydrophobic" seems to me to be consistent with the statement in the "Description" section that biodiesel "is practically immiscible with water...."</p>
<p>On the other hand, these statements appear to flatly contradict the assertion in the WP article on <a href="../../../h/y/g/Hygroscopy.html" title="Hygroscopy">Hygroscopy</a>, which states that "An example of a hygroscopic substance is biodiesel, which absorbs water to about 1200 parts per million (PPM)." I checked around and found that this claim is repeated widely on numerous websites, but I could not find definitive substantiation -- merely repetition of the same statement. I was hoping this apparent contradiction would be explored here on Wikipedia -- but this specific claim is not addressed anywhere in the Biodiesel article.</p>
<p>This is not a minor point. If biodiesel is indeed <b>hygroscopic</b> -- meaning that it has a strong tendency to pull water molecules out of the atmosphere -- there are serious implications in terms of its use, storage, etc., which would need to be addressed in the article. Currently, the problem of "Water contamination" is stated to arise because "Some of the water present is residual to processing, and some comes from storage tank condensation." But there's no mention of continuing accumulation of water due to its alleged hygroscopic properties.</p>
<p>So I pose the following question: Is it, in fact, possible for a substance be BOTH <i>hydrophobic</i> AND <i>hygroscopic</i>?? In other words, can it, somehow, both repel water molecules and also absorb them? One way or the other, this question needs to be settled. <a href="../../../c/g/i/User%7ECgingold_abdb.html" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> 14:10, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, my apologies for adding the Verification tag. My sense is that the explanation given is probably correct, but there is nonetheless a serious question re Hygroscopy, as I detailed above. I was hoping to elicit a response on that question, but it's been over a week now, so I thought it was time to give it another try. <a href="../../../c/g/i/User%7ECgingold_abdb.html" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> 13:59, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As to your question a to whether a hydrophobic compound can also be hygroscopic, the simple answer is "yes to a point." Organic compounds can elicit both behaviors simultaneously when they have varying functional groups with a wide enough separation. BioDiesel is an ester with a very shot side and a long side, the short side can exhibit polar qualities due to the presence of oxygen while the long chain exhibits nonpolar qualities. The polar side is what attracts the water, while the long chain repels the water. Cells of living organisms utilize a similar method to control the amount of materials crossing the membrane. I hope this explanation helps. <a href="../../../d/a/s/User%7EDas_Nerd_cfe2.html" title="User:Das Nerd">Das Nerd</a> 20:08, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you! I think your explanation may well get us "half way there", so to speak. As I said, it's widely stated elsewhere that biodiesel "absorbs water to about 1200 PPM" -- something which is not mentioned at all in the "Water contamination" section. If this is indeed a scientifically verified fact, then it needs to be included here, along with the other two reasons that are given. Again, none of the websites I consulted cited a source for the claim -- my impression was that they were all simply repeating a statement originally made by a single person or publication, which I was unable to locate. Do you have any idea where to find scientific validation (or lack thereof) for this assertion? Or, given your reply to my question, do you at least find it credible enough to include here without further confirmation? <a href="../../../c/g/i/User%7ECgingold_abdb.html" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> 21:10, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Surely pure plant oil without any processing qualifies as 'Biodiesel'because it is made entirely from biomass and will operate many kinds of diesel engine! If one uses Methanol and caustic soda (neither of which are biomass)to make FAME, fatty acid methyl ester, this surely disqualifies it from being called bio-diesel! replies appreciated &lt;email removed&gt;</p>

<dd>No, "diesel" fuel is a specific fractional distillate of crude oil, containing certain chemicals. It is not anything that will burn in a diesel engine.

<p>I propose that some of the sections in this article would really fit better in <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetable_oil_economy.html" title="Vegetable oil economy">Vegetable oil economy</a> as they apply to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_vegetable_oil.html" title="Straight vegetable oil">straight vegetable oil</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetable_oil_blends.html" title="Vegetable oil blends">vegetable oil blends</a> just as well. I am thinking of most parts of the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li># * 6.1 Biodiesel feedstock</li>
<li># 7 Yields of common crops</li>
<li># * 7.1 Efficiency and economic arguments</li>
<li># * 7.2 Thermal depolymerization</li>
<li># 8 Environmental benefits</li>
<li># 9 Environmental concerns</li>
<li># 10 Current research</li>
<li># * 10.1 Algaculture</li>
</ul>
<p>What do other people think?</p>

<dd>Every article should cover all the most important subtopics in relation to their importance to the overall topic. So much of the above material does need to be covered in this article because it is important to biodiesel. But it should be done in <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>, and if there is too much detail that calls for moving the excess detail off and leaving a proper summary. If a subtopic can't justify importance to the overall topic, only then should it be removed. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 14:23, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
