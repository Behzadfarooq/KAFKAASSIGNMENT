<h2><span class="mw-headline">I volunteer to maintain this portal</span></h2>
<p>Hey guys, I'm volunteering to maintain this portal. Just so you know my main area of expertise in biology is evolutionary biology, so if you see me tending to focus on evo bio to the exclusion of other disciplines, say something about it. I'll be maintaining this portal but that doesn't mean I don't need your help! Here are some things you can do to help me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate good biology pictures. These may be good pictures of animals or living things, interesting pictures of microscopic life, or maybe just good diagrams of biological processes. Post links to the pictures in here (as well as your caption) and on my <a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk page</a>. Or, if the highlighted picture is already several days stale, <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and update the picture!</li>
<li>Locate good biology featured articles. For now we can work off of <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">Wikipedia:Featured articles</a> but at some point we're going to run out and it might become a bit more difficult to locate them. If you have any leads please post in here and on my <a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk page</a>. It would help me a lot if you could write a short one or two paragraph summary for use in the portal infobox. Or, if the featured article is already several days stale, <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and pick and link to a new one!</li>
<li>Update the "Did you know?" section with neato biology factoids. I'm sure there's a lot more out there than I could ever come up with, and it's kind of lame to just randomly browse biology-related articles hoping to find something useful.</li>
<li>Update the "Things you can do" section. I just blanked it because everything in it was several months out of date. As you run across biology articles that are, for whatever reason, of inferior quality, please link them in the section.</li>
<li>Contact me with any concerns or questions you may have at my <a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk page</a>. I'm always open to suggestions or comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>One more thing: I'm working on a system for preserving previous featured articles, highlighted pictures, and did you know factoids. Once I standardize a way to do this I'll post a how-to on here. This will be a good system because in the boxes on the portal page we can have a link that says, "View previous featured articles". It's much better than having to tangle with the edit history.</p>
<p>Thanks, and I look forward to looking forward with all of you on <a href="../../../b/i/o/Portal%7EBiology_c9fb.html" title="Portal:Biology">Portal:Biology</a>! --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 03:55, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Here's a little source for finding new pictures to use.

<p>Hi Cyde,</p>
<p>I'm glad that someone is willing to maintain the biology portal. My only problem, is the "Highlighted Picture" area. This is probably very neccesary in subjects like Chemistry, where featured pictures are extremely lacking, but the current list of biology featured pictures is extremely large, and of high quality (mainly plants and animals). It has a new photo in it at least once a week, as it is most people's favourite photographic subject. If we run out of pictures, we could always start again, as it would take a long time to get through all the photos. Also, whenever a new photo is upgraded to featured status, it could get feature next on the portal.</p>
<p>I might also suggest only updating the portal once (or twice) a week. As it is quite a slow portal, it might be best to slowly update, so everyone can read the page once a week, and it is easier for you to update it (and spread out the time before you run out of featured articles). --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 14:34, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alright, I'm aiming at updating the article and picture every Wednesday. I'll be updating the "Did you knows" more often than that, but I won't be entirely replacing them, so hopefully they'll "scroll off" the main Portal page in about the time of a week. The archive for those isn't done yet, but I'll work on that once it becomes time. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 15:49, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Cyde, thanks for your offer to manage this portal. I think the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photosynthesis.html" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> article is pretty good and could be featured. <a href="../../../j/r/b/User%7EJrbouldin_bd87.html" title="User:Jrbouldin">Jrbouldin</a> 01:46, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey guys, I'm the current maintainer of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Portal%7EBiology_c9fb.html" title="Portal:Biology">Portal:Biology</a> and since I figure I "hang" with you guys a lot, you could perhaps help me. Just check out the portal and comment on things you think should be changed (or make the changes yourself). I especially need some more "Did you knows". Also, I'm currently in the process of taking over <a href="../../../s/c/i/Portal%7EScience_78d6.html" title="Portal:Science">Portal:Science</a>, so if you want to help me with that too I'd be grateful. Note that I set the current Featured article on the science portal to evolution. Just trying to get some exposure for us! The Science Portal is important because it's linked from the top of the main page. Not a bad spot, eh? --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 02:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure what to say here except I'm all about evidence and logic rather than politics. We all have our place so to speak... <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 03:58, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I actually wasn't trying to make it political. It's just the more exposure <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> gets the more (hopefully) good editors it gets for it and related topics. If you want to ascribe it to a base human appeal, I think celebrity is more appropriate than politics.

<dd>Unfortunately, it is not animals but bacteria in the cattle gut that digest the cellulose, so that particular "did you know" is technically incorrect. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> 19:20, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The animals make use of the bacteria to digest the cellulose. The bacteria do the actual digesting, but the animals digest the bacterial waste products. Essentially, the bacteria are part of the animal digestive system. Still, if it's confusing, leave it out. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User%7EEc5618_0777.html" title="User:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 19:32, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The featured pictures are heavily biased in favor of vertebrates and butterflies.

<dd>There were at least 20 invertebrates in the featured picture list. Granted most are insects, but since most invertebrates are, there is no problem there. Secondly, I have noticed there is a bias on your choice of "selected pictures" for animals. Why do you have to choose an animal when there are plenty of good plant photos available. It just doesn't make sense to me, that you have to choose a sub-par picture for the reason of variety, when you haven't nearly used a variety of images. You did not have to choose an aquatic invertebrate, and if you did, you could have used the <a href="../../../k/r/i/Image%7EKrilleyekils.jpg_4fe2.html" title="Image:Krilleyekils.jpg">antarctic krill eye</a> image. --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 03:25, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I've suggested a colour palette <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Samsara/PortalBioColour" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Samsara/PortalBioColour" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Please be clear on the fact that I suggest we pick ONE of the possibilities, not do patchwork! If there's no objections filed here within the next three days or so, I'll go ahead with putting one of these into practice to see if it gets reverted. The main decision to be made would be whether to stick with the white writing. If we do, the background should probably become a little darker. My current favourite is the colour scheme of the "selected picture" box on my example page, although it could be a bit bluer, as in the bottom example of the left hand column. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> <sub><span style="text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contrib</a></span></sub> <sup><span style="position: relative; left: -36px; margin-right: -36px; text-decoration:none;"><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a></span></sup> 19:28, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Featured or Selected Biography?</span></h2>
<p>I'm thinking a Featured/Selected Biography would be a good addition. This way there are two main content areas on the portal. I think a lot of people know a lot more about biological topics in general than biologists of the past. For biographies I'm thinking along the lines of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Pasteur_5462.html" title="Louis Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anton_van_Leeuwenhoek_9541.html" title="Anton van Leeuwenhoek">Anton van Leeuwenhoek</a>, etc. There's a whole lot more of 'em I learned about way back in high school Biology. I'll have to dig up the names from somewhere. But I think we can definitely go very far with this.

<dd>I will be moving near the beach in about a month, and it is really well known for its crabs (unfortunately not horseshoe crabs, but I find them all fascinating), so I may be able to get some good photos of crabs in the future (probably be a while though). I agree with Samsara, in that we really need a good caecilian photo. I cannot just go out and take one, as frogs are the only amphibians in Aus, but I really hope someone will soon. <a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">User:Dawson</a> uploaded a photo of one recently, and I was ecstatic about it, however it was far from feature status. Maybe we should create a section, where we request high quality photos of certain things. It would be a good insentive for people to go out photographing, as the current list of requested photos are very hard to get. The high quality photos may be of things which are common in an area, but most people just do not have the access to them. --<a href="../../../l/i/q/User%7ELiquidGhoul_8302.html" title="User:LiquidGhoul">liquidGhoul</a> 11:12, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
