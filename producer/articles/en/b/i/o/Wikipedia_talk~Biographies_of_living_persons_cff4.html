<p>How does one go about identifying an identity? An admin claims to be contacted by a extremely well know conspiracy theorist on his talk page. The person posts solely from an IP address, that is not from the college they are known to be at, but a DSL line in another part of California. The admin has been in edit wars over the article, and the article ended up protected. One could even say the admin has been arguing that people that believe in conspiracy theories are "not all there." Which makes them an odd person to have been contacted if the theorist was looknig for a sympathetic ear. The admin edits the protected article according to the request the anon left. Oddly enough the anon did not leave any proof, register an account with their known email at their affiliated college or anything. Do you remove the paragraph? is this a COI? How does one go about verifying this, its kinda odd timing, and the persons homepage and articles they write on a known site have not been updated to reflect this "new view" they claim to have. While I am sure people change their ideas, how do I verify this? is an anon message enough to edit a protected article you had been in edit wars over? --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to hear input on the following question. Suppose someone on an article talk page expresses a personal opinion that a particular public figure is "crazy and bad". That's it. There are no <i>facts</i> being alleged, which could be right or wrong, or well-sourced or poorly-sourced or unsourced, it's simply one person's opinion that that public figure is "crazy and bad". I will stipulate, by the way, that article talk pages are not for the sharing of such opinions and that someone who posts them should be gently informed to save such opinions for a personal blog or some other forum; the poster in question was in fact so advised.</p>
<p>My question is this: Is an editor who sees someone expressing a personal opinion of this nature entitled to remove the entire talk page section, or even just to edit the other editor's words to eliminate any reference to the public figure, claiming that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> entitles them to do so immediately? I would appreciate hearing opinions on this. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:54, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I would say so, Antaeus. If you mean can we removed unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material about ourselves, yes we can, certainly if someone uses our real names.

<p>Does this also apply to negative comments made about an individual during an AfD? I have seen several prominent individuals get pretty well trashed during AfD discussions, as Wikipedia editors unfamiliar with the field pop in and say things like, ""Delete: I've never heard of him, he's just a nobody," or ""Weak keep: His book was trash, but looks like it's pretty well-known trash." "Delete: Thoroughly not-notable," etc. Can or should those types of comments be refactored, after the discussion is completed? I agree that it's worthwhile to keep older AfDs for future reference, but perhaps if they contain personal attacks, they should be sealed away for view only by admins, and unsealed only if needed for future AfD discussions. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 23:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would oppose the refactoring or blanking of those kinds of comments during deletion discussions. "Non-notable" is not a personal attack at all. It's not even a negative comment. It's a simple assessment of how well known the person is by others. "His book was trash" is also not a <i>personal</i> attack. It is a negative opinion but it is inherently self-sourced - "I thought his book was trash". As a reader, I would be entirely entitled to that personal opinion. It wouldn't be appropriate to include my personal opinion in an article but it may well be relevant and appropriate in other contexts like deletion discussions. Furthermore, it's a negative opinion about the work, not the author. Books can't have their feelings hurt (and if an author's feelings are hurt by a single negative review, well, he/she is in the wrong line of work.) Applying this principle to AFD discussions should be done only in the most egregious of circumstances. Normal editorial discussions don't come close to the BLP line. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 04:48, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've noticed a lot of anon vandalism on BLPs lately. Since we have this policy that holds those articles to a higher standard, I wonder if it's appropriate to make semi-protection become the norm for BLPs. Users that aren't logged in could still post new info to the talk page, but not touch the bio itself. I don't think it's too high a barrier to ask someone to create an account before they can edit BLPs.</p>
<p>I don't want to create a bunch of work for admins here, so maybe I'm asking for a template that nonymous editors can use to tag an article as being a BLP and automatically protect it against anonymous edits. And that implies that a logged-in editor could also remove that template. But doing so would leave an audit trail, and unless there was a good reason to do it (the subject of the bio died, or the template were originally applied in error), it would affect the reputation of that editor, so it isn't something many people would do lightly.</p>
<p>There. I said it. Now tell me why anonymous edits to BLPs should be allowed. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Monster_dc52.html" title="User:The Monster">The Monster</a> 05:58, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I think that from the perspective of legal liability, anons are less problematic than editors with handles. If an IP-anon defames someone, they can see the IP directly, which takes them one step closer to finding them for retribution. <a href="../../../s/e/m/User_talk%7ESemperf_0e01.html" title="User talk:Semperf"><font color="#008000"><b><i>semper fictilis</i></b></font></a> 04:55, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It could be. However if it's a proxy or a shared IP without good records (whether they never existed or they were deleted coz it's been a while) or the ISP refuses to cooperate or whatever it'll be of limited use. On the other hand, if it's a registered editor with a resonable number of edits they could force wikipedia to hand over out logs related to that editor maybe. From there, there may be multiple IPs (including different ISPs), more recent IPs as well as multiple edits from the same IP at different times and it'll probably be more likely to be they may be able to track the person down. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

Seperating people into public versus nonpublic is for convinience. Privacy issues are actually decided by the specific encroachment of privacy alledged. But we should get nowhere near the line, so simplifying by dividing people up into private vs. public will work most the time.

At first it was publically visible. The question is should the BLP policy take into account a person's status as public individual vs. private individual? to go with that, a 'private person' would have even some un-controversial material removed, while the public people would <i>not</i>. The problem is... who decides who is public vs. non-public? is <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Affleck_9dc7.html" title="Ben Affleck">Ben Affleck</a> public or non? is <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> public or non? is <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooter_Libby_3b58.html" title="Scooter Libby">Scooter Libby</a> public or non? is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unibomber.html" title="Unibomber">Unibomber</a> public or non? since it's all so subjective (our take, the media's take, the subject's take)... who decides? A famous actor deciding everything is private? What is a private person becomes the textbook def of public, then tries a 'take back'? Or someone that fate makes famous... who decides?</p>
<p>I think we should have a section on this in the BLP policy, and a distinction of who is which that will hopefully non-edit-warrable... simplifications are bad (agreeing with WAS there on the Brandt page) but at the same time, people really either are or aren't. My thought was that if you meet x, y, and z criterion, you are public and we can add a {{PublicBLP}} or {{PrivateBLP}} template that links back to the appropriate section/rules. George Bush and Oprah Winfrey for example are clearly public... and once info is out, it can't really be taken back. thoughts? - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 23:13, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>my concern based on the chat with WAS is that 1) we need perhaps something different (more stringent?) for non-public people should be considered, and 2) that we need a clear policy definition of what makes someone public vs. private, and 3) a criterian for changes to those conditions (public to private, and private to public).

<dd>I think you may be misconstruing what "public" means in this legal sense. Plenty of public figures are reclusive or would prefer to be private, but that has absolutely no bearing on their legal standing. Someone who is not a public figure should not have an article. If they do, it will be deleted. There is no doubt that Brandt would meet any legal threshold for being a public figure, and this "non-public" argument is being advanced by people making groundless claims based on a misinterpretation. If someone is notable enough to have an article, and they are doing something that gets them mentioned in the national news many times, they are almost certainly a public figure. Since we already have a reliable source requirement, anyone following that policy is writing about a public figure. Whether they are "notable" is another matter and is a more arbitrary and non-legal definition used internally. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 00:04, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for that distinction. One thought I had come up with was that it might make sense to only include bios of people when there is enough material in secondary sources to build a proper and encyclopedic biography of the person's entire life. That is surely a higher standard than we have now but, seems to me, might not be a bad idea. So, in this case we'd definitely "lose" <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> but we'd keep <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a>. Lots of links to individuals would be broken but I think WP would survive and would be stronger in the long run.

<p>I haven't looked at this page in a while, and I'm surprised to see that the edits one should remove immediately and without discussion are now described as "unsourced... contentious material, whether negative or positive". Is this a change of policy? Does this mean that we have to demonstrate that an unsourced negative claim is contentious before removing it?

<dd>It used to say "unsourced negative" material. This change just points out that contentious material does not have to be negative. When did it only say "unsourced"? In any case, if it's merely unsourced, this policy doesn't apply.

<dd>(to Allen) You have to demonstrate that unsourced <i>positive</i> material is contentious before removing it, if you want it protected by this policy.

<dd>One needs to make some kind of reasonable argument for it being contentious - such as it is negative or self serving or you don't believe it or it seems unlikely. If others accept it as a reasonable argument then no problem. The problem is we had one person insist that every unsourced claim was contentious and the point is use reasonable judgement on a claim by claim basis or at least on an article by article basis as when stubbing a whole article due to some article-wide concern. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 10:28, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the responses. So if I'm reading things right, all three of you agree that negative material on living people is assumed contentious. I can understand this, but I feel like the article could use clarification. As it stands now, I think it opens the door for people to argue, "No, you can't summarily delete that sentence I wrote, because while it is negative and unsourced, everyone knows it's true, and therefore it isn't contentious." Though it would be awkward in terms of prose, how about adding a parenthetical "(All negative material is assumed to be contentious)" to the article right before reference #2? --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 17:00, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most problematic articles aren't really biographies anyway, but instead are notable things organized on a page with the title of a living person's name.

<p><i>Biographical information on living people</i>, looks good. Support the move. Let's not change the wording of the policy, and discuss possible implications of any changes. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 15:36, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>the B is redundant? how about the L? How is it acceptable to have bogus claims in articles about <i>dead</i> people? And how about the P? How is it acceptable to have bogus claims in articles about <i>anything</i>? I am sorry, but this whole page is just a glorified corollary of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. We can well have a "living people" taskforce for people who are interested in the living in particular for some reason or other, but I really don't see why this should have the status of a separate policy. I know this is a consequence of the Siegenthaler case. But then, why not be honest and call it "biographies of influential US media people who have the power to give Wikipedia hell if we mess up their articles"?? <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(�)</a></small> 17:19, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The L is not redundant; the point of it is that Wikipedia must be protected from accusations of libel. Under the law of the US and many other nations, negative information about a living person which is false or unproven may be classed as libel. The Wikimedia Foundation is a charity, and can't be expected to deal with expensive lawsuits from offended biographees. I agree that having "bogus claims" in other articles is not acceptable either; but false or unsourced statements in articles on dead people or non-current organisations are much less likely to cause offence. This is why unsourced controversial claims in BLP articles must be deleted immediately, while such claims in non-BLP articles should be tagged with a {{fact}} tag. <font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89"><font color="purple"><b>Wal</b></font></a><a href="../../../w/a/l/User_talk%7EWalton_monarchist89_7ca3.html" title="User talk:Walton monarchist89"><font color="silver"><b>ton</b></font></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/WP%7EBRoy_e296.html" title="WP:BRoy"><font color="purple">Vivat Regina!</font></a></sup></small></font> 09:23, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I would strongly support such a page move. Indeed I've been thinking of something like this for a while. While I'm not sure, it appears to me some people make the mistake of thinking BLP applies only to biographies and only to the person who's biography it's about probably partially because of the title. I often remind people to remember the principles of BLP in articles where there is a significant LP factor. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 15:22, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Db- I don't think this policy has only affected biographies of influential US media people. It usually becomes an issue in nearly all living people biographies and in fact has been quite controversial in some like <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>. Also several areas of application of this policy are usually more severe then in non-biographies like the in the removal of irrelevant commentry &amp; other potentially defamatory material from the talk pages of LP. And issues like privacy and controversy surrounding living people tends to be handled differently. So all in all, I don't think this policy just replicates other policies, it has made us a lot more strict around living people which I personally think is a good thing <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 16:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In my opinion we have a consensus for a move to <b>Biographical information on living people</b>. Will someone back me up on this by making the move? <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 23:05, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I decided it's best to follow normal procedure and list this in proposed move, add a header and I've also mentioned in the village pump as it's likely many people have not noticed this.

<p>This page contains a section explaining "<a href="../../../d/e/s/Designated_agent.html" title="Designated agent">designated agent</a>" of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>But if I understand it correctly, it is the point of contact for deletion request based on copyright concern (DMCA takedown notice), not for libel or other legal problems that biographies of living persons tend to have.</p>
<p>CDA 230 gives pretty good immunity to Wikimedia Foundation when it comes to libelous posts on Wikipedia, as I understand. I am not sure if it is a good idea to give impression that the designated agent will take care of non-copyright legal concerns. I am not saying that libelous stuff should remain in the article or such complaints should be ignored. But I suppose if Jimbo or others act to remove libelous or other objectionable material, that is out of courtesy and their sense of moral obligation, not out of some legal duty.</p>
<p>So why not simply offer contact address?</p>

<p>Shouldn't there be an exception for user talk pages where the information has been added by an administrator following standard Wikipedia administrative procedures? The rule as it is says that if an administrator puts "this user is a suspected sockpuppet" or "this user has been warned about vandalism" on a user's page, anyone can remove that statement because that is unsourced negative material about a living person. (Except in the unlikely case where the vandalism warning has also been published in a book or magazine.)

<p>It's true that a vandal's contribution history is already linked. But the vandal's contribution history isn't a reliable source, because we don't allow Wikipedia links as a reliable source.

Moreover, claiming that the contributions are vandalism is original research.</p>

<dd>I'm sorry but I disagree. (Not with your proposal but with your assertion in the first paragraph.) Wikipedia articles can not be used as sources for other articles but <i>actions</i> on Wikipedia are a self-evidencing primary source of knowledge. The qualification of "reliable" does not apply. You are confusing the rules for the product with the administrative rules for the process of creating the product. Go ahead and amend the page if you think you have to - I just think it's unnecessary and a little <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">creepish</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 18:17, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actions on Wikipedia are only primary sources for claims that the action happened. If I want to write "so-and-so said so-and-so on Wikipedia", I can refer to Wikipedia. If I want to write "so-and-so committed vandalism on Wikipedia", I need a reliable non-Wikipedia source which characterizes his Wikipedia activities as vandalism; the Wikipedia activities are not themselves a source. This rules quirk happens because BLP, by applying to user pages, also brings in a lot of baggage (such as reliable sources) which user pages normally don't have to conform with.</dd>
<dd>Also, the way the attribution policy (particularly the FAQ) is currently written, Wikipedia may not be used as a source *at all*, regardless of any other reasons why it might be included--primary source, self-published source about the author, whatever. This makes no sense, but I tried to change it and couldn't. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 15:21, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it should be handled in the following manner: The user in question should leave a comment on his talk page, together with some category to attract other users to notice it. Any user may then do the following:
<ol>
<li>Leave the message in the AFD discussion, as it was written, together with a link to the relevant diff.</li>
<li>leave a message on the user talk page along the lines of <b>I've copied your comment to the AFD discussion</b>, and remove the category.</li>

<p>Okay, I want a ruling here. Time and time again, I have seen articles where a living person has a notable controversy surrounding them, and half the folks want to put the controversy in the lead (citing the <b>guideline</b> <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>'s advice that any notable controversies should be included in the lead text), while half the folks want to push it down to the bottom of the article (citing that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is a <b>policy</b> and therefore trumps <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>). Examples: <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Hardaway_7465.html" title="Tim Hardaway">Tim Hardaway</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Richards_6ddf.html" title="Michael Richards">Michael Richards</a>.</p>
<p>I frankly don't give a damn either way, I'm just sick of an argument that doesn't seem to have an answer. So my request is: Can someone with authority (I invoke the holy name of Jimbo!&#160;;D ) please make a ruling on this, and make it <i>explicit</i> in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> as to whether current controversies regarding a living person belong in the lead text?

<dd>(e/c) Related to the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Richards_6ddf.html" title="Michael Richards">Michael Richards</a> controversy I posited the logic that because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTAL" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> relative to how a controversy will play out in a give individual's life that in the short term it is logical per <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>'s "notable controversies" wording that mention of the controversy in the lead made sense with respect to the notability of the incident.

<dd><a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> which is <i>policy</i> must always trump <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> which is merely a writing <i>guideline</i>. Controversial negative material must always be treated with sensitivity, particularly when it could be damaging to a living person's career or reputation. A seperate, more clearly defined section regarding controversies needs to be added to the <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> guideline. The term "controversy" really needs to be defined. Are we talking about criminal convictions or inflamatory public statements? More importantly, how those controversies relate to an individual's basis of notability is key to inclusion in the lead. A notable stock broker who is involved in a controversy involving a criminal prosecution for embezzlement warrants mention in the lead - because it is relevant to the subject's notability. On the flip side, an actor's arrest for DUI should not be included in the opening. The person is notable for their acting career, not their ability to maintain sobriety. If the founder of MAD were convicted of DUI, then the incident would be worthy of inclusion in the lead.</dd>
<dd>The current controversy on the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Richards_6ddf.html" title="Michael Richards">Michael Richards</a> page is an excellent example of the flaws in the <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> guideline. At present a very vocal minority are attempting to <i>define</i> Richards' in the article's lead as being notable for only to things&#160;: starring in Seinfeld &amp; shouting racial epithets. The very short lead would seem to define Richards as an actor and a racist. How can that not be considered defamation of character? There is a <b>global</b> problem with editorial bias on that page because Richards' biography is being treated differently than the leading paragraphs of other celebrity biographies. Barbra Streisand's "shut the fuck up" incident with a heckler isn't included in the leading paragraph of her biography. Why would Michael Richards' be treated differently?</dd>
<dd>Whether or not a "scandal" or "controversy" has affected an individual's career can only really be determined after that career has ended. I would propose that the scandals which are not of a criminal nature and do not directly relate to the individual's profession, should be excluded from the leading paragraph's of all biographies of living people. After a person has died, whether or not a scandal adversly affected their career (such as the Fatty Arbuckle prosecution) can be determined. By including scandals in opening sentences and paragraphs Wikipedia may be the cause of adverse effects on an individual's career. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 04:59, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's always a problem when people make up their own policies and guidelines as they go along, instead of following ones established by consensus. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> shows how the article should be approached and the emphasis on properly sourced material is paramount. It does not seek to exclude negative or derogatory material, but to ensure any such material is justified by sufficient sources and is then dealt with from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The aim of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> was to stop a practice by some editors of inserting rumour, hearsay and the like willy-nilly. It was not to exclude properly sourced material, which should be treated objectively like any other material.</dd>
<dd>Once the article is established, the lead should be a summary of it, so that any reader who wants a quick grasp of the basics should be able to obtain them, without having to read the whole article. Obviously, as <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> makes clear, this also includes any "notable controversies". The main text should have already established the prominence or otherwise of any controversies, so the lead should follow that precedent.</dd>
<dd>The problem with the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Richards_6ddf.html" title="Michael Richards">Michael Richards</a> lead is that there is simply not enough material on Richards' other activities, so the mention of the controversial incident occupies a disproportionate space. Editors on that article spend all their time arguing over The Laugh Factory Incident, but do not add material to other aspects of Richards' life. This is a problem I have encountered elsewhere also, e.g. <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xeni_Jardin_8fc4.html" title="Xeni Jardin">Xeni Jardin</a>.</dd>

<dd>This is an individual who is notable for issues other than his antisemitism, so it should indeed be possible to find other material, and if some editors think the antisemitism is overwelming (the "near-demented judaic banking elite," the "rats of the world," the "scum of the earth," the "pigs and monkeys who should be annihilated" <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/07/09/do09.xml&amp;page=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/07/09/do09.xml&amp;page=4" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), they should add other stuff to balance it out.

"Al-Sudais in his own words in context" with extensive quotes and let the reader decide. The sermon as a whole is more about supporting Muslims than attacking Jews. He attacks Jews in the context of supporting Muslims and Supports Muslims in the context of supporting his God and all that is holy - might be a better way to say it. anyway, it should be about <b>him</b> and not about Jews. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 23:01, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thank you for your lecture. Please do not make this personal. Al-Sudais's beliefs can and should be described in NPOV manner. Basing on the refs, he definitely belongs in the AS people cat, and my quick search revealed more evidence, I'll see if it may be added to the article to make it as uncontroversial as possible. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Humus_sapiens_ea7b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Humus sapiens">?</a></sup> 11:37, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Beinin is the professor of Middle East History at Stanford University, where he has taught since 1983. He also serves as Director of the Middle East Studies Department at the American University in Cairo. How is that not a reliable source? On the other hand the criticism of Sudais comes from a British journalist. How is a journalist a more reliable source than a notbale professor and director of institutes?<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 17:18, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a matter of evaluating the limitations of sources. As a rule, newspapers report on everything so the default expectation is that they lack both bias and expertise so they get the details wrong but the overall story right. Experts and organizations that work hard in a specific area can be expected to get the details right but have biases that may be minor or major. Wikipedia editors need to look carefully at all sources to evaluate their limitations. There is no such thing as a source that is useable as being reliable for all claims it might make even though our policies simplify the situation to make it sound that way. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 19:46, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This might be an ignorant question... but what if someone is just notable for negative things? I.e., their claim to fame is... well, nastiness, and all the ATT/RS material is hypothetically all critical/unfavorable. Would it be a problem for that to be the focal aspect of the article... if nothing significant on the other side (positive/balancing) existed? This is assuming the person isn't AfDable etc. as non-notable, so the article needs to be in... just in some form. Where do policy/practice stand on this? - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 04:35, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is simple, if there is nothing that we can attribute to a secondary source saying that X is a nice guy, but a lot saying that X is a nasty guy we cannot claim that X is a nice guy just to balance it. On the other hand, just because sources claiming that X is an ass are more readily available should we not stop searching for other sources. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 14:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Forgive me if I'm asking a question that has been answered many times. I was looking at the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Cannings_21be.html" title="Angela Cannings">Angela Cannings</a> article, and noticed that it didn't have that box at the top of the talk page, saying that it's about a living person, and that any controversial unsourced material should be removed immediately. So I went to some other talk pages about living people, to see what the box looked like in the source code. I found {{blp}} in some, and</p>

<p>I'm in favour of a move, since this policy just isn't solely about biographies anymore. But maybe we could discuss about a proper new name for the policy first?

<p>Since we have policies against <i>any</i> bogus information, this "policy page" is really redundant regardless of whether we widen its scope, hence the move is neither necessary nor harmful.

<dd>I'm still in favor of Wikipedia:Biographical information affects lives, as the title alone insinuates that the policy calls for taking care with biographical information rather than just describing the subject of the policy, which I think implicitly makes it a more accurate title. Although it does lack the specification "living people," I think that the notion that the policy is regarding living people is implied in the title (i.e. it can be inferred that the lives being affected are those that are the subject of the biographical data). <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeopold_Stotch_e88f.html" title="User:Leopold Stotch">Leopold Stotch</a> 05:36, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not sure whether I support the proposed move yet, but would like to suggest Biographical content on living persons as an alternate title.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Is it OK to blank a purely defamatory page about a living person? The policy says that <i>all</i> "unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material — whether negative, positive, or just highly questionable — about living persons should be removed <i>immediately</i> and <i>without discussion</i> from Wikipedia articles, talk pages, user pages, and project space." So, if I sight this, do I have a right to blank the page? It says <b>immediate</b> removal. To me, that means no waiting around for CSD or AFD to take care of it -- blank first, get the article deleted (and possibly <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">salted</a>) later. mike4ty4 05:46, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed 3 articles existing for no other reason than to document controversy/criticism about living persons. One was about Hillary Clinton, the other about Michael Moore, and the third about George W. Bush. I don't care how controversial someone is or how well justified the criticism may be. Under no circumstances should wikipedia tolerate entire articles devoted to controversy and criticism about ANY living person under ANY circumstances. If we allow it for the president of the United States, pretty soon it will be the president of the PTA, and then it will be you. Editors should be forced to summarize only the most notable criticism in a subsection of the person's article, and even here it should be very brief, in fact there should be an explicit limit (i.e. no more than 10% of anyone's article should be criticism). If people want to cite criticism of the war they can do it in article relating to the war, not an article about criticism of Bush (which shouldn't be allowed to exist). Wikipedia is not the place to blather on negative material about ANY living person and this should be explicitally written into policy. Wikipedia has far too many editors that come here for no other reason than to trash living figures and we need to start weeding them and have very clear unambiguous policy to discourage them and make them very easy to counter. <a href="../../../w/p/b/User%7EWPBio_acf5.html" title="User:WPBio">WPBio</a> 22:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Absolutely not. The above reasoning by WPBio is ridiculous. We already limit articles based on notability. YOU are not notable that's why we don't have an article about you, nor the fact that you may actually be a aardvark trying to pass itself off as human. Once you and your controversy becomes notable, then we should not bar any article about it. Wikipedia is to be the sum total of all knowledge, and <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Nicole_Smith_1541.html" title="Anna Nicole Smith">Anna Nicoles'</a> drug overdoes qualifies as knowledge, just as much as <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Haggard_ad26.html" title="Ted Haggard">Ted Haggard</a>'s gay sex. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 22:35, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Wikipedia's no hateration policy reflects the fact that any controversial content about a living person should be factual and not opinions. So while it's encyclopedic to cite media reports documenting the fact that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> has been seen at various night clubs, it is considered pure hateration to quote a media critic describing Britney Spears as a "bad role model" because of how she spends her recreation time. Other examples of hateration include quoting critics speculating that acts of charity are simply self-serving self-promotion. Hateration should be removed immediately and repeatedly, even if doing so requires violating the 3 revert rule. In general, pettiness, and mean spirited commentary, even if attributed to a reliable source, is of little encyclopedic value and damages wikipedia's credibility, causes ill will towards wikipedia, and is hurtful to real people. Although such content has become increasingly routine, even in reputable media, wikipedia strives for the highest standars of quality information especially when discussing sensetive matters related to real people<a href="../../../w/p/b/User%7EWPBio_acf5.html" title="User:WPBio">WPBio</a> 00:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. You cannot require fact. Fact is the same as *truth* in this context, it's subjective. That is why we now have (or had until a few days ago) attribution. Statements can be attributed-as-facts to someone, but we cannot require them to *be* facts.

<li>I get the distinction. It may be a fact that person X thinks person B is a slut but it's of little encyclopedic value. Hence I think facts, especially of a controversial nature when dealing with living people should meet a higher standard. So rather than reporting the fact that Fox news blasted Hillary for making comment B, it's better to report the fact that fox news conducted a polls showing Hillary's popularity among republicans declined after comment B. That's the kind of quality information upon which credible encyclopedia's are built. It's just too easy for anyone with an agenda to push to dig up any criticism on anyone and selectively quote it out of context <a href="../../../w/p/b/User%7EWPBio_acf5.html" title="User:WPBio">WPBio</a> 00:26, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Negative statements of opinions should be removed even if they're well sourced. For example you might quote a business magazine noting that a person went bankrupt (a negative fact), however quoting a business magazine calling someone a bad business man (negative opinion) should be unacceptable. You might quote a source saying that a certain company never hires black people (negative fact) but we should not quote a source calling that company racist (negative opinion). The distinction between statements of fact and statements of opinion is a clear one, and made by newspapers every day who differentiate straight reporting from editorials. While everything in wikipedia should be well sourced, editorializing of a living person should only be doucmented if it is of a positive or neutral nature. Once we start reporting negative editorializing we harm living persons and become a sleazy tabloid <a href="../../../w/p/b/User%7EWPBio_acf5.html" title="User:WPBio">WPBio</a> 03:53, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose</b>. Neologistic and subjective. The policy as it stands is already quite strong enough, and the balance of an article should reflect the balance of informed opinion, not the desire of the subject to be portrayed in the most flattering light possible. Some biographies cannot help but reflect the fact that informed opinion is against the subject. We cannot and should not promise that the subject will <i>like</i> the biography, only that they should, with appropriate levels fo self-honesty, concede its fairness. Some subject lack that self-honesty.

<p>If it's so clear that that's what he means, surely you can find a quote from him which says so. If this policy actually applied to user pages, talk pages, and project space, you wouldn't even allow an ArbCom decision against someone, since such decisions are usually based on a living person's Wikipedia posts and Wikipedia posts are not considered reliable sources. And the policy would require deleting almost everything from the talk page about just about every living person; for instance, around two thirds of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Talk%7EBritney_Spears_13d7.html" title="Talk:Britney Spears">Talk:Britney_Spears</a> should go. It would also mean that you cannot discuss whether a person is a reliable source on a talk page, without giving references, and that your discussion could be removed immediately otherwise. This is not how Wikipedia works, and is not reasonable. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 14:43, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's being used without citation. It would be better named "Professed Mediums", which is far less biased and loaded of a word than "Purported," which actually implies falsehood. Furthermore, categories are quite different than cited information placed in an article, one should not use a category that contains anything that needs citation - because a category cannot be cited. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 23:11, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My bad on the category name, I updated my post above from "psychics" to "mediums". Where is it being used without citation? What's an example of an article where it is used and the subject of the article isn't said to be a medium by themself or others? "one should not use a category that contains anything that needs citation" is a bit impractical since in theory all info may need citation - it would mean you'd have to get rid of categories like Rivers in Africa. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinderbinder_2383.html" title="User:Minderbinder">Minderbinder</a> 23:18, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, What I'm saying is controversial is the word "purported" and it's meaning, not whether they're claiming anything. The category itself can't be cited, and purported implies "falsehood", so we're essentially calling everyone who has that category applied to them a liar. You have to provide citations for each and every controversial statement. You can't do that with a cat.

<dd>Someone certainly may propose a move to "Professed mediums", although editors have complained about "professed" as well in the past. Martinphi, I'm not sure if you're serious about "acclaimed mediums" since that's probably the most biased and least accurate name I've heard proposed, possibly worse then just plain Mediums. I'm not sure you even understand the reason we can't use just Mediums. And while I understand the concerns about "purported", saying that "Purported mediums" means "People who say they are mediums but are really liars" is a bit melodramatic. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinderbinder_2383.html" title="User:Minderbinder">Minderbinder</a> 13:16, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not melodramatic if you understand the full meaning of "purported." It definitely won't be melodramatic when one of the subjects of an article that contains that cat decides it's the last straw and drops a lawsuit on our collective heads.

<dd>None of us are lawyers here, so it's pretty speculative to say that "purported medium" would attract a lawsuit while "professed" wouldn't, especially when <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a> recommends using purported and points out that the word is commonly used by newspapers. (Personally, I think a judge would laugh his ass off at such a suit) Looking back at the talk page for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Edward_0cf9.html" title="John Edward">John Edward</a>, the objection to "professed" doesn't seem to be against that word specifically, but more of a refusal to use <i>any</i> word along those lines. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinderbinder_2383.html" title="User:Minderbinder">Minderbinder</a> 16:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I totally agree with you, jossi, I don't even know how that change was allowed to get through. You want to know what’s really melodramatic? The very <i>idea</i> that categories named “psychics” or “mediums” are going to make readers think that either they’re real, or that Wikipedia thinks they are…or that it somehow violates NPOV.

<p>I want to check opinion on whether the policy page could say more about handling unsourced statements in articles. The line on contentious material is clearly established.

Deleting that as unsourced would change the balance of the whole article and IMO just worsen systemic bias.

<p>There are currently a handful of articles in the Military History area where the subjects hit the papers for a few days, therefore meeting the notability guideline, and thereafter have no media interest, so drying up the qualification.</p>

<p>Could I get an outside opinion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Davkal&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116788048" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Davkal&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116788048" rel="nofollow">this</a>? I removed it as a personal attack, but the editor takes issue that it's a personal attack. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinderbinder_2383.html" title="User:Minderbinder">Minderbinder</a> 22:26, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur that that's an unwarranted and unsourced personal attack on a living person, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Carroll_4821.html" title="Robert Carroll">Robert Carroll</a>. Based on the banner at the top of the page, it would also seem that this kind of comment is not an isolated occurrence. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 22:37, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If indeed the first quote is from Caroll himself (which I think it is), then it appears that the comment by the Wikipedia editor is merely rephrasing that same sentiment. In any case, it's not sufficiently egregious to warrant removal. The right way to handle this would be for the author of it to be asked kindly to soften it, and to stick to editorial questions about the article, rather than opinions about the subject. I am not sure if I would delete it from the talk page. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 20:12, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So you think comments about living persons such as <b>"Basically a self-confessed mud-slinging bullshit merchant throwing anything and everything at his pet hate."</b> are fine to leave on a user talk page? --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinderbinder_2383.html" title="User:Minderbinder">Minderbinder</a> 20:20, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Like I said "<i>The right way to handle this would be for the author of it to be asked kindly to soften it, and to stick to editorial questions about the article, rather than opinions about the subject.</i>" I have this on good authority about a much worse edit than Davkal's. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 20:29, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You may consider that "the right way" but this policy certainly doesn't agree: "Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material — whether negative, positive, or just highly questionable — about living persons should be removed immediately and without discussion from Wikipedia articles, talk pages, user pages, and project space." Or do you consider calling someone "a self-confessed mud-slinging bullshit merchant" not to be contentious? Your response particularly surprises me considering that above you argued that referring to someone as a "purported psychic medium" was begging for a lawsuit. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinderbinder_2383.html" title="User:Minderbinder">Minderbinder</a> 20:34, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Really? I guess you'll have to take that up with the authority I got my information from. You may know him: <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a>. Here's the full quote (and remember, this about a much worse edit - calling people crooks, thieves and criminals - when there was no proof - what I thought were very serious charges. Davkal, at least, is basing what he says on the subject's own quote - which you conveniently left out...):
<dl>
<dd><i>I think such negative commentary on a talk page is unnecessary and undignified. I would recommend that the author of it be asked kindly to soften it, and to stick to editorial questions about the article, rather than opinions about the subject. I am not sure if I would delete it from the talk page or not... I would tend to say yes, delete it, but this will depend on the full circumstances and probably should not be done lightly depending on the personality and so forth of the counter-party.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 09:14, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>I don't make these things up myself, dude. I get them from experience and asking the right people the right questions. And you really need to re-read what I wrote about the use of "purported". I don't think you quite got that either. Plus, yeah, I meant it to be a bit melodramatic - after all, it matches the melodrama around cats named merely "Psychics" or "Mediums". That's true melodrama. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 20:44, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, you do that. I asked him that question for a reason. Perhaps you'll be lucky enough not to run into those very same reasons. Policy doesn't back you up here, either. From what I see, Davkal's quote is based on Carroll's <i>own</i> quote about his own work. You may not like the wording, but that's a whole different ballgame than being unsourced or poorly sourced. It's opinion too, not something to easily sue for in American or British courts (yeah, that mysterious law experience of mine again...heh...) <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 20:57, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly, I do agree that there should be absolutely no personal attacks on anyone anywhere in Wikipedia. But I ran into stumbling blocks when I tried to remove a vicious, personal attack against a BLP on a talk page. I was overruled by several admins and other editors, even while I quoted the very same things you do, so that's why I went to Jimbo. After reading Jimbo's statement, the editor removed his own statement. So you and I essentially agree, but I went through a wringer with a similar attempt and was just giving you the benefit of my experience. Take it or leave it, I really don't care. Davkal can read this same stuff and make his own decisions. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> <small><a href="../../../d/r/e/User_talk%7EDreadlocke_6c29.html" title="User talk:Dreadlocke"><span class="Unicode">☥</span></a></small> 21:00, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest a very simple addition. "Biographies should not have trivia sections, as the bullet point list format of arbitrary information tends to accumulate unsourced claims, often of a damaging nature. Relevant, sourced claims from trivia sections which are present should be factored into the main article, and the remaining section content should be removed when present."--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 02:44, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>My gut instinct is that the last paragraph in the <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Street-Porter_46b9.html" title="Janet Street-Porter">Janet Street-Porter</a> article, which describes how the police have decided to take no action over an accusation against her of racism, shouldn't be there, particularly now that the incident's currency has passed. The trouble is that the paragraph is well-sourced, and so I am not sure I could get away with removing it. My feeling is that the paragraph, the best-sourced in this (poor-quality) article, is out of proportion to her life story as a whole and irrelevant to her notability. I also believe that it describes what amounts to a non-event. Should this woman (not someone I like, actually), a member of the Liberal Democrats who is always outspokenly liberal, have mud permanently stuck to her name in a Wikipedia article now that the minor newspaper kerfuffle has faded away?</p>
<p>Are there any grounds on which I could remove this paragraph? <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 18:33, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe there's a basis to remove it entirely, but it should at least be cut down to size - which I went and did. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:07, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
