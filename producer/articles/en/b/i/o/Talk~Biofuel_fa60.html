<p>The oil in plant <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seeds.html" title="Seeds">seeds</a>, in chemical terms, very closely resembles that of petroleum.

<p>A 1998 joint study by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) traced many of the various costs involved in the production of biodiesel and found that overall, it yields 3.2 units of fuel product energy for every unit of fossil fuel energy consumed.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> This makes a <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetable_oil_economy.html" title="Vegetable oil economy">vegetable oil economy</a> look better than an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethanol_economy.html" title="Ethanol economy">ethanol economy</a> which has gotten much lower numbers.</p>

<p>I am attempting to reword the paragraphs related to biogas. Biogas is slightly different than other biofuels as organic matter is converted first by <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anaerobic_digestion.html" title="Anaerobic digestion">anaerobic digestion</a> into <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biogas.html" title="Biogas">biogas</a> which can then be utilised in energy generation. It is incorrect to say that biogas is only derived from waste products. Some crops are grown to be fed directly into anaerobic digesters or to boost energy yields from wastes. There are also significant problems &amp; disputes with defining what is "waste" and when it no longer becomes a waste. Also to become truely sustainable thinking one should consider the wider picture as waste being a resource.--<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 13:15, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In most industrial processes there are by-products labeled as <a href="../../../w/a/s/Waste.html" title="Waste">waste</a>. As time goes and technology, needs, resource availability etc. changes these waste streams might turn into useful products -- sometimes they'll become the main product. As many (most?) other terms <i>waste</i> is a relative term. Since the value of biogas is rather low, it is natural that mostly (only?) waste streams are used for its production. --<a href="../../../t/u/n/User%7ETunheim_e421.html" title="User:Tunheim">Tunheim</a> 11:05, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that waste is a relative term. The value of biogas can actually be very high. This will depend upon value of energy (which is presently growing in the EU) and any subsidies that are brought for green energy such as <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renewables_Obligation_Certificates_783d.html" title="Renewables Obligation Certificates">Renewables Obligation Certificates</a>. Companies such as Greenfinch in the UK are considering the usage of <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar_beet.html" title="Sugar beet">sugar beet</a> and other crops to increase biogas &amp; energy yields. I understand this practice is also undertaken in mainland Europe.--<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 15:53, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the argument that burning biofuels doesnt contribute to atmospheric CO2 doesnt make complete logical sense. just because the carbon was recently extracted doesnt invalidate its re-addition to the atmosphere. By this logic, slash and burn clear-cutting doesnt add CO2 to the atmosphere. Also, the carbon in coal once came from the atmosphere, only it was absorbed into plants millions of years ago and got pushed into the earth. I am likely going to remove this sentence unless no one objects. --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonus_Onus_25d9.html" title="User:Bonus Onus">Bonus Onus</a> 23:11, Apr 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I completely object. The big difference is the timescale. CO2 from biomass was recently sequestered, so burning it results in no net increase in atmospheric CO2. Burning fossil fuels, releases CO2 that has been sequestered over a very long time period, and is thus a net increase in atmospheric CO2. What would be more correct is for the article to note that a net increase does not occur, instead of saying CO2 is not contributed. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 03:31, Apr 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with Taxman. Biofuel entails that you must GROW the crop, and thus sequestered the CO2, before you are able to make the fuel, so the cycle is always going. In the case of "slash and burn clear-cutting", it takes many years before that is replanted, and even more so with fossil fuels. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> July 19,2006</dd>
<dd>I don't see how slash and burn clear-cutting is an examble of bioenergy. Please elaborate. --<a href="../../../t/u/n/User%7ETunheim_e421.html" title="User:Tunheim">Tunheim</a> 11:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I like the new wording of that part now. Its clearer and more correct. And Tunheim, you're right that slash and burn doesnt represent biofuel, since the cut timber is very rarely used to do anything. I was just using that as an example of "adding CO2 to the atmosphere" which it definitely does, since its a transfer from a biological sequestration to gaseous form. Whether or not it is a net increase is debatable, and depends on how old the timber is, etc. --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonus_Onus_25d9.html" title="User:Bonus Onus">Bonus Onus</a> 20:55, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have heard of swamp grasses being used for bio fuals and due to the roots sotring the co2 in the soil, after burning the plant, the c02 levels in the air end up lower than they originally were. I'm not clear about this so any confirmation would be helpful. I believe the grass mentioned was snapgrass or something similar. <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoobeditor_16ed.html" title="User:Noobeditor">Noobeditor</a> 00:36, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may not be renewable, and you are correct on the other points. However it is still very commonly considered a biofuel. It certainly still is biomass. Most general discussions of biomass and biofuel will use peat as an example.

<dd>You have to be careful not to pigeon hole everything into exactly what our definition says. Nothing is saying our definition is perfect or definitive, and acting as if it were isn't proper. Peat is biomass, and it is burned for fuel. Yes it blurs the lines a bit.

<dd>You'll find other sites that clearly define peat as biomass. The sustainable harvest cycle of peat is rather long. And some slow peat bogs are possibly getting close to some coal types. However there are peat bogs that have rotation cycles faster than slow forests. So instead of trying to fight over where it should be categorized, we should use it as a prime example showing how the sustainability of biomass is based on rotation. And how this whole principle is a gradual thing. --<a href="../../../t/u/n/User%7ETunheim_e421.html" title="User:Tunheim">Tunheim</a> 11:20, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Peat is closely related in origin to coal. In fact, peat could have more sulphur. The pea-souper London fogs of the 19th century were due to peat burning. Since peat has higher non-combustible fraction than coal, it creates worse problems with <b>suspended particulate matter</b> if used carelessly. Not only is it a worse pollutant than coal, it is also true that peat, coal and petroleum are all fossil fuels, not biofuels. <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBambaiah_bac4.html" title="User:Bambaiah">Bambaiah</a> 13:56, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Biofuel is interesting as it clearly a more sustainable form of fuel, and it has been described as "carbon neutral" due the carbon sequestration process of growing biomass. There is one major problem with biofuel as a "carbon neutral" product however. Farming biomass is a very energy intensive practice. Many studies have shown that it takes more energy to farm biofuel (farm equipment, fertalizer, pumping water, transportation) than the fuel actually contains. Essentially this means that using biofuel represents a major net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, even when sequestration is taken into account.</li>
<li>Industrial scale farming is by no means an environmentally benign activity either. There are many good reasons to prevent further expansion of agriculture of this kind, such as: air pollution, chemical fertilizer, pesticides, water pollution, water consumption, habitat destruction, and top soil degradation.</li>
<li>Biofuel has one important role to play in making society more sustainable. Biofuel can be created from biological waste already produced in great quantities by humans. Particularly the burning of waste vegetable oil, or electricity generation from landfill or compost methane. So long as we do not waste energy creating new biomass specifically to burn for more energy, we will improve our net carbon output. It is also vital that we do not seek out to remove "wasted biomass" from the natural environment such as waste wood in forests. None of this is actually wasted biomass, and is essential to the sustainabilility of natural ecosystems and the sequestration of carbon into the soil.</li>
<li>Biofuels are being used as an excuse not to convert the economy away from fossil fuels. They have a role to play, but industry must be made to transition away from energy sources that rely on combustion altogether, using electricy derived from truly sustainable sources such as solar, wind, or water power.</li>

It is correct that biofuel is not carbon neutral. However, in most cases it is still beneficeial for the climate. Most of the greenhouse impact of biofuels is from the farming practises, particular fertilizer use. In this case, it is not CO2 that is released, but methane (CH4) a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. If i get around to it, I'll edit a section about the environmental impacts of biofuel production. If you want to go ahead, I suggest you read reports on this subject written by CE Delft, or alternatively:" ECOFYS - Biofuels in the Dutch market - a fact finding study". <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensbn_a5cb.html" title="User:Jensbn">Jens Nielsen</a> 19:11, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I must say that such discussion about biofuel not being carbon neutral because of the energy-intensive farming was true for a while with ethanol from CORN, and it is still close to that even today; therefore, some individuals such as David Pimentel (cited above), can (with their own agenda in mind) "show" that ethanol from corn IS NOT carbon-neutral. Many more studies have shown that, taking into account farming, and all energy inputs to the process, corn from ethanol is about 1.3:1, this is, for every 1 JOULE of energy going into the process by fosil fuels (tractor fuel, natural gas for the process, etc), you get 1.3 JOULES in the form of ethanol. Now, even when ethanol from corn can remain in the "limbo of controversy" because of the little differences between their energy inputs and outputs, such is not the case for biofuels such as BIODIESEL, for instance, whose overall energy balances (including farming) show that the ratio is 3:1, this is, for every 1 Joule of fossil fuel going into the process you get 3 JOULES in the form of Biodiesel. Now, if you go to more productive crops such as ethanol from Sugar Cane (using sugar itself to make ethanol), their energy balances are even more unreachable by individuals such as Pimentel. Energy balances from Brazil (including farming), show that the ratio is 10:1 (i.e., for every 1 Joule of fossil fuels you get 10 joules of energy in the form of ethanol and electricity). The case with sugar cane is such because of its high productivity. The leftover sugarcane <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagasse.html" title="Bagasse">bagasse</a> is used to provide energy for the process and the excess can be used to make electricity. SUCH situation, as with sugarcane, will also be seen when <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cellulosic_ethanol.html" title="Cellulosic ethanol">cellulosic ethanol</a> production becomes widespread, as high-productivity crops will be used and the leftover biomass can be used to provide energy for the process and for electricity. IN conclusion, even when ethanol from corn might be trapped in controversy regarding on whether it is carbon neutral or not, such is <b>definitely</b> not the case for BIODIESEL, and even more so for Ethanol from sugarcane, and in the future, for cellulosic ethanol. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">C.Granda</a> 21:32, 20 June 2006 (TAMU)</p>
<p>Bio-fuel can be much better than carbon neutral when agricultural waste is converted to bio-chemicals or fuels. For example, if waste that is normally left to rot, emitting methane which a strong greenhouse gas, is converted instead to chemicals or fuels, there will be a strong net benefit. Consider also rice straw, which cannot be plowed under and is burned in the fields generating fine silica dust that is associated with elevated rates of asthma in children; converting it to chemicals or fuels, brings a strong net benefit.</p>
<p>Consider bio-ethanol produced from corn. If both distillers grains and corn stover are converted to chemicals, fuels or fertilizer, the greenhouse gas balance becomes completely different.</p>
<p>Focusing only on energy balances is simplistic. We need to consider the quality of the product. For example, adding 5 or 10% ethanol to gasoline has major benefits, allowing gasoline to burn more cleanly and increasing the octane number. In this case, the energy requirements for bio-ethanol should be compared to the energy requirements for the production of similar safe additives (MTBE, for example, has been banned in several states).</p>

<dd>Awww (insert childish whining here), I was really getting into the modding of this chart. [I have since written maybe 60% of the info on this chart by now, and was hoping to get it finished before someone finally made some sort of inevitable suggestion/complaint.] I didn't start the chart, just inserted info that seemed relevant to the topic (like the column on CO<sub>2</sub> gas-produced mass per fuel-used mass (something I haven't completed yet 'cause I haven't found a complete answer on the proportions and chemical compositions of the average sample of "Animal Waste", "Coal", "Petroleum" and average "Vegetable Oil"s (<a href="../../../s/o/y/Soybean.html" title="Soybean">Soybean</a> Oil makes maybe 40% of world production, but has poor energy content per fuel mass, and even worse energy content per CO<sub>2</sub> gas-prod. mass (an idea for another column, but alas, there is only so much space on the average 1024x768 screen.)))) I also wanted to insert numbers where it says "Compression Dependant", and was thinking about using the average temperatures and pressures used in the industry of gas delivery (different for "Compressed Gas" and "Liquified Gas", by about 4 fold), but like I said, I didn't start the article, and don't want to offend it's projenitor by deleting, usurping, or otherwise "misplacing" large portions of data that he/she started (I only started working on this article in reverance of the questions that he/she started me to contemplating). But, if there is sufficient consensus among this Wikipedia community (the greatest and most inspiring I have yet to encounter since the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> community (too bad Lostpedia [<a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] closed it's sources)), then I would be open to the idea of copying this chart as it is to either a page of it's own (like Comparison of Energy-Mediums OR Energy-Media)(fully linked to and from all pages that it references) AND/OR to the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_development.html" title="Energy development">Energy development</a> page AND/OR the <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future_energy_development.html" title="Future energy development">Future energy development</a> page. It should also be noted prior to data-transplantation, that the Fuel Cell and Battery Energy Storage sections (both of which I added in full) only relate to useable electrical energy output, they also "bleed" heat energy at a rate proportional to the rate at which elec. energy is extracted from them (Ampereage/<a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_current.html" title="Electric current">Electric current</a>). All other non-nuclear sources relate to their heat energy output which may be modulated either by use of a heat <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furnace.html" title="Furnace">furnace</a> AND/OR <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_engine.html" title="Heat engine">heat engine</a> AND/OR <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_combustion_engine.html" title="Internal combustion engine">internal combustion engine</a> (a device which use heat to create pressure changes, without really using the heat itself). Their <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combustion.html" title="Combustion">combustion</a> really only has negative-side effects when you're not sure where to put the CO<sub>2</sub> (now that we know to put <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon.html" title="Carbon">carbon</a> into <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plants.html" title="Plants">plants</a>, we're not sure which plants will consume carbon quikly, while storing <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_energy.html" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> densly into itself, for us to harvest back, without consuming more energy in the whole process, than we harvest back, compared to say, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_power.html" title="Solar power">solar power</a>). In direct response to your suggestion though <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerBen_3b13.html" title="User:BerserkerBen">BerserkerBen</a>, I'm a tad sceptical of how adding the info of melting points, boiling points &amp; efficiency of recycling, would be terribly helpful (only 'cause <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel.html" title="Diesel">Diesel</a> and certain Oils combust spontaneously under (rapid-)pressurisation). It might require a sub-chart like <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_BitTorrent_software_09df.html" title="Comparison of BitTorrent software">Comparison_of_BitTorrent_software</a> page OR the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_operating_systems.html" title="Comparison of operating systems">Comparison_of_operating_systems</a> page (I do apreciate the colour coding, anything to make the data more accessible, like the colourful charts and graphs of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">Television</a>'s (semi-)news. As hinted to above, an appropriate title to consider is "Comparison of Energy-Storage-Mediums" OR "Comparison of Energy-Media". All fuels mentioned in the chart are mere Energy Storage Mediums, as they (plants mainly) derived their energy from the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a>, and progressively over time were compressed underground by the gravity of the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth_%28planet%29.html" title="Earth (planet)">Earth</a>.

<dd>Upon closer examination of various fuels, especially <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetable_oil.html" title="Vegetable oil">Vegetable oils</a> as fuels, I concur with your assessment that listing the melting points and boiling points of fuels will be helpful as they can be used as indicators to fuel-reaction rates, thermal-energy outputs, phase-change pressure-differentials and perhaps some other key properties worth considering, especially when dealing with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_combustion_engine.html" title="Internal combustion engine">Internal combustion engines</a>.

<p>Well I was thinking that things such as batteries would have columns (basically the chart becomes split into several charts) related to them such as efficiency of recycling (recharging), energy storage density (Wh/kg), energy production density (W/kg) energy volumes (wh/l) (w/l) etc. that kind of thing, really I too have added some to the chart and think that its has become big enough to be its own article with a little added introduction. --<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBerserkerBen_3b13.html" title="User:BerserkerBen">BerserkerBen</a> 01:28, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds like they're all good ideas.

Fossil fuel recycling is a very costly and time consuming process, made especially pointless as most of the hydrogen produced industrially comes from the De-<a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogenation.html" title="Hydrogenation">Hydrogenation</a> of fossil fuels in the first place. So the efficiency of recycling (recharging) fuels is definetly key to the sustainability of our developing energy-economy (how is the first world NOT part of the developing world, just a bit further along that's all&#160;:-]). {related to <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_density.html" title="Energy density">Energy density</a>}You should notice however that 1 W.h = 1 <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watt-hour.html" title="Watt-hour">Watt-hour</a> = 60 (minutes) * 60 Watt.seconds = 3600 <a href="../../../j/o/u/Joules.html" title="Joules">Joules</a> = 3.6 kJoules. Joules is a much better form of measuring total work energy, especially because both batteries and fuel cells that are not functioning at peak efficiency will still release their total amount of energy, just more of it will be released as heat at lower efficiency levels (when not using combined heat + elec. efficiency calculations). So energy density relates to total energy density, not modulated by operating efficiency, working conditions, or thermal/electrical resistance/insulation. (related to energy production density) As 1 <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watt.html" title="Watt">Watt</a> = 1 <a href="../../../j/o/u/Joule.html" title="Joule">Joule</a> per <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second.html" title="Second">second</a>, 1 Watt per <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilogram.html" title="Kilogram">kg</a> = 1 Joule per kilogram.second (1 W/kg = 1 J/kg.s). With batteries, these numbers are easy to input, but for fossil &amp; biofuels and fuel cells, the rate at which energy can be extracted from the fuel, depends on the cumulative number-of, size and efficiency of the reactor(s) (or engine(s) be they <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_engine.html" title="Heat engine">heat engine</a>(s) or <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_combustion_engine.html" title="Internal combustion engine">ICE</a>(s)). At which point, energy rates is an entirely new chart in of itself, where you're comparing biofuel reactors against fossil fuel reactors (or engines), fuel cells and batteries (and <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photovoltaics.html" title="Photovoltaics">photovoltaics</a>, solar heaters, geothermal plants, EM collectors, and all other methods of extracting energy from various energy-storage-mediums (those words again, remember: energy cannot be destroyed AND energy cannot be created, it can only be moved around and transformed from other forms, hopefully for our purposes (the greatest store-houses of energy are the earth and the sun, while energy wells of any form on the earth will always dry-up, the sun rarely fluctuates it's output by more than 0.15% every 10.87 <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_year.html" title="Tropical year">years</a>)).

<dd>That whole discussion is a bog that I think we should only touch lightly. For one there is no consensus on the topic, and any summary written by us here would closely resmble original research. I'll try to list some of the things that make this difficult:
<ul>
<li>Fossil fuel is used much more heavily in agricultural biomass compared to forestry biomass. Both are used as bioenergy.</li>
<li>High quality biofuels (e.g. bioethanol) is more resource intensive than low quality (e.g. wood chips). On the other hand, so is the case for the petroleum equivalents (e.g. petrol and coal).</li>
<li>It may take one energy unit of petrol to produce two energy units of bioethanol, making the CO<sub>2</sub>-saving only 50 %. But then it should also be taken into consideration that it may take one energy unit of crude oil for every two units of petrol. So for every unit substituted there is an additional 50 % gain. This example would give a CO<sub>2</sub>-saving of 75 % by substituting petrol with bioethanol.</li>
<li>Growing corn for bioethanol is not done only for the energy. The dried distiller's grain that are left when the sugar is removed from the corn is very high in protein. This makes it more valuable as animal feed than regular corn. It may be argued that the energy used for the corn growing was for this purpose primarily and so it is the beef-eaters of the world that are contributing to this energy use.</li>
<li>Then many of theses processes are not yet scaled up enough to show their true nature (good and bad).</li>

<p>G'day, I don't understand what the point of the <i>Direct biofuel</i> section is. Biofuels such as <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_vegetable_oil.html" title="Straight vegetable oil">straight vegetable oil</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_oil.html" title="Palm oil">palm oil</a>, which can be directly used in diesel engines, are not mentioned in this section, but derived (i.e. indirect) fuels such as <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethanol.html" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiesel.html" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> <i>are</i>. The section doesn't make any sense to me, and I think it should either be removed, or rewritten to make some sense. <a href="../../../w/e/b/User%7EWebaware_8973.html" title="User:Webaware">Webaware</a> 13:29, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Much better, but the section still seems unnecessary to me. However, I'm no biofuelled engine enthusiast. I gave it a bit of a cleanup anyway. <a href="../../../w/e/b/User%7EWebaware_8973.html" title="User:Webaware">Webaware</a> 00:48, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I note the expansion of the biofuels page, specifically the direct biofuels page. You mention a direct biofuel is one that can be used directly in a petroleum engine. Biogas can be also be used directly but in a standard gas engine. --<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 08:42, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the name is bad. This page is not well organized. Direct biofuels are mostly addressing transportation (at least after my edits, and it seems to be what the intent was), but the definition and heading means that several fuels are eliminated from this section. Biogas won't run in any "traditional" engine without modification, so it isn't a direct biofuel, yet it is clearly a biofuel of importance. I'm not ready to propose a complete reorganization, but perhaps someone should, with sections on heating, cooking, transportation, and electric. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluGill_7b69.html" title="User:BluGill">BluGill</a> 18:38, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont see that these companies are so relevant to the topic of biofuels they should be mentioned in the introduction to an encyclopedia article. Seems to me to be spam. --<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 14:59, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is biofuel? It seems that in common usage the term biofuel is used to mean a liquid or gas fuel that is derived from biomass while the term "biomass fuel" (which redirects here) means biomass is used directly as a fuel. <a href="http://www.natsource.com/markets/index.asp?s=104" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.natsource.com/markets/index.asp?s=104" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>This article seems to be using the term biofuel to mean gas or liquied fuels in the history section, it says biofuel was first used in the "early days of the car industry". Then in the section "Applications of biofuels" it says "Typical fuels for this are wood, charcoal or dried dung". Is wood a biofuel? Is wood considered to be "derived" from biomass? The article also uses the term "bioenergy". What is bioenergy? Both biofuels and biomass fuels? (it also redirect to biofuels). <a href="../../../k/a/m/User%7EKAM_fc6e.html" title="User:KAM">KAM</a> 15:03, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bioenergy, depending on it's use, is a <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypernym.html" title="Hypernym">hypernym</a> or <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synonym.html" title="Synonym">synonym</a> of biofuel. It seems to be the more common term in Europe as opposed to biofuel being the more common in the US. The term bioenergy is also sometimes used in medical text, but then to describe something completely unrelated to this arena. --<a href="../../../t/u/n/User%7ETunheim_e421.html" title="User:Tunheim">Alf</a> 11:18, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<pre>
   I don't know how to make the markup edit, but the text line beginning with "Biofuel can be used both for central and decentralized" is too close to the top of the "Sugar_cane_leaves.jpg" image. In some page loads the text is partially obscured. Adequate whitespace exists at the bottom of the image to move it down or a ~1/2 line space could be added above.
