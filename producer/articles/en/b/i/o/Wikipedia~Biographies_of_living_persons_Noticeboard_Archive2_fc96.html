<p>Section on Russian investor is inciting inflamatory language that has nothing to do with Neil Bush. Multiple attempts to moderate by several individuals have failed. Certain individuals will not yield to only including material that has directing bearing on Neil Bush, trying to make in guility by association.

<dd>The Bush and Boris Berezovsky section is, 1) notable (it's made international news from many multiple sources). 2) It's relevant (Boris funds Neil Bush and it's also well-documented that they travel, attend events and more together) and, 3) it well-documented and well-sourced. (Once again, it's made international news from many multiple sources). All the sources are there within the section. All we've asked is that the section be edited for accuracy, etc. Instead, it's continually "edited" to the point where it only contains nonsense sentences and/or it's removed entirely in what appears to be vandalism and/or POV pushing (especially when you consider the nature of the nasty History comments). I hope that efforts will go forward in the future to, instead, make the section better and more accurate and therefore, benefit the project instead of the current rabid deletions that make the section and full article suffer. 67.190.61.6 06:48, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the policy regarding non-web based sources (hard copy analog woodpulp type) for biographies? I'd added in the professional wrestler Doug Basham's real name, based off of my 1990 high school yearbook plus first-hand accounts from friends/family of Doug, just to have it removed due to a weblink that I'd found to a discussion forum not being considered a proper source. I'd asked in the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedia_copyright_questions_04f1.html#Copyright_legality_of_yearbook_excerpts" title="Wikipedia:Media copyright questions">Wikipedia:Media copyright questions</a> forum about the legality of scanning the yearbook for sourcing, only to be asked why the yearbook can't stand as cited. As I detest edit wars and losing civil grace amongst rational human beings more than being accused of lying (lol) I figured I'd ask the experts.</p>

Robert Burton apparently made a lot of enemies, and whether it's his fault or not I couldn't care less right now. (I am a third party entirely to whatever disputes Burton and others are in.) I created the article because he's a worthwhile subject who has been the subject of more than one news article and who has had an affect on people's lives in one way or another. It's time for some admin to deal with these vandals and to look at past vandalism on the page. Wiley coyote has been around before. I have suggested that adding information about Burton in a truthful way would be something constructive that vandals could do, to no effect. Please someone deal with this.

<li>So the main problem I have is that the article contains a very curious mix of original research and poor sources. But other than that, it seems strangely hit-and-miss regarding matters of importance or lack of importance. I give probably 50-75 public lectures a year (I don't keep count). So why is a fairly routine lecture for the Long Now Foundation featured? Did the press "frequently" refer to Sanger as co-founder before he left and started calling himself that? Newsgroup messages are original research if anything is. Altruism is "the belief that you have a duty to help others"? Well, perhaps in a sense, but geeeeee, that more or less misses the important point. (One of the reasons we forbid original research is that trolls trying to make people who are subjects of biography look bad are notoriously bad at philosophical interpretation.) --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 00:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Here is something I wrote on the FAC vote: "In order for an article to be a Featured Article, it should first be, you know, good. This article is actually quite bad in several important respects. Controversial claims are made without attribution. (Example: the bit from Wired about my trading career is something I have objected to repeatedly but it is still reported on as fact.) My birthdate is sourced to a cut and paste from Wikipedia (original research), and is in fact completely at odds with what my birth certificate says. The number $100,000 appears, with no source. The number $500,000 appears, no source. The article implies falsely that the foundation spent $25,000 on my travel. False, and original research. (And a good example of what is wrong with original research.)

<li>I have to admit that my knowledge of the subject (you) is fairly limited, which may or may not be an advantage in this situation. I will take another look, but do feel free to "go on", as it is helpful to me to isolate what the problems are. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 15:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have read the Wired article very carefully, and it is the source of the $500k statement, so I tagged that, and reworded it a little. I removed the other unsourced statements. Are you disputing the accuracy of the Wired article regarding your trading career? If so, I am not sure how to reconcile that in the article, as Wired is considered RS. I did remove the birth date too, since you say it is incorrect, but the use of Wikimedia official web documents seems to fall into a grey area in my mind, as self-published sources are allowed to be cited as RS in articles about the sources. While you personally are not Wikimedia, you are the head of the organization, so it seems unclear to me whether or not WM sources can be used in your article, obviously they would be allowed in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a> article. If you can direct me to further problematic areas, I would be happy to look at those too. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 15:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have been giving thought to the RS policy re: sources from wikipedia, and it seems that probably the only Wiki-based source that can be used as reliable is the by-laws pdf, since it is an official document, and cannot be modified by any users. Any other "self-published" sources, such as the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a> article, cannot be verified without question to be written by the subject, as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> requires. Possibly the mailing list emails can be cited too, since policy is often handed down there, attribution does not appear to be a problem, and I often see the subject's comments there cited in WP policy articles. But I am not sure about that, so input from others is requested. Any comments about this, before I start the Great Purge? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 19:30, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Normally, "states" would be a pretty neutral term, with "claims" being less neutral. In this particular context however, "states" seems to lean to the less neutral. But I think, considering the lack of reliable secondary sources for the statements, it is appropriate as a caveat. Same with the use of "as" re the Selma claim. There is a certain amount of hair-splitting to this one, and it seems the solution would be to find RS sources for the two statements. I will try applying a little Google Fu to this later today, and see if I can pull something out of the ether. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 15:58, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'd appreciate help or advice regarding <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Newman_ad8f.html" title="Fred Newman">Fred Newman</a>. He's a Marxist psychotherapist who has been accused of being a cult leader, though I don't know how widespread that view of him is. I was asked to take admin action at the page because of reverting by single-issue users who appear to be supporters of Newman. They're opposing edits to the page made by <a href="../../../c/b/e/User%7ECberlet_c009.html" title="User:Cberlet">Cberlet</a>. I protected the page on Cberlet's version.</p>
<p>The other users are saying on the talk page that there are BLP concerns, particularly with the lead section. Looking at this, the third paragraph isn't sourced and is negative, though not particularly controversial as I think both sides agree on the basic facts. The second paragraph is sourced, but is negative and it could be argued is being given undue prominence. The first sentence of the first paragraph calls him "controversial" (which he is, but to say so upfront is arguably POV), and the third sentence says he's a psychotherapist, but then immediately adds that he has no appropriate qualifications.</p>
<p>I'm unsure how to proceed given that I protected on the BLP-disputed version, especially given that it's not a clear-cut violation. Should I unprotect and allow editing to continue; or edit the article myself while it's protected to remove the BLP-related issues? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

This page is about the last place I would have expected an edit to be vandalized, but my edit was vandalized (by being removed) so here it is again:</p>
<p>The David Westerfield article contained the statements:</p>
<p>"His computer contained <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a>."</p>
<p>and later, in the Notes</p>
<p>"According to the police a large part of his pornography consisted of legitimate images."</p>
<p>I <b>quantified</b> this by adding:</p>
<p>" - only 1% were considered ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù "</p>
<p>with the reference</p>
<p>Bean, Matt, Court TV (June 25, 2002), "Jury sees graphic child pornography taken from Westerfield's home". <a href="http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/062502_pm_ctv.html" class="external free" title="http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/062502_pm_ctv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.courttv.com/trials/westerfield/062502_pm_ctv.html</a></p>
<p>Someone objected to this addition, and <b>watered it down</b> to:</p>
<p>"A fraction of this contained material that could be considered child pornography"</p>
<p>I then added the statement:</p>
<p>"Some members of law enforcement, such as Detective Chris Armstrong, went further, and concluded that this was <i>not</i> child pornography."</p>
<p>with the reference:</p>

<p>The same person promptly <b>removed</b> that statement.</p>
<p>I am not happy about this. Wikipedia is supposed to be NEUTRAL, which means presenting the truth - the WHOLE truth. Furthermore, possession of child pornography is an extremely <b>serious</b> charge and very <b>damaging</b> to someone's reputation. To comply with Wikipedia's policy on the biographies of living persons, Wikipedia readers should be made aware that there is considerable <b>doubt</b> over whether Westerfield in fact had any child pornography.196.15.168.40 19:29, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Reply to WAS 4.250‚Äòs comment about Selby. There was a wealth of unidentified evidence in the van Dam home and at the body recovery site: DNA in blood stains on Danielle‚Äôs bed, fingerprints in her house (especially two palm prints outside her bedroom door), a hair under her body, a variety of fibers with her body (especially red ones with her fingernail clippings), and footprints and tire tracks at the dump site. All the San Diego police had to do was to check these against Selby, and also determine if he had been in San Diego in early February, e.g. establishing if he had any family there (such as at the ice cream parlor). I can‚Äôt get over the fact that the police <b>ignored</b> DNA found on the very bed the victim was abducted from when they discovered it didn‚Äôt match Westerfield.196.15.168.40 04:47, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ooooooh unidentified blood and prints Westerfield must be innocent. &lt;sarcasm&gt; &lt;sarcasm 196.15.168.40 MOST crime scenes contain things that can not be identified. The Van Dams bought the home used, not brand new. The small blood spot on Danielle's bed could have come from one of her friends, friends of her brothers. Danielle was not stabbed otherwise there would be a trail of her blood all over the house. It means absolutely nothing. The palm prints outside her bedroom door might have been there, ever since they bought the house. Doors are not clean ALL the time. Fibers with her body or in her fingernail clipping means nothing as well. SHE was a CHILD. Children run around and play and get dirty all the time. Do you seriously expect a 7 year old to clean her fingernail clipper everytime? It means nothing. You have nothing but mindless conjecture in defending this man. You are badly mistaken if you think any of this is going to exonerate David Westerfield. It will have to be connected to someone, for starters, and next the person has to be placed at the scene of the crime. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 00:04, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reply to Fighting for Justice:</p>
<p>That evidence won‚Äôt be connected to anyone unless someone TRIES to do so, and the police DIDN‚ÄôT, neither for Selby nor anyone else, not even prior to Westerfield‚Äôs arrest and conviction. They had already decided, on the first day they met him, that he was guilty. Much of that evidence I listed WOULD place the person at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>Your arguments show signs of desperation: YOU are the one guilty of ‚Äúmindless conjecture‚Äù. In particular, the van Dams had been living in that house for nearly 4 YEARS, but you believe the prints were older than that and had survived for so long! You think the unidentified blood on her bed might have come from her brothers‚Äô friends. Why were they bleeding on HER bed? And their blood MIXED with hers. Interestingly, ‚Äúthere was a yellowish stain that was observed on the inside crotch area of the [Danielle‚Äôs] underwear‚Äù (Annette Peer, Preliminary Hearing, March 12), which is ‚Äúa fairly common source, for example, in sexual assault cases‚Äù (prosecutor George Clarke, March 12). So it looks like Danielle was sexually assaulted in her own house. By whom? One of her brothers‚Äô friends? It actually wouldn‚Äôt be too surprising if the children were imitating the sexual behavior of the adults in that house. You might think that ‚ÄúFibers with her body or in her fingernail clipping means nothing‚Äù, but you are WRONG. Let‚Äôs see what the criminalist Jennifer Shen said (trial testimony, June 25): ‚ÄúThe fibers that I collected from on and around her would have come from whatever environment she was last in.‚Äù Obviously it WASN‚ÄôT Westerfield‚Äôs environment. Which, contrary to what you said, EXONERATES him (especially coupled with all the other evidence, such as the entomology). And yes, she WAS a CHILD. And children don‚Äôt only ‚Äúrun around and play and get dirty all the time‚Äù, they also explore INTERESTING places - such as their neighbor‚Äôs unlocked RV.</p>

<dd>Oh my goodness. Are you for real? A sexual assault <i>right</i> in the bedroom? I'm dying of laughter over here. Yes fingerprints can stay there for as long as 4 years, however, let's say it wasn't there for 4 years. All it means is that someone touched the door anyone from a long time ago or a short time ago. So they have to find the owner of that fingerprint? The whole world is going to be fingerprinted. Listen I don't know why the blood was there or why it was mixed. What I do know is that an actual sex assault would have YIELDED way more then a little blood and a yellowish stain. Even if she was digitally penetrated in the vagina or anus, there would have been more of a mess. It would have been painful and she would have been screaming/crying, or at least fighting with the assailant. Oh and now you're defaming the deceased victim and her brothers. But you have to fight about a quote describing the <b>convicted child-killer's</b> child pornography. "It was defamatory" according to you. Yet you've proven that you have no problem defaming children. I hope you're proud of yourself. If any of the evidence exonerates Westerfield <b>he wouldn't be in jail RIGHT now</b>. Jennifer Shen, yes, wow, some statement. Too bad it is easily negated, since the girl was found <b>nude</b>; I view her statement as an hypothesis. Do fibers know time then? Who cares that they weren't found to be from Westerfield. She was outside and things must have gotten on her body by the wind. There is a mountain of fiber evidence proving Danielle was in his environment. A brief cookie sale isn't going to yield so much evidence. Fibers such as the dog hair shouldn't have been there because the dog didn't go into Westerfield's home. The length of Danielle's hair, in the RV, was the same length as her new haircut. The blood and fingerprints, no good alibi, and his pointless trip make him guilty. I don't believe his RV was as opened as the defense would have one to believe. The print they lifted off of it was not in such a way to indicate a child was playing there. Oh, don't, fault the police for their investigation. Westerfied acted like a guilty person. What was with his overly cooperativeness? Opening things up that the police were not even interested in. Not telling them about his jacket. The trip where he did more driving then relaxing. The police stated Selby wasn't in the San Diego area when Danielle disappeared. The guy once confessed he murdered Jon Benet Ramsey. He was a class nut. Moreover, if he wanted the police to believe he was the perpetrator why did he do it in a unconvincing fashion? Like how did he find the Van Dam family? How did he get inside? Where did he first see Danielle? If he was the actual murderer he would have answered all those questions. They were on the right track once they knew Westerfield had no concrete alibi for the entire weekend. They knew child abductors are into child porn. It was found on his computers and CD's. Gas receipts and cell phone call records are not concrete alibi. A good alibi is a person, who could vouch that you were with them during the moment the crime was committed. He had squat for that. We don't really know if Westerfield was really alone that entire weekend. We have no idea what he was doing at night. The police were right on the money with this pervert. Where there is smoke there's fire. And, no, I am not a sockpuppet for TripleH1976. But I am grateful that he thwarted your plans on making this article a pity party for David Westerfield. I'm more than happy to continue his legacy.&#160;:) <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 07:30, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reply to Fighting for Justice: How did all this start? I added two short statements made by members of the police, true statements, with good sources quoted, but you removed them simply because they cast doubt on Westerfield‚Äôs guilt and even though Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral. So you are clearly in violation of Wikipedia policy. I don‚Äôt know why you have now broadened the discussion so much, except perhaps to draw attention away from the fact that you obviously don‚Äôt have a leg to stand on: your action is indefensible and you know it. Your belief seems to be: Westerfield had child porn, therefore he murdered Danielle. That is an unjustified standpoint, it‚Äôs based on emotion not reason. And it means that no child porn being in his possession implies he didn‚Äôt do it. But you have too much emotional investment to accept that, so you have to suppress the truth. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre not the only person who ‚Äúthinks‚Äù that way, making it all the more important that the article contain the WHOLE truth whether you like it or not. Thankfully, Wikipedia rules are on my side196.15.168.40 04:22, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ha ha ha Wikipedia's rules on your side that's hilarious!!!!! omg! That's even funnier then your statement Danielle was sexually assaulted in her bedroom. I didn't know you could top that one, but you did. Congrats! Your comments are defense spin. You misquote and you put your own interpretation on the evidence. James Watkins did not say only 1% was questionable. Someone else did, but you make it seem like it came from James Watkins. You make it seem like a fact. THAT'S A LIE! You can't do that here. Armstrong's statement was discussed during the preliminary hearing. The article is on the TRIAL. The judge previously determined Armstrong's statement won't count. It will be determined by the jury if it was child porn or not. You are misleading people and you are minimizing the evidence of child pornography. If you want to spin go on a <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferris_wheel.html" title="Ferris wheel">ferris wheel</a>, don't do it here. The U.S. Assistant Attorney you quote about what is his name? You don't provide it. I went to the reference and I didn't find page 85. I had to sift through a mountain of pages, and some had no numbers. But even if I did find it it doesn't matter. YOU CAN'T QUOTE DIRECTLY FROM TRANSCRIPTS! How did he arrive at that conclusion? is it his personal opinion, or professional opinion? Perhaps, he's a pervert like Westerfield and liked what he saw. Your description for the media discrepancies that's your POV. You are the one violating policy. You are not here to analysis things for people. Like it or not the jury believed it was child porn and found it very disturbing. It would require a person made of steel to not be disturbed by it. No, I don't think Westerfield killed Danielle because he had child porn. Other evidence convinces me of that. What it does prove is that he fantasized about child sex. Because no normal man, in this world, would have it if he wasn't getting some type of pleasurable experience from it. It would not be there, not even in 1%. What for? Congress knows it's on the internet. No this case is not about emotion, it's more about common sense. It is clear to me that you do not care about children, otherwise you would not be defending this man. You had no problem defaming the deceased victim and her brothers. Accusing them of having sex; that's pretty twisted. You see nothing wrong with child pornography. In fact you think it shouldn't be considered graphic. You object to the word "graphic" when describing it. As a result, you have no credibility with me. I didn't think you were capable of defaming the victim, but thanks so much for revealing the real you. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 05:36, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So you agree that a member of the police declared that this is NOT child porn. And it‚Äôs obvious that you believe these images have considerable evidentiary value. The logical conclusion is that the Wikipedia article MUST contain the whole truth about them. Thank you.</p>

<dd>No, no, no, no you are wrong on ALL counts as usual. Evidentiary value is for the court room. Wikipedia isn't a court room; try to drill that into your head, ok? David Westerfield is a criminal. What wikipedia owes him is an article that is neutral in language. Wikipedia does not have to cast doubts about his guilt. Wikipedia does not have to make defense-like apologies for him. I know all of that is very painful for you to understand. What "whole truth" are you talking about? The "whole truth" is only known by the convicted child-killer David Westerfield. Since, you are a big fan of his perhaps you can visit him at San Quentin and ask him about it. I know he must be really unhappy in prison right now. He doesn't have anymore porn or child rape videos to keep him occupied; poor thing. You might be able to cheer him up. You can tell him that you defend him on wikipedia. THe article is very neutral, more so then many other articles on child-killers. You should be happy by now. Leave the article alone and find some other child-killer to defend.

<p>If the article shouldn‚Äôt contain information of evidentiary value then what should it contain: trivia? How should Wikipedia report on court cases? Seems to me you are so eager to oppose everything I say that you don‚Äôt stop to think if what you are saying is sensible or not. Where do you get the idea that Wikipedia articles should be neutral in language but not in content? The latter is more important. Any quality academic publication, and not just Wikipedia, should give both sides of an argument, without fear or favor, unless it is expressly stated to be an argument for a particular point of view. The Wikipedia article should not read like it was almost written by the Prosecutor. The only way you can KNOW that Westerfield is a criminal is if you were his accomplice, in which case you should hand yourself over to the police so you can join him on Death Row. In fact, to fit the evidence, the only way Westerfield could be guilty would be if he had an accomplice. That would explain why the police couldn‚Äôt find any evidence he had been at the scene of the crime, why there was no evidence Danielle had been in his RV that weekend, and why he had a strong alibi covering the calculated date window during which the body was dumped. What‚Äôs relevant is not what‚Äôs painful to me but what‚Äôs painful to you. I have never deleted anything, whether I liked it or not, I have merely pointed out flaws in it or added missing information. You, on the other hand, regularly delete what you don‚Äôt like. That‚Äôs vandalism. It was video CLIPS that were presented as evidence, in other words very short, not full length videos. If you want to attack anyone, then choose someone against whom the police were actually able to find evidence of a crime: in the Westerfield case, all they were able to do, after MONTHS of trying, was to prove that they were neighbors who had contact with each other - which we already knew. With regard to the other cases you mention, my question would be: in any of them, was law enforcement in effect told by experts they consulted that their suspect was innocent, but they ignored this advice and continued to prosecute him? Because that‚Äôs what happened in the Westerfield case (Faulkner, Goff, Armstrong, etc.), and I find it extremely disturbing. If you were genuinely interested in justice, then so would you.196.15.168.40 11:55, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

You want to point out flaws make a website! Use your imagination and create an online journal, about the case, instead of coming to Wikipedia and being a disruption. You care nothing about wikipedia besides defending a child-killer. Wikipedia does not owe anything to his defense. He does not have a strong alibi for that weekend. He spent many, many hours alone. The Entomology is an inconclusive science at best. The entomologist themselves say their science can't determine a maximum time a body is out in the elements. Since when did wikipedia get created so you can point out flaws? If she wasn't in the RV, the weekend she went missing, then why does anybody have to believe she was in there uninvited BEFORE the weekend since there's no evidence to support that. Blood on your jacket from a child you barely know is evidence of a crime. Blood that is not yours and you can not innocently explain away IS evidence of a crime! Particularly so if the owner of that blood is missing. Westerfield had all 3 against him. They don't require evidence that he was in the home, because the blood evidence alone is damning enough. What don't you understand about that? The article is the nicest article about any child-killer article in wikipedia. What more do you want? No one said Westerfield was innocent, not even his lawyers. All they merely did was challenge the evidence. Experts can be paid to testify positively for the defendant. No one gives a d@mn what you find disturbing. Like I said before, make a website supporting the child-killer for all I care. Just stop dumping your malarkey in wikipedia. It's not your soapbox. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 07:08, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reply to ‚ÄúFighting for Justice‚Äù:</p>
<p>So you DON‚ÄôT know Westerfield is a criminal: juries make LOTS of mistakes, as can be seen in the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innocence_Project_40fa.html" title="Innocence Project">Innocence Project</a>. If there are flaws in ANY article in Wikipedia, then they SHOULD be corrected, it most certainly should NOT be left to an independent website to do that. What I want is a more informative and balanced article, like I‚Äôm sure most Wikipedia editors, and you are disrupting that. So I am trying to raise the standard of Wikipedia. Wikipedia doesn‚Äôt owe anything to the prosecution either, what it does owe is to the truth. Of course Wikipedia wasn‚Äôt created for me personally to point out flaws: anybody and everybody has a DUTY to point out flaws, and I am happy to oblige.</p>
<p>Westerfield did have a strong alibi for the weekend. You can‚Äôt look at just the amount of time he was alone: he was far away from the body dump site, especially given how big and slow his vehicle was. Furthermore, it‚Äôs not just a case of having an alibi for that weekend, but even more so for when the body was dumped, and there would have to be around a 100% error in the entomological dates for him to be guilty. I‚Äôll leave you to produce other cases in which entomology was so badly wrong (especially four entomologists, and even more especially, entomologists brought onto the case by law enforcement). And because this was a circumstantial case, and given that guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt (a high standard), it wouldn‚Äôt be sufficient to produce just one or two examples of such a huge error, you would have to prove that such enormous errors are common. There are specific circumstances when entomology can‚Äôt determine a maximum time, such as a sealed container or the body was moved. No evidence was produced of such circumstances in this case.</p>
<p>If the handprint in the RV and the blood spot on the RV carpet are valid, then she was in the vehicle at some time. The failure of the police dogs to alert to her scent shows she wasn‚Äôt there recently. Therefore she must have been there uninvited PRIOR to that weekend. A SMALL amount of blood (you conveniently left that out) on your jacket from a NEIGHBORING child (you also left that out), even one you barely know, is NOT evidence of a crime, as it CAN be innocently explained. If the police had processed it properly - such as examining it for spatter and photographing it BEFORE part of it was cut off for testing - then I would give more weight to that evidence. Evidence he was in the victim‚Äôs home (the scene of the crime), when he said he had never been there, would be very different: THAT would be damning. But it was lacking. We didn‚Äôt hear from the children that they had never been in the RV.</p>
<p>In his closing argument (August 7), Steven Feldman, Westerfield‚Äôs lead attorney, said ‚ÄúIT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR WESTERFIELD TO HAVE DUMPED THE BODY‚Äù. In other words, he‚Äôs innocent.</p>
<p>You haven‚Äôt responded to my question about the other cases you mentioned, so I presume NONE of those defendants were in effect declared innocent by law enforcement experts, and that this is reflected in their Wikipedia articles. Are you seriously claiming that an INDIGENT man paid a PROSECUTION witness to testify positively for him? So YOU don‚Äôt find it disturbing that law enforcement ignored their own experts‚Äô considered professional opinion: that tells us a lot about you, and it isn‚Äôt flattering. Clearly you are NOT genuinely interested in justice.196.15.168.40 04:39, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ha! ha! ha ha! ha! hah&#160;! The innocence project. Every criminal hangs his hopes on them. What does Westerfield have to do with that? What lack of DNA testing does he have to show for? faulty eyewitness? coerced or false confession??? police brutality? diminished capacity/retardation??? More often then not juries render the proper verdict. Oh wow! Feldman said it was impossible for Westerfield to have dumped the body. Oh and you place it in all capitals - nice touch, but there's a problem. HE WAS HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEY!!!!! DID YOU EXPECT HIM TO SAY ANYTHING LESS???? Show me a defense attorney who tells a jury, "my client is really guilty".</dd>

<dd>A search dog did detect her scent in the RV compartment. What are you talking about that they didn't? None of the entomologist were brought in by law enforcement. Stop spewing BS. Three of them were hired by the defense and, no, I'm not saying Westerfield paid for their testimony - I'm saying Westerfield's defense attorney's paid for their testimony. The fourth was for the prosecution. Jeff Dusek proved the entomologist for the defense conducted their test in a way to benefit the defense. He proved that very little testing of the body, particularly her tissue, was examined.</dd>

<dd>You'd think the body itself would paint a more accurate picture of when one expires then some bugs. The longer a body is exposed to the elements the harder it is to determine the time of death. Some of the nights were cold and sunlight caused her skin to be burnt. Animals feeding on the body. You fail to take any of this into account, because this affects the bug infestation. Many trials have experts sparring with each other over evidence. They spar over who's the better expert. Who's got more knowledge. You think this trial was the first? The situation plays out in many court rooms.</dd>

<dd>How do you know Westerfield wasn't near the dump site? I guess you were with him then. It wouldn't shock me in the least if you were. The RV can't be that difficult to drive since he put in so many mileage. You once said Westerfield went out that weekend, because he wanted to relax. Well, does his driving around sound relaxing? forgetting your wallet relaxing? over paying someone sound relaxing? filling up heavy water tanks relaxing? He lived alone, why didn't he relax at home? Unless he had to get away from people. Like the police, or dump a body. I understand he was allowed to be in his RV. It is the timing that makes it looks suspicious. To believe your theory that Westerfield is innocent I have to believe he was the most unluckiest man in the world that weekend. And the real killer was the luckiest killer of all killers that weekend. Everything worked out for him. Westerfield driving his RV. The police focusing in on him. The cookie sale. His laundry situated in a way to let evidence of Danielle falling on them. Fate gave Westerfield the worse luck that week. Is that the insanity you want people to swallow? You must be smoking something really bad then. You need to a get new dealer.</dd>

<dd>What law enforcement expert declared him innocent? Innocence wasn't even mentioned by his attorney's. His attorney were looking to cause a hung jury. Again, must be that stuff you're smoking. It's getting to your head. I don't know what type of company you keep but I have NEVER EVER, in my life, had blood from a child I barely know on any of my personal belonging. What difference is a spatter test going to make? It is blood that he has no good reason for having on him. What is his innocent explanation for the blood on his jacket? Because I never heard it. Again, a crime scene does not have to yield a pool of blood to declare it a crime scene. If the blood of a missing person, however small it may be, is on you suspicion should be cast upon you. Until you are cleared by conclusive evidence. Entomology is not conclusive yet. DNA, his travel that weekend, lies, and circumstance convicted him.</dd>

<p>Reply to "Fighting for Justice":</p>
<p>You said you know Westerfield is guilty because the jury said so. I then pointed out, quoting the Innocence Project as evidence, that juries make lots of mistakes. Your response is therefore irrelevant: I proved my point, you CAN‚ÄôT be sure he is guilty. If juries "More often than not ... render the proper verdict", that means they are often wrong, and this could be one of those occasions. So you are ADMITTING that I was right. But to respond to your new points: The DNA on Danielle‚Äôs bed (especially blood stain 10-7A) was ignored when it was found not to match Westerfield. That must be followed up. Similarly, no attempt seems to have been made to obtain DNA from the hair found under her body (Item T.E.-J.S.5 from Item 169). Thank you for pointing out that there was NO eyewitness testimony linking him to her. And that attempts to coerce a confession out of him failed. And sleep deprivation is a form of police brutality. If he is innocent, then "diminished capacity/retardation" doesn‚Äôt apply. Why are you pointing out that Feldman was his attorney? To refresh your memory, you claimed that even his lawyers didn‚Äôt say he was innocent, so I proved you wrong.</p>
<p>A search dog did NOT "detect her scent in the RV compartment". You are getting the dogs confused. Their handler CLAIMED the CADAVER dog alerted at the RV compartment, but it would have alerted to anything, even animals that had been run over or Westerfield‚Äôs own blood if that had been on the shovel inside that compartment: it would NOT have alerted to her scent. But there are two significant points that should be made. Firstly, the handler said NOTHING at the time; over two weeks later (coincidentally (?) just after Westerfield‚Äôs arrest) he thought the dog MIGHT have alerted (but admitted that it might just have been reacting to him - "handler bias"); by the time the trial came round he was SURE the dog had alerted. Clearly, you can‚Äôt trust his belief. And secondly, the dog did NOT alert the first time it inspected the RV, a day earlier, when the smell would have been stronger, NOR did it alert when the compartment was opened and any smell coming from inside the compartment would again have been stronger. Clearly, therefore, the dog did NOT alert, and the handler was right that it was just responding to his own emotions.</p>
<p>Are you disputing that Faulkner was brought onto the case by law enforcement? He himself said he was invited to the autopsy by Doreen (Dorie) Savage, a Forensic specialist. Sergeant William Holmes said it was his idea to bring Faulkner in. He was their usual expert, but they dropped him when his dates exonerated their only suspect. So you are not saying that Westerfield paid for Goff‚Äôs testimony, his lawyers did. The distinction is not significant. I‚Äôm not sure about Faulkner, because little was said about his calculation method, but probably only ONE of the four entomologists, Haskell, used a "maggot mass" factor in his calculations, and Dusek didn‚Äôt have to "prove" this, it‚Äôs common knowledge. Two points: One is that Haskell is surely right - even Goff admitted that "to a certain extent I believe it's already accounted for"(in other words, not entirely) - it‚Äôs just that there is as yet a lack of good data to support or at least quantify it; the other is that it doesn‚Äôt make much difference, only a day or two in this case (according to Hall), so even if he had left it out he would still have arrived at a range of dates that excluded Westerfield, just like the other three entomologists. If you are going to talk about experts "conducting their test" in a way that benefits their employer - "hired guns" - then rather talk about how Goff in effect pretended that daily maximum and minimum temperatures were hourly temperatures - that makes a much bigger difference than maggot mass.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know what you mean by "very little testing of the body, particularly her tissue, was examined". It was stated clearly in testimony that attempts to determine the time of death from a body (notably the vitreous humor) have not been successful (see Dr Blackbourne‚Äôs testimony, also Dr Rodriguez). That‚Äôs why the Medical Examiner gave such a broad range (10 days to 6 weeks) and why law enforcement use bugs - that‚Äôs the most accurate method presently available for a body more than a few days old, and it must be pretty good because it‚Äôs accepted in court. The method used by entomologists - thermal energy - DOES take the cold nights into account (as its name implies). Her skin WASN‚ÄôT burnt, it just appeared to be because of the dark color, and that wasn‚Äôt caused by the sun but by decomposition (see Lieutenant Collins‚Äô testimony). What do you mean by "Animals feeding on the body"? Unless they eat ALL the first wave(s) of eggs/larvae - which is not so easy, because each fly lays HUNDREDS of eggs at a time - it won‚Äôt make any difference to the calculations - just ONE egg/larva from the first wave needs to survive. And the prosecution‚Äôs theory that animals opened up a mummified body is a non-starter, because it couldn‚Äôt have been promptly mummified by a wind that only began days LATER!</p>
<p>This trial may not have been the first in which experts sparred with each other, but it may well have been the first in which they were nevertheless unanimous in excluding the defendant. That fact alone makes this case notable.</p>
<p>I know Westerfield was far from the dump site because many witnesses said so, and nobody testified to seeing him near it. I didn‚Äôt say the RV was difficult to drive: the point I was making was that it can‚Äôt be driven as fast as an ordinary vehicle, and you are also somewhat restricted as to your route, so you might have to take a longer route. Driving on the open road isn‚Äôt such hard work. And I doubt he spent more than a quarter of the time driving. Forgetting the wallet might not have been relaxing, but by definition that wasn‚Äôt planned, so you shouldn‚Äôt have mentioned it, at least not in the context you did. You could have mentioned it in a subsequent context, as it proves he wasn‚Äôt "the unluckiest man in the world that weekend" - because that caused him to return home that afternoon, and it is implausible in the extreme that a guilty man would have done that, so that is evidence of innocence. In other words, forgetting the wallet gave him proof of his innocence. It is doubtful that he overpaid at the Strand, it‚Äôs more likely the ranger made a mistake, but either way, this is further evidence of innocence: a guilty man would hardly have left the child unattended in the RV while he discussed a few dollars. The water tanks might be heavy, but you don‚Äôt have to carry them, you don‚Äôt even have to carry heavy buckets, you simply use a garden hose: hardly strenuous work. He didn‚Äôt live alone, his son lived with him part-time. Technically, he DID relax at home - his motorhome! If he had to get away from people, then why did he mostly go to occupied places? So, by your own argument, that‚Äôs more evidence of innocence. If he had to get away from the police, then why did he go to a place where he could be sure the police would be in great numbers, namely back home? For that matter, why did he park close to a group of police officers at the Strand? Still more evidence of innocence. He was at places - the ocean and the desert - where he could have dumped a body and it would likely never have been found. Yet more evidence of innocence. Clearly he wasn‚Äôt the unluckiest man in the world that weekend. And the real killer wasn‚Äôt necessarily the luckiest. Westerfield often drove his RV, and this was a weekend, after all. That wasn‚Äôt the first cookie sale to him, and there was also a gift wrap sale not long before. Even if his laundry hadn‚Äôt been on the couch, the three van Dams would still have left just as many of their hairs and fibers behind, which would have been transferred throughout his environment. Where the real killer WAS lucky was that the police focused so quickly and intensely on Westerfield - by the Monday afternoon (4th) they were already CONVINCED it was him, and without good reason. This is so suspicious that I wonder if someone influential in law enforcement was somehow involved (not necessarily the perpetrator, maybe just a friend of the parents who suspected the culprit was another member of their group, or maybe just didn‚Äôt want to be exposed).</p>
<p>It was the van Dams and their friends - that‚Äôs the people you are so vigorously defending - that were smoking something, not me.</p>
<p>Faulkner, the entomologist originally brought onto the case by law enforcement, but then dropped by them, and Goff, his replacement, both gave dates that excluded Westerfield, and neither could account (with supporting evidence) for the discrepancy between their dates and the prosecution‚Äôs. Now I know what you‚Äôre going to say: they didn‚Äôt explicitly declare Westerfield to be innocent. They didn‚Äôt have to, that‚Äôs the logical conclusion to be drawn. If you want something more explicit, then Detective Armstrong and the Assistant US Attorney both said that he didn‚Äôt have child porn. His attorney was looking for far more than a hung jury, he had every right to expect an acquittal, based on time of death - he had achieved that before, on the Corenevsky case. How do you know that you have never had blood from a child you barely know on any of your personal belongings? The only way we know that in Westerfield‚Äôs case is that DNA testing was done. How often have your belongings been DNA tested? Remember that this stain was so faint it couldn‚Äôt be seen on the photo shown in court. Have you ever left your RV unlocked and unattended outside a house in which lived three children? A spatter test would have revealed if the blood had been applied with a Q-tip. (And I‚Äôd be more convinced it was Danielle‚Äôs blood if they had sent the actual material to the outside laboratory, instead of just extracted DNA.) You HAVE heard the innocent explanation but you don‚Äôt want to listen. I agree that a crime scene doesn‚Äôt have to have a pool of blood: neither Danielle‚Äôs bedroom nor the dump site had a pool of blood, and the former had more of her blood than Westerfield‚Äôs environment. In principle you are right that entomology is not conclusive: but in this case the time gap was so huge, with no evidence to account for it, that it cannot reasonably be doubted. And the parents told more lies than Westerfield. (You didn‚Äôt mention what lies you are referring to. That his estimate of the time he arrived back at the Strand was half-an-hour out? Brenda‚Äôs claim, retracted too late, that she hadn‚Äôt told him (anyone at the bar) about the father-daughter dance?)</p>
<p>I spend so much time on this case, answering invalid objections, that I don‚Äôt have time for contributing to any other articles. I am not lying. I first came here purely to see if there was an article on the case. And when I found there was, I saw it was riddled with errors so my intention was simply to correct them. My present motivation is largely outrage at your totally unfair and unjustifiable behavior. The standard of Wikipedia is low, and you obviously aren‚Äôt going to raise it, so it‚Äôs up to me. And I certainly don‚Äôt need Wikipedia. There are various other on-line forums where I can post the truth, and without having it removed by people who are either ignorant or are acting in bad faith, and there‚Äôs also the printed media.196.15.168.40 08:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article has been completely rewritten by an anon and a brand-new user (probably the same person) who seems to be claiming that he is Nathaniel Tarn. I am not sure whether to revert, in case it really is Mr. Tarn. However, some of the alterations are unacceptable. He has removed the fact that he is anthologised in <b>British Poetry since 1945</b> and he has deleted all categories, including even Living People.

<p>There's a bit about a possible conflict of interest, alleged by a group called <a href="../../../f/o/e/Foetry.com.html" title="Foetry.com">Foetry.com</a> (also in THAT article).

<p>It does seem odd that there's the citation of legal code because a layperson said it was relevant, when no court has so found; does the way it's presented currenly give allegations something close to the weight of fact?</p>

One thing that came up is the use of the Notable Names Database as a source. Here is their article on Wells: <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/578/000118224/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nndb.com/people/578/000118224/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> As you can see their comments, which seem a bit hostile from the tone, are unsourced. Yet the Wikipedia article repeats them as fact using the site as a reference. This seems like a problem to me since all a person would have to do is post anything he or she liked to a website and then repeat the material on WP using the site as a source and thereby get around the restrictions on uncited negative material on living persons.</p>
<p>Anyway I don't think Wells' article is too much of a problem since most of the material seems to be accurate. I would just like to see the article a little more professionally written, Besides I know Wells and there is almost no chance that he is thinking about suing WP.  :-) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 03:57, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brandt, who has long sparred with Wikipedia over an unflattering biography of himself, called on Wikipedia to conduct a throughout review of all its articles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This author, who is independant of both Brandt and Wikipedia, has characterized his biography as "unflattering." She could have left that term out and still conveyed the same information if she didn't think it was "unflattering." It seems that this is at least external evidence that article is not NPOV if the perception is that it's "unflattering." It should be neither flattering nor unflattering.

<dd>Sometimes "unflattering" is a euphemism for "attack", and but I have seen it used more often as a simple opposite to "flattering," to mean a writeup that includes sharp criticism.

<dd>Wikipedia bios should be neither flattering nor unflattering.

<dd>Well, depending on the precise definitions of those words, a "flattering" or "unflattering" bio is not necessarily a problem. To take an extreme example, the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> is unflattering. This is just an inevitable result of readers encountering the facts and drawing their own conclusions. We write from the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>, but if the facts lend themselves to a negative impression, then there's no avoiding it, even in a perfectly NPOV article. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">‚Äî Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 00:11, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>1)</b> AP reporter Anick Jesdanun is a "he," not a "she." Wikipedians often seem to be confused about gender. <b>2)</b> AP reporters don't do opinion pieces -- if he says it is "unflattering," that's a neutral statement. I say it's "unflattering" also. <b>3)</b> Oh crap, now I'm compared to Adolf Hitler. Let's go back to comparing me to Britney Spears, as one Wikipedia editor did who was bent on sabotaging my reputation, and needed to justify his attack. <b>4)</b> I think Mr. Jesdanun probably should have added that I've been trying to get my bio taken down for 13 months now. There are issues beyond "unflattering" or "flattering," such as, what impact does a bio have on a person when it shows up as number one in all the search engines? --Daniel Brandt 68.92.156.87 18:38, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A detailed description of a slashdot discussion was included with quotations from a pseudonymous user claiming to be Brandt.

Gil-white states about African Americans "The claim that they were innately stupid because they had done poorly on IQ tests was therefore obviously nonsense, but this was Arthur Jensen's claim." is perhaps the most insulting as Jensen has NEVER stated this and it is essentially libel. I have read the majority of jensen's work and to state this is patently absurd and evidence of lack of neutrality again.// BenGibson 19:17, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is about a main work of pop-art by Richard Hamilton. At the moment it is an unverified original resarch essay claiming that this collage should be attributet to another artist, John McHale. I think that this is a violation of BLP as this claim damages the reputation of an artist without giving a single independent reliable source for this change of attribution. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualDelight_6c58.html" title="User:VirtualDelight">VirtualDelight</a> 18:39, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>An update: I found a cached version of the Prechter bio and saw that contributions from other editors may indeed be a copyright problem. But I can't address that issue unless I can get to the article. User 141.156.240.102 disregarded Wikipedia policy regarding lag times and failed to post the Prechter article on the copyright problem page. <a href="../../../r/g/f/User%7ERgfolsom_7131.html" title="User:Rgfolsom">Rgfolsom</a> 16:02, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I posted here yesterday because <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> said, "In the most exceptional cases, posting a message to WP:AN/I may be more appropriate instead. Rapid correctional action can then be taken if the ensuing discussion makes clear it should be." I've also politely made it clear to the deleting administrator that the speedy deletion of the Prechter bio page was unwarranted and outside of Wikipedia's guidelines. So far I haven't seen an ensuing discussion here, much less any "rapid correctional action." For the record, I'll be resubmitting a new Robert Prechter biography unless I can get an administrator to discuss the deletion issue with me. <a href="../../../r/g/f/User%7ERgfolsom_7131.html" title="User:Rgfolsom">Rgfolsom</a> 14:44, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The homosexuality section has been an area of concern for a long time now, and I just realized that biographies of living people have very strict guidelines, so I removed a lot of information from that section.

<p>There are many, many problems with the section. First of all, Chubbybunny78 has only been a Wikipedian for one or two days and the ONLY articles that Chubbybunny78 seems to be interested in are Steele's and Erlich's. This FACT calls into question the motivation. We must assume "good faith" but a pattern is appearing and it cannot be ignored. Also, the whole section seems to be to tear down a strong, independent black man. That needs to be pointed out. The whole article is just one "criticism" of Steele after another. And don't you even tell me that this issue is not important. The election is over. It is NOW time to start enforcing the Living Person rules of Wikipedia. Is this topic something that belongs in a so-called encyclopedia???? I don't think so. I have never, until I stumbled upon Wikipedia, seen encyclopedias where the articles are written in such stark biased ways. Yes, I know that Wikipedia has a policy to be NEUTRAL, but that ain't happening. This article is a disgrace to a talented and motivated person who has served his state and his country. It is a just a laundry list of so-called "controversies" that are nothing more than spitballs thrown at him during an election campaign. The election is over. Call off the biased Wikipedia dogs and let's make the article neutral. And we can start by getting rid of this unimportant, non-notable incident where there is nothing behind it but allegation and heresay. And it was put in the article by a Wikipedia that has been here a couple of days and the ONLY edits that Chubbybunny78 has made is to tear down Steele and Erlich. Can't we just follow the Living Person rules and make honest decisions on what should be biographical article (date of birth, place of birth, schooling, work experience, etc.) instead of a series of election-inspiried charges by overzealous Democrats out to completely destroy a black man that dares to get off of the Democratic Plantation???--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> 14:46, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since when is this noticeboard the FIRST place to go to, to complain about POV? I was under the impression that edits and discussions on article talk pages were where one should start, with only serious problems posted here. I see no evidence of dialog by Getaway in this situation, just an (implied) assertion that a new editor focusing on a two biographies should be characterized as an <i>overzealous Democrat out to completely destroy a black man that dares to get off of the Democratic Plantation</i>.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia has an easy remedy for unsourced negative information: remove it. Apparently (reading above) that isn't the real problem here; rather, it's sourced negative information that is bothersome. And if I misread the situation, I'd be happy to be corrected - on the article's talk page. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 22:46, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wrong. The ARTICLE as a whole is biased. It is a long laundry list of so-called "complaints" by Democrats about Steele. The article is not about Steele. The article is about what Democrats think of Steele.

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fisher" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fisher" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> I feel that this article is unnecessarily opinionative and should be edited if not completely removed. There are contextual issues, a lack of references, chronological assumptions, and other issues which I think should be addressed.</p>
<p>First of all, I'd like to give a quick explanation as to why I'm asserting this position in regards to this entry. The article masks itself as an entry regarding Joseph Fisher, where in fact his "biography" is restricted to a mere three sentences. In which case I would've pushed for a simple renaming of the entry from Joseph Fisher to something along the lines of "The 'Islam Sucks' Controversy." However, the entire article contains many problems, so I raise the following issues.</p>
<p>The quotation in the article "a danger to the welfare of many" is speculative and doesn't portray the implication in Fisher's original editorial. In his essay, Fisher writes "Islam also presents a danger to the welfare of many due to its influence in Middle Eastern and North African governments." It is clear that Fisher's concern over the "danger to the welfare of many" was not Islam itself, but rather over Islamic fundamentalist regimes. This makes the wikipedia entry's statement "[Fisher] remarks on his dislike of ... Islam ... calling it a 'danger to the welfare of many.'" completely false. It should be removed from the entry.</p>
<p>The quotation "As this may suggest, the column is rife with inflammatory language ... where Fisher quotes Pervez Musharraf, calling Muslims 'the poorest, most illiterate, backward, unhealthy, unenlightened, deprived and weakest of all the races.'" First of all, I think the implied connection between the alleged inflammatory language in the editorial and the quotation of Pervez Musharraf fails to show Fisher's acknowledgement of the inflammatory nature of the comment, as indicated by his follow-up sentence "I don't have to defend these words because I didn't say them", culminating in his attributing the words to Musharraf. However, if you disagree on this being a deletion-worthy sentence based on contextual issues, I think many would still agree that "As this may suggest" is a slippery sentence to use in objective writing. It appeals to the audience to come to a conclusion, particularly the author's. It serves no purpose in an objective, encyclopedic entry.</p>
<p>The quotation "Fisher also condemns Muslim sharia law and in particular, the application of justice in Saudi Arabia." is blatantly and entirely false. It is entirely inferred by the author and has no factual basis. In fact, the author of the article even admits sharia is not even mentioned in the editorial. If the entry is (properly, I assert) abridged, it becomes paradoxical gibberish: "Fisher also condemns Muslim sharia law and in particular, the application of justice in Saudi Arabia, ... though his article does not mention sharia or the ongoing debate in Muslim nations about its application."</p>
<p>The omitted sentence between the quotations has its own supplications for deletion. "In [Fisher's] view, [sharia] is antithetical to women's rights." This sentence itself is an insult to "women's rights" as the "antithetical" position the author implies is condemnation of the sharia practice of punishing rape victims. An issue I feel ethically compelled to take a position on, and I hope and intend this position to be the only one I take in critism of this Wiki entry.</p>
<p>The remains of this flawed paragraph reads: "His only differentiation of the Muslim world is that of secular Turkey and just about everybody else - whereas he is unrelentingly critical of Islam and the nations where it plays a dominant role, he calls Turkey a 'shining light amidst all this madness. There's an understanding that a Muslim society can prosper, as long as it downplays the whole Islam thing.'" This paragraph fails to portray the larger context from which the quotation is taken. Mr. Fisher's position in his editorial seemed to be critism of religious law and an affinity to secular governments. The quotation is used in a way to imply criticism of Islam, where again, I don't feel the source properly verifies this assumption.</p>
<p>The statement "The author claims that some versions of the article found on the Internet are inaccurate and have been modified with malicious intent." lacks quotation and is speculative.</p>
<p>The statement "Two days later, after hundreds of letters to the editor poured in, an apology written by Fisher appeared on the front page of the South End." is presumably lifted from the entry's third source. Upon examination of the source, however, it is evident that this statement has been construed from two points in the source, without maintaining the factual integrity of the source. If I'm being unclear, my point is that the quotation can not actually be verified by the source. While the information is there, the chronology is not, and the chronology implied in the quotation is unverifiable. For this reason, it should be edited.</p>
<p>The statement "Fisher has since stated that he was coerced into the writing the apology." lacks quotation and is suspect.</p>
<p>The statement "In the days following the column's publication, he received thousands of e-mails, many of them threatening his life." lacks quotation.</p>
<p>The statement "Fisher believes that he was perfectly justified in writing the article, arguing that was approved by his editor before publication, and that while he 'may want to change a few of the details in the column, I would not change the gist of it.'" is wrong on so many levels, I think there might be a legal case against the author within it, should it prove to be false. Since it lacks quotation and is aggressive, I presume it to be false, and surely deserves deletion if nothing else in the article does. Without references, this claim is simply attacking Mr. Fisher and has NO place in his Wikipedia biography.</p>
<p>I believe in Mr. Fisher's right to free speech, and I think his Wiki article was written by someone who felt otherwise. While the article is seemingly accurate, minor changes and elaborations have been made that tarnish the factual history of the event. I think this subtlety is what makes this article particularly insidious. It wrongly chronicles Mr. Fisher's biography and inaccurately portrays the "furious debate" from the point of view of one of Mr. Fisher's debators. I originally started this piece with the intent of asking for the expurgation of large portions of the article, but upon the completion of it, I request it be expunged unless many feel Mr. Fisher deserves a Wikipedia entry, in which case, he deserves a cleaner rewrite with a more neutral tone.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration of my case, and I apologize for its length. J.S.</p>

<p>Biased, slanted, unbalanced article with 5 sentences on her early life, education, and television career. The remaining sentences focus on controversy. Libelous comments on the discussion page need to be removed. These sentences include</p>
<p>"Star Jones is a despicable human being who kills puppies for fun, eats kittens and mocks the handicapped. She has been seen flirting with five year olds and even supported the nazi's during ww2 (she did this before being born through her alliance with satan). She sold out the human race to the aliens years ago and even flew one of the planes into the world trade center. I have personally seen her club baby seals and sodomize a blind dog. She has been spotted many times fisting sheep on various occassions. Finally, she is the anti-christ and must be killed asap. Thank you for your time."</p>
<p>"She is a fat stupid and obnoxious cow, and that, in my mind, makes her a target for ridicule."</p>
<p>I don't expect Wikipedia to do anything--obviously you've ignored all other complaints. But at least I've followed the rules and reported the libel against a living person.</p>

<p>She herself is constantly editing the article. The problem is, she doesn't really speak English. I've tagged the article for cleanup and copyedit (because it needs cleanup and I don't have time to do it right now), but then she attacked me in the revert comments, and she and a newly registered user magically appeared and vandalised my userpage 3 times in short order, commenting (in Hungarian) that "if you don't stop yourself, you'll get more of this, but in Hungarian". (I haven't edited any other articles related to Hungarian topics in weeks.) To her credit, she did add references to many of her statements, which I requested on the talk page alongside the English cleanup, so I'm really straining to assume good will. I've tried her talk page, but I think she doesn't know how to use talk pages.</p>
<p>I'd happily copyedit the article, but she seems firmly set on my being a vandal at this point, and I don't really feel like having horrendous things appear on my userpage overnight. I don't know what to do - I don't know her in person and I've never been connected to her in any way besides Wikipedia.</p>

I didn't restore it - I didn't think the whole thing was that important to get into a revert war over - and it was deleted after a while.)</p>

<p>One of the men that did this was caught and and he claimed that O'Callaghan asked him to do this as part of a sex act - this is all reported widely and and reference in the article. The only person claiming that he was gay and the jury didnt believe him and convicted him of robbery. This is also highlight in the article.

<dd>Tilman, if I have EVER inserted libelous unsourced information into a living person's article, don't hold back - go forth and zap it mercilessly.

<dd>I agree with you that the Jason Scott issue should be mentioned in the article, but I also agree with Wikpediatrix that most of the stuff from the old article was unnecessary and read like a personal attack. Smeelgova 20:51, 13 November 2006 (UTC).

<dd>Not mentioning the controversies makes the article look like a whitewash. The current article does him a disservice, because now there is also no neutral review of these attack arguments (e.g. scientology, Ammerman, Wessinger, etc). --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 20:55, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Like I told you before, this would mean having "[12]" after every sentence of the Jason Scott segment.

<p>Wikipediatrix, you and I have disagreed in the past, but I have to agree. Tillman's edit is too negative and the citations arent clear. Jason Scott could probably be mentioned in a sentence or two without going into all the gory details, but the article looks good to me the way it is. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrabapplecove_aff7.html" title="User:Crabapplecove">Crabapplecove</a> 21:32, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rick Ross comes up as the final winner in "my" edit. After all, Jason Scott first won a lawsuit against Ross because Ross had tried to deprogramm him, then he fire his (scientology) attorney, settled with Ross for a tiny amount of money, plus 200 hours of his expert time! --<a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">Tilman</a> 21:45, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bad example. For a two-sentence paragraph, you only need one link at the end of the paragraph. Nothing in wikipedia policy says that every phrase, or every word, or even every sentence needs a separate citation. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 18:19, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed, and I haven't suggested anything on the order of what Tilman is facetiously (at least I hope he's just being facetious) claiming I have. A link at the end of each paragraph would suit me just fine, <i>provided</i> that everything in the preceding paragraph is in fact supported by that link's info. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 19:35, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>The criticism and controversy section of this article is completely unsourced. It accuses Matheson of rarely going to church, having a far left voting record on social policy, and getting a free pass from the local media. The writer's uses some version of the phrase "some say" or "critics say" repeatedly to cover up the lack of sourcing. I attempted to remove the section, but the original writer added it back. I'm new to wikipedia and wasn't sure what to do.</p>

<p>Certain sections of the article on mwai kibaki ,the president of kenya are libelous .The article does not meet Editors standards of not being biased or malicious .The article is clearly pushing an agenda and biased point of view. The third-party published sources are cleverly picked from government critics and news sources that have a history of being biassed such as the bbc when it comes to african issues.The writers of the article are representing their views and misrepresenting them as a majority view.sections of his personal life that state he has a second wife are of concern and of damaging repute to the president . i also take issue with the highlighting section concerning 2005 dismissal of the cabinet . though the event of the sacking did take place most of the insinuations in the article are false and clearly aimed at damaging the reputation of the president . most of the claims are infact out rightly false eg 2005 constitution- the article claims that "Though strongly supported by Kibaki, the majority of Kenya's citizens rejected it". what exactly constitutes a majority ,referendum results clearly showed that though the president was for the constitution it was defeated with a narrow victory for the opposition a 47% loss to a 53% win.</p>
<p>On the 2005 dismissal of cabinet- this events hadly qualifies as a major incident in the presidency of mwai kibaki its importance is grossly over blown.the article goes further to state that "The Cabinet was appointed, but some MPs were offered ministerships but did not take up posts" which also is a fabrication one agin aimmed at the presidents reputation.The laterst entry that On 15 November 2006 he reinstated Kiraitu Murungi as Energy minister, accused of corruption in the Anglo-Leasing scandal, and George Saitoti as Education minister, previously accused in the Goldenberg scandal.is infact misleading Kiraitu Murungi Energy minister, was never accused of corruption in the Anglo-Leasing scandal but rather he was accused of slowing down investigations into anglo leasing as justice minister a huge difference than the implied actual involVement in the scandal</p>

<p>I have vigerously removed comments made by User:170.252.11.11, who now goes by User:70.129.156.204. He seems to have changed his IP after I tried to contact him through his talk page. He will not speak to me directly, but has made grandios claims on the talk page that I am a "Dave Ramsey lover" and that I am vandalizing the page by not allowing this person to "reveal any kind of criticsm about Dave Ramsey." I don't know what controversy he is referring to other than the one he seems so intent to invent. Ramsey himself admits to being criticized by some in the financial industry, but the only thing I can find to support that is in his books, in two blogs, an Amazon.com member review, and a Myspace page. This person has cited his sources as that Amazon.com member review, three articles that don't even talk about the arguement he was making in the statement, and a form on Dave Ramsey's site allowing listeners to enter a contest to win a free TiVo. He also repeatedly adds an uncited comment that Ramsey makes derogitory statements against women by calling them "Darling." When I revert his comments, he reverts them back stating that I am vandalizing the article and either twisting wikipedia policy to support my actions or making up wikipedia policy to forward my "Pro-Ramsey agenda." I admit I'm fairly new to this, and I'm pretty much learning this as I go. This isn't exactly the only article I contribute to, I just have a fair bit of knowledge about it. I'm not really sure what stage to take next with this guy. If any of his statements had any strand of truth, I'd cite it properly. (and believe me, I've been using every resource I can think of to try and verify any of it-Besides the rediculous nature of some of it, really the only thing I can find validity to is the comment about other financial professionals, and according to Wikipedia BLP guidelines, the only usable source available is his own books) So what do I do? Or can I get some help in the area? Should some sort of block take effect? It seems like if he's changing his IP that won't do anything. I'm going to look into requesting this be protected. But could someone maybe look over the history page and see what should be done? I saw something about removing this stuff from the history as well, but I'm not even sure how to do that. Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated.--<a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkcana_127a.html" title="User:Arkcana">Arkcana</a> 03:10, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Fraga" is <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manuel_Fraga_5509.html" title="Manuel Fraga">Manuel Fraga</a>, a famous living spanish politician.</p>
<p>The "source" given by Igor21 <b>does not exist</b>, due to two simple facts.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. The <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grupos_Antiterroristas_de_Liberaci%C3%B3n_e98f.html" title="Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci√≥n">Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci√≥n</a> criminal actions started in october 1983.</li>

</ul>
<p>After this gaffe, Igor21 wrote:</p>

<p>Now "he thinks" it was the magazine Cambio 16. After this he wrote a text in spanish in my user page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Randroide#Por_si_te_interesara_de_verdad" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Randroide#Por_si_te_interesara_de_verdad" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> where he writes further unsourced accusations against Fraga an Pedro J Ram√≠rez. He also talks about the source he has not been able to provide as the <i>"mysterious source"</i>.</p>
<p>I asked Igor21 for a formal statement about that <i>"mysterious source"</i>, because I wanted to check his assertions in the library and I do not want to go there every time Igor21 has a <i>surprising recall</i> about the <i>"mysterious source"</i>. He made no such statement.</p>
<p><u><b>Finally</b></u>:</p>
<p>I gave the User the link to <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> and <b>asked him for sources several times, with no success</b>.</p>

<p>Please refer also to the opinions of other editors as expressed on the talk page for the Madrid bombngs. This is a debate which is entirely unproductive and irrelevant to the subject matter of the article. Those who accuse, without evidence, the Spanish government of participating in the massacre of 191 of their own citizens are on very shaky ground when accusing others of libel.</p>

<dd>In my opinion it is. Scientists should keep open minds and not reject possiblities. Although in this case they are said to only reject a "likelihood", which I guess is not so bad. I made a suggestion on the talk page of the article which could improve the sentence without changing the point it is trying to make.

<dd>So provide a reliable source indicating that the majority of scientists -- or even anything more than a percent or two -- do not consider Bigfoot to be utter hooey.

<p>Some person or persons editing from IP addresses are repeatedly reverting to a version that includes unsourced/poorly sourced information, while the subject himself is removing the unsourced information but also an item of sourced information. The latest revert claimed that 192.com, i.e. the phone book, was sufficient proof that Mike Mendoza the DJ (the subject of the article) is also a former Tory councillor, which is one of the items the subject has been removing and is not supported by any reliable source - the phone book plainly doesn't qualify.</p>
<p>I've summarised the points under dispute on <a href="../../../m/i/k/Talk%7EMike_Mendoza_4635.html" title="Talk:Mike Mendoza">Talk:Mike Mendoza</a>. I've asked for a third opinion but it was the wrong place to go - I need someone to actively edit the article rather than just give their opinion. Specifically I need someone to either help revert, or even better, semi/fully protect the page to force participants to discuss rather than edit war. I've reverted too much myself, and can't protect as I've 'taken a side'. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 23:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
