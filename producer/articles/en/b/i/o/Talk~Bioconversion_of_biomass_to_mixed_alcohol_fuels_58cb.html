<p>Is this process patented? Please include this information in the article.</p>
<p>--It sure is patented. I added the word "patented" as per your request Alex. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Cesar</a> 09:00, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This comment wasn't mine! I added the environment link. The article is very close to being an advert for the MixAlco process so other people may wish its deletion. You may wish to consider if there is an article it can be a sub heading under.

<p>more energy from the biomass will end up as liquid fuels than in converting biomass to ethanol fuel.</p>
<p>Is this statement confirmed&#160;? <a href="../../../m/i/o/User%7EMion_afee.html" title="User:Mion">Mion</a> 14:58, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course it is confirmed, and it is also explained why. Cellulosic ethanol made by saccharifying holocellulose (i.e., cellulose and hemicellulose) to make glucose and xylose followed by yeast fermentation will produce 2 molecules of ethanol per every molecule of sugar plus CO2. The undigested biomass, which is mostly lignin, must be burned to make electricity and it cannot be added to the fuel. If you go the acetic acid route, then you make 3 molecules of Acetic acid with no CO2 production. Then if you gasify the lignin, you get the lignin energy in the form of H2 which can be added to the acetic acid to obtain 3 molecules of Ethanol overall. So you see, if you make 100% acetic acid, then your yield will be 50% higher (i.e., 3 molecules of ethanol as opposed to 2). The MixAlco process makes 75% acetic acid (the rest is higher acids which are made with CO2 production); thus, you will end up with about 40% higher alcohol yields on an energy basis. I hope this is clear. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 22:30, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mion, you don't need links. The chemistry is clear. Ethanol fermentation is chemically limited to only 2 molecules of ethanol per molecule of glucose and you cannot add more energy to it. Acetic acid fermentation, followed by hydrogenation, produces 3 molecules of ethanol per molecule of glucose, thus you end up with 50% higher yield (both in energy and mass). <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 08:30, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The efficiency of the process is not mentioned anywhere. WHat is mentioned is a comparison of the theoretical yield (maximum yield as allowed by chemistry) of acetic acid fermentation (which is the type of fermentation used in the MixAlco process) and ethanol fermentation. To this, as I mentioned, you don't need links because, again, the chemistry is clear. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 8:50, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, you don't need any links. The chemistry says so. Do you understand the chemistry? Ethanol fermentation cannot make more than 2 molecules of ethanol per molecule of glucose. THe undigested residue is then just burned to make electricity for the plant and to export it to the grid, thus the energy in the undigested residue never makes it to the liquid fuel. In Acetic acid fermentation + hydrogenation, on the other hand, 3 molecules of ethanol per molecule of glucose are obtained. THe H2 is obtained from gasification of the undigested residue, thus some of the energy of the undigested residue makes it into the liquid fuel, which can't be the case with ethanol fermentation. ONe thing must be clear.. THis is not the efficiency but only a comparison of the theoretical YIELDS. Even the DOE agrees with this, as they are supporting the so-called ZeaChem indirect route to ethanol, which is basically acetic acid fermentation followed by hydrogenation, with H2 obtained from undigested product (if ethanol is made from glucose/xylose obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis), sugarcane bagasse (if ethanol is made from sugar from sugarcane) or corn stover (if ethanol is made from corn). Just google ZeaChem. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 10:50, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ohh that explains it. Then how good an external link will do you, since the link will simply state the very same thing based on chemistry. Ethanol fermentation produces theoretically 2 molecules of ethanol per molecule of sugar (i.e., 2 lb of ethanol per pound of sugar). It could produce less, but it cannot produce more because it would break the laws of chemistry and physics. Acetic acid fermentation followed by Hydrogenation, on the other hand, produces theoretically 3 molecules of ethanol per molecule of sugar (i.e., 3 lbs of ethanol per pound of sugar fermented). So it is clear that 3 lbs of ethanol is 50% more energy and mass than 2 lbs of ethanol produced by the ethanol fermentation. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 15:41, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK. How about this <a href="http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/841137-u4bFGI/841137.PDF#search=%22Acetic%20acid%20route%20ZeaChem%22" class="external free" title="http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/841137-u4bFGI/841137.PDF#search=%22Acetic%20acid%20route%20ZeaChem%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/841137-u4bFGI/841137.PDF#search=%22Acetic%20acid%20route%20ZeaChem%22</a>. The ZeaChem process is based on the acetic acid route because of this reason. They start with free sugars and they ferment to acetic acid instead of ethanol because of the higher yields. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 17:21, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>MixAlco process is how this process is identified in the scientific community. Any scientific article written about it calls it this way. You should not change the name. Thanks. Also, I must clarify, MixAlco is the name of the process not the company. There is no company named MixAlco.</dd>

<p>Yes, discussion was going that way to keep the title as it is, (<a href="../../../b/i/o/Biomass_conversion_to_mixed_alcohol_fuels.html" title="Biomass conversion to mixed alcohol fuels">Biomass conversion to mixed alcohol fuels</a> also known as the MixAlco process), would be better, but the way you are putting the name repetitive in the article it is commercial spamming which would end up that the whole article might end up on the deletion list. MixAlco isn't a company name, but its a name used for commercial branding.<a href="../../../m/i/o/User%7EMion_afee.html" title="User:Mion">Mion</a> 08:39, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have to disagree. MixAlco is not even a TRADE MARK. As I said, is the name given to this process and it is how it is known in the scientific community. There are more than 20 technical articles published about it in well-renowned scientific journals, where commercial spamming is not allowed as well, and they have NO problem with that. Regarding putting the name many times in the article it has to do with keeping clarity. Just by putting "the process", like you were doing it just does not cut it. I can give you many examples here in wikipedia of the same situation. Quickly check out for instance <a href="../../../r/a/n/Raney_Nickel_5fba.html" title="Raney Nickel">Raney Nickel</a>. "Raney" is even the TRADEMARK given to this catalyst belonging to W. R. Grace and Company, and they use the name to keep clarity more than 20 times in the article, and that is because RANEY NICKEL is the name given to this catalyst in the scientific community. or should the "Raney nickel" article also be deleted for using the TRADEMARK name so many times? <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 08:20, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just because a name is not a registered trademark it does not mean it is not a commercial plug. If it was trademarked and well established it may have more justification as the title of the whole article. I.e. <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-cola.html" title="Coca-cola">Coca-cola</a>. The academic articles do not give justification for the article to be a commercial plug, they give proof of the science behind it. These are two different issues.--<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 08:54, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, let us end this here, as this is taking us nowhere.. First of all, no, if you read above, you asked for technical articles and I gave you technical articles. Somewhere else you asked for reference links which are not from Holtzapple or van Walsum, the two professors/researchers (one from Texas A&amp;M and the other from Baylor) that have been working on this process and who know more about it than anybody else. I don't know why would you want that, as this article is merely informative as to what is the MixAlco process and a summary of its details and it is not meant to cause controversies... Secondly, you say that "Bioresource Technology", one of the most respected and well-renowed peer-reviewed scientific journals is NOT a trusted source.. come on!!.. Thirdly, why do you say "my own publication"?. Just to let you know I am NOT Mark Holtzapple. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 12:22, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My own publication is from the view of the patenters and publishers of this whole process, now for new inventions it is logical that it is hard to find proper references/reflections on a recently innovated process, the article states that its running since 1991, so why is the rest of the community not responding/taking it up&#160;? <a href="../../../m/i/o/User%7EMion_afee.html" title="User:Mion">Mion</a> 13:26, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the article states that its running since 1991, so why is the rest of the community not responding/taking it up&#160;?
<dl>
<dd>Those involved in industry know very well that for any innovative process using unconventional raw materials and new methods and making new products, to get to be a well-established process takes some good 30 years from the time laboratory testing starts to the time a full scale commercial plant is built and functioning. I can give you many examples of this. There are however, in some cases, circumstances that might accelerate things. In the case of the MixAlco process, and all the other biofuel-from-biomass processes, the <b>recent</b> high energy prices, are speeding up things. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 15:32, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Gents, personally I agree with Mion <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biomass_conversion_to_mixed_alcohol_fuels.html" title="Biomass conversion to mixed alcohol fuels">Biomass conversion to mixed alcohol fuels</a> seems like a better, more encyclopedic title with a subreference to the MixAlco process in the main text. I also consider that if the author of this article was neutral there would not be an issue with the title being changed to allow readers greater understanding or the subject. I consider the multiple references to MixAlco in the text as a commercial plug. I believe this should be kept to perhaps 1 or 2<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 08:13, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is being described in this article is THE MixAlco process and NO OTHER process. Many technical articles have been written about it in well-renowned scientific journals and many presentations in biotechnology symposiums have been given and that is the name that has been given to it and how it is known in the biotechnology/scientific community. To change the title and not mention it will cause confusion. You say: "biomass conversion can be achieved by systems such as the MixAlco process", then what is being described IS the MixAlco process and no other process. To me it makes no sense. I'll go with the title change for now as long as it says <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biomass_bioconversion_to_mixed_alcohol_fuels.html" title="Biomass bioconversion to mixed alcohol fuels">Biomass bioconversion to mixed alcohol fuels</a> (as there is a way to make Mixed Alcohols by <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasification.html" title="Gasification">gasification</a> followed by fisher tropsch) and, because it is the MixAlco process that is being described and no other process, where it says "can be accomplished by systems such as the MixAlco process" it is changed to "is accomplished by the MixAlco process" becuase what is EXTENSIVELY described afterwards IS the MixAlco Process and NO other process. I would like to hear more people's opinion on this regard other than Alex and Mion. If I don't hear from anyone else or the opinion is that it should be kept as is, then I will revert. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 09:40, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On second thought, the title might as well be left as is, as it is more descriptive of what this process is about. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 17:40, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am glad you have finally understood our point. The fisher tropsch process has been long commercialised. The MixAlco process has not as yet got further than pilot scale. If the system becomes widely used and well known and accepted I would have no objections to the article being named as such. At present I do not believe this is the case and a descriptive title would be more helpful to readers. It is not a personal criticism as it is a good and interesting article--<a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVortexrealm_bdaa.html" title="User:Vortexrealm">Alex</a> 08:33, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes Alex, I agree with you I think the title is more descriptive of what is being done. Although I never talked about Fischer Tropsch, but about Raney Nickel as an article that is using it TRADEMARK name in the title, I also accept those are well established technologies. On the other hand, just to show you, here in wikipedia you find <a href="../../../i/o/g/Iogen_Corp._68fb.html" title="Iogen Corp.">Iogen Corp.</a>, which is a company that is also starting to get established in the biofuel industry, by producing <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cellulosic_ethanol.html" title="Cellulosic ethanol">cellulosic ethanol</a> with enzymes followed by <a href="../../../y/e/a/Yeast.html" title="Yeast">yeast</a> fermentation. They are NOT even commercial yet, but they are only in the R&amp;D stages. Yet, no one is changing their name, title or the like. Their process is extensively explained in the same page. In any case, let's just leave it at that. <a href="../../../a/g/2/User%7EAg2003_b935.html" title="User:Ag2003">Ag2003</a> 5:30, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you have concerns relating to the <a href="../../../i/o/g/Iogen_Corp._68fb.html" title="Iogen Corp.">Iogen Corp.</a> article perhaps you should raise them. On the face of it it seems that this particular company is well established and has been trading since the 70s. The article doesnt relate to the process which isn't yet developed, instead the company which is developing it.</p>
<p>Now the article is less promotional I have added links to this article via <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_solid_waste_treatment_technologies.html" title="List of solid waste treatment technologies">List of solid waste treatment technologies</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butanol_fuel.html" title="Butanol fuel">butanol fuel</a> &amp; <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethanol_fuel.html" title="Ethanol fuel">ethanol fuel</a>. You may want to also include links on <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_alcohol_fuel.html" title="Timeline of alcohol fuel">Timeline of alcohol fuel</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cellulosic_ethanol.html" title="Cellulosic ethanol">cellulosic ethanol</a>.</p>
