<p>In this dispute Biophys has created this article in order to present the evidence for human rights violations in Russia and to make the point in the article <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Russia_e259.html" title="Human rights in Russia">Human rights in Russia</a>. However, the initial version of this article was totaly one-sided and presented just allegations of human rights activists and other defenders of Boris Stomakhin. In order to make the article NPOV and to add other POV I have added the official text of the Court sentence and Investigation conclusion on Boris Stomakhin. Also I have added Boris Stomakhin citation taken from the official website of his organization. These contributions made Biophys personal opinion on Stomakhin and his initial version of the article to look controversial. The edit war resulted because Biophys claimed that all my sources violate biography of living person policy. He was deleting opinions of the journalists from such respectable Russian newspapers as <a href="../../../k/o/m/Komsomolskaya_Pravda_7cb1.html" title="Komsomolskaya Pravda">Komsomolskaya Pravda</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rossiyskaya_Gazeta_8482.html" title="Rossiyskaya Gazeta">Rossiyskaya Gazeta</a>, <a href="../../../i/z/v/Izvestia.html" title="Izvestia">Izvestia</a>. See the respective version of my edit of Boris Stomakhin article here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boris_Stomakhin&amp;oldid=105173635" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boris_Stomakhin&amp;oldid=105173635" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boris_Stomakhin&amp;oldid=105173635</a></p>
<p>In order to delete my contributions from the article, Biophys had employed a strategy of accusing me of violations of Wikipedia policies. Namely, he declared that all my contributions are taken from the contradictory sources which violate Wikipedia BLP policy. Namely he claimed that the article of Izvestia journalist Maksim Sokolov who also was a talk show showman and is very respectable and famous journalist in Russia contradicts to the website of Boris Stomakhin. It was established that from the citated passage two citations of Boris Stomakhin are found in his articles on his website, and the third citation is not found here. Therefore it was established that Biophys claims about contradictions are false. See the discussion here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#quote_.22Death_to_Russia.22" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#quote_.22Death_to_Russia.22" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#quote_.22Death_to_Russia.22</a>.</p>
<p>As Biophys failed to present the evidence of contradictions he chose to accuse me of other violations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Violations_of_LP_policy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Violations_of_LP_policy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Violations_of_LP_policy</a>. He claimed after that the source (Izvestia newspaper article) is unreliable, it is not neutral, and it is "non-encyclopedic". As you see these accusations are not supported by any facts and resent just empty accusations. It is laughable to claim that the source is not neutral, sine the neutrality may be restored by presenting other POV and it is easy enough. However, Biophys pursued the goal of complete deletion of sources presenting POV which contradicts to his personal opinion. He failed to support his accusations here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Points_to_answer_for_Biophys" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Points_to_answer_for_Biophys" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Points_to_answer_for_Biophys</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Violations_of_LP_policy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Violations_of_LP_policy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Violations_of_LP_policy</a>.</p>
<p>Following the edit warring between me and <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhinarticle</a> was protected by administrator <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">User:Cbrown1023</a> who told that he would unprotect that page till I reach an agreement with <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys</a>. The underlying problem for edit warring is that Biophys holds strognly Russophobic views and maintains that criminal Boris Stomakhin, who got 5 years of prison in Russia for public calls to <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extremism.html" title="Extremism">extremism</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> against Russians including me, is actually innocent dissident and there is conspiracy against him by Russian government</p>
<p>Here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#quote_.22Death_to_Russia.22" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#quote_.22Death_to_Russia.22" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#quote_.22Death_to_Russia.22</a> here wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not talking about Izvestia at all. I am talking about this citation by Sokolov. It was taken from another unreliable and not identified by Sokolov source (probably RKO site). He also made a composition from three different articles/sources but misrepresented this as a single continuous citation. We do not want such citations in Wikipedia. Sokolov discloses his "source": Stomakhin (this is not a case with protecting an anonymous witness). Of course, he does it! The entire article by Sokolov is clearly a defamation of a dissident ordered by government (there are numerous cases like that in Soviet history). But this is not my argument at the moment. The argument is poor source - RKO site. Biophys 19:03, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Biophys himself took his text material inserted into the article <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a> from blog [<a href="http://russophobe.blogspot.com/2006/10/another-russian-journalist-goes-on.html" class="external text" title="http://russophobe.blogspot.com/2006/10/another-russian-journalist-goes-on.html" rel="nofollow">La Russophobe</a>]. As you could see phrases in the current article <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a> match those found in Blog La Russophobe. It is evident that this Blog La Russophobe is inciting ethnic hatred at least. The page of that blog <a href="http://russophobe.blogspot.com/2006/06/why-is-lr-russophobe-why-arent-you.html" class="external free" title="http://russophobe.blogspot.com/2006/06/why-is-lr-russophobe-why-arent-you.html" rel="nofollow">http://russophobe.blogspot.com/2006/06/why-is-lr-russophobe-why-arent-you.html</a> says that you should hate russians. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys</a> insists that we should agree on exclusion from the article of citations taken from Russian respectable newspapers which hints that Stomakhin is not really innocent peaceful dissident, but actually almost a <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascist.html" title="Fascist">fascist</a>. My question for Wikipedia administrators: If Wikipedia is a proper place for publishing Russophobic statements (anti-semitic statements), inciting ethnic hatred against Russians? I understand the position of <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">User:Cbrown1023</a> who doesn't want to verifiy reliability of Russian texts, but a simple search in Google on Boris Stomakhin would lead to all <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russophobe.html" title="Russophobe">Russophobe</a> sources which are published by <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">User:Biophys</a> in current protected version of the article on <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a>. I am astonished that Wikipedia administrators allow to paint people like Osama bin Laden like peaceful dissidents.</p>
<p>Biophys refused to negotiate, he demanded to scrap all sources which may prove that Stomakhin is a fascist. Here is his message<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Article_by_Maksim_Sokolov" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Article_by_Maksim_Sokolov" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and respective diffs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Boris_Stomakhin&amp;diff=107018692&amp;oldid=106431040" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Boris_Stomakhin&amp;diff=107018692&amp;oldid=106431040" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, []:</p>

<p>Therefore, I have filed petition for Cabal Mediation on Boris Stomakhin article here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2007-02-10_Boris_Stomakhin" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2007-02-10_Boris_Stomakhin" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2007-02-10_Boris_Stomakhin</a></p>
<p>Biophys is a very interesting user, who contributes only to two topics: either anti-Russian propaganda, such as Putin (Putin phallus, Putin's citations), involvement of Russian in world terrorism, Politkovskaya, Litvinenko, Mitrokhin archieve and etc.) where he advances only one POV - Russophobic, or Biophysics (hence that's why he had chosen his nick). He never contributes to NPOV materials and holds extreme Anti-Russian position. Initially article about Boris Stomakhin was designed by Biophys to claim violations of freedom of speech in Russia (article 'Human rights in Russia'). However after I edited this article to present another POV, he began his personal vendetta on me by reverting and deleting all other materials, because my edits had compromised his edits at the article 'Human rights in Russia'. Incidentaly, the article was edited by two Russian admins - Alex Bakharev and Mikka, but Biophys was reverting and deleting even their versions, without any hesitation.</p>

<p>As could be seen from the complaint, applicants do not show the real evidence of me stalking them, they just provide links to the history pages of some articles. It could be seen from these pages, that my edits, contributed to these articles, are deleted by users Biophys and Colchicum in no more than 24 hours period.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fact that some pages were created by Biophys and Colchicum doesn't grant them any authority or powers to publish false information in them. And certainly doesn't forbid other users from editing their one-sided stories by adding relevant and sourced material.</p>
<p>Users Biophys and Colchicum never tried to resovle any disputes with me. Empty and false accusations on Administrators noticeboards are not a method of peaceful dispute resolution. Personal attacks and unsupported deletions of my contributions, intimidation and threats are certainly not the way a man could resolve a dispute.</p>
<p>Users Colchicum and Biophys claim that I currently 'stalk' them. However, it could be easily ascertained form the Colchicum contributions page that he is editing the following articles:</p>

<p><br />
That I do not follow edits of the user Colchicum and his claims that I disrupt his edits and Wikipedia activities are false. Moreover the articles which he refers to in his support were not created by him, but by user Biophys. Therefore, user Colchicum allegations are not supported by the real facts and are fraudulent. He just tries to help his fellow Biophys there. Moreover, Colchicum invites other users who presented POV identical with him to harass me, in particular user Ilgiz - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ilgiz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109309046" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ilgiz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109309046" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ilgiz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=109309046</a>. They also try to intimidate users who are supporting me and it's going on right here on discussion page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Vlad_fedorov" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Vlad_fedorov" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Vlad_fedorov</a>. Here Colchicum writes false accusations that I personally pursue him by stalking his edits which is clear lies that could be easily ascertained.</p>
<p>User Biophys also openly acknowledged his personal stalking of me (user Vlad fedorov) here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Colchicum#Thank_you" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Colchicum#Thank_you" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Colchicum#Thank_you</a>:</p>
<p>I cite Biophys confession published on the talk page of Colchicum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that it perfectly appropriate to follow logs of other users. We can do it. WP:STALK policy says: "The term "wiki-stalking" has been coined to describe following a contributor around the wiki, editing the same articles as the target, with the intent of causing annoyance or distress to another contributor. This does not include checking up on an editor to fix errors or violations of Wikipedia policy, nor does it mean reading a user's contribution log; those logs are public for good reason. The important part is the disruption - disruption is considered harmful." Obviously, it was Vlad who disrupted our work in Wikipedia. Biophys 21:24, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It could be easily seen that users Biophys and Colchicum conspired against me not because of stalking, but because my edits and contributions present other point of view, which they do not tolerate and make everything possible in order to harass and intimidate me.</p>
<p>Biophys also confessed in his message to me, that his articles indeed have mistakes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AVlad_fedorov&amp;diff=106849885&amp;oldid=106512675" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AVlad_fedorov&amp;diff=106849885&amp;oldid=106512675" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, but he demanded that I should not correct his mistakes which is outrageus.</p>
<p>As could be seen from the following history pages, my edits are reverted or deleted by user Biophys in less than 24 hours after my edits:</p>

<p>It is therefore evident, that it's not me, but Biophys traces my contributions, for it is always Biophys who reverts my edits in no more than 24 hours often without any explanations.</p>
<p>I would like to discuss here just the typical case. In the article dedicated to Russian security agency <a href="../../../g/r/u/GRU_d449.html" title="GRU">GRU</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GRU&amp;oldid=109121989#Chechen_GRU_agents" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GRU&amp;oldid=109121989#Chechen_GRU_agents" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, it was written that terrorist <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamil_Basaev_1f02.html" title="Shamil Basaev">Shamil Basaev</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Said-Magomed_Kakiev_eb4f.html" title="Said-Magomed Kakiev">Said-Magomed Kakiev</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Said-Magomed_Kakiev_eb4f.html" title="Said-Magomed Kakiev">Said-Magomed Kakiev</a> are 'Chechen GRU agents'. I have deleted these phrases, because there are no any evidence and sources that support these statements. Moreover, there are just allegations that Shamil Basaev was trained by some Intelleigence service long before the Chechen Conflict arised. Biophys however wrote a list of Chechen GRU agents, thereby presenting these pure allegations as established facts.</p>
<p>In less than 30 minutes my edits were reversed by Biophys,</p>
<p>&lt;cut begin&gt; (cur) (last) 05:18, 19 February 2007 Biophys (Talk | contribs) (rv vandalism by Vlad Fedorov - this is supported by refrences 4,5,6, and the content of Wikipedia articles that are provided as links) (cur) (last) 04:48, 19 February 2007 Vlad fedorov (Talk | contribs) (→Chechen GRU agents - False unsupported statements removed) &lt;cut end&gt;</p>
<p>who has cited the following source: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,,1796576,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,,1796576,00.html" rel="nofollow">Land of the warlords</a>, by Nick Paton Walsh, <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guardian_Unlimited_1c3a.html" title="Guardian Unlimited">Guardian Unlimited</a> as evidencing that <a href="../../../s/a/i/Said-Magomed_Kakiev_eb4f.html" title="Said-Magomed Kakiev">Said-Magomed Kakiev</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Said-Magomed_Kakiev_eb4f.html" title="Said-Magomed Kakiev">Said-Magomed Kakiev</a> are Chechen GRU agents. However, in the article the following is written about these individuals:</p>
<p>"Alkhanov rang for the help of Said Magomed Kakiev", the powerful head of the "West" battalion of 900 Chechen fighters under the control of Russian military intelligence, the GRU.</p>
<p>Zair said Alkhanov has gained the support of not only Kakiev but Sulim Yamadayev, the head of the "East" battalion, 800 hardened special forces Chechens also under the control of the GRU.<br />
It could be clearly seen that newspaper article doesn't say these individuals are GRU agents. It says just their battalions were under control of GRU which is a different thing at all. It follows therefore, that Biophys has repeatedly and intentionally reintroduced false disinformation by these edits into the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GRU&amp;diff=109325167&amp;oldid=109239180" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GRU&amp;diff=109325167&amp;oldid=109239180" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GRU&amp;diff=109325167&amp;oldid=109246313" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GRU&amp;diff=109325167&amp;oldid=109246313" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GRU&amp;diff=109325167&amp;oldid=109247374" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GRU&amp;diff=109325167&amp;oldid=109247374" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. And as such violated repeatedly Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>This is just fresh typical example of Biophys anti-Russian activities in the Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Other case include:</p>
<p>Deletion of pertinent information from the article dedicated to <a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevgenia_Albats_183a.html" title="Yevgenia Albats">Yevgenia Albats</a>. And specifically deletion of the information that her father has been GRU spy during the WW II. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yevgenia_Albats&amp;diff=108373818&amp;oldid=108344491" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yevgenia_Albats&amp;diff=108373818&amp;oldid=108344491" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yevgenia_Albats&amp;diff=108373818&amp;oldid=108344491</a> Please note that Biophys has never actually presented his arguments on deletion of this information on the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yevgenia_Albats" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yevgenia_Albats" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Yevgenia_Albats</a>. According to the Wikipedia policy deletion of sources material is vandalism. This information about Albats father was later reintroduced by the administrator Alex Bakharev here cur <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yevgenia_Albats&amp;diff=109477667&amp;oldid=108836686" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yevgenia_Albats&amp;diff=109477667&amp;oldid=108836686" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yevgenia_Albats&amp;diff=109477667&amp;oldid=108836686</a>. However, it was evident that the information about Albats father compromises her neutrality as a researcher appointed on Parlament commission for the investigation of KGB activitites and compromises reliability of Albats claims. That's why Biophys initiated campaign for the deletion of such material.</p>
<p>Biophys also claimed on the talk page that the following sources: <a href="http://polithexogen.ru/info/38854.html" class="external text" title="http://polithexogen.ru/info/38854.html" rel="nofollow">Boorishness as a World View</a> by Yelena Kalashnikova (in Russian) <a href="http://www.vz.ru/columns/2006/10/26/54497.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vz.ru/columns/2006/10/26/54497.html" rel="nofollow">Full Albats</a> by Oleg Kashin, business newspaper Vzgliad, October 26, 2006 (in Russian)</p>
<p>violate BLP policy, because they are: 1) not neutral 2) controversial 3) Allegations of crude and extremely uncivil behavior 4) Unsubstantiated accusations of fraud</p>
<p>However Biophys failed to show how these materials violate Wikipedia policies. There are no facts, evidence, whereabouts and so on. Again Biophys undertook the same false accusations campaign against sources and information he personaly dislikes and the same false flag campaign he was waging on the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a>. Just empty and unsubstantiated accusations.</p>
<p>I have reverted deletions by Biophys of well-sourced materials published by another author on the article <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitrokhin_archive.html" title="Mitrokhin archive">Mitrokhin archive</a>. This deletion could be seen here cur <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitrokhin_Archive&amp;diff=107010834&amp;oldid=106018891" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitrokhin_Archive&amp;diff=107010834&amp;oldid=106018891" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mitrokhin_Archive&amp;diff=107010834&amp;oldid=106018891</a> I have reinserted these well-sourced statements, since they are reliable and definitely should be mentioned in the article. I have deleted Biophys's unsourced defamatory statements on Russians as ethnicity which incite ethnic hatred in the article <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Satter_0020.html" title="David Satter">David Satter</a>. Please note that Biophys reinserts unsourced statements inciting ethnic hatred by following edits cur <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Satter&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107021411" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Satter&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107021411" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Satter&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107021411</a>. I think he should be blocked for violation of LP policies, since these statements describe David Satter as inciting ethnic hatred at least.</p>
<p>I would like to notice that Biophys deletes well-sourced materials not for the first time. For example Biophys has deleted good source in the article <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_sponsored_terrorism.html" title="State sponsored terrorism">State sponsored terrorism</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=State-sponsored_terrorism&amp;diff=102543018&amp;oldid=102542124" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=State-sponsored_terrorism&amp;diff=102543018&amp;oldid=102542124" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=State-sponsored_terrorism&amp;diff=102543018&amp;oldid=102542124</a> Revision as of 23:23, 22 January 2007 (edit) (undo) Biophys (Talk | contribs) /* United States - reference to blog removed, non-working reference corrected) deleted the working link to <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/oct1999/corr-o26.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/oct1999/corr-o26.shtml" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. I ask you to read his comments with attention, first Biophys claims that it is a blog, and second he claims the link is broken. But how he could say it is a blog if the link is actually broken? By the way, the source is not a blog and the link always works.</p>
<p>Every edit is explained and supported with specific arguments. <a href="../../../f/s/b/FSB_109a.html" title="FSB">FSB</a> cannot be described as a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_police.html" title="Secret police">secret police</a>, since this term according to the respective Wikipedia article refers to the totalitarian states. I have corrected Biophys POV to NPOV, since <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> is not described as a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_police.html" title="Secret police">secret police</a>. As to the Human Rights article, I have employed the same approach which Biophys has taken in regard to the <a href="../../../i/z/v/Izvestia.html" title="Izvestia">Izvestia</a> article in <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a> case. Biophys uses unconfirmed allegations of <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Politkovskaya_ee36.html" title="Anna Politkovskaya">Anna Politkovskaya</a> which is said was publishing her materials without verifications and presents them as facts and not as unconfirmed allegations.Parfitt, Tom (2006-10-08). <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1890481,00.html" class="external text" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1890481,00.html" rel="nofollow">Assassin's Bullet Kills Fiery Critic of Putin</a>. The Observer. Retrieved on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_9.html" title="October 9">10-09</a>. Moreover, in the cited sources on Russian there are no allegations of Politkovskaya that people were detained because of their religion, while Biophys inserted these claims into the passage dedicated to the freedom of religion, which is evidently is not appropriate.</p>
<p>I would like to bring your attention, that I have never deleted the information which was contributed by users Biophys and Colchicum. And their claims about Stalking are actually turn everything upside down, since I do not follow tremendous number of their articles. And claims about me pursuing Colchicum are absurd, since actually he first began harassing me (Mediation case page on Boris Stomakhin) by writing everywhere about my two acknowledged mistakes, thereby violating the Wikipedia rule that editors do not discuss personalities and discuss the articles and sources.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_VF_on_the_underlying_problem_of_the_Albats_notice_3e2d.html" title="Edit section: 3)Allegations of uncivil behaviour.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">3)<b>Allegations of uncivil behaviour</b>.</span></h3>
<p>I would like to notice that in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Russian_sentiment#La_Russophob" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Russian_sentiment#La_Russophob" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anti-Russian_sentiment#La_Russophob</a>, Biophys behaved himself incivil, and I never wished him to die actually. Biophys wrote 'Just imagine that Putin suddenly dies. What will change in Russia?'. Considering that Biophys wrote offensively in regard of Putin, I have responded the following way: 'The same would be in Russia if Biophys would die too'. I don't find such exchange to be offensive, since Biophys first began 'death' assumptions.</p>
<p>This situation also concerns attepmts of Biophys to introduce defamatory claims of Russian journalist who was sentenced for his libelous and defamatory claims in regard of Putin into the article on [Phallus] cur <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phallus&amp;diff=103190052&amp;oldid=103041322" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phallus&amp;diff=103190052&amp;oldid=103041322" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Moreover, in order to abuse Putin he published this material deleted from the articles on <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Putin_50b8.html" title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phallus.html" title="Phallus">Phallus</a> on his personal talk page, as well as his deleted article on the blog La Russophobe.</p>
<p>Later in order to hide information compromising him he deleted this material <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Biophys&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107095030" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Biophys&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107095030" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Biophys&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=107095030</a> the edit which he called clean-up.</p>
<p>Moreover, Biophys openly hinted on me as an agent of KGB working in the internet here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Further_actions" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Stomakhin#Further_actions" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. He called me a troll on my talk page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AVlad_fedorov&amp;diff=106849885&amp;oldid=106512675" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AVlad_fedorov&amp;diff=106849885&amp;oldid=106512675" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> and therefore personaly attacked me too.</p>
<p>Even now User Biophys maintains speculatory article about FSB brigades working in the internet on his talk page in order to send the message to and to harass everyone who has POV different from his. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Biophys" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Biophys" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Biophys</a>.</p>

<p>User Biophys and user Colchicum wage false accusations camapaign against me in order to punish me for presenting my POV in the articles which they feel are important for them. In order to disrupt my work, intimidate and harrass me, they accuse me of violating virtually everything in the Wikipedia and persistently publish their accusations on Administrators Incident Noticeboard, 3RR noticeboard, BPL noticeboard. They persistently complain to the administrators urging them to punish me. All this is done with one goal - to silence individuals having other opinion, to punish those who correct their intentional mistakes and malicious disinformation.</p>
<p>I would like to bring to the attention that all of the disputes cited in the accusations of Biophys and Colchicum were published on the respective noticeboards and administrators pages. The problem is that no one has directly ruled that Biophys and Colchicum accuse me falsely. The issues which they complain here were taken by the administrator Alex Bakharev on his talk page.</p>
<p>Users Biophys and Colchicum actual reason for my public prosection is that I present the point of view they personally dislike and do not tolerate. There is no any evidence that I disrupt their work by creating annoyance or distress. It is my POV that creates 'annoyance or distress' for Biophys and Colchicum.</p>
<p>As could also be seen, users Biophys and Colchicum never tried to resolve any disputes with me. All they have done is false accusations and deletions of my contributions to the respective articles.</p>
<p>I would like to ask anyone here in Wikipedia to review all the pertinent materials to this dispute in detail, and not to consider surface accusations of the users who brought the complain against me. I could be contacted any time on my talk page and could provide any information that is needed to handle this case or others in which I am involved.</p>
<p>I would also like anyone here to ask the administrators <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_Bakharev_88ab.html" title="User:Alex Bakharev">User:Alex Bakharev</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">User:Mikkalai</a>, about these disputes, since they were observing this dispute from its very beginning and were themselves editing the articles on which this duo complains.</p>

<p>I beg anyone competent to take measures in order to stop users Biophys and Colchicum from persistent and continued campaign waged by them against me. I am not a witch and Wikipedia is not a witch trial place. If they couldn't tolerate opinion of other users and if they can't held disputes over the edits by means other than Complaints, then should create their own ecyclopedia where they could do whatever they want without other users disturbing them by other point of views.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 17:07, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
