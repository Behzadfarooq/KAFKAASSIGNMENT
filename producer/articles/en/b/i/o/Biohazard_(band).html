<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Biohazard_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h3>
<p>The band formed in 1987 amongst an intense <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> atmosphere, resulting in their writing of equally intense music. The original lineup consisted of bassist/vocalist <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evan_Seinfeld_f1d0.html" title="Evan Seinfeld">Evan Seinfeld</a>, guitarist Bobby Hambel, and drummer Anthony Meo. Guitarist/vocalist Billy Graziadei would join the band soon after, changing the three-piece to a four-piece. Their first demo tape, released in 1988, caused a stir with journalists who felt that the band's lyrics displayed certain <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascist</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacy.html" title="White supremacy">white supremacist</a> views, ignoring the fact that both Seinfeld and Schuler, themselves, were Jewish. The accusations of racism in their music were something strenuously denied by the band, but in later interviews, Seinfeld and Graziadei explained that it had all been a publicity stunt to win over the band <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnivore_%28band%29.html" title="Carnivore (band)">Carnivore</a> and their fans. Eventually, the songs in question were no longer played or even mentioned and the band began preaching an unbreaking message of tolerance and anti-racism. After the release of their demo, Anthony Meo left the band and drummer Danny Schuler stepped in to replace him. A second demo tape would follow, in 1989.</p>
<p>While never completely considering themselves a <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore</a> band, Biohazard often found themselves sharing stages with bands associated with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_hardcore_5c52.html" title="New York hardcore">New York hardcore</a> scene, such as the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cro-Mags_c50c.html" title="Cro-Mags">Cro-Mags</a> and <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_Front_c9dd.html" title="Agnostic Front">Agnostic Front</a>. They would also share stages with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_hardcore_2628.html" title="New Jersey hardcore">New Jersey hardcore</a> band, <a href="../../../m/u/c/Mucky_Pup_84a3.html" title="Mucky Pup">Mucky Pup</a>, quite often and a friendship between the two bands developed. Mucky Pup became a strong supporter of Biohazard and would often book them as an opening act, but many of the clubs would refuse to let Biohazard play, thinking the shows would lead to violence. As a result, Mucky Pup would resort to sneaking them on stage to perform a few songs before their own set.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Biohazard_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: Maze Records">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Maze Records</span></h3>
<p>In 1990, Biohazard signed a recording contract with Maze Records. The <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biohazard_%28album%29.html" title="Biohazard (album)">self-titled album</a> was poorly promoted by the label yet still sold over 40,000 copies. The content of the album was about Brooklyn, the gang-wars, drugs and violence. The band went on their first European tour and when they returned, they realized that the problems they sang about on their first record, were not limited to their Brooklyn hometown.</p>
<p>One year after the release of their debut album, Seinfeld and Graziadei contributed vocals to the song, "Three Dead Gophers," from <a href="../../../m/u/c/Mucky_Pup_84a3.html" title="Mucky Pup">Mucky Pup</a>'s third album, <i>Now</i>. The album was released on <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadrunner_Records_7496.html" title="Roadrunner Records">Roadrunner Records</a>, who would soon release Biohazard's second album.</p>

<p>In 1992, Biohazard signed to <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadrunner_Records_7496.html" title="Roadrunner Records">Roadrunner Records</a> and released <i><a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Discipline_5a63.html" title="Urban Discipline">Urban Discipline</a>.</i> The album gave the band national and worldwide attention in both the heavy metal and hardcore communities. Their video for the song "Punishment," became the most played video in the history of <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a>'s <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headbanger%27s_Ball_97ea.html" title="Headbanger's Ball">Headbanger's Ball</a> and the album sold over 1,000,000 copies. The band also began opening for larger acts such as <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Of_Pain_d088.html" title="House Of Pain">House Of Pain</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sick_Of_It_All_39e8.html" title="Sick Of It All">Sick Of It All</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishbone.html" title="Fishbone">Fishbone</a> and <a href="../../../k/y/u/Kyuss.html" title="Kyuss">Kyuss</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, several former members of <a href="../../../m/u/c/Mucky_Pup_84a3.html" title="Mucky Pup">Mucky Pup</a> had formed the band <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_Eat_Dog_%28band%29_83e3.html" title="Dog Eat Dog (band)">Dog Eat Dog</a>. Biohazard had continued their friendship with these members and began to share the stage with Dog Eat Dog. While touring Europe, Graziadei gave a <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_Eat_Dog_%28band%29_83e3.html" title="Dog Eat Dog (band)">Dog Eat Dog</a> <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demo_%28music%29.html" title="Demo (music)">demo tape</a> to a Roadracer Records representative. At the time, Roadracer was the European sister label to Roadrunner Records. The tape was sent back to the New York office of Roadrunner Records who then sent representatives to several Dog Eat Dog shows. As a result, Dog Eat Dog signed their first record deal with the label.</p>
<p>In 1993, the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_rap.html" title="Hardcore rap">hardcore rap</a> group, <a href="../../../o/n/y/Onyx_%28band%29.html" title="Onyx (band)">Onyx</a>, recorded an alternate "Bionyx" version of their hit single, "Slam," with Biohazard as their backup band. This led to a collaboration for the title track of the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judgment_Night_%28film%29_dde5.html" title="Judgment Night (film)">Judgment Night</a> soundtrack. The soundtrack would go on to sell over 2,000,000 copies in the United States.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Biohazard_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: Warner Bros.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Warner Bros.</span></h3>
<p>Months later, the band would leave <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadrunner_Records_7496.html" title="Roadrunner Records">Roadrunner Records</a> in order to sign with <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Bros._Records_a338.html" title="Warner Bros. Records">Warner Brothers Records Inc.</a> and release their third studio LP <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_the_World_Address_7e20.html" title="State of the World Address">State of the World Address</a></i>. The album was produced by Ed Stasium in Los Angeles and contained the single, "How It Is" featuring Sen-Dog from <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cypress_Hill_e211.html" title="Cypress Hill">Cypress Hill</a>, for which a video was also shot. During their 1994 tour, the band made an appearance on the second stage at the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monsters_of_Rock_4b1f.html" title="Monsters of Rock">Monsters of Rock</a> festival held at <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle_Donington_5d1e.html" title="Castle Donington">Castle Donington</a>. The <i>State Of The World Address</i> album went on to sell over 1,000,000 copies and <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a> magazine selected the Biohazard logo as the best logo of the year. <i>State Of The World Address</i> was the last Biohazard album featuring Bobby Hambel due to differences with the rest of the band. Hambel would spend time in White Devil, also featuring members of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cro-Mags_c50c.html" title="Cro-Mags">Cro-Mags</a>, before seemingly leaving the music business behind.</p>
<p>The band recorded their fourth studio album, <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Mata_Leao_5ae8.html" title="Mata Leao">Mata Leao</a></i>, as a three piece in 1995. It was produced with the help of Dave Jerden. For the 1996 Mata Leao Tour, the band hired former <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helmet_%28band%29.html" title="Helmet (band)">Helmet</a> guitarist, Rob Echeverria.</p>
<p>While touring Europe in support of the Mata Leao album, the band recorded their Hamburg, Germany show for their first live album, <i><a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Holds_Barred_%28album%29_d260.html" title="No Holds Barred (album)">No Holds Barred</a> (Live in Europe)</i>. It was released in 1997 through their former label, <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadrunner_Records_7496.html" title="Roadrunner Records">Roadrunner Records</a>.</p>
<p>In 1998, <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evan_Seinfeld_f1d0.html" title="Evan Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a> began his acting career playing <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jaz_Hoyt_bfd0.html" title="Jaz Hoyt">Jaz Hoyt</a> on <a href="../../../h/b/o/HBO_509e.html" title="HBO">HBO</a>'s award winning series <i><a href="../../../o/z/_/OZ_%28TV_series%29_6441.html" title="OZ (TV series)">Oz</a></i>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Biohazard_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: Mercury Records">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mercury Records</span></h3>
<p>The band signed to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_Records_6082.html" title="Mercury Records">Mercury Records</a> and released their fifth studio album, titled <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_Disorder_%28Album%29_dc1c.html" title="New World Disorder (Album)">New World Disorder</a></i> in 1999. Once again, the band used Ed Stasium, as a producer. Their relationship with Mercury Records, soured quickly. The band felt betrayed and misunderstood by their label and as a result, severed their ties with the label amidst the merger of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_Records_6082.html" title="Mercury Records">Mercury Records</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Records_88d9.html" title="Island Records">Island Records</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/f/Def_Jam_Records_c977.html" title="Def Jam Records">Def Jam Records</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygram.html" title="Polygram">Polygram</a> into the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Music_Group_a819.html" title="Universal Music Group">Universal Music Group</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Biohazard_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: Independent again">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Independent again</span></h3>
<p>In 2000, the band continued to tour Europe and Japan, without the support of a record label or management. In 2001, the band released a compilation album titled <i><a href="../../../t/a/l/Tales_From_The_B-Side_c597.html" title="Tales From The B-Side">Tales From The B-Side</a></i>. The album consisted of various B-sides and remixes from various eras in the band's recording history. The album was released by the Phantom Sound &amp; Vision label. After the release of <i>Tales From The B-Side</i>, Rob Echeverria resigned from the band in order to get married. Leo Curley, of Outline and All Means Necessary, was hired as his replacement.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Biohazard_%28band%29.html" title="Edit section: SPV/Sanctuary Records">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SPV/Sanctuary Records</span></h3>
<p>In the same year, Biohazard signed two new record deals with SPV/Steamhammer in Europe and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanctuary_Records_a4aa.html" title="Sanctuary Records">Sanctuary Records</a> for the remainder of the world. Despite the new record deals, the band took some personal time in order to work on other projects.</p>
<p>Graziadei briefly formed a <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trip_hop.html" title="Trip hop">trip hop</a> project with Jennifer Bair of the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> band, Hilo. After writing and recording approximately 20 songs for the project, named Blu, Bair relocated to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a> to continue an art career and the project dissolved. Graziadei also began work a book project titled, <i>Tales From The Hardside</i>. Schuler used his downtime to join New York band, Among Thieves as a replacement drummer for the departing Will Shepler.</p>
<p>Graziadei and Schuler also collaborated in transforming the band's rehearsal <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> studio, into a digital recording studio, known as Rat Piss Studios. Re-investing into the band, Graziadei and Schuler honed their engineering and productions skills while recording and producing local acts and new Biohazard demos. The band then undertook the process of writing, recording and producing their own music.</p>
<p>Their studio work would lead to the band's first sixth studio album, titled <i><a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncivilization.html" title="Uncivilization">Uncivilization</a></i>, released in September of 2001. The album features many guest appearances by members of bands, such as <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_Front_c9dd.html" title="Agnostic Front">Agnostic Front</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatebreed.html" title="Hatebreed">Hatebreed</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantera.html" title="Pantera">Pantera</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipknot_%28band%29.html" title="Slipknot (band)">Slipknot</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepultura.html" title="Sepultura">Sepultura</a>, <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cypress_Hill_e211.html" title="Cypress Hill">Cypress Hill</a>, Skarhead and <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type_O_Negative_7d60.html" title="Type O Negative">Type O Negative</a>. Shortly after the release of <i>Uncivilization</i>, Leo Curley decided to leave the band in order to focus on writing his own music. He was replaced by former Nucleus member Carmine Vincent who had previously toured with Biohazard as part of their road crew.</p>
<p>In 2002, Seinfeld was engaged to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Porn_star.html" title="Porn star">porn star</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tera_Patrick_b0a7.html" title="Tera Patrick">Tera Patrick</a>. Patrick had never heard of Seinfeld until she saw one of his nude scenes on <i><a href="../../../o/z/_/OZ_%28TV_series%29_6441.html" title="OZ (TV series)">Oz</a></i>. After making several phone calls, Patrick was able to contact Seinfeld, who had never heard of her either, and the two began dating.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the band had to cancel scheduled European festival dates when Carmine Vincent underwent major surgery. The band did manage to find a temporary guitarist, Scott Roberts of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cro-Mags_c50c.html" title="Cro-Mags">Cro-Mags</a>, in time to join the Eastpak Resistance Tour with <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_Front_c9dd.html" title="Agnostic Front">Agnostic Front</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatebreed.html" title="Hatebreed">Hatebreed</a>, Discipline, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Threat_7158.html" title="Death Threat">Death Threat</a> and Born From Pain. Also participating in the tour was All Boro Kings, a band consisting of old friends from both <a href="../../../m/u/c/Mucky_Pup_84a3.html" title="Mucky Pup">Mucky Pup</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_Eat_Dog_%28band%29_83e3.html" title="Dog Eat Dog (band)">Dog Eat Dog</a>.</p>
<p>Biohazard completed their seventh studio album in seventeen days. It was titled <i><a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill_Or_Be_Killed_9f99.html" title="Kill Or Be Killed">Kill Or Be Killed</a></i>, and was released in 2003. Originally titled, <i>Never Forget, Never Forgive</i>, the band made a last minuted decision to change the name and artwork of the album. While touring North America with <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kittie.html" title="Kittie">Kittie</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brand_New_Sin_a21b.html" title="Brand New Sin">Brand New Sin</a> and <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighteen_Visions_9504.html" title="Eighteen Visions">Eighteen Visions</a>, Biohazard announced that Roberts would remain as their permanent guitarist. The tour was curtailed when it was announced that <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evan_Seinfeld_f1d0.html" title="Evan Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a> had fallen ill.</p>
<p>With more downtime, due to Seinfeld's illness, Graziadei and Schuler collaborated to mix <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_Of_Agony_7c1d.html" title="Life Of Agony">Life Of Agony</a>'s live comeback album, <i>River Runs Again: Live 2003</i>. Once Seinfeld was healthy again, the band toured <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> and North America, headlining over bands such as <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatebreed.html" title="Hatebreed">Hatebreed</a>, <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic_Front_c9dd.html" title="Agnostic Front">Agnostic Front</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/r/Throwdown.html" title="Throwdown">Throwdown</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_Blown_Chaos_6cd3.html" title="Full Blown Chaos">Full Blown Chaos</a>.</p>
<p>Once home, Seinfeld began recording and circulating demos, for his own <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trip_hop.html" title="Trip hop">trip hop</a> project, named Triplesicks. For a brief time, Graziadei and his wife moved to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> where their daughter would be born. While there, Graziadei struck up a friendship with drummer, Fernandao Schafer. After jamming together in the studio, Schafer formed the band Ink which Graziadei would eventually join. It wasn't long before Ink was renamed Endrah and an EP titled <i>DEMONstration</i> was released. Once Graziadei returned to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, the logistical problems of traveling back and forth, caused Graziadei to quit Endrah.</p>
<p>In early 2004, Graziadei, Schuler and Roberts would team up with <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabber_music.html" title="Gabber music">gabber</a> DJ, Rob Gee, <a href="../../../d/j/_/DJ_Starscream_8862.html" title="DJ Starscream">DJ Starscream</a> (aka <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sid_Wilson_6fdd.html" title="Sid Wilson">Sid Wilson</a> of <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipknot_%28band%29.html" title="Slipknot (band)">Slipknot</a>), Jeff Anthony and Keith Rooney, both of Gutwrench, to form <a href="http://www.amptup.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.amptup.com/" rel="nofollow">Ampt</a>. The band combined <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabber_music.html" title="Gabber music">gabber</a> music with <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore</a> and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal</a> to create their sound. After writing several songs and putting together a live band, Graziadei and Schuler left the project in order to continue with Biohazard. Ampt has gone through several additional lineup changes since.</p>
<p>Also in 2004, Seinfeld, now residing in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>, married his fiance of two years, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tera_Patrick_b0a7.html" title="Tera Patrick">Tera Patrick</a>. Using the alias Spyder Jones, Seinfeld has since starred with Patrick in several adult movies, including <i>Desperate</i> and <i>Reign of Tera</i>, which he also directed.</p>
<p>By the end of 2004, the band had begun recording its eighth studio album <i><a href="../../../m/e/a/Means_To_An_End_207c.html" title="Means To An End">Means To An End</a></i>. Unfortunately, the completed album was completely lost in a studio disaster forcing the band to completely re-record the album which was released in August of 2005.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Graziadei had formed another new band with former members of <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kittie.html" title="Kittie">Kittie</a> and The Groovenics. Originally named Rodek, the band would eventually change their name to Suicide City. In October of 2005, Graziadei announced that <i>Means To An End</i> had been the final Biohazard album and that he would continue playing with Suicide City as his main focus. One month later, on the Biohazard website, it was announced that there would in fact be a 2006 Biohazard tour.</p>
<p>On December 15th, Seinfeld and Graziadei participated with the <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadrunner_United_8aba.html" title="Roadrunner United">Roadrunner United</a> conglomerate at the Nokia Theater in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> for an all star event. The show opened with Biohazard's "Punishment," performed by Seinfeld, Graziadei, <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sepultura.html" title="Sepultura">Sepultura</a>'s <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andreas_Kisser_e5d3.html" title="Andreas Kisser">Andreas Kisser</a>, former <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fear_Factory_049b.html" title="Fear Factory">Fear Factory</a> member <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dino_Cazares_fcff.html" title="Dino Cazares">Dino Cazares</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slipknot_%28band%29.html" title="Slipknot (band)">Slipknot</a>'s <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joey_Jordison_61e9.html" title="Joey Jordison">Joey Jordison</a>.</p>
<p>In January of 2006, Danny Schuler announced his resignation from Biohazard and the formation of Bloodclot featuring vocalist Jon Josef of the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cro-Mags_c50c.html" title="Cro-Mags">Cro-Mags</a>, guitarist Scott Roberts and bassist Craig Setari of <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sick_of_it_All_68c4.html" title="Sick of it All">Sick of it All</a>. As a result of Schuler's resignation, Roberts announced that he would also be leaving the band to focus on Bloodclot with Schuler. That same month, Graziadei announced that Biohazard would not participate in a farewell tour, after all <a href="http://www.metalisrael.com/?p=113" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.metalisrael.com/?p=113" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Graziadei and Schuler have since relocated their recording studio to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Amboy%2C_New_Jersey_30b3.html" title="South Amboy, New Jersey">South Amboy, New Jersey</a> and have renamed it Underground Sound Studios. The studio has undergone renovations in order to include a live room with 20 foot ceilings and 4,000 square feet of studio space.</p>
<p>In February of 2006, Seinfeld participated in the filming of <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/SuperGroup_bcdb.html" title="SuperGroup">SuperGroup</a></i>, a <a href="../../../v/h/-/VH-1_ba5a.html" title="VH-1">VH-1</a> reality television series also starring <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Nugent_d690.html" title="Ted Nugent">Ted Nugent</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Ian_cb71.html" title="Scott Ian">Scott Ian</a> of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthrax_%28band%29.html" title="Anthrax (band)">Anthrax</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebastian_Bach_beb1.html" title="Sebastian Bach">Sebastian Bach</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Bonham_3a65.html" title="Jason Bonham">Jason Bonham</a> of Bonham, UFO and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreigner_%28band%29.html" title="Foreigner (band)">Foreigner</a> as a band named Damnocracy. The show debuted on May 21, 2006. Seinfeld continues to work with his wife, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tera_Patrick_b0a7.html" title="Tera Patrick">Tera Patrick</a>, in adult entertainment. In 2005, they launched the Tera Patrick Agency with the goal of representing talent in both the adult and mainstream entertainment business.</p>
<p>A Biohazard DVD was released in early 2006.</p>
<p>In March of 2007, Evan Seinfeld debuted his new band, The Spyderz (originally named White Line Fever, until finding out that there was a UK band of the same name). They are gearing up for a tour with Buckcherry.</p>
