<p>In <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioinformatics.html" title="Bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a>, a <b><a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequence_alignment.html" title="Sequence alignment">sequence alignment</a></b> is a way of arranging the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_sequence.html" title="Primary sequence">primary sequences</a> of <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a>, <a href="../../../r/n/a/RNA_78c4.html" title="RNA">RNA</a>, or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protein.html" title="Protein">protein</a> to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional, <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structural_biology.html" title="Structural biology">structural</a>, or <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> relationships between the sequences. Aligned sequences of <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nucleotide.html" title="Nucleotide">nucleotide</a> or <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amino_acid.html" title="Amino acid">amino acid</a> residues are typically represented as rows within a <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matrix.html" title="Matrix">matrix</a>. Gaps are inserted between the residues so that residues with identical or similar characters are aligned in successive columns.</p>
<p>If two sequences in an alignment share a common ancestor, mismatches can be interpreted as <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_mutation.html" title="Point mutation">point mutations</a> and gaps as <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indel.html" title="Indel">indels</a> (that is, insertion or deletion mutations) introduced in one or both lineages in the time since they diverged from one another. In protein sequence alignment, the degree of similarity between <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amino_acid.html" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a> occupying a particular position in the sequence can be interpreted as a rough measure of how <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservation_%28genetics%29.html" title="Conservation (genetics)">conserved</a> a particular region or <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequence_motif.html" title="Sequence motif">sequence motif</a> is among lineages. The absence of substitutions, or the presence of only very conservative substitutions (that is, the substitution of amino acids whose <a href="../../../s/i/d/Side_chain.html" title="Side chain">side chains</a> have similar biochemical properties) in a particular region of the sequence, suggest that this region has structural or functional importance. Although DNA and RNA <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nucleotide.html" title="Nucleotide">nucleotide</a> bases are more similar to each other than to amino acids, the conservation of <a href="../../../b/a/s/Base_pair.html" title="Base pair">base pairing</a> can indicate a similar functional or structural role. Sequence alignment can be used for non-biological sequences, such as identifying similarities in a series of letters and words present in human <a href="../../../l/a/n/Language.html" title="Language">language</a>.</p>
<p>Very short or very similar sequences can be aligned by hand; however, most interesting problems require the alignment of lengthy, highly variable or extremely numerous sequences that cannot be aligned solely by human effort. Instead, human knowledge is primarily applied in constructing algorithms to produce high-quality sequence alignments, and occasionally in adjusting the final results to reflect patterns that are difficult to represent algorithmically (especially in the case of nucleotide sequences). Computational approaches to sequence alignment generally fall into two categories: <i>global alignments</i> and <i>local alignments</i>. Calculating a global alignment is a form of <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_optimization.html" title="Global optimization">global optimization</a> that "forces" the alignment to span the entire length of all query sequences. By contrast, local alignments identify regions of similarity within long sequences that are often widely divergent overall. Local alignments are often preferable, but can be more difficult to calculate because of the additional challenge of identifying the regions of similarity. A variety of computational algorithms have been applied to the sequence alignment problem, including slow but formally optimizing methods like <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamic_programming.html" title="Dynamic programming">dynamic programming</a> and efficient <a href="../../../h/e/u/Heuristic.html" title="Heuristic">heuristic</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Probability.html" title="Probability">probabilistic</a> methods designed for large-scale database search.</p>

Excellent fossilised forms of the <i>Tiktaalik</i>, which is generally described as the fish that evolved from water dweller to land dweller, were found in 2004 on <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellesmere_Island_51ad.html" title="Ellesmere Island">Ellesmere Island</a> in <a href="../../../n/u/n/Nunavut.html" title="Nunavut">Nunavut</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>.</p>
<p>It lived approximately 375 million years ago. Paleontologists suggest that <i>Tiktaalik</i> was an intermediate form between fish such as <i><a href="../../../p/a/n/Panderichthys.html" title="Panderichthys">Panderichthys</a></i>, which lived about 385 million years ago and early tetrapods such as <i><a href="../../../a/c/a/Acanthostega.html" title="Acanthostega">Acanthostega</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../i/c/h/Ichthyostega.html" title="Ichthyostega">Ichthyostega</a></i> that lived about 20 million years later.

<p><a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesch-Nyhan_syndrome_fe4e.html" title="Lesch-Nyhan syndrome">Lesch-Nyhan syndrome</a> (LNS) is a rare, <a href="../../../i/n/h/Inherited_disorder.html" title="Inherited disorder">inherited disorder</a> caused by a deficiency of the <a href="../../../e/n/z/Enzyme.html" title="Enzyme">enzyme</a> <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypoxanthine-guanine_phosphoribosyltransferase.html" title="Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase">hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase</a> (HPRT). LNS is an X-linked recessive disease: the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene.html" title="Gene">gene</a> is carried by the mother and passed on to her son. LNS is present at <a href="../../../c/h/i/Childbirth.html" title="Childbirth">birth</a> in baby boys. Patients have severe mental and physical problems throughout life. The lack of HPRT causes a build-up of <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uric_acid.html" title="Uric acid">uric acid</a> (<i>pictured</i>) in all body fluids, and leads to symptoms such as severe <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gout.html" title="Gout">gout</a>, poor muscle control, and moderate <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_retardation.html" title="Mental retardation">mental retardation</a>, which appear in the first year of life. A striking feature of LNS is <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-harm.html" title="Self-harm">self-mutilating</a> behaviors, characterized by lip and finger biting, that begin in the second year of life. Abnormally high uric acid levels can cause sodium urate crystals to form in the <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint.html" title="Joint">joints</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidney.html" title="Kidney">kidneys</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_nervous_system.html" title="Central nervous system">central nervous system</a> and other tissues of the body, leading to gout-like swelling in the joints and severe kidney problems. Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntington%27s_disease.html" title="Huntington's disease">Huntington's disease</a>. The direct cause of the neurological abnormalities remains unknown. Because a lack of HPRT causes the body to poorly utilize <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitamin_B12_68e6.html" title="Vitamin B12">vitamin B12</a>, some boys may develop a rare disorder called <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megaloblastic_anemia.html" title="Megaloblastic anemia">megaloblastic anemia</a>.</p>
<p>The symptoms caused by the buildup of uric acid (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthritis.html" title="Arthritis">arthritis</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renal.html" title="Renal">renal</a> symptoms) respond well to treatment with drugs such as <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allopurinol.html" title="Allopurinol">allopurinol</a> that reduce the levels of uric acid in the blood. The mental deficits and self-mutilating behavior do not respond to treatment. There is no cure, but many patients live to adulthood. LNS is rare, affecting about one in 380,000 live births. It was first described in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_in_science.html" title="1964 in science">1964</a> by Dr. Michael Lesch and Dr. William Nyhan.</p>

The energy used by human cells requires the <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrolysis.html" title="Hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> of 200 to 300 moles of ATP daily. This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 2000 to 3000 times during a single day. ATP cannot be stored, hence its consumption must closely follow its synthesis.

In human cells, both normal <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metabolic.html" title="Metabolic">metabolic</a> activities and environmental factors (such as <a href="../../../u/v/_/UV_deaa.html" title="UV">UV</a> radiation) can cause <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a> damage, resulting in as many as 500,000 individual <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molecular_lesion.html" title="Molecular lesion">molecular lesions</a> per cell per day. These lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule, and can dramatically alter the cell's way of reading the information encoded in its <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene.html" title="Gene">genes</a>. Consequently, the DNA repair process must be constantly operating, to correct rapidly any damage in the DNA structure.</p>
<p>As cells age, however, the rate of DNA repair decreases until it can no longer keep up with ongoing DNA damage. The cell then suffers one of three possible fates: an irreversible state of dormancy (<a href="../../../s/e/n/Senescence.html" title="Senescence">senescence</a>), cell suicide (<a href="../../../a/p/o/Apoptosis.html" title="Apoptosis">apoptosis</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programmed_cell_death.html" title="Programmed cell death">programmed cell death</a>), or <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>. Most cells in the body become senescent. Then, after irreparable DNA damage, apoptosis occurs. In this case, apoptosis functions as a "last resort" mechanism to prevent a cell from becoming tumorigenic and endangering the organism. When cells become senescent, alterations in biosynthesis and turnover cause them to function less efficiently, which inevitably causes <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disease.html" title="Disease">disease</a>. The DNA repair ability of a cell is vital to the integrity of its genome and thus to its normal functioning and that of the organism.

<p><b><a href="../../../s/y/n/Synapses.html" title="Synapses">Synapses</a></b> are specialized junctions through which cells of the <a href="../../../n/e/r/Nervous_system.html" title="Nervous system">nervous system</a> signal to one another and to non-neuronal cells such as <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscle.html" title="Muscle">muscles</a> or <a href="../../../g/l/a/Gland.html" title="Gland">glands</a>. Synapses form the circuits in which the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuron.html" title="Neuron">neurons</a> of the central nervous system interconnect. They are thus crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They also provide the means through which the nervous system connects to and controls the other systems of the body.</p>
<p>At a prototypical synapse, such as a <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dendritic_spine.html" title="Dendritic spine">dendritic spine</a>, a mushroom-shaped bud projects from each of two cells and the caps of these buds press flat against one another. At this interface, the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_membrane.html" title="Biological membrane">membranes</a> of the two cells flank each other across a slender gap, the narrowness of which enables signaling molecules known as <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurotransmitter.html" title="Neurotransmitter">neurotransmitters</a> to pass rapidly from one cell to the other by <a href="../../../d/i/f/Diffusion.html" title="Diffusion">diffusion</a>. This gap is sometimes called the synaptic cleft.<br clear="all" /></p>

Its <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell.html" title="Shell">shell</a> is oblong and has a notable thickness around the middle of the body. The posterior end of the shell has a <a href="../../../s/a/w/Saw.html" title="Saw">saw</a>-like formation, flanged outward like a <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell.html" title="Bell">bell</a>.

The ventral shell is lighter coloured and has pairs of triangular markings with the points facing the rear of the animal. The front sides of the limbs are covered with large <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scale.html" title="Scale">scales</a>. In old <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female.html" title="Female">female</a> specimens, the rear flaps of the underside of the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastron.html" title="Plastron">plastron</a> are somewhat moveable. The <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tail.html" title="Tail">tail</a> is notable for a lengthwise marking and for an undivided carapace over the tail. <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male.html" title="Male">Males</a> have a longer tail, which is thicker at the base than the females. Their underside is more strongly indented. Males are also often larger than the females.
