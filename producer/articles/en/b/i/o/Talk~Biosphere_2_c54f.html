<p>The first time, before you've worked out any of the glitches? Ridiculous.</p>
<p>They would have done well to learn from the American space program. The first flight was Alan Shepard's 15 minute sub-orbital flight, then Gus Grissom's sub-orbital flight, then John Glenn's three orbits, and so on and so forth. (And maybe they could learn from the Russian side as well! But being an American, I'm more familiar with what we did.)</p>
<p>Six weeks might have been an appropriate first run. Then maybe three months or four months for the second one. And this business where we're going to keep going even when people's health is at risk, from not enough food and from low oxygen, that kind of misplaced virtue, is absolutely ridiculous! The whole benefit of doing it here on Earth is that if things start going poorly, you are not stuck halfway to Mars.</p>
<p>And the other benefit of course is greater environmental knowledge, and for that, we would be better served by a number of (smaller?) biospheres and a lot of small- and medium-scale experiments, rather than a few big experiments. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriendlyRiverOtter_238f.html" title="User:FriendlyRiverOtter">FriendlyRiverOtter</a> 08:12, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There were three pilot experiments (or "missions" to be dramatic). They took place in the Test Module, a very much smaller airtight enclosure without any ambition to grow crops or practice animal husbandry. It did have waste recycling, however. John Allen spent 72 hours there, then Abigail Alling spent 5 days, then finally Linda Leigh set a new world record by staying in the TM for 3 weeks. Should this information be in the article? <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuHarris_83b4.html" title="User:StuHarris">El Ingles</a> 14:19, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It was still too big of a jump. And what I really object to is that they kept going when things clearly were not working. I’ve read that at one point a biospherian was on his hands and knees going down a row of plants with a hairdryer, I guess hooked up to an extension cord, blowing insects off of the plants. When things got really bad, they opened up emergency food supplies. Jane Poynter made the project director aware of this situation. And apparently, instead of having an adult-to-adult, reality-based conversation, the director fired Jane and ordered her to come out of the dome, to which Jane refused.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why does this not surprise me! Why does this sound so much like the “public relations” department of a corporation (or better still, the “human resource” department)? Why can’t someone tell the rich guy financing it, hey, these are the facts, it’s not yet a success, it might become a success, but it’s going to take multiple attempts.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It became a protracted limp-along.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Instead . . . let’s pull back, and let’s try something else. We may have found success on the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh attempt.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Jared Diamond states that his colleague was crippled. I’d be pissed too. Like I said before, a misplaced sense of virtue, almost a sense of puritanism that we must keep going regardless of the circumstances.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, break the enclosure, keep working on the dome. Maybe introduce a whole bunch of edible plants, enough diversity so that insect damage is not that big a problem. Or, if that’s not realistic, fix the climate control system where we can live quite happily using food stores thank you very much, and that’s kind of a victory and maybe the way a space flight to Mars would actually work. Afterall, we humans are pretty large animals. Maybe 3-point some odd acres is not near enough.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And yes, I think some of this, and the three pilot studies (“missions” if you prefer, and I’ll happily accept a little drama), should be included in the article. I think one of the advantages of the Internet vs. the printed page is that it’s cheap. We can be long, provided that it’s good. An introductory paragraph, and then we can tell the whole story, including the twists and turns of the human drama. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriendlyRiverOtter_238f.html" title="User:FriendlyRiverOtter">FriendlyRiverOtter</a> 05:03, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe your opinions have some merit but I also believe they have no place in an encyclopedia. The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> sleuths would have it out in a heartbeat. From all I've read, it seems that John Allen and Margret Augustine were hopeless managers. Ed "Moneybags" Bass came to the same conclusion, but tragically much too late. That opinion has no place in the encyclopedia either, although I may look for ways to drop hints. I wrote about the emergency food in the section on Psychology -- it was Chris Helms, PR Director, that Jane Poynter informed, not John Allen. In her book she writes that she feared the news would leak out anyway, and it would be better that Helms was prepared to handle the press over the issue. Augustine accused her of "going to the press with the story", which was absurd. I'll put in the pilot missions stuff later today. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuHarris_83b4.html" title="User:StuHarris">El Ingles</a> 16:18, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone have any more information about Biosphere 2 being sold? When is it being torn down?</p>

<dl>
<dd>I rather doubt it is being torn down. It's reportedly being converted into a planned community; I would imagine the structure is being minimally converted. They probably wouldn't have bought the site if it was going to be torn down, there's probably plenty of land around the area they could have used for a green field site.<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfkeeper_0629.html" title="User:Wolfkeeper">WolfKeeper</a> 02:01, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I took the tour on August 24th and according to the employees, the sale wasn't final yet and the fate of the actual Biosphere 2 area was still up for negotiation. As they described it the main interest was in the 2000 acres (this acreage conflicts with the article) around the site and less the site itself. If it just turns into another wasteful exurb, what a sad footnote to a once promising project. There's already a subdivision in progress on biosphere road leading to the main site. sanderant 20:07, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They are still giving tours as of February 26th 2007 and the guide indicated they were still looking for a buyer for the biosphere. The planned community around the Biosphere were under construction when we were there.Jcplugg 19:25, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't happen to have any reliable sources available at the moment (I wish I did, I'm writing a paper on Biosphere 2 that's due in 3 hours), but while I agree that oxygen levels fell during the first experiment, I don't know if CO2 fell as well. I thought CO2 rose... am I wrong?</p>

<p>I added a link to a computer game called <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosys.html" title="Biosys">Biosys</a> because when I read up on biosphere 2 I recalled the game and thought it was a very fun exercise since you get to play around with your own enclosed biosphere.

<p>I came to this article when I was looking for examples of people claiming to be scientists when they really aren't. Before the first "shut in", I recall that there was an expose about Biosphere 2 in which it was pointed out that many of the degrees claimed by the people working on the project were granted by a school they had set up for themselves.</p>
<p>Beyond any of that, the project had no real scientific purpose. In order for the experiment to work the conclusions would already have to be know. And a failure would leave an almost infinite choice of failure modes, which is just what happened in the end (concrete? microbes? what?). Interviews with "real" biologists noted a large number of problems with the experiment, for instance, many of the land areas appeared to have been picked for no good scientific reason, they simply looked cool. Nor was there any value to the experiment, it's not like we were going to build something like this in space. The article seemed to suggest that it was simply a way for a rich man to spend some money with his friends.</p>
<p>None of this appears in the article. Were these points discredited? Or are they simply not here?</p>

<dd>"Being confined with a small group of one's fellow humans is an unnatural and highly disturbing situation..." Okay - but according to whom?</dd>
<dd>"This is why people go crazy on long sea voyages, why fights and riots break out in prisons, and why normally well-balanced scientists in Antarctic stations take to hoarding food and suspecting the worst of their colleagues."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Does this even happen? Maybe it does -- but how am I going to check for myself? Again -- according to whom?</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The study of this phenomenon is "confined environment psychology", and according to Jane Poynter [2]not nearly enough of it was brought to bear on Biosphere II." My beef with this is the tone -- it reads like a magazine article, not an encyclopedia entry. An alternative wording would be: "Jane Poynter, a researcher during the first mission, has said that the implications of the confined environment on the psychology of the team members was not adequately considered. (reference)"</dd>
<dd>"The rift inside the bubble reflected a rift outside, among those who were supposed to be managing and advising the enterprise. The question was, essentially, "Is Biosphere II a scientific experiment or a business venture&#160;? Or perhaps just an enormous Art Installation?" Again -- according to whom? Has anyone actually asked this question? And what about alternative viewpoints? It's hard to believe there aren't any.</dd>
<dd>"There was a high-powered Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), and they, of course, felt that Biosphere II was about science, or else what were they there for?" Informal, conversational style -- again, not encyclopedic.</dd>
<dd>"The faction that included Poynter felt strongly that they should be making formal proposals for research for the SAC to evaluate. Unfortunately, the other faction included Abigail Alling who was titular director of research inside the bubble, and who sided with John Allen in blocking that move." It was unfortunate? Some people might feel differently -- anyway, that's inherently POV.</dd>
<dd>"On February 14 the entire SAC resigned, and Biosphere II's scientific credibility was gone." Maybe so -- but that's a grand statement and unattributable. It's okay to say "So-and-so said Biosphere II's scientific credibility was gone" (and so-and-so should be someone who is themselves credible and an expert) because that is a factual statement, but the sentence as is is just conjecture. Ms. Poynter's platform is her book; Wikipedia is a collection of verifiable information. As such, Ms. Poynter's assertions don't belong in the article. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhombus_6461.html" title="User:Rhombus">Rhombus</a> 00:55, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Bertrand Russell is a great example of someone who is intellectually honest, but still lets his or her own voice come through, and thus we're able to go on a journey, whether we end up agreeing with him or not. Or most likely, partially agreeing. A good piece of writing gives you something substantial to think about, and to think through on your own.</p>
<p>I question the part at the end: "Ms. Poynter's platform is her book; Wikipedia is a collection of verifiable information. As such, Ms. Poynter's assertions don't belong in the article." So, we're not going to include it at all??? That reminds me of the time my high school was renovated and there was all kinds of problems and all kinds of complaints by students, and the student newspaper did something so bland and timid and plain vanilla that it was just incredible. It was very disappointing (especially to an idealistic teenager!).</p>
<p>So I view it as a (creative?) tension. Yes, we want to be accurate, but we also want to be cutting edge, like I think Diderot and the French encyclopedists were cutting edge.</p>
<p>So, everyone, Please, do your best work! Do not hold yourself back. If you're going to make an assumption, if you're going to go out on an limp intellectually, acknowledge it and then go ahead and do your best work. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriendlyRiverOtter_238f.html" title="User:FriendlyRiverOtter">FriendlyRiverOtter</a> 09:15, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the opinion. I have in fact made one edit already in the direction of more encyclopedicity and I intend to do more next week. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuHarris_83b4.html" title="User:StuHarris">El Ingles</a> 16:54, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>El Ingles, do it however you want, and I think experimentation of all sorts is a good thing. But . . . I like it just the way it is! Your "Psychology" section is much better than the "Mission 2" section. And I generally do not agree with Rhombus's criticisms. For example . . .</dd>

<dd>magazine style: "The study of this phenomenon is "confined environment psychology", and according to Jane Poynter[2] not nearly enough of it was brought to bear on Biosphere II."</dd>

<dd>I prefer magazine style! To me it's far more readable. I can read it once and understand it. I can get with the flow and stay with the flow. I can read far more of this in the same time period and for a longer concentrated period, and get more out of it, than I can with the "encyclopedia style."</dd>

<dd>We can bring Carl Sagan in as an example of a writer who takes on technical and seemingly difficult topics but who does so in a very approachable way.</dd>

<dd>Or this example, someone you love is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. You go to the doctor with them. They want to know, what is the next step, what do I need to start doing from here? A good doctor is going to lay it out. Not to overwhelm your family member, but to start the education process. The doctor might use a few technical terms that you both need to start learning, but it is not going to be a dry, technical, stilted, formalistic conversation. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriendlyRiverOtter_238f.html" title="User:FriendlyRiverOtter">FriendlyRiverOtter</a> 23:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, certainly you can (and should) put your opinions for everyone to see and understand, but the objective of Wikipedia is to be a reliable source of information and, as such, must seek neutrality.</p>
<p>The reason why it must do so is the bias carried by a text written in order to show opinion. The search for neutrality oblies writers to observe and reason with ideas which are not in accordance to their own, generating an approach that is richer, better balanced and closer to the truth.</p>
<p>There is sufficient space for opinion in other types of media and this space must certainly be filled for the sake of freedom and knowledge.</p>
<p>As to the writting style, a more formal text structure is, in my point of view, the best way to cast opinion aside, since emotion put in words is a way to (even unconsciously) hide a non-neutral point of view in a text that shoud be neutral.</p>

<p>A bone-headed decision made by someone in a position of authority, often out of impatience, and everyone else feels compelled to cover up and use language that makes the decision process, and the end result, and what we're measuring, seem okay (often you simply stop measuring the aspects that are not working well). I have experienced how frustrating this is.</p>
<p>I do not have the additional experience of this happening in a confined environment. Does that make that big of a difference? Apparently. It some cases, it apparently does. And studies can address the circumstances of when it's more likely, and when it's less likely. The severe breakdowns, I mean. And the severe alienation. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriendlyRiverOtter_238f.html" title="User:FriendlyRiverOtter">FriendlyRiverOtter</a> 00:28, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
