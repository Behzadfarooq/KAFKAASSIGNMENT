It's obviously unsourced, but I don't know if it's controversial enough to risk a 3RR violation.

<p>Update: New inserts are that he is called a hollocause denier (appears to be a mixup between the conference and the cartoon contest). A flickr.com page is used as source (is that reliable?). Also some cartoons are described as "monsters and as nazis" (the source would be the images themselves, no other source given). // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a> 13:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

BabyDweezil's statements <i>"A sizable amount of this biography is currently sourced to usenet postings"</i> and similar allegations are false; the article's sources include newspaper articles and court documents published by the United States government, which meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Likewise, the statement that one editior <i>" is involved in a rather nasty and abusive flame war with the article's subject"</i> is extremely misleading, since the article's subject is well known <a href="http://www.morningmist.org/nanae/kookfaq.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.morningmist.org/nanae/kookfaq.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.zenatode.org.uk/ian/misc/schwarz.xhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zenatode.org.uk/ian/misc/schwarz.xhtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> for her libelous and <a href="http://www.ahbl.org/notices/barbschwarz.php" class="external text" title="http://www.ahbl.org/notices/barbschwarz.php" rel="nofollow">abusive postings</a> to the Usenet where she attacks anyone and everyone who refuses to accept her delusions as factual accounts, and therefore the subject of the article is involved in "a nasty and abusive flame war" with nearly everyone she encounters <a href="http://www.ahbl.org/notices/barbschwarz.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ahbl.org/notices/barbschwarz.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> on the entire Usenet. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> have stated an intent to <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barbara_Schwarz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108167218|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barbara_Schwarz&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=108167218|" rel="nofollow">"cut down to what notable parts it may have and then perhaps AfD"</a></i> this article, as the subject was the former president of scientology in Germany, and the well documented and well sourced antics of this former scientology leader are, without doubt, an embarressment for the scientology organization. Both editors have claimed an affinity for the scientology organization (and one editor admits being part of it), thus making it difficult to presume they are keeping a NPOV with their interest in the article. The scientology organization is well known for <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/FRL/" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/FRL/" rel="nofollow">harassing those who do not support it</a> and for <a href="http://www.spaink.net/fishman/home.html" class="external text" title="http://www.spaink.net/fishman/home.html" rel="nofollow">attempting to conceal its beliefs and practices from public scrutiny which may be an embarressment to it.</a> Nevertheless, the subject is notable for other reasons besides that involving scientology, and the subject's notability has been discussed at length and on repeated occasions as an examination of the article's Talk page archives will attest. However, I see the actions of these editors as being disruptive and a pro-scientology POV push by removing information from Wikipedia which is factual, well-sourced, and accurate, but embarressing to the scientology organization, and request that editors not involved with this article examine the article's Talk page, and examine the nature of the edits and behavior of <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> on it. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 03:05, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I genuinely feel sorry for her on a personal level, sadly she has by her own actions made herself noteworthy for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Ms. Schwarz has filed a very large amount of FOIA litigation regarding information she believes the government has concerning her life. I wish the circumstances were different, but what sets her apart is the unique reality she accepts as her motivation to litigate. Even more remarkable is that she has done this <i>pro se</i> (representing herself) without a law degree or even full command of written English. I don't mean the latter point to be an insult, it is actually a setback she overcame to make her case anyway. In a society where many citizens question the government's good faith in sharing information, Ms. Schwarz is historical. In my opinion it shows that the government does take FOIA seriously and that it can be abused. The specific circumstances I wish the article didn't have to discuss are her "delusions". It is for that reason I feel the article should be limited to discussing them as the relate to her motivation.</li>
<li>Ms. Schwarz was subjected to a forced deprogramming session. The concept of such practices seems to be a source for debate, and to those interested I think Ms. Schwarz is a relevant topic.</li>
<li>Ms. Schwarz has gained attention due to her posts to several online forums, including a self published autobiographical series on USENET and her hostile behavior to other users. Some editors on the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> page seem to equate this as the only evidence citied for her strange beliefs in regards to the first point. That is not accurate, the main source of information is actually available directly from various government sources. The biography corroborates and expands her legal claims.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that much of the debate about this article comes wholly from either <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">COI concerns</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> is trying to have the article removed because he made a commitment to Ms. Schwarz to do so to spare her embarrassment. This seems to violate some aspects of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> seems to believe the article is an indirect attack on the CoS due to Ms. Schwarz's previous association with the church.</li>

<p>Sure, Anynobody, one final thought. Just remember that "assume good faith" means "expend <b>effort</b> to do so", IMO. If you need to, if it is not coming easily. It means take all those niggling doubts about people's motives and make the <b>effort</b> to set them aside and make the <b>effort</b> to assume good faith. Make the <b>effort</b> to assume that when someone says they will help another with seeing that if the article can go away, they mean that they will put it up for the community to decide if it belongs here, not interfere with the process, and abide by the decision of the community. Make the <b>effort</b> to assume that when someone says Tilman has a conflict of interest, that they believe that Tilman's fighting and ridiculing this person for years on usenet means that he should leave it to neutral editors since he clearly is not neutral on her. And when I say we don't have any proof she was the president of the Church, please make the <b>effort</b> to assume I simply mean that we do this encyclopedia a disservice to rely on usenet rumor that someone with the same common name is the person that filed those FOIA requests. If you read WP:BLP, that is what we are supposed to do, insist on good sources! High quality sources and we have none. Yet some would put in the encyclopedia that the FOIA person was past president, just based on usenet. Maybe she was, I don't know and I don't care (really), it is just we don't have a source. Assume good faith takes <b>work</b>, sometimes, my friend. But it is work worth doing. Otherwise you find yourself going out on limbs attacking people's motives (see <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAM_9e2a.html" title="WP:NAM">WP:NAM</a>, really, read that one all the way through) and avoiding that is the least of the benefits of AGF. The real benefit is a spiritual one but that is a matter of personal belief. I even AGF Tilman that his activities, that I feel are repressive of religious freedom in his own country, are based on his heartfelt beliefs of the "dangers" of these groups and while I think he is as misguided as he no doubt thinks I am, I think we each AGF on the part of the other (though he doesn't like me ribbing him, smile).

<dd><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> I appreciate that you feel my observations about your behavior are incorrect and lack good faith. I I'm willing to admit when I'm wrong, as I have proven when I misunderstood the talk you and <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">User:BabyDweezil</a> had regarding AfD after parring down the article. To that point I'm willing to look at any citations you are willing to show me from your comments and discussions in case I am wrong. Honestly I still AGF on your part in the sense that I don't think you are intentionally giving into the "bias" (for lack of a better term) of feelings for your spirituality. I urge you to take some time and read through your posts. In doing so count how many times you accuse editors of having an agenda with vague comments like this:
<blockquote>
<p><a href="../../../b/a/r/Talk%7EBarbara_Schwarz_ee6c.html#Clean_up_needed" title="Talk:Barbara Schwarz">Talk:Barbara Schwarz#Clean up needed</a> I think I see material in the article that seems to be pushing an agenda by utilizing non-RS sources (usenet) or primary sources. She is not that notable and some "notability" seems to be being manufactured here. --Justanother 04:06, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seriously, <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> I think this is a similar mistake to when you forgot that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> applies to articles just the same as sections of an article.

A media organisation conducted a DNA test of dubious validity (a <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torres_Strait_Islander_abd4.html" title="Torres Strait Islander">Torres Strait Islander</a> was supposedly of European and Asian but not Melanesian ancestry) and presented the results to the subject, as reported in a newspaper <a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,21204450-952,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,21204450-952,00.html" rel="nofollow">story</a>. In this story she is quoted as saying "All I can think of is that probably down the track it eventuated from some war.", but we are not given the precise context of these remarks. Some editors have inserted this material into the biographical article, along with various attempts to ascribe racist views to the subject - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APauline_Hanson&amp;diff=108337617&amp;oldid=108294674" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APauline_Hanson&amp;diff=108337617&amp;oldid=108294674" rel="nofollow">here</a> for discussion. My main problem with this material is that it is of transitory notability - it belongs in a news article but not a biographical article, unless it develops "legs", which a search for follow-up articles shows none. But for BLP purposes, the quote is not well sourced in that we are not given any dialogue or record of conversation, so we cannot tell what, precisely, the subject was responding to. We must depend on the media organisation's own interpretation, and this has been reinterpreted in the attempts to summarise it for the biographical article. --<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 14:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can't see how it has been reinterpreted as you claim. A simple mention of the story is there. Current version of quote: <i>"All I can think of is that probably down the track it eventuated from some war" [and] "rape and pillage" - "But I'm not going to knock it. It has made me who I am." - on discovering the results of a media-sponsored DNA test which claim Ms. Hanson's genetic makeup has 9 per cent originating in the Middle East, 32 per cent from Italy, Greece or Turkey and 59 per cent from northern Europe"</i><a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 15:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For a start, your quote above is confected. Even taking the article at face value she didn't use those words in that order. All the paper tells us is that her words eventually followed "When told of the results, the former fish and chip shop owner appeared flustered...". We are not told of any intervening conversation, and therefore we cannot say to what statement or question, precisely, she was responding. The paper gives one interpretation, and when summarising it for the article you neccessarily reinterpret it. But I am not satisfied that the newspaper, in setting up what is clearly a stunt, has told us the full story. You appear to take the whole thing at face value, but it might be that Ms Hanson was responding to something quite different, perhaps the results of another person, or possibly the methodology of the test. You note that we are not told explicitly that it was her results to which she gave the response. We should be skeptical of media outlets which set up stunts of this nature, because they can misdirect the reader to make for a better story in order to sell more papers. Using such sources without corroboration in a biographical article is unwise or gullible, particularly when the subject is controversial. --<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyring_afb0.html" title="User:Skyring">Pete</a> 16:05, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is not "my" quote. It is (was) how the article sat when you posted here. And if the order bothers you, then change it - it won't change the meaning of the article. I'm sure if it was something you wanted to hear you woudln't be playing games about "interpretations" and "context". I thought our role was NOT to intepret. Furthermore, are you accusing "me" of "reinterpreting" or "taking it at face value". Which one? Furthermore, if sources cannot be summarised for inclusion in WP, then we are in big trouble - any sourced info on WP is likely to be summarised (or paraphrasing?) - do you mean you've never done it? hmm. If the interpretation is the issue then i suggest you offer an alternative.<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 16:14, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's probably worth noting that Pauline Hanson built her political career on views that have often been described as racist, so her own race, and her response to apparently being only mostly white, is notable.

<dd>Quality of source? It happened - no one is pretending it didn't. Yes, it was a media stunt, no is suggesting otherwise, but it got a reaction that is notable - ie, hanson's apparent discomfort with it.

<dd>I read this section and examined the sources used. I don't have a problem with the sources. Wonkette in this case is probably acceptable as this regards an event that occurred in the Blogosphere and the Wonkette writer has knowledge due to previous employment. That being said, the section almost certainly does not belong in the Regnery article at all, since it is too tangential, and adds nothing to our understanding of Regnery. It looks more like part of a vendetta against either Ben Domenech or more likely, Regnery. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 14:11, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for trying to help. The section has been put back in with the reason given being basically that Regnery is an evil, right-wing publisher and anything that can be found that might be negative about it should be included in the article. I don't feel like getting into a fight over it, however. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 02:02, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It reads like just trivial gossip to me. I bet that most publishers have fired editors and other employees for more serious offensives.

<li>Well, I don't think we should jump to conclusions. For all we know, she could be telling the truth. I would suggest that you possibly run <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_checkuser_3b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser">checkuser</a> on both of the people, to get a better sense of whether they're sock puppets. Given those are sockpuppets, you can rule out any possibility of it being either one of those who they say they are. If not, though, then I think the person has a right to take off whatever they don't want on the page about them. It's only right. But I doubt that that is actually Kate Mulgrew. But again, don't just assume. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035"><font color="#0084C9">Jared</font></a></b></sup><sub>┘</sub><sup>┌</sup><sub><i><a href="../../../j/p/0/User_talk%7EJP06035_4c31.html" title="User talk:JP06035"><font color="#009E49">talk</font></a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup>  00:32, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Some of the references you are adding to the article aren't helpful. I'm looking at this edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Burt_Reynolds&amp;diff=109709482&amp;oldid=109707334" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Burt_Reynolds&amp;diff=109709482&amp;oldid=109707334" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Just linking to <a href="http://www.britannica.com" class="external free" title="http://www.britannica.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannica.com</a> or <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/Default.aspx" class="external free" title="http://encarta.msn.com/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/Default.aspx</a> doesn't help. If you used the Burt Reynolds article as a reference, link to that article. The <i>best practice</i> is to link everything inline using {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}}. So you would write something like this:
<dl>
<dd>This is the line I want to cite. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatever|date=whatever|etc...}}&lt;/ref&gt;</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That will appear in the article like this:
<dl>
<dd>This is the line I want to cite. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>And then if you add a &lt;references /&gt; tag to the bottom of the article, everywhere that you have a &lt;ref&gt; link in the article will show up at the bottom. As it is, the IP user is right. Several of the links you have in there just say the same thing. Does that help at all? As it is, the references section just isn't that useful. If you would like an example of an article where inline citations are properly being used, see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>.

<dd>Please note that Alex Bakharev edited the article from which talk show scandal was deleted by <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlgiz_5b54.html" title="User:Ilgiz">User:Ilgiz</a>. Moreover, Alex Bakharev has reintroduced the information according to which father of Albats was a <a href="../../../g/r/u/GRU_d449.html" title="GRU">GRU</a> spy, which was repeatedly deleted by users Biophys and Colchicum. Alex Bakharev version doesn't endorses personal opinion of Biophys and Alex Bakharev doesn't endorsed you empty accusations.<a href="../../../v/l/a/User%7EVlad_fedorov_a7bd.html" title="User:Vlad fedorov">Vlad fedorov</a> 17:07, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are no any evidence that anyone except users Biophys, Colchicum and Ilgiz agree with the version of Biophys. Two other users are collegues of Biophys.</p>
<p>I would like to respond the following to the accusation of Biophys:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, users Biophys and Colchicum never contacted me on a Talk page and tried to resolve the dispute. In fact they just demanded me to stop the editing of the articles. They also never tried to resolve the dispute. They also haven't presented evidence of trying to resolve the dispute with me. Complains to the Administrators noticeboards and false, unsupported accusations of my violations of Wikipedia policies are not a method of resolving the dispute.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Second, they violate 'good faith' obligatory assumption in cliaming that I stalk them. I am a newcomer to the Wikipedia. I was brought to the Wikipedia, because the article on Boris Stomakhin created by Biophys was completely outrageous since it turned everything uspide down. Convicted criminal Stomakhin was presented as a hero, besides his calls to exterminate all Russians, to destroy Russian with atomic explosion, to commit terrorist attacks on Russian civilians.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Third, accusations presented here were already taken up at vurtually every Administrators, incident, 3RR, BLP noticeboards and administrators talk pages. So they just mainly repeat their accusations. I have never received any warnings from administrators, because otherwise they would have gladly published these warnings already here. I was just arbitrarily blocked by non-Russian, English speaking admin William Connolley. This admin, however, later helped me to clarify the points of dispute which I had with Biophys over <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a> article, but unfortunately he left the discussion on the talk page of <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Stomakhin_1a0a.html" title="Boris Stomakhin">Boris Stomakhin</a> article, when the critical decision on the validity of Biophys accusations was needed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fourth, these accusations pursue the goal to harass me and to stop me from contributing another POV into the articles dedicated to Russia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fifth, I also would like to bring all these issues to the arbitration, because the allegations of Biophys and Colchicum that I violate Wikipedia policy by citing reliable sources defame me and are directed not on the sources, but on my person. I would like to have finally a decision of an arbitrator/mediator/administrator that my sources are valid and reliable, the are not contradictory and do not violate anything. The problem is that Biophys claims that every my contribution violates Wikipedia policies. This is a strategy taken by him in order to discredit every introduced material presenting other point of view.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The underlying problem, in my opinion, is the personal dislike of me and revenge of user Biophys against me</b> for the following:</p>

There was a posting to the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AL._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=110367562&amp;oldid=110366576" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AL._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=110367562&amp;oldid=110366576" rel="nofollow">here</a> that I considered gross misuse of the talk page so I deleted it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AL._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=110374345&amp;oldid=110370732" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AL._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=110374345&amp;oldid=110370732" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Now I know that my deletion there may not be supported in policy and that is not what I am asking about. One editor let my deletion slide but another reverted it. I then removed only the part that I thought was an ultra-clear BLP vio, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AL._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=110430596&amp;oldid=110428874" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AL._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=110430596&amp;oldid=110428874" rel="nofollow">here</a> and again, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AL._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=110448462&amp;oldid=110437780" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AL._Ron_Hubbard&amp;diff=110448462&amp;oldid=110437780" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Figured that would be the end of it but one came back with lawyerly stuff and the other that I am just wacked to think that (my words, not his). Am I wacked? On just this point, I mean! Please (laff). I thought that sort of unsupported and wildly derogatory material could not stand, no matter where it appeared. I thought that is what BLP says.

<li><b>Answer</b> - Technically, BLP applies to article space, not the talk page. The comments you cite were not in line with Wikipedia norms in that the talk pages are specifically for the purpose of discussing ways to improve the article, not a blog or forum to voice opinions on celebrities. Feldspar's warning to that effect was an appropriate response to the comments. The comments could be seen as vandalism and removed as not constructive or trolling. But in that case, IMHO, it's better just to ingore them and not encourage the trolls.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 05:08, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi. Thanks for your input. How do you then reconcile this prominent line in BLP
<blockquote>
<p>Unsourced or poorly sourced controversial (negative, positive, or just highly questionable) material about living persons should be removed immediately from Wikipedia articles, <b>talk pages</b>, and user pages. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
--<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 05:18, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Answer</b> - I think the difference is that it is obvious that the comments in question are not presented as biographical information officially sanctioned by Wikipedia and no reasonable person would construe them as such. (That's not a shot at you, I just mean that there's no possibility of litigation as the comments are clearly presented as one editor's opinion and not given as "fact". Nevertheless, I have left a warning on the user's talk page.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 05:28, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks again. That is an interesting take. I can see the logic of it but, I guess that my problem is that it introduces "gray area" into something that should probably have as little gray area as possible. We agree that the comment is inappropriate and it is certainly about a living person but now we have to apply some subjective test as to whether litigation is a factor (IAMNOTALAWYER). This one may have been clear but why add the gray area? <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> does not seem to. And is it only about litigation? Wasn't there something in BLP about feelings? Why would we allow that comment to stand anywhere here? The other problem with leaving such trollish remarks in is that it leads to subtle (or not-so-subtle) enabling of the abusers. Please notice Feldspar's use of the word "our" rather than "your" when describing the trolls claims and opinions. That is a little subtle (and if I misinterpreted from that that Feldspar agrees with the troll then I apologize) but I have seen it much more obvious. My feeling is that such trolls should just be removed and that the BLP aspect just seals the deal. What do you think? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 15:59, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Answer</b> - All good points...and I don't disagree. However, we're now getting into other issues that are better dealt with on more germane pages. I don't feel that this is a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> issue for reasons outlined above. You're right, however, about the "grey area" and that should be discussed on the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy talk page to get more consise language in the policy regarding article talk pages. This is a clear case of trolling and could legitimately be removed as such. However, that's not always the most productive was to handle trolls. As for how to best deal with trolls, see <a href="../../../n/o/f/WP%7ENOFEEDING_69da.html" title="WP:NOFEEDING">WP:NOFEEDING</a> under the subsections "Not feeding the Trolls" and "the value of slow reverts". I am going to remove the comments as trolling and see what happens.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 17:56, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thank you once again and very much this time. It is quite a pleasure and a distinct change to have my ideas and concerns addressed with respect and not as "fantastical, <i>bizarre</i>". I am not even saying that my idea of the application of BLP was correct, simply that, IMO, it is not really that much of a stretch from the words and intent of BLP, though perhaps going a bit into "uncharted territory". I will look forward to any discussion of this on the policy talk page and may well start one myself at a later time. Thank you again for your help. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 20:00, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

He hasn't played professionally since, and has gone downhill rapidly and been arrested for drug use. Various anonymous IPs in the 192.88.124 range have been attempting to insert a mocking reference to Mr. Bell's unfortunate circumstances into the article ("Operation Shutdown is currently in its Xth month."). I think this is unencyclopedic and needlessly cruel, and have been reverting. Most recently, a "new" user has showed up to add the identical piece of information. Anyway, if y'all could help keep an eye on things, I'd appreciate it. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 05:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>As one of the several users to edit the Derek Bell article, I feel that it is worth noting that the status of Operation Shutdown has been a part of Mr. Bell's entry for almost two years, and was the reason for starting an article on this particular baseball player. As a fan of not only Mr. Bell, but of the Pittsburgh Pirates, I do not find this information to be a mockery, but rather a way to follow a campaign on which he embarked. Furthermore, myself and the other IPs involved have not been adding useless information, but rather replacing information that I've known many people to enjoy seeing, and that has been there for, as previously stated, almost two years now. We have not been vandalizing the article, but restoring it.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mtcupps (<a href="../../../m/t/c/User_talk%7EMtcupps_cba5.html" title="User talk:Mtcupps">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mtcupps_feab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mtcupps">contribs</a>).</small></p>

An entire paragraph is devoted to explaining what a persecutory person a "Lutheran Sect Commissioner" is, not because the article subject is a "Lutheran Sect Commissioner", but because he allegedly "worked for years" with one, and "wrote for" that "Lutheran Sect Commissioner"'s magazine. Only problem is, the single citation that claims to show that they "worked for years" together only shows that they were at a single picket together, and the pieces that were supposedly "written for" the Lutheran Sect Commissioner's magazine are nothing but weekly digests giving capsule summaries of news stories that are of interest in a particular field. Just because someone reprints such a list of capsule descriptions does not in any way show that the list was written <i>for</i> them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the people who are working together to repeatedly reinsert this poorly sourced and POV information appear to be taking a far different approach to this article than they do to any of the articles whose subjects they prefer. As I write this, the report exactly three above mine on this noticeboard is <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJustanother_3420.html" title="User talk:Justanother">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Justanother_b9c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Justanother">contribs</a>) arguing repeatedly that <i>not editing out of another editor's words</i> a personal opinion that Tom Cruise may be "crazy and bad" is a violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. (And incidentally, also taking the opportunity to <b>smear me</b> with innuendoes such as "Please notice Feldspar's use of the word "our" rather than "your" when describing the trolls claims and opinions" when what I told the new editor, the one Justanother refers to as "the troll", was that "Our own personal value judgements ... our personal opinions ... don't really belong here unless they lead to improvements in the article". I am not happy that Justanother is now trying to insinuate that I am somehow expressing support for the troll's views by not phrasing it as "<b>Your</b> opinions are not welcome here".) But who took it upon himself to restore the paragraph-long description of Lutheran Sect Commissioners(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110714812&amp;oldid=110709361" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110714812&amp;oldid=110709361" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>) and specifically <i>add</i> material about how Lutheran Sect Commissioners allegedly "contributed to persistent negative public attitudes toward members of minority religions", calling it "The net effect of Tilman's (and friend's) work"?(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110714812&amp;oldid=110709361" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110714812&amp;oldid=110709361" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>) Who else but <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a>?</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I am not working with anyone at all (don't worry though, I put "cabal" on my Christmas list). The funny thing is I came to it because Misou posted a warning on Antaeus' talk page about vantalizing Tilman (warning since by removed Antaeus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=110700292" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Antaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=110700292" rel="nofollow">here</a>, not that I care). I thought it meant <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETilman_2a94.html" title="User:Tilman">User:Tilman</a> and I could not figure out why Antaeus would vandalize Tilman as Antaeus and Tilman are "cult-fighting" buddies. So I clicked and saw it was Tilman's (non-notable - editorial comment, laff) article, not his user space that was being referred to. So I took a look to see why Tilman was "notable" today and saw these refs to the "Lutheran Sect Commissioner". "What is that", methought, so I looked it up. (I was not aware of Misou's similar reference to what I then found as Misou's had been deleted by then.) Found some (cough) poorly-sourced material in a US State Department Report and posted it. After all, if Tilman wrote for the organization and such writing speaks to his notabilty (god knows, little else does) then does it not make sense to add some extremely well-sourced info about what that organization is and how it fits in to the overall subject of "cult-fighting" which is, again, Tilman's "claim" to notabillity. I mean, we are not running out of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">paper</a>, are we? PS, Antaeus. I see that you posted this an hour ago and have moved on to other work. Don't you think it might have been worth a mention in the talk page or a notice to mine and Misou's user talk? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 04:13, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Justanother, let me see if I can sum up the first part of what you are claiming. You claim that you only came to <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilman_Hausherr_909d.html" title="Tilman Hausherr">Tilman Hausherr</a> because you saw Misou's false vandalism allegation on my talk page, <b>but</b> you did not investigate Misou's claim: you did not examine my edits to see what information I had added or removed, or whether I had presented sound reasons for those additions/removals (such as <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> violations, which you clearly care deeply about -- sometimes). <b>But</b> somehow, <i>without</i> taking any sort of time to look at the very thing that brought you to the page, the allegedly-vandalistic removal of text from the article, you somehow managed by pure coincidence to reintroduce into the article <i>almost exactly</i> the very same text that had been removed.(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110709361&amp;oldid=110484755" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110709361&amp;oldid=110484755" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>) That is your story so far and it already strains credulity. But all right, let us suppose that you restored -- <i>coincidentally</i> -- almost exactly the same quote about what a "Lutheran Sect Commissioner" because you didn't bother to take a look at the recent history of the article. What is your excuse for restoring the same material <i>after</i> you were made aware that the stated relevance does not exist? When I removed the poorly-sourced claim that Tilman "has been writing in" Berliner Dialog, I did so with the edit summary "As before -- Tilman writes a piece that summarizes news stories of interest; to say he is "working with" anyone who prints that piece is your OR."(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110727764&amp;oldid=110727511" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110727764&amp;oldid=110727511" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>) Removing once again the irrelevant digression about the "Lutheran Sect Commissioners", I used the edit summary "remove again irrelevant digression about the pursuits of a man who has no shown connection to Tilman besides reprinting a piece that ANYONE CAN REPRINT".(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110728318&amp;oldid=110727764" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110728318&amp;oldid=110727764" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>) You ignored both of those and restored that poorly sourced claim that he "writes for" Berliner Dialog with the edit summary "Antaeus, what are you talking about? All I do is clarify the group that the article aleady said he writes for - not the first bit of OR. Show me the OR on talk please".(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110728525&amp;oldid=110728318" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110728525&amp;oldid=110728318" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>) But <b>this is clearly false</b>. The article <b>did not</b> 'already say he writes for' Berliner Dialog because that original research had been removed. You attempted to justify the very edit in which you restored that original research by falsely claiming it was already there. Now you attempt to <i>again</i> in this very space promote the same claim which has already been debunked -- that because "Berliner Dialog" reprints a freely available digest of news stories of which Tilman Hausherr was the compiler, it means that Tilman "wrote for the organization" (oh, it's graduated from a publication into an entire organization now) and that anything which pertains to "the organization" is therefore relevant to Tilman Hausherr. Under a similar theory I suppose that if the Ku Klux Klan were to carry the "Dear Abby" column in their newsletters then anything about the Ku Klux Klan would suddenly be extremely relevant to "Dear Abby"? The material you repeatedly reinserted was poorly-sourced material that violated <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>; your claim that <i>even now</i> you have <i>still</i> not realized this absolutely astonishes me. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 05:43, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry to hear that that you are strained and astonished. That does not sound comfortable. Hey, I have no reason to lie about how I got there. I watch your page, I don't watch Tilman's article. I won't bother but I imagine the edit history will prove my lack of interest there. When I arrived there the article looked like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110706227&amp;oldid=110705949" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tilman_Hausherr&amp;diff=110706227&amp;oldid=110705949" rel="nofollow">this</a>. See the ref to the Lutheran Sect Commissioner? And the "Beliner Dialog". Well that is what I saw. So I clicks on 'em and I sees "net.update - 1. 12. 1999 - 29. 6. 2000 - von Tilman Hausherr" and "net.update von Tilman Hausherr 5.9.2002 - 29.5.2004". Now my German is bad but it looks like Tilman is the author there. So I figure those articles must be there to establish Tilman's notability since, IMO, little else does. Here we have Tilman writing for a Lutheran Church publication. OK, there is some notability, right? So I do a bit of searching and, guess what, I find the State report (it was not very hard). I am already familiar with those and I think I quoted one some time ago in the main Scientology article, if I am not mistaken. So it only makes sense to me to add that well-sourced material about the organization that published the paper that Tilman seemed to be writing for. And you know, Antaeus, I looked in the article talk page and I completely missed where you discussed this and where you justified edit-warring with Misou over it. Would you mind pointing me at it? Please. But wait, what does Tilman say over there:
<blockquote>
<p>For example, that I wrote for Berliner Dialog could be properly sourced . . . Tilman 22:11, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
Antaeus, it is amazing what you find if you ever actually look at a talk page while you are edit-warring. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 06:13, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Suppose that we take it as stipulated that Tilman wrote for Berliner Dialog. Oh hell! I'll even <i>bend over backwards</i> for you and pretend for the sake of argument that we have some reason to believe Tilman "wrote for" Berliner Dialog something more substantive than "Net Update", the previously-referenced digest of stories of interest from the news. Berliner Dialog is still a publication, not an organization (contrary to your earlier muddy references to them as if they were the same thing). Your argument is still "Tilman writes for the publication, therefore he supports the organization that publishes the publication, therefore anything which can be said about the organization can be brought up in reference to him" and as a result your argument is still shoddy and still no justification for your blatant attempt at guilt-by-association. If I were to insert into <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirstie_Alley_8e28.html" title="Kirstie Alley">Kirstie Alley</a> a paragraph of well-sourced material entirely about and unflattering to <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narconon.html" title="Narconon">Narconon</a>, I <i>guarantee</i> you would be screaming about how it was a clear attempt by "the POV-editors" to bias the article -- despite Alley being the International Spokesperson for Narconon for <a href="http://www.freedommag.org/english/la/issue01/page04.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.freedommag.org/english/la/issue01/page04.htm" rel="nofollow">ten years</a> or more, <b>far more</b> of a connection between the person and the organization than you have to justify your repeated insertions of anti-Lutheran Church material into <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilman_Hausherr_909d.html" title="Tilman Hausherr">Tilman Hausherr</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 08:04, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, a coherent argument (not the part where you try to back away from your error as in "that poorly sourced claim that he "writes for" Berliner Dialog" but that is OK, we all make errors - I mean the other part about Kirstie). Couched in the usual invective, of course, but a coherent argument none-the-less. Now, had I found such an argument on the talk page from your edit-war with Misou or had you presented any such argument on self-same talk page when I posted to it about my edits under the "ambiguous" heading of "Lutheran Sect Commissioner"; had you responded there instead of using up all your 3RR and having none left for Fossa and then running over here to attack me instead of simply asking a question (an abuse of this board that I will likely report on AN/I so there is your heads-up though I could likely be forestalled with a simple apology); had you done any of that you may have found that I agreed with your argument. I think we have seen time and again, Antaeus, that we two can edit together in the Scientology articles and really have no big problem about it but when you attack me and I defend myself it gets ugly and while it may be "fun" for both of us it is boring for others, and when you bring it somewhere like this, it is disruptive (and please let's not get into the bit with "our" and "your" - trust me, you don't want to bring that up either; please use my talk page if you really must). So, in response to your coherent argument. Fair enough. I think it would be most appropriate for me to make an article on the "Sect Commissioner" and put the US State data there (I also think there is UN data, and did see a bit). Then Tilman et al can help us with balancing the view. Finally, if we then want to put the Berliner Dialog in Tilman (and if we are to have anything at all there then it belongs), we can do the "publication of the sometimes controversial Lutheran [[Sect Commissioner]]" as we would if this were Kirstie's article. Does that sound fair? And again, as I have said before, but maybe you missed, "I do not have any double-standard" which also happens also to be a concise statement of who I am here. Cheers. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 14:34, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Gentlemen (and/or ladies), I have taken a look at the article and its talk page as well as the <i>extremely</i> long explanations here (in the future please note the text in bold at the top of this page about being consise). It seems this dispute is rather complex, involving AfD, deleting sourced matertial, BLP, arguments over which version is better, and some obvious POV issues. After reading the comments and histories, I believe this issue is not going to be settled here. I suggest that somebody take the issue here <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a> or here <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Biographies_b5b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Biographies">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Biographies</a>. A fresh set of outside eyes not involved in the issue is needed to help establish consensus and sort out WP policies. I would also suggest that everybody take a look at <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAM_9e2a.html" title="WP:NAM">this essay</a> before continuing, it contains some good advice.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamThweatt_f58c.html" title="User:WilliamThweatt">William Thweatt</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamThweatt_8c60.html" title="User talk:WilliamThweatt">Talk</a></sup> | <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilliamThweatt_f34f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilliamThweatt">Contribs</a></sup> 16:17, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Libby himself has not publicly identified himself as Jewish, nor have there been any credible articles showing that his ethnicity or religion (or his parent's for that matter) has in any way impacted his professional work.

<dd>Also troubling is your use of the term "has not publicly identified himself as Jewish."

<dd>Why is his religion relevant? Also, the page currently reads "was born into a Jewish family." Perhaps he converted? My point was that there is no evidence that he has made his religion/ethnicity part of his work, as opposed to a politician that is courting a religious constituency, for instance (in that case, it would be appropriate, of course). His being Jewish or not is not part of his public persona or notoriety. The fact that the source you cited is the Tulsa Jewish News (is this generally considered a reliable source?) adds to the argument that this is not noteworthy to the general public.<a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmyrealname_819d.html" title="User:Notmyrealname">Notmyrealname</a> 04:32, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The Tulsa Jewish News is a perfectly reliable and acceptable source. It has a long history of print publication -- more than 75 years -- and isn't some sham publication created for partisan purposes. There is no requirement that a reliable source be a national publication. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 13:19, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Conversion is extremely unlikely, and actually his being Jewish has come up as somewhat relevant. See for example. <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/bushjews.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/bushjews.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=15997" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=15997" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. Whether he was born in or not is an interesting point and it mgiht be good to find a source that explicitly says that he was born Jewish. But given how rare converts to Judaism are, if he were a convert, we can be pretty sure it would have come up. (technically this is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> but hopefully sourcing can be found) At minimum, this isn't a BLP concern because being born Jewish is not potentially negative info (especially if he is Jewish no matter what)). I would suggest however, given that the above sources mention it explicitly and that they show that his Jewishness matters, that it should be mentioned in some form in the article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:43, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe both criteria are met. For the first criterion, attending public religious services would certainly count as public self-identification.

<dd>As I have shown on the Libby talk page, source 1 is not reliable. The bio for Libby cites its source as "Wikipedia." For all the people it identifies, it cites "News Sources" and another website that does not indicate Libby's ethnicity. This is a bogus list. Source number 2 claims that some <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Supremacist_fed5.html" title="White Supremacist">White Supremacist</a> groups affiliated with <a href="../../../k/k/k/KKK_5ce8.html" title="KKK">KKK</a> member <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> thought Libby's ethnicity was relevant, however everything in the actual article says that it was not. I think it is kind of twisting logic to say that a responsible news story saying that his being Jewish is not relevant somehow makes it relevant. Read the full story. I very much disagree with <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> that his being involved with policy towards Israel automatically makes his being Jewish relevant. Jews have diverse opinions about Israel. There is no evidence that Libby's input (whatever it was) was influenced by his being Jewish or not. His family membership in a synagogue does not constitute PUBLIC self identification. If that were the standard, then every person of any faith who attends church/synagogue/mosque, etc. would automatically lose their right to privacy on Wikipedia. If he had written an op-ed saying "as a Jew, I believe..." than it would be a different story. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmyrealname_819d.html" title="User:Notmyrealname">Notmyrealname</a> 16:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the source itself is somewhat obscure. But, I wonder, relevant to what? I could see it if we want to include a section saying that some hate groups have mentioned him in their blogs, but then what are we doing beyond giving them more exposure? I just don't think that a single mention by a rather obscure publication (who has heard of the JTA?) is enough to justify relevancy, especially when the article is about it not being relevant. If the end result is that we just note that he is Jewish based on all of this, we have, in effect, just supported the efforts of fringe hate groups. If we are to take the role of <i>editors</i> seriously, we have to have some sounder rationale for relevance. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Reliable_sources" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Reliable_sources" rel="nofollow">WP:BLP</a> we should "ask yourself if the information is presented as being true, if the source is reliable, and if the information, even if true, is relevant to an encyclopedic article on that subject."

<p>Libby's attendance at a public synagogue is so well known among the Jewish community that it is noted by Jewish publications <i>outside of his region</i>. That's certainly sufficient. It isn't necessary for someone to shout "I'M A JEW" to meet this requirement. This is also no privacy violation, it's published in an established newspaper. Also the language "born into a Jewish family" is not necessary and should probably be changed to be less weasel-worded. Libby himself attends synagogue. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 18:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a>, I think that there are several questions here. Has Libby publicly self-identified his religious affiliation? Is it relevant? I don't think he has taken any action to indicate that this is part of his public persona. Does joining a religious institution automatically mean that your religion should be included on a Wikipedia biography? The fact that the Tulsa Jewish News included this (hardly a representative sample of "the Jewish community" (sic)), without sourcing in a minor news item isn't a sufficient case of relevance. If you look at the Google results and read the links, you will see that <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-semitic.html" title="Anti-semitic">anti-semitic</a> groups, including those run by <a href="../../../k/k/k/KKK_5ce8.html" title="KKK">KKK</a> leader <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> wrote some pieces under the headings "Lewis Libby: One more Jewish Traitor Neocon Exposed." One writer for <a href="http://www.jta.org/index.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.jta.org/index.asp" rel="nofollow">JTA</a>, Ron Kampeas, wrote a story about it that a bunch of blogs reprinted. The story was about the hate groups writing about Libby being Jewish. In his interviews, he found that most people who worked with him in the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> had no idea he was Jewish, and in fact were adamant that he was not. I have never heard of the JTA before, and I doubt anyone would consider it mainstream. There has been no discussion of it in the broader media. The article itself goes to great lengths to explain that his being Jewish is NOT relevant. The only point of including this in his bio would be to echo the blog rants of hate groups. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmyrealname_819d.html" title="User:Notmyrealname">Notmyrealname</a> 19:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. The article is on the man, Lewis Libby, and not about American-Israeli policy. A <i>basic fact</i> about him such as religion can be included if no other claim is made regarding it. By your logic, not even his age or marital status could be included in the article, nor can that same information be included even in articles about US Presidents. That's simply absurd. You are misapplying <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, which requires that the thesis be stated ("introduces a theory, method of solution, or any other original idea"). Making a mere statement of religion implies nothing. Just as with birthdays of politicians, it is germane to include religious affiliation if it is public, but not to make any conclusion about it without supporting secondary sources. Never has it been WP policy or guideline that basic facts about an individual -- age, religion, birthdate, location of birth, names of parents and siblings -- be explicitly relevant to that person's body of work. If that is the case, let's get busy working, we have to remove all of that information from hundreds of thousands of articles. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 16:12, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(indent to left side) Just chimming in since I reinserted Libby's ethnicity into article. I agree that Libby's ethnicity isn't all that notable but it seems that the wikipedia "standard" if any really exists, is to mention ethnicity if it can be properly sourced. Also, my opinion is that ethnicity should only be mentioned under "early life" or "family backround" ect unless there is some major reason to list it higher up in the article. The mention should also "flow" and not just slammed into the article for its own sake which I see quite a bit of.

<dd>I think there is some confusion regarding <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a>'s comments. You seem to be arguing two different points. One is that Libby's religion is a basic fact (like age, marital status, etc.) that should be included if it is public knowledge and properly sourced. There is a reasonable disput about this given that Wikipedia has a policy against using a category such as Jewish American Lawyers. Although the policy does not seem to explicitly rule out including his religion in the general text of the bio for privacy reasons, it is certainly implied (otherwise, why have it in categories?). Your other point seems to be that because Libby dealt with government policies involving <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, his being Jewish is notable. This second point, if it is what you mean, is troubling and would appear to be POV. It might be helpful if you could clarify your arguments.

<dd>My argument is more nuanced than that. There are two prongs to the argument -- first, it is basic factual information, inherently not POV to include it if it is public information, properly sourced, and not used in a POV fashion. My second argument is that it is always appropriate to note the religion of a high public official (though not necessarily other individuals), because of the possibility that it might impact policy. Otherwise we must omit the fact that Mitt Romney is LDS, the ages of candidates, their birthplaces, etc. and that also is absurdity. Of course, no conclusion should be drawn from the basic facts unless there are secondary sources. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 21:29, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification. I think the main source shows that it is being used in a POV fashion. I also think you are missing the element of privacy that should be accorded in biography cases. To the second argument, I think that there is a difference for public officials and politicians. In this case, it should be proven first that it has had an impact on policy. The assumption that it always does is POV. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmyrealname_819d.html" title="User:Notmyrealname">Notmyrealname</a> 22:15, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think so. I am following the logic of the rule on categories-- "Category tags regarding religious beliefs and sexual preference should not be used unless two criteria are met: * The subject publicly self-identifies with the belief or preference in question * The subject's beliefs or sexual preferences are relevant to the subject's notable activities or public life." If this applies to categories in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, why not to the content of the article itself? Also, YOU'RE the one who brought up the policy thing. I think a different standard should apply to non-elected officials than to elected politicians. Does it matter if the head of trade policy is Episcopalian? Should this always be included in a biography? There is a bias towards privacy on <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Beliefs and sexual preferences are singled out in particular. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmyrealname_819d.html" title="User:Notmyrealname">Notmyrealname</a> 00:37, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But as I said before, both criteria are met. 1. He self-identifies, by attending a public synagogue, a fact well known enough in the Jewish community to be reported outside his region, and 2., the religious identification of all high officials and policy makers (not just those that are elected) are certainly "relevant to the subject's notable activities." They are <i>extremely relevant</i> if the individual is making foreign policy. It doesn't have to be proven that the religious affiliation has affected policy (the requirement which you have invented), it is simply inherently relevant because it helps frame where the policy is coming from. As to your second point, having different standards for elected or non-elected officials -- no. They are both public servants. The only difference is in how they are chosen. Lewis Libby was far more powerful than the majority of elected officials in the US. He was on the public payroll in an extremely critical and influential position, one more powerful than most US Senators and certainly most US Congressmen. Arguing to exclude such people from scrutiny is baffling. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 01:17, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How does someone's religion frame where the policy is coming from? This is a POV contention not supported by any facts. Also, by your standard, anyone who actually practices their faith by attending a religious institution should automatically have their religion included in a Wikipedia bio? This basically includes everyone of faith. The difference between an elected official and a non elected official is that the elected one appeals to different constituencies to garner votes. According to the article cited in all this hullabaloo, most people had no idea about Libby's faith and it was NOT relevant. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmyrealname_819d.html" title="User:Notmyrealname">Notmyrealname</a> 01:40, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I did not say that. What I am saying is that <i>any official in high office</i> (I have repeatedly stated that this does not apply to all individuals, apparently you chose to ignore that), if their religion is publicly self-identified (a criterion met in this case), it ought to be stated. The same goes for birth location, birth date/age, education, work experience, marital status. They are acting on our behalf, and we should know where they are coming from. <i>All of these things together</i> frame the individual and the policies they make. It is not necessary to prove each of these specifically have had an effect on policy to include them in a biography on the individual. It is extremely reasonable to state the background facts about an individual when such clearly has no privacy implications (as is true in this instance). Your logic is so absurd that it's not possible to state George W. Bush's birthdate, and here, bafflingly, <i>it is not possible to state someone is Jewish when they make policy towards Israel.</i> Simply astonishing. The fact is relevant even if it has not affected policy. It should be shown. As to your other point, the difference between elected and unelected officials, while interesting and noteworthy in some other venue, is irrelevant to this discussion. If someone holds high office in the US, they are answersable to the American people, and we ought to know exactly who they are. Elected or unelected. Until he resigned Libby was one of a handful of the most powerful individuals in the Executive Branch of government. There are only two elected officials in the Executive Branch. Now all the others are off limits? This seems to be what you are saying.

<p>You are twisting my words into a Israeli/Jewish issue to make it appear that I hold an agenda. That is false. I am not approaching this from that standpoint except using it as an example here because in this instance, it demonstrates your utter absurdity. I am saying that it is perfectly acceptable to list the religious affiliation of <i>any high official</i> without stating a reason, if he self-identifies (I would even go further than that, it would be acceptable to list it even if he did not self-identify publicly, but I am not arguing that point here.) This must be done in a non-POV way, that is, it must merely be stated without any conclusions drawn to it. I am saying that we don't need to demonstrate a reason, because for a high official, the very nature of high office is reason enough. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 03:18, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, you are saying that every high public official (whatever that is) who attends a religious service should have their religion on their Wikipedia bio. The <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> policy that "Biographies of living people must be written conservatively and with due regard to the subject's privacy" doesn't include religion, even though there are restrictions on this regarding categories. This is because there should be a presumption that there is a possibility that the person's religion might in some way affect their policies (for instance a Jew who is involved in Israel policy). I just don't agree with this (and especially the final parenthetical, which you have put forth several times). Public officials in the United States are not required to list their religion. It would be illegal to ask them to do so when they applied for a job. I think the bias should be in favor of privacy in regards to things like religion and sexual orientation, rather than presuming relevancy. I think we need a somewhat higher standard for self identification than attending a service or belonging to a church/synagogue, etc. I am pleased that the page no longer lists Libby as a "Jewish American lawyer," "born into a Jewish family," or lumped in with the category of "Jewish American lawyers." The current rendering of the page is rather clunky and probably falls under original research, but I think we are making progress. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotmyrealname_819d.html" title="User:Notmyrealname">Notmyrealname</a> 05:46, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We have already established that this is not a privacy issue (it's public information), so any privacy argument you make here is moot. The fact that public officials are not required to divulge their religion, also is not relevant to our discussion. If a high official attends public services and that becomes a published fact in a reliable source, it is perfectly fair game for Wikipedia. If you seriously are posing questions such as <b>Why does someone being Jewish or not have anything to do with their policy decisions regarding Israel [the Jewish state]?</b>, you really should stop and decide whether or not you are living in a different world than everyone else. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 06:40, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The relevance of debate in the media about whether or not Lewis Libby is Jewish is clearly established in the reliable source published by <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Telegraphic_Agency_404f.html" title="Jewish Telegraphic Agency">Jewish Telegraphic Agency</a> (JTA) and several reliable news media cited directly in the article on <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Libby_3c63.html" title="Lewis Libby">Lewis Libby</a> at the following link: <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Libby_3c63.html#Personal_history" title="Lewis Libby">Lewis Libby#Personal history</a>--deleted due to nmrn's campaign but still accessible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lewis_Libby#The_content_removed_from_this_article_that_pertains_to_my_previous_comments" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lewis_Libby#The_content_removed_from_this_article_that_pertains_to_my_previous_comments" rel="nofollow">here</a> on the talk page--and fully explained in the talk page section long before Notmyrealname came upon the article and started deleting the sources (reverting continually pertinent sourced information): see <a href="../../../l/e/w/Talk%7ELewis_Libby_30cc.html" title="Talk:Lewis Libby">Talk:Lewis Libby</a> (scroll up before nmrn's comments and read my recent replies). Kampeas' article makes very clear what relevance this aspect of Libby's personal history has to current political debate in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> regarding both the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_Invasion_of_Iraq_a692.html" title="2003 Invasion of Iraq">Iraq war</a> policies of the Bush administration (in which he was a senior member) and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_v._Libby_5f31.html" title="United States v.

<dd>Actually, the Kampeas article makes painfully clear that Libby's being Jewish is not relevant at all, except possibly as a rejoinder to <a href="../../../k/k/k/KKK_5ce8.html" title="KKK">KKK</a> leader <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> and others who believe in conspiracies.

On the article itself, at <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Libby_3c63.html#Personal_history" title="Lewis Libby">Lewis Libby#Personal history</a> you will see NYScholar's latest clunky edit, including poor use of sourcing, that is original research.

<dd>A mischaracterization -- the Kampeas article does nothing of the sort. The most it does is make a claim that Libby's being Jewish has not affected his decisionmaking, and that he kept his profile low. Stipulating those conclusions are true (they likely are) is not at all equal to a finding that his "being Jewish is not relevant at all." One must be careful not to draw the conclusions one wants to find, when they are not actually present. I find the article troubling for other reasons, but it is one of the few sources discussing the issue. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuatloo_1acc.html" title="User:Quatloo">Quatloo</a> 17:20, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree that the reverted edit was vandalism in anything other than the clumsiness with which it broke the first reference. The first content sentence it removed was a textbook example of <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>, and the second sentence was an entirely unsourced accusation of racism (the article referenced for that sentence being a glowing description of Radnich's multiracial family).

<dd>Clumsiness is an understatement. The user removed 3½ of 4 citations, which linked to <i><a href="../../../s/f/_/SF_Weekly_dfe7.html" title="SF Weekly">SF Weekly</a></i>, the <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i>, and <a href="../../../k/r/o/KRON-TV_85d0.html" title="KRON-TV">KRON-TV</a>, a network television affiliate in San Francisco. These are reliable sources. A responsible edit would have been to replace the statements with material actually supported by those sources. Removing such references for no apparent reason is indistinguishable from vandalism. — <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7ECharlotteWebb_8dbe.html" title="User talk:CharlotteWebb">CharlotteWebb</a> 00:19, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I respectfully disagree in this case, per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_contentious_material" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_contentious_material</a>. The first sentence was perhaps salvageable, the second sentence not - it was clearly contentious and derogatory material, and clearly not supported by the listed sources (in fact, it was at least partially disproven by the listed sources). While I agree that the deleted sources are both reliable and perhaps useful in the context of this article, they actually worsened the article as it stood: readers who didn't bother to follow the links might have assumed that the sources corroborated "refusing to take responsibility for his racist commentary". Again, I understand why the edit in question might have been mistaken for vandalism, but I think the policy is clear in stating that this sort of material should be deleted.</dd>
