<p><b>Pope John Paul II</b> reigned as pope of the Roman Catholic Church and sovereign of Vatican City for almost 27 years. The first non-Italian to serve in office since the Dutch-German Pope Adrian VI died in 1523, John Paul II's reign was the third-longest in the history of the Papacy. Pope John Paul II's reign was marked by a continuing decline of Catholicism in developed countries but expansion in former Communist countries of Eastern Europe and the former <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and in the Third World.</p>

Karol Wojtyła at 12 years old</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Karol Józef Wojtyła</a> was born on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">18 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wadowice.html" title="Wadowice">Wadowice</a> in southern <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, son of a former officer in the Austrian <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habsburg.html" title="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> army whose name was also Karol Wojtyła, and Emilia Kaczorowska. According to popular Wadowice legend, Emilia used to tell fellow townsfolk that her Karol would be "a great man one day." As a child Karol was called Lolek by friends and family.</p>
<p>His mother died during childbirth in 1929. On hearing about her death, he composed himself and said, "It was God's will." After Emilia's death, his father, an intensely religious man who did most of the housework, brought up Karol so that he could study. His youth was marked by intensive contacts with the then-thriving <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> community of <a href="../../../w/a/d/Wadowice.html" title="Wadowice">Wadowice</a>.</p>
<p>His brother Edmund, also known as Mundek, died of scarlet fever contracted from a patient at the age of 26 in 1932. His only other sibling, a sister, died in infancy before Karol was born.</p>
<p>He practiced sports during his youth, being particulartly athletic. He often played <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a>, as a <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goalkeeper_%28football%29.html" title="Goalkeeper (football)">goalkeeper</a>, and was a supporter of Polish <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_club.html" title="Football club">club</a> <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cracovia_Krak%C3%B3w_6e3a.html" title="Cracovia Kraków">Cracovia Kraków</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>George Weigal in his biography "Witness to Hope" (p31) recalls that when Karol was around fifteen a young person playfully pointed a gun at him not realising that it was loaded. On pressing the trigger the gun fired and narrowly missed the target. He would escape from other near death incidents as a young seminarian and later as Pope.</p>

Karol Wojtyła as a student, 1938</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the summer of 1938, Karol Wojtyła and his father left Wadowice and moved to Kraków, the former capital of Poland, where he enrolled at the Jagiellonian University in the autumn semester. In his freshman year, Wojtyła studied Philology, Polish language and literature, introductory Russian, and Old Church Slavonic. He also took private lessons in French. He worked as a volunteer librarian and did compulsory military training in the Academic Legion. At the end of the 1938-39 academic year, he played Sagittarius in a fantasy-fable, <i>The Moonlight Cavalier</i>, produced by an experimental theatre troupe.</p>
<p>In his youth he was an active person, and learned as many as twelve languages. By the time he was Pope he spoke ten languages fluently Polish,Slovak,Russian, Italian, French , Spanish, Portuguese,German, Ukrainian and English, beside his good knowledge of Ecclesiastical Latin.</p>

<p>In September 1939, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_September_Campaign_01ad.html" title="Polish September Campaign">invaded</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>, and the country was subsequently occupied by German and Soviet forces. At the outbreak of War, Karol and his father fled eastwards from <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krak%C3%B3w.html" title="Kraków">Kraków</a> with thousands of other Poles. They sometimes found themselves in ditches, taking cover from strafing <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> aircraft. After walking 120 miles, they learned of the Russian invasion of Poland and were obliged to return to Kraków. In November, 184 academics of the <a href="../../../j/a/g/Jagiellonian_University_ae5d.html" title="Jagiellonian University">Jagiellonian University</a> were arrested and the university suppressed. All able-bodied males had to have a job. In the first year of the war Karol worked as a messenger for a restaurant. This light work enabled him to continue his education and theatrical career and in acts of cultural resistance. He also intensified his study of French. From the autumn of 1940 Karol worked for almost four years as a manual labourer in a limestone quarry, and was well paid. His father died in 1941 because of a heart attack. In 1942, he entered the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground_education_in_Poland_during_World_War_II_5e5b.html" title="Underground education in Poland during World War II">underground seminary</a> run by Cardinal Sapieha, the archbishop of <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krak%C3%B3w.html" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>. <a href="../../../b/27/n/B%27nai_B%27rith_12ed.html" title="B'nai B'rith">B'nai B'rith</a> and other authorities have testified that he helped Jews find refuge from the Nazis. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_29.html" title="February 29">29 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, Karol was walking home from work at the quarry when he was knocked down by a German truck. The German officers tending of the injured Wojtyła, and the decisive commandeering of a passing truck for use as an ambulance for the unconscious patient, is in sharp contrast to the harshness normally expected from the occupying forces during this period. He spent two weeks in hospital and suffered severe concussion, numerous cuts and a shoulder injury. According to <i>Witness to Hope</i>, the biography by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Weigel_263d.html" title="George Weigel">George Weigel</a>, this accident and his survival seemed to Wojtyła a confirmation of his priestly vocation. In August 1944, the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warsaw_uprising.html" title="Warsaw uprising">Warsaw uprising</a> began, and the Gestapo swept the city of <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krak%C3%B3w.html" title="Kraków">Kraków</a> on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">6 August</a>, "Black Sunday", rounding up young men to avoid a similar uprising there. Wojtyła escaped by hiding behind a door as the Gestapo searched the house he lived in, and escaped to the Archbishop's residence, where he stayed until after the war. On the night of <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_17.html" title="January 17">17 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, the Germans quit the city. The seminarians reclaimed the old seminary, which was in ruins. According to the official biography, <i>Witness to Hope</i>, Karol and another seminarian volunteered for the odious task of chopping up and carting away piles of frozen excrement from the lavatories.</p>

Karol Wojtyła as a priest in Niegowić, Poland, 1948</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Karol Wojtyła was <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordination.html" title="Ordination">ordained</a> a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">1 November</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, by the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Krak%C3%B3w_4837.html" title="Archbishop of Kraków">Archbishop of Kraków</a>, <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Stefan_Sapieha_4cd1.html" title="Adam Stefan Sapieha">Adam Stefan Sapieha</a>. He then travelled to Rome to begin doctoral studies in the Pontifical Athenaeum of St <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Aquinas_b8c6.html" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> ("the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelicum.html" title="Angelicum">Angelicum</a>"). There he became well versed in theology and politics. He studied writings of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Gregory_I_367c.html" title="Pope Gregory I">pope Gregory I</a>, the teachings of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_the_Cross_42b6.html" title="John of the Cross">Saint John of the Cross</a>, the <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenomenology.html" title="Phenomenology">phenomenology</a> of <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Scheler_04b9.html" title="Max Scheler">Max Scheler</a>.

He lived for two years in Rome in the Belgian College. The college was small with twenty-two resident student-priests and seminarians, among them five Americans. In this polyglot environment, Wojtyła could improve his French and practice his German, while he began to study Italian and English. In his doctoral thesis, which examined <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_John_of_the_Cross_c899.html" title="St John of the Cross">St John of the Cross</a>'s understanding of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith.html" title="Faith">faith</a>, Wojtyła emphasised the personal nature of the human encounter with God. Returning to Poland in the summer of 1948, his first <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastoral.html" title="Pastoral">pastoral</a> assignment was to the village of Niegowić, fifteen miles from Kraków.</p>

</div>
<p>In March 1949, he was transferred to <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Florian_a9a5.html" title="Saint Florian">Saint Florian</a>'s parish in Kraków. He taught <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a> at the <a href="../../../j/a/g/Jagiellonian_University_ae5d.html" title="Jagiellonian University">Jagiellonian University</a> in <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krak%C3%B3w.html" title="Kraków">Kraków</a> and subsequently at the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_University_of_Lublin_b7de.html" title="Catholic University of Lublin">Catholic University of Lublin</a>. Wojtyła gathered a group of fewer than twenty young people, who began to call themselves <i>Rodzinka</i>, the "little family", who met for prayer, philosophical discussion, and helping the blind and sick. Rodzinka continued to grow. Wojtyła's young friends began to call him <i>Wujek</i> (Uncle) to avoid outsiders from guessing he was a priest on outside trips. As the Wojtyła's circle grew, and their bond deepened, several weddings occurred in the group. Eventually there were some 200 people in his circle, which came to be called <i>Środowisko</i>, meaning roughly "milieu". Wojtyła and his group went on both <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skiing.html" title="Skiing">skiing</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayak.html" title="Kayak">kayaking</a> trips annually. On the annual kayaking trip, Wojtyła used to have a two-man kayak and others would join him for conversation or spiritual direction. <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28liturgy%29.html" title="Mass (liturgy)">Mass</a> was celebrated using an overturned kayak as an altar, and two paddles as a cross. Once, in 1955, the kayakers took part in an international competition through a gorge on the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunajec.html" title="Dunajec">Dunajec</a> River. <i>Wujek'</i>s <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayak.html" title="Kayak">kayak</a> was punctured and sank at the finish line. Fr Wojtyła wrote a series of articles in <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krak%C3%B3w.html" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>'s Catholic <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> <i><a href="../../../t/y/g/Tygodnik_Powszechny_5d70.html" title="Tygodnik Powszechny">Tygodnik Powszechny</a></i> [Universal Weekly] dealing with contemporary church issues.</p>
<p>Karol Wojtyła's literary work blossomed in his first dozen years as a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a>. The <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_world_war.html" title="Second world war">war</a>, life under <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a>, and his pastoral responsibilities all fed his <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.html" title="Poetry">poems</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Play.html" title="Play">plays</a>. These were published under two pseudonyms-Andrzej Jawień, and Stanisław Andrzej Gruda. He used these pseudonyms firstly to distinguish his literary from his religious writings, which were published under his own name, and also so that his literary work would be considered on their own merits rather than as clerical curiosities.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">5 August</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a>, while on a two-week <i>Środowisko</i> <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayaking.html" title="Kayaking">kayaking</a> trip on the river Lyne in north-eastern Poland Karol Wojtyła received a letter ordering him to report immediately to the primate, Cardinal Wyszynski, in Warsaw. When he arrived at the primate's office, the cardinal informed him that on bishop Baziak, apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krak%C3%B3w.html" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>. Wojtyła accepted the nomination and went straight to the <a href="../../../u/r/s/Ursuline.html" title="Ursuline">Ursuline</a> convent, where he knocked on the door and asked if he could come in to pray. Wojtyła amazed the nuns by remaining prostrate on the floor for some time in front of the <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabernacle.html" title="Tabernacle">tabernacle</a>. Pope John Paul II recounts in his book "Rise, Let us be on our Way" how he entered a room a full of priests, after news had been received of his appointment as auxiliary Bishop, when Archbishop Baziak called out "Habemus papam" ("We have a Pope"). He suggests that these words may be seen as prophetic in the light of subsequent events. And so Karol Wojtyła found himself, at thirty-eight, the youngest <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a> in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Poland</a>. He was consecrated a <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">bishop</a> by Archbishop Baziak on the feast of <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wenceslaus_I%2C_Duke_of_Bohemia_0db0.html" title="Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia">St. Wenceslaus</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_28.html" title="September 28">28 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/w/Wawel_Cathedral_004f.html" title="Wawel Cathedral">Wawel Cathedral</a> in <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krak%C3%B3w.html" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>.</p>
<p>Bishop Wojtyła began an annual custom, in 1959, of celebrating Christmas midnight Mass in an open field in <a href="../../../n/o/w/Nowa_Huta_e4a3.html" title="Nowa Huta">Nowa Huta</a>, a new industrial town built by the communists not far from Kraków and the first town in Polish history deliberately built without a church. (The measured but persistent pressure by the Catholics would eventually succeed, and in 1977 a church was built in Nowa Huta.)</p>
<p>Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak died in June 1962 and on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_16.html" title="July 16">16 July</a> Karol Wojtyła was elected as <i>Vicar Capitular</i>, or temporary administrator, of the Archdiocese until an Archbishop could be appointed.

Being young and having relatively low position in the hierarchy, Wojtyła sat next to the door of St. Peter's basilica. Prior to the council, Bishop Wojtyła had sent an essay to the commissioners preparing for the Council suggesting that the world wanted to know what the church had to say about the human person and the human condition. What was the Church's answer to modernity's widespread "despair about any and all human existence?"</p>

<p>He made contributions to two of the most historic and influential products of the council, the <i>Decree on Religious Freedom</i> (in Latin, <i><a href="../../../d/i/g/Dignitatis_Humanae_9450.html" title="Dignitatis Humanae">Dignitatis Humanae</a></i>) and the <i>Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World</i> (<i><a href="../../../g/a/u/Gaudium_et_Spes_f845.html" title="Gaudium et Spes">Gaudium et Spes</a></i>).</p>
<p>In 1960, Wojtyła had published the influential book Love and Responsibility, a defense of the traditional Church teachings on sex and marriage from a new philosophical standpoint.

Pope John Paul II</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In August 1978, following Paul's death, he voted in the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_election.html" title="Papal election">Papal Conclave</a> that elected Albino Luciani, the Cardinal <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch_of_Venice_c142.html" title="Patriarch of Venice">Patriarch of Venice</a>, as <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_I_e324.html" title="Pope John Paul I">Pope John Paul I</a>. At sixty-five, Luciani was a young man by Papal standards and Wojtyła, then fifty-eight, could have expected to participate in another Papal conclave before reaching the age of eighty (the upper age limit for cardinal electors). However, he could hardly have expected that his second conclave would come so soon, for on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_28.html" title="September 28">28 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, after only 33 days as Pope, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_I_e324.html" title="Pope John Paul I">John Paul I</a> was discovered dead in the papal apartments. In October 1978 Wojtyła returned to <a href="../../../v/a/t/Vatican_City_edb3.html" title="Vatican City">Vatican City</a> to participate in the <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_conclave%2C_1978_%28October%29_2f27.html" title="Papal conclave, 1978 (October)">second conclave in less than two months</a>. Voting in the second conclave was divided between two particularly strong candidates: <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuseppe_Siri_1e51.html" title="Giuseppe Siri">Giuseppe Siri</a>, the Archbishop of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genoa.html" title="Genoa">Genoa</a>, and <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giovanni_Benelli_ca45.html" title="Giovanni Benelli">Giovanni Benelli</a>, the Archbishop of <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence.html" title="Florence">Florence</a> and a close associate of <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_I_e324.html" title="Pope John Paul I">Pope John Paul I</a>. In early ballots, Benelli came within nine votes of victory. However Wojtyła secured election as a compromise candidate, in part through the support of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_K%C3%B6nig_ed76.html" title="Franz König">Franz König</a> and others who had previously supported Giuseppe Siri.</p>
<p>The next day he celebrated <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28liturgy%29.html" title="Mass (liturgy)">Mass</a> together with the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_Cardinals_49b1.html" title="College of Cardinals">College of Cardinals</a> in the <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sistine_Chapel_8b2a.html" title="Sistine Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a>. After the mass, he delivered his first <i><a href="../../../u/r/b/Urbi_et_Orbi_3b16.html" title="Urbi et Orbi">Urbi et Orbi</a></i> (a traditional blessing) message, broadcast world-wide via radio.</p>
<p>The election of a cardinal from a communist country reminded many of the plot of the book (1963) and film (1968) <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shoes_of_the_Fisherman_91d7.html" title="The Shoes of the Fisherman">The Shoes of the Fisherman</a>.</p>
<p>Like his immediate predecessor, Pope John Paul II dispensed with the traditional <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_Coronation_7650.html" title="Papal Coronation">Papal Coronation</a> and instead received ecclesiastical investiture with the simplified <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papal_Inauguration_705a.html" title="Papal Inauguration">Papal Inauguration</a>.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_13.html" title="May 13">13 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>, John Paul II was shot and nearly killed by <a href="../../../m/e/h/Mehmet_Ali_A%C4%9Fca_23a4.html" title="Mehmet Ali Ağca">Mehmet Ali Ağca</a>, a <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> gunman, as he entered <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Peter%27s_Square_60ed.html" title="Saint Peter's Square">Saint Peter's Square</a> to address an audience. He was rushed to the <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agostino_Gemelli_University_Polyclinic_93dd.html" title="Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic">Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic</a>, where he underwent emergency <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surgery.html" title="Surgery">surgery</a> and extensive <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_transfusion.html" title="Blood transfusion">blood transfusion</a>. Ağca was eventually sentenced to <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_imprisonment.html" title="Life imprisonment">life imprisonment</a>. In his <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_%28law%29.html" title="Will (law)">will</a>, the Pope described his survival as a "miracle" and believed the Virgin Mary intervened and prevented his death.</p>
<p>Who commissioned the murder attempt remains controversial. In late March 2005 documents originating from the former Soviet states seemed to indicate that the <a href="../../../k/g/b/KGB_8668.html" title="KGB">KGB</a> was responsible for setting up the attack (<i>Deutsche Welle</i>, 2005, <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1538173,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1538173,00.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>), although this is disputed. Speculations about the possible motives of the alleged Soviet conspiracy abound. Perhaps the Soviets were afraid of the effect of the Polish pope on the stability of its Eastern European Soviet satellites, particularly Poland. Other speculation has accused factions in the Vatican, especially the so-called "freemason" faction, opposed to Wojtyła and <a href="../../../o/p/u/Opus_Dei_ef15.html" title="Opus Dei">Opus Dei</a>, of which Cardinal Casaroli was a leading figure.</p>
<p>Ali Ağca himself remains reticent to disclose the truth about the origins of his assassination attempt, although he has often hinted that he received some help from inside the Vatican. Finally, whoever the commissioner was, it has been suggested that Ağca, an excellent marksman, would have killed the Pope if he had intended to do so, and that his mission was to scare the Pope rather than to kill him. However, no definitive evidence of these things has yet come to light.</p>
<p>In November <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, Serghiei Ivanov Antonov, an officer of the Bulgarian airline <i>Balkan air</i> was arrested as the "Bulgarian plot" was investigated.</p>
<p>He and two other Bulgarian agents were later acquitted by an Italian Criminal court (1986 and 1987) for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Two days after the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> of 1983, John Paul visited the prison where his would-be assassin was being held. The two spoke privately for some time. John Paul II said of the meeting, "What we talked about will have to remain a secret between him and me. I spoke to him as a brother whom I have pardoned and who has my complete trust."</p>
<p>Another assassination attempt took place on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_12.html" title="May 12">12 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, in <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fatima%2C_Portugal_82d9.html" title="Fatima, Portugal">Fatima, Portugal</a> when a man tried to stab John Paul II with a <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayonet.html" title="Bayonet">bayonet</a>, but was stopped by security guards. The assailant, an ultraconservative Spanish <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priest.html" title="Priest">priest</a> named <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Mar%C3%ADa_Fern%C3%A1ndez_y_Krohn_a312.html" title="Juan María Fernández y Krohn">Juan María Fernández y Krohn</a>, reportedly opposed the reforms of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Vatican_Council_623f.html" title="Second Vatican Council">Second Vatican Council</a> and called the pope an "agent of Moscow." He served a six-year sentence that was followed by his expulsion from Portugal.</p>
<p>The Pope and some Catholics believe that the assumption of the papacy by Karol Wojtyła was predicted decades earlier by <a href="../../../p/i/o/Pio_of_Pietrelcina_5704.html" title="Pio of Pietrelcina">Padre Pio</a>. The same <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capuchin_friar.html" title="Capuchin friar">Capuchin friar</a> also predicted that Wojtyła's reign would be brief and end bloodily, a prophecy that the latter's shooting almost vindicated. The Vatican and the Pope believed that the assassination attempt was also predicted in the third secret of the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Secrets_of_Fatima_c4d1.html" title="Three Secrets of Fatima">Three Secrets of Fatima</a> (Bertone, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000626_message-fatima_en.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000626_message-fatima_en.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>).</p>

<p>As the youngest pope elected since <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Pius_IX_2d2b.html" title="Pope Pius IX">Pope Pius IX</a> in 1846, John Paul II entered the papacy as a healthy, relatively young man who hiked, swam and went skiing. However, after over twenty-five years on the papal throne, the 1981 assassination attempt, and a number of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> scares, John Paul's physical health declined. He had a <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tumor.html" title="Tumor">tumour</a> removed from his <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colon_%28anatomy%29.html" title="Colon (anatomy)">colon</a> in 1992, dislocated his shoulder in 1993, broke his <a href="../../../f/e/m/Femur.html" title="Femur">femur</a> in 1994, and had his <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermiform_appendix.html" title="Vermiform appendix">appendix</a> removed in 1996.</p>
<p>An <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthopedic_surgery.html" title="Orthopedic surgery">orthopaedic surgeon</a> confirmed in 2001 that Pope John Paul II was suffering from <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson%27s_disease.html" title="Parkinson's disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, as international observers had suspected for some time; this was acknowledged publicly by the Vatican in 2003. He had difficulty speaking more than a few sentences at a time, as well as trouble hearing. He also developed severe <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthritis.html" title="Arthritis">arthritis</a> in his right knee following a hip replacement, and therefore rarely walked in public. Nevertheless, he continued to tour the world. Those who met him late in his life said that although physically he was in poor shape, mentally he remained fully alert.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his Papacy, there were those both within and outside the church who thought that the Pope should resign or retire. Even <a href="../../../t/e/r/Term_limits.html" title="Term limits">term limits</a> for Popes were suggested. However, as John Paul had indicated his acceptance of God's will that he should be Pope, he was determined to stay in office until his death, although his private papers show that he gave resignation serious consideration in 2002.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">1 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, the Pope was taken to the <a href="../../../a/g/o/Agostino_Gemelli_University_Polyclinic_93dd.html" title="Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic">Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic</a> in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> suffering from acute inflammation of the <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larynx.html" title="Larynx">larynx</a> and laryngo-spasm, brought on by a bout of <a href="../../../i/n/f/Influenza.html" title="Influenza">influenza</a>. The Vatican reported the following day that his condition had stabilised, but he would remain in the hospital until fully recovered. The pope appeared in public on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">6 February</a> to deliver the final lines of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelus.html" title="Angelus">Angelus blessing</a> in a hoarse voice from the window of his hospital room.

He raised his hand and attempted to say something, but his doctors advised him not to try speaking. The Pope gave 'silent blessings' from his hospital window on Sunday <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_27.html" title="February 27">27 February</a> and Sunday <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_6.html" title="March 6">6 March</a>, and is said to have spoken in German and Italian during a working meeting with Cardinal Ratzinger (later <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>) in his 10th floor suite of the Gemelli on Tuesday <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">1 March</a>.

I brought the Holy Father greetings from the plenary of the Congregation for the divine cult, which is meeting at this moment in the Vatican. The Holy Father will be working on material, which I gave him today. I am happy to see him fully lucid and mentally capable of saying the essential matters with his own voice. We usually speak in German. The details are unimportant--he spoke of essential matters."</p>
<p>During the Angelus of Sunday <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">13 March</a> The Pope was able to speak to pilgrims for the first time since he was readmitted to hospital. Later that day he returned to the Vatican for the first time in nearly a month. (<i>BBC News</i>, March 13, 2005 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4344923.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4344923.stm" rel="nofollow">link</a>) On Palm Sunday (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">20 March</a>) the Pope made a brief appearance at his window to greet pilgrims. He was cheered by thousands of the faithful as he silently waved an olive branch. It was the first time in his pontificate that he could not officiate at <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palm_Sunday_ff40.html" title="Palm Sunday">Palm Sunday</a> Mass. He watched it on his TV in his apartment overlooking <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Peter%27s_Square_5963.html" title="St Peter's Square">St Peter's Square</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">22 March</a>, there were renewed concerns for the Pope's health after reports stated that he had taken a turn for the worse and was not responding to medication (Lorenzi, March 22, 2005 <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20050321/popeill.html" class="external text" title="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20050321/popeill.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>). On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_24.html" title="March 24">24 March</a>, Colombian Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo performed the rite of the washing of the feet, in the Vatican's St Peter's Basilica. The cardinal stood in for Pope John Paul II at a Holy Thursday ceremony at the Vatican. He said the ailing Pontiff was 'serenely abandoning' himself to God's will. The Pope, whose health was precarious following the throat surgery in February, watched the service on television from his Vatican apartments. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_27.html" title="March 27">27 March</a>, Easter day, the Pope appeared at his window in the Vatican for a short time. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelo_Sodano_1c49.html" title="Angelo Sodano">Angelo Sodano</a> read the <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urbi_et_Orbi_3b16.html" title="Urbi et Orbi">Urbi et Orbi</a> message while the Pope blessed the people with his own hand.

<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">1 April</a>, his condition worsened drastically, with his heart and kidneys rapidly failing. The Pope had been fitted with a second feeding tube in his nose to help boost his nutritional intake as a result of his fever. Reports out of the Vatican early that morning reported that the Pope had suffered a heart attack, but remained awake. (D'Emilio, 2005 <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=514&amp;u=/ap/20050401/ap_on_re_eu/pope_5" class="external text" title="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=514&amp;u=/ap/20050401/ap_on_re_eu/pope_5" rel="nofollow">link</a>). Vatican spokesperson Joaquin Navarro-Valls denied the reports of the heart attack, but said the Pope had suffered a "cardio-circulatory collapse" and called the Pope's condition "very serious" (<i>CNN</i>, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_2.html" title="April 2">2 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/01/pope1/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/01/pope1/index.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>).</p>
<p>Several Italian media agencies reported the Pope's death at 20:20 CEST (18:20 UTC), but soon afterwards, the Vatican denied that the Pope was indeed dead, and stories changed. TV Sky Italia reported that his heart and brain were functioning.</p>

He refused to be taken to the hospital, and met with his closest associates, among them Cardinal Ratzinger, who said, "he knows that he is dying and he gave me his last goodbye." The Pope also requested that he be read the meditations said on the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stations_of_the_Cross_8b48.html" title="Stations of the Cross">Stations of the Cross</a> a few days before.</p>
<p>His final hours were marked by an overwhelming number of younger people who kept <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigil.html" title="Vigil">vigil</a> outside his <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apostolic_Palace_1c1d.html" title="Apostolic Palace">Vatican</a> apartments. In his last message, specifically to the youth of the world, he said: "I have looked for you. Now you have come to me. And I thank you."</p>
<p>Early in the evening, the Vatican announced that his condition "remains very serious. In late morning, the high fever developed." However, "when addressed by members of his household, he responds correctly."</p>
<p>At approximately 19:00 CEST (17:00 UTC), Italian news sources claimed that Pope John Paul II had lost consciousness. At least one medical centre stated that there was no more hope for him. The Vatican published a press release refuting the claim but conceding the Pope's kidneys had stopped functioning. The ANSA news agency reported around half an hour later that he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>According to Father Jarek Cielecki, the Pope's last word before death was "Amen"; then he closed his eyes.

The title "The Great" has so far been reserved to two popes from the first millennium, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Leo_I_9fd6.html" title="Pope Leo I">Leo the Great</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Gregory_I_367c.html" title="Pope Gregory I">Gregory the Great</a>. Scholars of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_law_%28Catholic_Church%29_f10e.html" title="Canon law (Catholic Church)">Canon law</a> state that there is no official process for declaring a pope "Great"; the title establishes itself through popular, and continued, usage.</p>

<p>The death of Pope John Paul II set into motion centuries-old <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritual.html" title="Ritual">rituals</a> and traditions dating back to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> times: crushing of the <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_of_the_Fisherman_4ea3.html" title="Ring of the Fisherman">Ring of the Fisherman</a>, solemn procession from the Apostolic Palace through St. Peter's Square, <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funeral_of_Pope_John_Paul_II_0d86.html#Mass_of_Repose" title="Funeral of Pope John Paul II">Mass of Repose</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funeral_of_Pope_John_Paul_II_0d86.html#Rite_of_Visitation" title="Funeral of Pope John Paul II">Rite of Visitation</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funeral_of_Pope_John_Paul_II_0d86.html#Mass_of_Requiem" title="Funeral of Pope John Paul II">Mass of Requiem</a>, and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interment.html" title="Interment">interment</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/e/s/Testament_of_Pope_John_Paul_II_7293.html" title="Testament of Pope John Paul II">Testament of Pope John Paul II</a> published on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_7.html" title="April 7">7 April</a> revealed that the pontiff contemplated being buried in his native Poland but left the final decision to The College of Cardinals. The College of Cardinals in passing preferred burial beneath St. Peter's Basilica, honouring the pontiff's request to be placed "in bare earth."</p>
<p>The Rite of Visitation took place from <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_4.html" title="April 4">4 April</a> and extended through the morning of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_8.html" title="April 8">8 April</a> at St. Peter's Basilica. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_8.html" title="April 8">8 April</a>, 10:00 a.m. CEST (08:00 UTC), the Mass of Requiem was offered by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger by virtue of his office as Dean of the College of Cardinals. It was concelebrated by the College of Cardinals and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch.html" title="Patriarch">patriarchs</a> of the Eastern Rite. After being sealed in three <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casket.html" title="Casket">caskets</a>, Pope John Paul II was interred in the grottoes under the basilica, the Tomb of the Popes. He was lowered into the <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomb.html" title="Tomb">tomb</a> vacated by <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_XXIII_ce7b.html" title="Pope John XXIII">Pope John XXIII</a>, who was moved by Pope John Paul II for <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatification.html" title="Beatification">beatification</a>.</p>
<p>The funeral was the largest gathering of dignitaries gathered at one event. Security considerations were of primary concern and the Italian Military was put on high alert to ensure safety and prevention of a terrorist attack and to control the expected crowd of over 2 million people.</p>
