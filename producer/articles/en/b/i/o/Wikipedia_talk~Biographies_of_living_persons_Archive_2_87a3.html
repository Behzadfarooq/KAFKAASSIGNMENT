<dd>The list of criteria reads as an "if all" list, not an "if any one" list. That is, you can include information only if all five criteria are met. Adding this would either impose a further restriction (if it remained an "if all" list), or would require some rewrite to the rest of the list.

I worry that it will just encourage disputes and will lead to ill will when other editors remove the content as irrelevant.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed change re primary sources</span></h2>
<p>I want to make a change to the portion of this guideline that says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Material from primary sources should generally not be used. For example, public records may include personal details such as home value, outcomes of civil court cases, traffic citations, arrest records, and vehicles and real estate owned. Use material only from reliable third-party sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think it makes sense to exclude primary sources. One does not improve informaiton by passing it from ear to ear. I do think there are <b>specific</b> things that should not be taken from primary sources, including a person's home value or vehicles owned. Court cases should be allowable as these are often part of what makes the person notable enough to be in Wikipedia. This is not the case for the value of their house or their income tax records and the like. I propose changing this statement to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Material from primary sources should be used with care. For example, public records that include personal details such as home value, traffic citations, vehicle registrations and home or business addresses. Material that is related to their notability, such as court filings of someone notable in part for being involved in legal disputes, are allowable, as are records such as graduation dates, dates of marriage licenses and the like, where they are publically available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to get consensus to make this change. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 04:55, 29 June 2006 (UTC)<br />
Here by the way is just one example of a primary source document <a href="http://ast.faa.gov/pdf/20060622_Draft_EA_As_Published.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://ast.faa.gov/pdf/20060622_Draft_EA_As_Published.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which could be useful in a biography of a living person, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Bezos_4881.html" title="Jeff Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a>. It is an FAA report for his planned new <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_tourism.html" title="Space tourism">space tourism</a> venture, obtained directly from the federal government (the primary) source, and considered to be public domain. I don't think "primary sources" are the problem, I think revealing "certain types of informaiton", such as a person's home phone number or address is the problem, regardless of whether we are citing a primary or secondary source. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 07:06, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see (at the moment) a flaw with your example case, but I oppose your wording. If nobody has written about something, we should definitely not cover it at all, even if primary sources can verify the facts. For instance, even if a famous person's criminal record is accessible on a public web site, we should not write about it, if nobody else has. Often "public records" are "hidden in plain sight". Often nobody has put the pieces together. It's not our role to discover/expose things. I don't want the enemy of a person to come to Wikipedia, to tell the world about a court case, that no newspaper saw fit to print. Rather than us deciding what should be notable, we should find what reliable sources have found to be notable (by writing prose about the subject). However, if reliable media has covered something broadly, but failed to give the "low level details" we want, than certainly, it's ok for us to go "straight to the source". Also, for trivial/uncontested things, like an alumni lists at a college, primary sources can be fine.--<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 07:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With repsect, I think that the two of you are misinterpretting <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I would say that <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> would prohibit attending the court-room to write your own story about what happened during the proceedings, and it would prohibit calling up the lawyers involved or e-mailing the judge and then using those conversations for the article - but I don't see it at prohibiting any type of online research.

<dd>A special issue with biographies and primary sources such as court records is assuring that the reference concerns the subject and not a similarly-named person. Another concern is with court papers, such as divorce filings, which make unrebutted and unsupported accusations.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Families</span></h2>
<p>I would like to propose the addition of the following section to the guidelines. In part this has been prompted by a number of complaints and comments coming in via OTRS which, I believe, have merit and support the "do no harm" of the current policy.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Privacy of family</b></dd>
<dd>Wikipedia includes details of siblings, children, and life partners for some famous people, but including this information for most living people should be handled with caution. While many well-known living persons' family relationships are widely known and available to the public, the same is not always true for marginally notable people or non-public figures. With issues about chidren's security, and with identity theft on the rise, the privacy of such details should be carefully considered prior to their inclusion in an article. In general please err on the side of caution and simply list the number of siblings and of children rather than their names and ages.</dd>

<p>What is going to be the process for reporting misinterpretation or abuse of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>? Since editors employing it are exempt from 3RR, where will removal of material referenced to reliable sources be reported?</p>
<p>I understand the necessity of aggressively combatting unsourced innuendo and negative criticism about living persons, but this policy is being used to remove text, referenced to reliable sources, from <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_233d.html" title="Criticism of Hugo ChÃ¡vez">Criticism of Hugo ChÃ¡vez</a>.

<p>So, where are questions about the applicability of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> raised, and where does one take 3RR issues if the editors believe they are exempt from 3RR? Strong application of this policy is unquestionably necessary; but the potential for abuse in order to stifle referenced criticism is also a problem. Can the wording be tightened up to make it clear that text referenced to reliable sources is not subject to 3RR, and will there be a means of addressing misinterpretation of WP:BLP? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 15:29, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The 3RR exception on BPL refers to criticism that is "unsourced or poorly sourced". The examples you provided do not fall within the scope of that exception. Note that the first example needs attribution, otherwise it reads as an assertion of fact. You could NPOV that as follows:

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What about excessively positive information?</span></h2>
<p>The policy says, in different ways in in different places: "Unsourced or poorly sourced negative material about living persons should be removed immediately from both the article and the talk page". OK, but what about unsourced or poorly sourced <i>positive</i> material, especially if it amounts to cheerleading a controversial figure? I can imagine a fan putting fulsome praise in a bio, without balance (the current policy would discourage an attempt to provide balance, although it would allow toning down the excess); it could even be specifically objectionable when the subject has a well-known antagonist who is implicitly referred to. For the policy to focus on negative material seems so...<i>asymmetrical</i> (apart, of course, from the practical concerns of unsourced negatives attracting libel claims).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed change re primary sources</span></h2>
<p><i>Note: I am restoring this archived talk information in order to continue the discussion and reach a consensus on this.</i> I want to make a change to the portion of this guideline that says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Material from primary sources should generally not be used. For example, public records may include personal details such as home value, outcomes of civil court cases, traffic citations, arrest records, and vehicles and real estate owned. Use material only from reliable third-party sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think it makes sense to exclude primary sources. One does not improve informaiton by passing it from ear to ear. I do think there are <b>specific</b> things that should not be taken from primary sources, including a person's home value or vehicles owned. Court cases should be allowable as these are often part of what makes the person notable enough to be in Wikipedia. This is not the case for the value of their house or their income tax records and the like. I propose changing this statement to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Material from primary sources should be used with care. For example, public records that include personal details such as home value, traffic citations, vehicle registrations and home or business addresses. Material that is related to their notability, such as court filings of someone notable in part for being involved in legal disputes, are allowable, as are records such as graduation dates, dates of marriage licenses and the like, where they are publically available.</p>

<dd>I don't see (at the moment) a flaw with your example case, but I oppose your wording. If nobody has written about something, we should definitely not cover it at all, even if primary sources can verify the facts. For instance, even if a famous person's criminal record is accessible on a public web site, we should not write about it, if nobody else has. Often "public records" are "hidden in plain sight". Often nobody has put the pieces together. It's not our role to discover/expose things. I don't want the enemy of a person to come to Wikipedia, to tell the world about a court case, that no newspaper saw fit to print. Rather than us deciding what should be notable, we should find what reliable sources have found to be notable (by writing prose about the subject). However, if reliable media has covered something broadly, but failed to give the "low level details" we want, than certainly, it's ok for us to go "straight to the source". Also, for trivial/uncontested things, like an alumni lists at a college, primary sources can be fine.--<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 07:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline">new proposed wording</span></h3>
<p>In consideration of the above discussion, I would like to offer the following ammended wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Material from primary sources should be used with care. For example, public records that include personal details such as home value, traffic citations, vehicle registrations and home or business addresses should not generally be used. Where a fact is verifiable by a notable source, it is acceptable to turn to open records as primary sources. Material that is related to their notability, such as court filings of someone notable in part for being involved in legal disputes, are allowable, as are public records such as graduation dates, dates of marriage licenses and the like, where they are publically available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here by the way is just one example of a primary source document <a href="http://ast.faa.gov/pdf/20060622_Draft_EA_As_Published.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://ast.faa.gov/pdf/20060622_Draft_EA_As_Published.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> which could be useful in a biography of a living person, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Bezos_4881.html" title="Jeff Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a>.

<dd>This would not allow original research. This would be relying on information from public sources. Saying "I saw Joe Blow growing marijuana in his back-yard." would be original research.

<dd>Johntex, I don't think there is a way to word your proposal that doesn't open the door to original research. I'm sorry the example that I can provide is in Spanish, but it's the best I can do. <a href="http://www.el-nacional.com/referencia/documentos/pdf/Listadeimputados.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.el-nacional.com/referencia/documentos/pdf/Listadeimputados.pdf" rel="nofollow">This pdf is allegedly a "list"</a> of people who signed "some version of something" in Venezuela. Defining exactly what these people signed under what circumstances is where it gets tricky, and OR comes in, as some of these signatures were attached to blank pages of what appears to be a "guestbook". This is a public document. It is used now in at least 3 articles on Wiki to disparage the character of a living person. Yet, there is no journalistic or reliable source commentary which explains what this "list" was, how some people came to sign it, provide context for this list, or provide the signers' explanations for how, when or where they signed this "list" (which was actually a guestbook, according to some accounts). The same editors who are misinterpreting <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> in a way that allows them to cleanse <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_233d.html" title="Criticism of Hugo ChÃ¡vez">Criticism of Hugo ChÃ¡vez</a>, are using this "list" â not discussed in any journalist context â as criticism of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mar%C3%ADa_Corina_Machado_9426.html" title="MarÃ­a Corina Machado">MarÃ­a Corina Machado</a>, a pro-democracy advocate in Venezuela. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is already being used incorrectly: your proposal allows for further misuse. I agree with others above who say this proposal has no wings.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Third attempt</span></h3>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who has commented, I have tightened up the wording again to make it even more clear that primary documents should be used only after a notable, verifiable seconday source has reported the information originally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Material from primary sources should be used with care. For example, public records that include personal details such as home value, traffic citations, vehicle registrations and home or business addresses should not generally be used. Where a fact has first been presented by a verifiable secondary source, it is acceptable to turn to open records as primary sources to augment the secondary source. Material that is related to their notability, such as court filings of someone notable in part for being involved in legal disputes, are allowable, as are public records such as graduation dates, dates of marriage licenses and the like, where they are publically available and where that information has first been reported by a verifiable seconday source</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this makes very clear that we are encouraging use of primary sources only once a secondary source has deemed the primary material to be relevant. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 20:31, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I agree with FloNight. But -- and I know this is not the main issue here, but since we're talking about wording -- how about changing the two instances of "verifiable, notable" to "reliable" or perhaps "verifiable"? My impression is that we generally avoid saying "notable" in official policy, because it's a less well-defined concept than reliability or verifiability.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal: No first biographies</span></h2>
<p>Pardon me if this has already been suggested elsewhere, but, I have what seems like a excellent guideline to determine if an article on a person should be permitted in Wikipedia: <b>Only allow an article if it cites an <i>existing</i>, published biography of the subject</b>. That's it. We could add it to CSD. It would allow articles on anyone famous enough to have biographies already written on them, but would stop people like Angela from having to have articles on them (at least until someone writes a bio on Angela). And it leads to a perfect reply to people who object to having their articles deleted - "Go get this published elsewhere, and then come back. We'll be happy to have the article then."

Is an obit a bio? (though that'd be a different policy, I suppose) What about spouses of notable people who are included in a partner's bio? Would the bio have to be published in a reliable source, or just anywhere? I'd guess, offhand, that a policy like this would effect half of our articles about living people, possibly much more if constructed strictly.

<dd>These are good questions. I would answer them as follows: A news article (or a full book) <i>on the person</i> would be a bio, but a paragraph on them in an article (or book) on something else would not be. A resume is not a bio, because it is written by (or on request of) the subject; neither is an "about us" profile for the same reason. An obit <b>is</b> a bio as it is a news article on the person. A spouse would not have a seperate article unless there was a seperate bio about them. Bios would have to be published by reliable sources, although we might be gentle about that at first. I do believe that this might affect a large number of our existing articles, but I think a large number of our existing articles should not exist as seperate articles, so that's a feature, not a bug.&#160;;-) I think I'll pick 20 random entries from <a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> and see what percentage I think would be unacceptable under this policy. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 20:08, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would describe it as being primarily about the work he did to merit the award. Biographical content other than that specific work is this paragraph "Mr. Finkelstein grew up in the Bronx, where his interest in cryptography was fostered by Sherlock Holmes tales and newspaper cryptograms. He studied mathematics and physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the goal of becoming a theoretical physicist. When he was rejected by all the top graduate physics programs, he said, he turned to computer programming as a job that paid the bills. But he finds that his technical skills have more meaning in urgent social debates."

<dd>I did my own quick survey, picking the last name on the first column of the BLP category for each letter of the alphabet. Excluding official websites, very few have 3rd-party bios listed. Quite a few articles are about performers or athletes whose works or stats are (presumably) published on IMDB or relevant sports pages (some of which label their player stats pages "biography"). Several more look like there must be a bio somewhere (such as the current head of government for a tiny nation, a past U.S. state governor and ambassador, and the deputy prime minister of a major country). I found one person with a long profile of his profesional career in a reputable journal, but which didn't have anything about him outside of his work. Lastly, I came across some criminals with official indictments, etc. So, there are many notable people who do not have their presumed bios cited, there are many notable people for whom we only have information on their professional careers, and quite a few for whom we have reliable info, but no bio. Out of 26 entries I'd say only about five would qualify under strict construction. I didn't see any biographies that were obvious candidates forAfD under current policies. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 20:43, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks, I'm currently about halfway through my similar search (I'm also using the top entries in each column, but I'm using the 2nd and 3rd columns of each letter, rather than the first), and I'm doing what I can to <i>find</i> bios even when they arn't listed. But I have also noticed this - there are many people generally considered "notable" where there is no easily available bio that I'm aware of. I'll publish my results here when I've finished them. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 21:58, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A minor, but very significant point: is it intended that this proposal only be applied to biographies of <i>living</i> people? (Its placement here would suggest so, but this wouldn't necessarily be the case if it were made a CSD or something similar.) If not, it will basically obliterate our coverage of ancient and medieval figures; <i>very</i> few of them have their own dedicated biographies, and most get only sections in a larger work, at best. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 22:37, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, I hadn't intended it to apply to dead people. Second, you remind me, "sections in a larger work" would count as a biography, assuming they were <i>about the person</i>; i.e. if there was a book on "Major Afgahani Religious Leaders", each of the leaders who had an entry would be considered to have a bio for purposes of this. Thanks for provoking me to clarify this. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 06:36, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think it is too restrictive. Sometimes, what makes a person worth an article may be a paragraph here, half an article there, appearance in 10 different lists, etc. They don't need to have one whole biography on them to be notable. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:02, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am saddened to see this comment. If the <i>only</i> reliable sources available about a person are "a paragraph here, half an article there" and "appearance in 10 different lists" - then we don't have enough to write a good article on them without doing original research, i.e. synthesizing the fragments of sources into a meaningful whole. Such a synthesis is the essense of original research, and something we should specifically avoid doing. To write about <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Earnhardt%2C_Jr._b630.html" title="Dale Earnhardt, Jr.">Dale Earnhardt, Jr.</a>, there is no need to create a novel synthesis; to write about someone who cannot be documented except in "a paragraph here, half an article there" requires such. Someone like that certainly may be notable, but we can't write a good article on them without breaking our principles. If you want to write about such people, please do - <b>elsewhere</b>. Again, it saddens and depresses me to see such a comment. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 06:36, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think it's a novel synthesis if we find the name of a politician (for example) in the alumni lists of his alma maters and to use those to say that he attended X, Y, and Z. Nor is it novel synthesis if we use other sources, that don't mention his schools, to reference that he divorced his spouse in 1998, or yet other sources to say that he voted in favor of a budget measure, source which neither mention his divorce nor his education. It isn't novel synthesis to list the events in a person's life, so long as we don't make unsubstantiated leaps, such as assuming that the John Smith who graduated from LSU is the same as the one who received the Medal of Honor, or other unsourced conclusions. Every featured bio we have synthesizes numerous sources, and probably every one synthizes the material in a novel manner (without engaging in original research, of of course). Saying, on our own account, that A + B =C is a violation of original research. But concatenating A=B, A=C, and A=D is not. This view of biography would require that each subject have a totally-complete published biography already available. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:00, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're mixing two very different things. We are allowed to create "novel synthesis", that's what an "Editor" does, they "Edit".

<dd>I mispoke above. We are certainly allowed to use primary sources which have not been previously used in secondary sources. The bar on primary sources is that they "have been published by a reliable publisher" as stated on the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guideline page. Although it also states we *should* not use them, it does not forbid their use, except in requiring publication by a reliable publisher.

<p>As for the many sports stats, and factoids about band members - this proposal is not to remove them, but merely to change how they are indexed, moving them from names (through which they are very unlikely to be found) to the groups of which they are a part, teams, bands, etc. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 06:36, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am one hundred and twelve percent against this proposal. In fact I can't think of a single page I've worked on (extensively) where I cite a published bio. And to address a misunderstanding of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, synthesis is not original research in the wiki-sense. It is merely "editing" which it what we're supposed to do. Our job is not a strictly mechanical one of cutting-and-pasting with an occasional "and", "after", or "but" thrown in. We are also supposed to be weaving various sources together into something coherent. We are, as I see it, allowed to create bios on people who had no previous bio, from synthecizing the various materials we find, into one whole piece. Actually a overly simplistic reading would be fairly close to plagarism unless our articles are to be filled with quotation marks and footnotes. I would also point out that the Encyclopaedia Brittanica itself has some bios for people who had no previous bio, so there's your standard <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.png_3237.html" class="image" title="image:smile.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/2/26/Smile.png" alt="image:smile.png" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.png_3237.html" /></a> <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 06:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I very much SUPPORT the proposal of "no first bios (of LIVING persons)." (though I dont't think it goes far enough, still, it's a long way down the correct road). It helps automatically take care of the notability problem, as has been pointed out. And in doing so it helps against the tendency for "notability creep," which is rapidly making Wikipedia a central repository for personal information on any person who is mentioned in more than one place in the media, which soon enough (nod to Andy Warhol's 15 minutes) will include just about all of us. And newspapers are only as immortal as their morgue files, electronic or otherwise. Wikipedia (by whatever name it's many progeny come to have) is forever. Kindness standards need to be set NOW. Otherwise, folks, what goes around, will come around. To a town near you. To your families.

<li>Slam dunk, mega-hard support this proposal. Add an absolute veto to the subject (if living), and my support burns brighter than an A0 star. The current framework will inevitably lead to Wikipedia being hammered hard by someone who will not accept the usual "give us a chance to make it right" platitudes; it is a system (accidently) designed to fail, despite the best efforts of everyone here. This proposal reduces these risks tremoundously, and (as Sbharris notes), resolves many other issues in this touchy area ... and we obtain all these results at negligible cost. What is there to dislike about it? <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 18:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I very much oppose this proposal. As compared with any other reference work, Wikipedia has many, many more contributors. As compared with printed works, Wikipedia has virtually no space problem. These differences allow us to, in some cases, be the first or only source with a biography of a particular person. This is an <i>advantage</i>. The proposal would exclude from Wikipedia all articles in which we exploit this advantage to provide more comprehensive information to our readers. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 18:06, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Don't you know somebody who might like to, for some reason? Or will, in the future? Aren't you ever planning to do anything at all notable in your life? Ever? As available space for bio material expands, notability criteria <i>falls</i> to allow expansion of bio material to meet it. Parkinson's law in action. Which has already been operating here, as has been noted correctly by opposing factions, to produce many, many bios on WP (100,000 and counting) which there is simply no space for, in Britannica (and therefore which have been left out of Britannica because they aren't NOTABLE enough to go there).

<dd>In any case, the issue should be less terror that treating other people as article subjects, as you'd like to be treated if YOU were the article subject. Most Wikipedians would NOT want to be the targets of an unauthorized net biography, even a totally bland one. If they don't EVEN edit under their real names and general locations, you know that they value privacy a LOT. But even so, strangely, most Wikipedians are not supporting the idea of authorization of bios because it's not their ox being gored. They wouldn't like it themselves, but they feel safe due to lack of notability, and if it's happening to somebody else, so what? Jimbo, of course, has total effective control and veto over the content of his own Wiki bio, so he lives in a bubble on the issue. In effect, he ALREADY benefits from the policy which I think should extend to everybody. So, given this state, we're destined to see "notability" (whatever that means) drop in criteria toward the point that 51% of Wikipedians still don't feel threatened by an unauthorized bio which they have no control over. Of course, I also predict that long before that, the feces will contact the rotary air circulation device, and policy here on BLP will need to be changed. I read in the Wiki on <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a> that the A.P. press has calculated the 95% of libel suits toward newspapers come not from high profile stories, but from local criminal and business reporting.

<dd>Since I don't want to repeat myself: the synopsis is that "public" information is not a black and white thing. Something "published" in an obscure newspaper years ago, or some public record only available in a court building and not accessable to google, is not PUBLIC in the same way as something that gets into your Wiki bio and is available in 10 seconds on an internet cellphone. Ordinarily it takes work to find out if you said something indiscrete to the officer while being arrest for drunk driving. But that info wound up in Mel Gibson's Wikibio in about 24 hours. That kind of loss of privacy is coming to all. Very slowly, like RFID tags, and in a "top down" sort of way. Like having to be finger or thumbprinted for some reason. But coming. Remember how they told you your SSN would never be used as an ID number? They changed their minds.</dd>
<dd>Jimbo has experienced this. His involvement in the ahem "erotica" business would not be "public" knowledge if it weren't in his Wiki and if he hadn't tried to screw with it, and got caught. He had to put it back or face hypocrisy charges, but his Wiki treatment still isn't as vicious as Gibson's is, or that yours or mine would be, if we happened to become "notable" for ANY reason (even a good reason). In fact, as Jimbo should well know, this kind of thing feeds on itself. Jimbo's porn question wasn't notable (or really PUBLIC in any way that mattered) UNTIL it got to his wiki, and magazines and the standard publication industry picked it up as a controversy. NOW it IS too notable not to leave out of his Wiki bio, but that's BECAUSE of the Wiki bio ITSELF. Wups. But there's a LESSON there. Alas, it seems not to have been learned institutionally. And I can't seem to get it across, either.

<dd>You may wish to recall that there is a big, wide, world beyond Wikipedia's server farm. Said world has rules and laws and men with guns to back them up, and no amount of editing here will change this (let alone the rules). What this means is that, in effect, what you (or anyone else here) thinks about "privacy" (or similar) doesn't really amount to much. All that matters is what will happen in court, the day WP manages to piss off someone who (a) will not be sweet-talked by Jimbo Wales or the army of anonymous editors bleating their refrain "give us a chance!" and (b) has the means to sue Wikipedia into peonage. BLP's are so <i>wickedly important</i> for this single reason: just one (1) successful suit can destroy the entire project, not just a single biographical article.

<dd>Sbharris I think you've made your point pretty clear. Welcome to the world we actually live in today, instead of the world we used to live in 20 years ago. You can be a <a href="../../../l/u/d/Luddite.html" title="Luddite">Luddite</a> but I don't think you're going to get much sympathy unless you unplug your computer and start making your own cheese in a barrel. Your exaggeration is that my bio is going to start announcing when I brush my teeth, how much I weigh, and whether I've ever kicked my dog. This simply isn't going to happen. However if I've ever done hard time in prison, writen a phamplet on overthrowing the government, or been attacked in an newspaper op-ed from 15 years ago, simply *is* relevant to my bio. Attacking editors for doggedly citing sources is a bit disengenious. That is exactly what we *want* this wiki to become. Tiredly rehashing information that everybody already knows from their history book is what we dont want it to become. I found the exact date on which <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Roosevelt_f19f.html" title="Anna Roosevelt">Anna Roosevelt</a> divorced her first husband... *gasp* Oh no! Her loss of privacy! Self-spank. I didn't include that it was on grounds of "extreme cruelty".

<p>Strangely, my answer to you seems to have disappeared into the aether. Wikipedia already practices personal-veto for a lot of bio material of "marginally-notable" people, such as birthdays:</p>
<p><i>Wikipedia includes exact birthdates for some famous people, but including this information for most living people should be handled with caution. While many well-known living persons' exact birthdays are widely known and available to the public, the same is not always true for marginally notable people or non-public figures. With identity theft on the rise, it has become increasingly common for people to consider their exact date of birth to be private information. When in doubt about the notability of the person in question, or if the subject of a biography complains about the publication of his or her date of birth, err on the side of caution and simply list the year of birth rather than the exact date.</i></p>
<p>Note that the reason given is "identity theft," which is silly given the stakes, here. You can lose worse than your money by being the target of a bio with well-documented negative info (look at Mel Gibson). To quote Iago in Othello:</p>
<p>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls: Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing; 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands: But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed.</p>

Where will this process end? What % of people are <i>inherently</i> less than "semi-notable", meaning they've never been in the news or had enough public documentation about them to make a short bio interesting? 90%? 60%? 51%?

<dd>Wikipedia has grown at an even exponential pace since Jan 2003, with an 11 month doubling time. If bios keep up with that (and I have no reason to assume they won't), that means we reach your 200 million bio count in 10 years, in 2016. Of course, that's global and the % of people bio'd will be far higher than the mean 1% in many countries, just as it's far out of proportion from the global mean % number now. In any case, I want a hard number from you. At what point, if the pace of of bio article creation fails to break from exponential, will you admit that you are wrong, and that this is going to go "all the way" unless actively stopped? <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 23:27, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Better to ask what the biographical articles:other articles ratio is at Britannica, and state why the ratio should be remarkably different here. But even if we accept your figure, let me be the first to point out that it will be impossible to police 200 million articles for WP:BLP violations: the current policy framework simply will not scale. <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 13:42, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">General information about the person</span></h2>
<p>The current policy says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are nevertheless entitled to the respect for privacy afforded non-public figures. In such cases, editors should exercise restraint and include only information relevant to their notability. Material from primary sources should generally not be used unless it has fist been mentioned by a verifiable source. (see above)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe the wording,<i>"include only information relevant to their notability"</i>, if interpreted too literally, would be damaging to the idea of presenting a rounded view of the person. For example, we would have to exlude things like what they do for a living if it is not what they are famous for, maritial status, where they grew up, where they went to school, awards they have won if they are not the primary reason the person is notable...etc. If the person is best known because of something negative, we would be running the risk of biasing their article too far to the negative.<br />
Theefore, I propose changing this to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are nevertheless entitled to the respect for privacy afforded non-public figures. In such cases, editors should be particularly careful about using <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable sources</a>. Material from primary sources should generally not be used unless it has fist been mentioned by a verifiable source. (see above).</p>

<p>If the information meets WP:V, then that means a reputable source has thought it notable.

<li>Johntex, there are good reasons to exclude some of the information you listed. Many of these non-public notable people are flashes in the pan. They will not have ongoing coverage of their lives.

<dd>Hi Flo Night - even in today's topsy-turvy world where people change jobs frequently and divorce is common, most people are only married once or maybe twice, and they may change jobs but they don't tend to dramtically change careers (at least not often). Some things, like what state they grew up in, will never change. I think the best way to address your concern is to encourage the use of year-specific qualifiers: "Born in 1965, Janet Blow attended Harvard University in the 1980's and was working as an accountant for Exxon in 2006." - <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:36, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

For example, see <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Gail_Mangum_e379.html" title="Crystal Gail Mangum">Crystal Gail Mangum</a> and its associated <a href="../../../c/r/y/Talk%7ECrystal_Gail_Mangum_a89e.html" title="Talk:Crystal Gail Mangum">Talk</a> page. <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbe.Froman_da43.html" title="User:Abe.Froman">Abe Froman</a> 00:40, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

None of that information is strictly related to the scandal resulting from the allegations she has made against these alleged criminals. Surely it is not in Mangum's best interest or the reader's best interest to remove this information, yet a literal interpretation of the wording could lead to someone trying to do that.

<dd>Addresing Abe's point, we shouldn't have articles about non-notable people. The answer to that problem may be to change the notability standards so that flah-in-the-oan types are excluded, or are only mentioned in articles about the broader topic in which they've achieved their limited attention. On the other hand, our articles about notable people should be real biographies, including the verifiable details common to all biographies. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 05:08, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal: No Wiki BLP at all if the living person objects. A veto option. No exceptions.</span></h2>
<p>As it is, Wikipedia's policy is partly driven by a morally questionable principle, which is that people who go into politics (even to run for city council or dog-catcher), or who decide to be actors (rather than, say, painters), somehow "agree" thereby to give up major rights to privacy. And therefore don't (and shouldn't) get any. This policy, which has evolved over many years of court cases, has basically come about because the average person has some gossipy interest in personal details in the lives of "celebrities" and has decided that, what the heck, they'll never be on the short end of this anyway, so what does it matter if somebody else gets hurt? Especially if the "somebody else" has money or fame, which are things the average person is jealous about, anyway. Thus the genesis of taboid journalism, and the legal system that supports it.</p>
<p>I don't particularly see any reason why Wikipedia's standards need to be this low, simply because it's legal. I see no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't take the high ground and simply have a policy to prohibit Wikipedia biographies on any living person who objects to a Wiki bio, from the President of the United States, on down. No exceptions. Shocking? No, not really.</p>
<p>I see little reason why Wikipedia as a whole would be greatly harmed by such a policy. Many people, particularly people who crave public attention, would certainly NOT veto a biography (and if they didn't, all the present WP:BLP would continue to apply). So for them, nothing would change. And with such a policy, how many biographies of living people that we really MUST have, would be lost (or more exactly, not available until the person's death)? I think not many. The price is low and the gain is high.</p>
<p>What's the gain? The gain is that Wikipedia treats all people as you would want yourself and your family to be treated. I happen to edit here under my real name, but I'm in a minority. I've made a habit to ask people who support the present WP:BLP policy, who do NOT edit under their given names, WHY they don't. The results are vastly entertaining. Usually they reveal people who simply think loss of privacy should be a concern for other people, even though they themselves regard if very highly. I had one person tell me seriously that they did edit under their own name until they became an administrator and started to get threats, following which they decided that personal information wouldn't be a good thing to have collected on the net. But failed to then take the next logical step and add 2 plus 2.</p>
<p>Hey, folks. Give this some thought. Consider raising the standards of this whole place, and give living Wiki bio targets a veto. And even if they choose NOT to exercise it, continue to abide by the very strict guidelines already in place.<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 04:39, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A) We're only (or should be only) compiling information already published about the bio subjects. B) The task of verifying the identity of someone asking to have a bio could be difficult. C) The OTRS system, though not publicized, allows anyone but especially the subjects to complain about an article resulting in very careful scrutiny of its contents by a senior editor. D) I don't see any reason why we shouldn't have an article about George W. Bush, even if he objects. Newspapers don't ask the permission before they run stories. E) Dogcatchers shouldn't be considered notable. If we're invading the privacy of non-notable people then that can be handled by simpling raising the notability threshold and enforcing the verifiability standards. F) I appreciate your concern about the privacy of individuals. It is an unfortunate fact that some in some professions (actor, politician, athlete, etc) there is an inverse proportion between amount of privacy and success. Encyclopedia editors are in a very different profession (or hobby), one that until recently attracted little fame. We should all be sensitive to who and what we write about. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 05:21, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm proposing a bio veto, but would not object to one after the fact (ie, you don't have to seek permission in STARTING a bio (provided you have a reference to one that already exists somewhere -- I like <i>that</i> proposed idea a lot, see above), BUT you'd have to delete it, if the subject turns up on Wiki to object. Now, comes the question of how do you verify true identity? Answer: there are several obvious ways, but first let me point out that none of them will likely be used very often. If a person A turns up claiming to be the subject of the bio X, you can default remove it, presuming they ARE. What harm? The only problem you ever have is when person B turns up, saying "Hey, what happened to that nice bio I had? I'm the REAL person X". In which case somebody has to submit a notarized request somewhere. That can be done by FAX and takes 1 hour (I know many package delivery and fax centers with licensed notaries on staff--, but all major banks have one). Only if TWO people do that (fax in notarized requests for opposite actions-- HUGELY unlikely), do you have to resort to original copies. And in that case somebody is breaking the law, and it's a case to refer to the local cops. Which should be fun, because people who do identify theft things like that are a menace, and probably crazy or ciminal or both. If you don't have time for that, I hereby volunteer to handle any case that get that far, and I will make sure that the proper authorities do the proper thing. So you don't have to be bothering about the time it will take. I think the time demands will be very small.
<p>Yes, this would mean George W. Bush could request his own Wiki be deleted. So what? Do you seriously think he would? And what harm if he did? Do you think Wikipedia would implode from the information vacuum if it wasn't the repository of a George W. Bush bio? Lack of one would probably save Wikipedian editors more TIME than this entirely policy enforcement would.</p>
<p>The OTRS machanism allows the subject to complain, but also allows them to be ignored. And I know of at least one case (a cop who shot a serial mass-murderer on a berserk rampage 40 years ago) where the request was denied. This guy merely didn't like the idea that there was a separate bio on him. He didn't object to his name being used in the article on the guy he killed. Lots of <i>relevant</i> bio material could continue to exist on Wikipedia, and this policy would not prevent that. Mentioned as been bio material on band members which is revevant to the band. Or bio material on an actor which is relevant to a particular work (Actor Gert Froebe's history of belonging to the Nazi party prevented the film Goldfinger from being shown in Israel until an Jewish family thanked him for sheltering them during WW II. Etc. But that info apears two places in reference to the Bond book and film, so loss of the Froebe bio (assuming he were living) would be no great loss.</p>
<p>Newspapers do things we shouldn't. Journalists can be SOB's. Dog catchers can be notorious enough to rate an attack article in the local papers from their opponent in the dogcatcher election, mentioning details from their dirty divorce, and there you are. Yes, encyclopedia editors can be a ticklish buisness trying to decide if somebody is "notable" enough to have their birthplace and age published on the Web. But I don't think any of this is really any of their BUSINESS. So I suggest we fix it with policy, so they can get back to what they're supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>Finally, Bill B. Back, why are you not editing here under your own name? Privacy concerns?

<dd>Although it's correct that we should only be publishing material already published, we're making it available in a very accessible format. We had an unfortunate situation recently where a marginally notable figure had a 15-year criminal conviction dragged up by an editor who went back and found the original newspaper stories about it. The subject said that it was ruining his life to have it displayed around the Internet, because his current friends didn't know about it. But because it passed <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and he was just about notable enough for an article, the information stayed up, until the Foundation blanked it when he complained.
<p>It would be good to have a policy in place that would mean the Foundation didn't have to keep stepping in and doing our job for us. But tighter enforcement of V wouldn't have helped in this case. Raising the notability standard might have, but how in practise do we do that, and is there the will to do it (given the "Wikipedia isn't paper" attitude)? It would be nice to have some sort of "kindness principle," but I'm not sure there's a will for that either. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:32, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia, in large part, establishes the notability of persons based on the availability of reliable sources that refer to them. In most cases that is a good rule of thumb. However court cases are very reliable, by and large. That may tend to give criminal and civil cases, and those involved in them, excessive prominence. However, even if reliable sources are available about them, the hundredds of thousands of crimnals in the world do not merit articles. Perhaps the problem lies with the admissability criminal convictions? This is a tricky issue, no doubt. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In fact, I've been in enough newspaper articles in the last few years that I might actually meet the standard policies and guidelines we have here. I don't want or need an article, but I also know that when I put myself out there and allow myself to be involved in newsworthy issues, I don't get to choose how that information is used.

<dd>Yep, you reverted my deletion of the request, after I noted the above. Still, now that you've commented further, may I suggest that the reason why there's no article about you is not because it's "not what other people want" but merely because nobody has gotten around to it, yet? Sooner or later, as "media" expands, we're all going to have Wiki bios unless we live as hermits in cabins in the Ozarks. And no, I'm not about to research you and post a bio on you against your will, to make a point. Not only is that probably against wiki policy (deliberate nastiness to make a point about how some bad behavior is actually just as nasty as the claimant says it is), but it would also violate my deeply held believe that this is really one of the peaks of incivility--- far worse than calling somebody a dirty name or comparing them to some noxious item. Most of us value our privacy a great deal. The reason you see Entertainment Tonight on TV is that most of us do not value the privacy of our neighbors nearly as much as our own. Office gossip abounds with info most of the gossipers would die of shame of have talked about, involving THEM. This may be the single greatest hypocrisy of modern society. You see the tip of the iceberg of the question here on WP:BLP. In any case, don't kid yourself. Your bio will be "up" one day. I have two acquantences who are both bio'd, and it happened entirely without malace. Person A bio'd the other as an act of semi-complement, putting only lauditory stuff in about his science accomplishment. But forgot to tell person B, who was really pissed, and tried to get it removed, and even more pissed when he got voted down. His response to was to write a scientific bio, full of compliments, about person A. Now they're both unhappy, but have had to resort to nothing more than "when rape is inevitable, at least do what you can to minimize how unpleasant it is." Not a good place to be.<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 19:13, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I thought it got removed improperly/accidentally, my bad. Regardless, what I want is irrelevant. If there's enough verifiable material for me to have an article, I can't complain that people are able to use it. This policy bends over backwards to balance privacy with public knowledge, and to say that an article about me would automatically violate my privacy is wrong. I can't really stress it enough - as long as we're not publishing information that isn't public knowledge, we're a-okay. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:19, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Two points I can't overemphasize myself. One is that "public knowledge" is not a yes,no binary thing. Stuff in your high school yearbook which I can find by going to your highschool and asking the library for a copy (or one of your classmates that year, if they still have one), is "public knowledge". As are the official accident reports if you ran over somebody accidentally years ago, like Laura Bush did. And so on. But when we collect a hundred such items and synthesize them into an easily read article anybody can access at the hit of a key, at home, it's MUCH MORE public than it was. It's also MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. So loss of privacy is not only not a binary thing, but it's an emergent property (or system property) of a collection of dug up facts. Have we not gotten to the point that non-binary logic and system properties are part of general consciousness? Not all things are black-and-white. The sum is very often far more than the sum of its parts--- sometimes shockingly so.<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 19:39, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm simply trying to understand your side of this here at this point, even though it's unlikely we're going to agree. You're talking about a loss of privacy that doesn't exist. If I ran someone over, was in the newspaper because of a USENET flamewar, said I enjoyed polish loaf on my blog, and was photographed demonstrating against unfair labor practices at the Oompa Loompa factory, that's all public information. Combining it together doesn't make it "more" public, it just compiles it in one place. If it's verifiable, what's the deal? In the age of the internet, especially, there's no such thing as "more public." You either are or are not. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:47, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, I'm happy to comment. If a verifiable media source writes about me and someone wants to make an article about me, that is fine with me. Perhaps they have already done so and my biography is already here? I think that you are trying to draw some sort of parallel between a non-notable editor writing under a pseudonym and a notable person being the subject on an encyclopedia article. They are not the same thing. If someone is notable, they can have an article here, whether they want one or not. If they are not notable, then they can't have an article here, whether they want one or not.

<p>I agree with those who think that we should use more restricitve notability standards for living people than for dead people. This is not a trolling/liability/vanadlism concern. The nature of wikipedia makes it suffer from a systemic bias toward excessive inclusion of recent events and currently living people. This is similar to the concerns discussed under at <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentism_cde3.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentism">Wikipedia:Recentism</a>, but more general - that is about specific content within an article, my concern is whether we should have an article at all. It is also a lot harder to have an encyclopedic perspective on currently living people.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this ever since the discussion at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Angela_Beesley_%283rd_nomination%29_36bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angela Beesley (3rd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angela Beesley (3rd nomination)</a>, where several people indicated a desire to have tighter standards for living people than we currently do. I like, but have some boundary testing concerns on, the no first biography proposal above. If nobody else has taken the time to write biographical content about someone, it is a good sign that we don't need a biography of them either, because they just aren't that important. I haven't come up with a workable alternative yet. (Only using material first published or republished (not merely still available) 5+ years after the event(s) in question is unworkable in practice, but would address my concern.)</p>
<p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that a living person has a veto right. I'm not sure if we should give them extra weight in AFD discussions. We currently don't. If their argument is that they do not have historic importance, that should be evaluated seriously. If their argument is that they don't want an article for vandalism/trolling concerns, I don't think it should get much extra weight. This policy, in current form, already adequately addresses negative content within an article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me see if I can phrase this to my liking. If there is "biographical content" but no "complete biography", we can take that "biographical content" and nip and tuck it with various other sources which also give *other* "biographical content" on the person to create a full biography. See for example, my recent page on <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gus_McLeod_3943.html" title="Gus McLeod">Gus McLeod</a>. I have by no means done an exhaustive search, but I was reading an old Smithsonian and thought he had an interesting article. Of course it did not mention that he was on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Amazing_Race_7bc6.html" title="The Amazing Race">The Amazing Race</a> because that happened *after* the article. The article was on his other adventures. So I added some more details on a few more recent things. Since that article gave some "biographical content", they found him notable enough, and that should allow us to have an article on him, with updates from other sources. Do you agree with this&#160;? <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 16:21, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While many problems with this proposal have already been brought to light, I will share some more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many subjects of biographical write to Wikipedia asking that the articles be taken down. We get many such requests each day and in general don't comply with them (though there are exceptions when the article is irredemably bad).</li>
<li>We also get many requests to either rewrite a biographical article to a subject's liking, or else take it down. While again there are cases where an article is so bad that we agree, in general we don't act on these requests. In partcular, many cases involve controversial public figures who don't want NPOV biographies of them to be available. Leaving Wikipedia with a choice between a <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowdlerized.html" title="Bowdlerized">Bowdlerized</a> biography and none at all would neither serve the public interest nor the goals of the project.</li>
<li>The best biographies have involved significant expenditures of effort by Wikipedians and it would be most unfair for the labors of the editors involved to come to naught merely because the subject preferred obscurity.</li>

<dd>You're another anonymous user making arguments <i>against</i> protecting privacy of individuals. Would you like to comment on why you yourself post anonymously?
<p>The goals of wikipedia are far larger than maintaining biographies of living public figures, which they object to the existance of (sorry about that preposition). If we lose those, it's no great loss. What we gain is the unlamented LOSS of many bios we have, of people who wouldn't be nearly as close to being "public figures" if they didn't have a bio on Wikipedia! "Public figure" is not a binary thing, as I've pointed out. I'm floored by the suggestion that our primary concern should be the "unfairness" of loss of the work editors did to make a bio the target is unhappy with, and not the "unfairness" of the fact that the person has had a bio constructed invading their privacy, which they never asked for and do not want! There's enough "unfairness" to go around here. A primary question is "Whose business is all this?" The world used to have a well-developed sense of that whose proper business things were. Nobody knew Rock Hudson was gay, except all of Hollywood. But the public didn't. I think our sense of "fairness" and kindness to public figures died right after the Kennedy administration. Now, if I look at TV, I can hardly change the channel fast enough to keep from finding out that some famous actor's older sister is really his mother, and his mother is really his grandmother. This, I didn't want to know. And I can't fathom the bloodimindedness of whoever made this into public knowledge. What has happened to us as a society. But it's bleeding over into wikipedia, and I hate it<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 20:28, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand why these are problems. If the subject wants it taken down, why not just take it down (and permanently)? If the subject wants it re-written, then why not let it be re-written? (A second re-write request could be considered a permanent take-down.) The business about work ultimately amounting to nothing is something every single editor labours under: where is the guarentee that any of my pictures will be decorating their respective articles tomorrow? I can't know for sure about these un-named editors you mention, but I've spent literally hours in the field obtaining some of these images ... and many times returning with nothing of value to this project. It's the way of the wiki; I've read and understand the little ditty near the bottom of every single submit page here that reads: "If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it." <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 19:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It was an interesting visit and we discovered that the production of a professional encyclopedia was not so different from Wikipedia in many aspects and that we had a lot in common to talk about. We talked about our controversial discussions about inclusion of biographies. The answer the Brockhaus people gave us was very simple: "First, the person must be dead." Of course they weakened this rule a bit, to include the Pope, George Bush and Michael Jackson but in general they only include people after their death. If I look at how much damage a wikipedia article can do to a minor notable person, it might not be the worst course of action. --<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElian_23dc.html" title="User:Elian">Elian</a> <sup><a href="../../../../de/e/l/i/Benutzer_Diskussion%7EElian_1557.html" class="extiw" title="de:Benutzer_Diskussion:Elian">Talk</a></sup> 17:24, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So this would mean that if we got word that Osama Bin Laden didn't want a biography we'd have to take it down? Giving people a veto over their own biographies would be a big mistake and would seriously undermine Wikipedia's credibility as all we'd be left with as far as living person biographies is laudatory crap.

If there are no reliable secondary sources, or if those available are all highly partisan, the biography should be deleted. What the individual concerned thinks is really immaterial unless they can provide evidence that the material "out there" is partisan and NPOV cannot be followed.

<li><b>Oppose</b>, because if adopted it would greatly shrink knowledge available on Wikipedia and possibly restrict articles on public figures who need close scrutiny (politicans, for example) to only their positive points. It might be fair to allow a "veto" if the article is a "first biography" (as defined by someone else above). In other words, allowing all articles about people who are absolutely public figures, while in any case where the "public figure" status is arguable allowing a veto then. But in no case should a politician or O.J. Simpson or anyone like that be allowed to expect his biography to be deleted at his request.PhilO837 23:18, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Another anonymous editor who supports loss-of-privacy. Mind commenting on your choice to edit without using even your real name, connecting your public comments with your public name?
<p>As for the matter of WP:V and WP:NOR <i>your</i> bio article on <i>my</i> life can never be neutral, or truly informed. Nor mine on yours. It's an insoluble problem. Once I've died, my viewpoint can't be accessed, so you're free to do the best you can. Meanwhile, I remain the ultimate expert on me, which you cannot trump. The idea that WP:V attempts to trump the expertise problem in BLP by <i>ignoring</i> it, is a symptom of wikipedia's <i>general</i> problem of not paying any attention to real experts in a small field (like their own lives!) who don't publish. Which truly is a problem. Because there is such a thing as objective truth, even if official wikipedia policy is that there isn't, but only public opinion. Nowhere else but WP:BLP does this stark disagreement stand out so clearly<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 20:14, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps your can point to the edit where I supported the loss of privacy, in this forum I've generally promoted there being more respect for such things. Yes, I am anonymous, at least for now. There is a lot of detail in the wiki edit history. It is possible to get a sense of one's schedule and so forth. Maintaining some level of anonymity is prudent and I choose to do so. I don't understand your need to repeatedly attack editors for reasonable behavior.</dd>
<dd>While I suppose that individuals may have better access to the "objective truth" about themselves, they often have good reason not to propagate such infromation. There are many places where the 'pedia needs to be more sensitive to living people, but should we remove the article on say <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tonya_Harding_3b49.html" title="Tonya Harding">Tonya Harding</a> because she doesn't like the way that she is being represented? No. Should we wait until she's dead? No, she is only 35, and her story is one that has had great impact. Again what reasonable information source restricts itself to only information that its subjects will find pleasant? -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 21:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, we should remove Tanya Harding's article if she doesn't like it. That would mean people would have to read about her someplace else other than Wikipedia, and so what? You may feel that it's a good thing to maintain your own privacy, and that you deserve to have it maintained, simply because you didn't hire somebody to break somebody else's kneecaps. But that's a slippery slope, and we've all done something we're not proud of. Having a Wikibio really IS a binary thing (you either have one or you don't), and I don't think Wikipedia is in a position to be able to clearly draw a line on who is or who isn't "notorious" or "notable" or "famous" or "public" enough to rate one, even if they don't want one. So let us just not go there at all. We can leave Tanya to the tabloids and other websites, and be none the poorer for it. Really. And we gain immeasurably in respect before the world, and immeasurbly in safety for ourselves and our families.

<dd>As explained, if Fidel logs in and asks that his bio be removed, we remove it, with a tag stating that Castro has requested it be removed. If we get a second user claiming to be the real Castro who wants it put back, we ask for two faxed notarized notes to a phone number in Florida, and Wikipedia honors the one from Cuba. Time expended, 5 minutes. For very famous people, like heads of state, you might have to START with the request for the notarized notes (or mail from the embassy or State Department Rep or Ambassador, or something). But 99+ % of the 100,000 people wikiBioed, the problem of verifying identity will have stopped long before this. And I can think of other way to do it if you don't like notaries: you can have your bio removed at a cost of 25 cents, fee to be paid by personal check only. Or by credit card, exactly as you'd make a 25 cent donation to the WikiFoundation. Come on. These problems have largely been solved out there.

<dd>This is just asking for massive abuse from anyone with some free time and a desire to make us look like utter idiots.

The <i>real</i> individuals, however, would neither know nor care about this, and would therefore <i>not</i> take the time to ask that these bios be replaced.

<dd>I'll keep it short. The electronic world has learned how to work out identity and money transactions, or otherwise there'd be no online banking, stockbrokerages, Ebay, B2B transactions, etc, etc, etc. Your claim is essentially equivalent to saying that the world as we know it, cannot (or does not) work, because identity cannot be verified except by fingerprint. I reject it. I don't even know where my online brokerage is located, and we've been happy with each other for years.

<dd>Have you any idea how much working out said identity and money transactions <i>costs</i>? (And it goes up by orders of magnitude as soon as you want to deal with countries where information is not electronically available to the outside world.)

<dl>
<dd>And you know this, how? The Wikimedia Foundation already takes credit card donations and no doubt also bank wire transfers. If they have a minimum, they don't say it. Bank card use companies usually charge as a % rather than as transaction cost, or otherwise it would inhibit small sales. What does the system COST? Ultimatly, how should I know? All I know is that if you use it, you don't have to pay the startup costs. International banking and wire-transfers verification stuff were assembled to fight international terrorism funding, drug-money laundering, and stuff I don't even want to think about. However, it's there available for you to be used for a pitance. As a Gold Club member of my bank, wire-transfers overseas are actually free to me, like my checks. And they identify me pretty well, as my account (like all US accounts) is linked with my social security number as well as multiple layers of password protection. Anyway, don't be telling me the system doesn't work, or is too expensive, or can be used by somebody pretending to be me. It does work. It also works internationally, though I don't know the details (how good are the bank ID systems in Ethiopia or Iraq? Search me). Many other countries also have passports and our equivalent of notaries, who work for fees that are typically small by U.S. standards. If you've traveled and banked in the civilized world, you've used this system, and you didn't have to be rich. And you probably weren't a victim of identity theft unless you did something really dumb. Can Wikipedia afford it? They might have to charge their expense, but it shouldn't be more than a typical overseas bank transaction. Most people really argry about their wiki bios would be more than pleased to pay a notary or the fee for a minimal wire transfer to fix the problem for good (or until they pay the same to undo it). Will this fix the problem for every country in the world. No. But why wait until the policy is implementable everyplace, where it's immediately implimentable most places where international business is done?<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 04:51, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Umm, all of that stuff is free for you because your bank is swallowing the price as a cost of doing business with you. It most certainly would <i>not</i> be free for some random non-profit (which is all Wikimedia is) to start conducting such checks. This would be particularly true of trying to verify notarized documents (something which is generally only done in the course of legal proceedings of some form).</dd>

<p>Sorry, but you are mistaken. The purpose of a notary is to verify the identity of the person signing the document, and witness the signing (as well as testify that the person knew in general what they were doing). Lawyers do not get involved except in the document creation (which for Wikipedia would be only once), and after that, if somebody thinks some notarized signature, complete with notary stamp and notary license number, is fraudulent. But how often do you expect that to happen?

<p>Can I just point out that contrary to Sbharris's attempts to cast it as such, there is absolutely no double standard involved in editors wishing to remain anonymous while maintaining that allowing article subjects to veto the existence of articles is a bad idea. There have been a number of cases of individuals being harassed at their home or workplace by editors who for various reasons disagreed with their practices on Wikipedia, and that's in addition to the huge number of other ways publishing personal information of the internet can be a bad thing. In the case of articles, however, the information is already available in public sources; if it isn't then it would be disqualified for inclusion as <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. In any case, the provision of information should always trump other considerations (with the exception of law and the goals of providing a wholly free encyclopaedia). There is simply no condoning removing an article on such a prominent and important figure as Fidel Castro simply because they request it. I would suggest in general that Sbharris concentrate on the issues rather than concentrating on the personal anonymity preferences of those opposing vetos; doing so is bordering on an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> argument. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 23:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now, now. I know there's been the suggestion that editing Wikipedia is one of the most dangerous and nutcase-attracting things a person can do, akin to being President of the United States, and so therefore of course editors might be more careful of their privacy than any Hollywood star (about which we write any verifiable thing we like). However, let me point out that there are many other ways to make nutcase enemies in the world, or even get into business or personal situations in which you don't want your life details immediately available to anybody with cellphone access to Google. And many of the 100,000 people you've never heard of who are bio'd here, are going to run afoul of some situation in which they really don't want their bios available at a keystroke, in 60 seconds. That may include even you, one day. And even if you never touched Wikipedia as an editor, so that's a nonstarter of an argument.</dd>
<dd>This request of mine is Socratic. It's not intended as ad hominem-- it's intended to make people think. So far, I've only gotten back the arguments which essentially translate to: "Well, I'm anonymous here because *I* am special. For reasons I won't tell you, or due to my high-danger editorical job. But who the *&amp;%$ cares about Tonya Harding or Fidel Castro? Fidel already has security, and if Tanya doesn't, well, too bad." Or perhaps I've missed the gist.</dd>
<dd>As for what's PUBLIC INFORMATION and what's not, I've never gotten a satisfactory answer to that. Is your home address public? It probably is if you own the property. Those Hollywood Tours of the Homes of the Stars are probably not run with the Stars' consent. Somebody knows where they all live, anyway. Boats go by Bill Gates' house on the lake everyday-- that's the price he pays for his fame. Do you care, or do you hate the man for his money and his Windows? But does that mean YOU want your home address on Wikipedia? Or would you like it be harder to find, even if it's ultimately findable by somebody with some money and time? There are levels to information access ease. I'm heavily arguing against this idea that all information is PUBLIC (like George W. Bush's birthdate), and easy to find, or PUBLIC and hard to find (like your property ownership records). But should you become famous, or infamous, or run for public office, or even find yourself in the news a lot as a commentator, somebody will put in the work to find the hard to find. And it will go on Wikipedia, if you allow it.</dd>
<dd>I'm finding my case hard to argue, except in the way I'm arguing it. People seem genuinely not to care about other people's privacy, but they always have reason why their <i>own</i> privacy is something COMPLETELY different. How do we show this, except with real life examples? I'm arguing about privacy with anonymous people, and you're claiming I'm bordering on ad hominem. Well it must be a pretty wide border, because I don't even know your names. From my end, I'm arguing with a bunch of electrons on a screen.

<dd>You're taking a reasonable example (the privacy of random Joe off the street) and trying to drag it to an absurd conclusion (the privacy of the POTUS). The first is a valid issue, and one which this policy is meant to address. The second is <i>not</i> a valid issue, since genuine public figures (and, gray areas aside, I think we can all agree that there are <i>some</i> people who are undisputably "public figures") are going to want their articles removed not because of issues of privacyâthey don't, as a general rule, have expectations of suchâbut because they <i>don't like the contents</i>.

But if you enter Bedford and her name into Google you get <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4DE173CF930A25750C0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=health&amp;pagewanted=print" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4DE173CF930A25750C0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=health&amp;pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> which has the street, housing division, into on names of nextdoor neighbors, and all info from the NY Times, so it's WP:V and subject to sticking in her article, if somebody wants to. Perhaps you could suggest some more names. The whole point is, if it's NOT in wiki but IS in Google (after hard search) it CAN be in Wiki. Which makes it an easy search.

<dd>Wouldn't your efforts perhaps be better spent asking the New York Times to remove Martha Stweart's address, rather than advocating the removal of articles on individuals such as Martha Stewart (a noteworthy person by any criteria) on the basis that said articles could, possibly, be used to find information already prominently published elsewhere? In any case, given that your original question was "does that mean YOU want your home address on Wikipedia?" I'm still waiting for these examples of articles which publish the home address of their subjects. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 20:45, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The anonymous status of an individual in discussion about a policy about specifically identifying individuals and facts of their lives seems highly relevant to me. No different (logically) from a prosecutor soliciting from the person on the stand he was (say) previously convicted of perjury: context counts, and it's good to reflect on the potential biases of those speaking. For example: who is some anonymous guy, from the safety behind their ISP, to say specific things about someone who is not anonymous? The target can't "return fire" -- and doubly so, since the subject of the biography is specifically forbidden from doing so anyways. <i>Is this really fair?</i> Not only is it fair to the subject of the article, but is it really fair to the project as a whole? Consider that later on in this talk page, the leader of this project is talking about the possibility of editors being personally named in libel suits. How would this happen if virtually all of them are anonymous? Is it realistic to expect Wikipedia to suck down the entire liability created by random, unknown, goofballs who speak any falsehoods it publishes? Will it try its best and pierce their veil of anonymity when the shit hits the fan? It is high time to consider not just the immediate, tactical, goals of this project -- the "sum of human knowledge by any means necessary" (or however it is said now) -- but more strategic matters that amount to its survivability to (predictable!) external threat. What do you think the policy changes will be when the "9/11" of lawsuits is filed against WP and a clique of "John Doe"'s? I think it is far better to anticipate them now, work to prevent the threat by implementing them, then to simply wait for failure to occur. By engineering for success, survival is more certain and the responses to failures become simpler, faster. If this means a few people remain undocumented at WP, who cares? If this means (say) the only people allowed to edit such articles are non-anonymous, we should read this as a statement of the seriousness of the responsibility being undertaken, not cry about "wholesale censorship". <a href="../../../m/d/f/User%7EMdf_6f2c.html" title="User:Mdf">mdf</a> 14:29, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, this discussion is about deleting articles at the subject's behest, not the limiting the ability of anonymous editors to contribute. There's plenty of vaired proposals about that issue floating around (<a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThe_overuse_of_anonymity_at_Wikipedia_and_a_proposal_57a6.html" title="Wikipedia:The overuse of anonymity at Wikipedia and a proposal">Wikipedia:The overuse of anonymity at Wikipedia and a proposal</a> was the first I could find), none of them getting very far, but if you do feel passionately about the issue your comments might be better suited to those proposals. Secondly, if Wikipedia editors were to be cited in a legal case there are manifold ways that their identity can be readily established (very few people are truly anonymous on the internet) and even if they could not that would not mean the legal burden would instantly shift to the Wikimedia foundation; legal precedent is quite clear on that issue. Finally, and most importantly, there are many policies both in place and being developed which act as a means to combat libelous statements made against individuals, and permitting the wholescale deletion of articles on the subject's say-so would be neither a necessary nor a sufficient tool to prevent libel. Less drastic measures (such as strict inforcement of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> policies) are far more effective tools to prevent the spread of libelous falsehoods, and would no doubt be considerably more effective than depending on the subject noticing the libel. In any case, the subject can easily remove the statements as things stand, and if that is insufficient and legal recourse is taken on the basis of the prior existence of the statements then allowing subjects to delete articles would be equally ineffective. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 13:23, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I generally <b>support</b> the SBHarris proposal, with one reservation. The reservation is there should be an exception if a person is clearly notable beyond any reasonable argument to the contrary. Examples of clearly notable beyond any reasonable argument to the contrary: O.J. Simpson, Osama bin laden, and current and past Presidents of the U.S. In reading this discussion some things pop out that strain belief. Some people apparently take the idea seriously that Wikipedia has a "mission" to collect the sum total of human knowledge on a single website. Hello. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Nothing more. Any grandiose "mission" beyond that isn't attainable nor should it be. Some people also seem to have a skewed idea of what NPOV means, and seem to be operating under the belief that articles must contain a great deal of negative or derogatory information about a person or have a "criticism of *" section, otherwise it isn't "NPOV". Last I checked the N stood for neutral, not negative. There is also the argument that editors who have spent much effort on articles will see their efforts come to naught if articles are deleted. Well, tough. There are thousands of examples every day of editors who spend hours of effort writing only to see their edits instantly rv'd. That's how a wiki works. I don't see why BLPs should be an exception. The approach to sources which favors material on the Web as opposed to, say, books in the library, is a questionable one. This is an example of <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">systemic bias</a> that is rampant on Wikipedia because of its location on the internet. Related to all of the above is another form of systemic bias: marginal and non-notable people tend to get Wikipedia articles about themselves solely on the basis of them holding fringy views, while non-controversial but notable people are less likely to have articles. Sadly, Wikipedia editors tend to self-select from people with axes to grind, who see fit to start articles on people because they don't like something or other about that person. Wikipedia articles wind up being repositories of negative information and criticism of living persons, and create controversies about people where no controversy existed before. I take issue with that whole line of reasoning. Is Wikipedia an encyclopedia or is the Wikipedia "mission" to be an all-encompassing repository of gossip and controversy about people, some of whom would rather be left to get on with their lives? And are there some people who have invested so much time in Wikipedia that it has become a "mission" that they take far too seriously, as opposed to a fun and occasional hobby? <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleenupKrew_dfad.html" title="User:KleenupKrew">KleenupKrew</a> 02:39, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>"The reservation is there should be an exception if a person is clearly notable beyond any reasonable argument to the contrary."</i> How do we come to an agreement about that? Don't we already delete non-notable biographies per a set of criteria that the community has agreed to apply. Are you suggesting a second tier of notability? The examples you have given offer no illumination as to where the line would be drawn. I can see some truth in your description of the selection bias, I'm just not certain that the inclusion of an additional bias for balance would resove this. Also, I disagree with the characterization of All wikipedia authors as having axes to grind, I think you are talking about a very vocal and active (and thus still problematic) minority. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 07:04, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We don't have to come to an agreement: external reality can tell us via the proposed "no first biography" rule (see above). These two proposals can be modified slightly and combined into a policy that reduces to:</dd>
</dl>

<pre>
 if(external_biography_exists) {
     wikipedia_article can exist, subject has no veto
 } else {
     wikipedia_article can exist, subject has veto until an external biography exists
 }
</pre>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While there are other ways, I look at the above and seriously wonder what the possible problems are going to be.

<dd>To some degree the current policy already has this covered. Information (from criminal records, high school yearbook interests, whatever...) is not to go into a bio unless it has been published reliably elswhere. A "no first biography rule" would indeed require criteria. What defines an existing bio, AND how do we debate whether or not an article is in violation of that criteria IF a deletion was requested AND if that request could be varified as originating from the mildly obscure person who is the subject of said biography. This is not so simple as you might like it to be. I think we need to be more patient and see how this new criteria works as it stands. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 14:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I am generally opposed to this suggestion. Anyone who's biography contains an error has recourse. If their biography is accurate then they don't need to veto it out of existence. If people want to read the article, then that is some proof of notability. If no one does want to read the article, then the subject has not been harmed by its being avaialble. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 22:34, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am also generally opposed. I don't see the need to formally give people a means of getting rid of their biographies when our current means of fixing problems seems to work. I also see having to wait for a biography as a big hinderance to writing about people who suddenly become famous, or to people with lots of verifiable information about them who just haven't had a biography written about them yet. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No, I think the current rule is perfectly sensible. If you want to insert negative information about a living person, particulary information that would be libel if it is false, then you run the risk, personally, of being named in a libel suit, and quite properly so. The responsibility for justifying controversial claims in Wikipedia, of ALL KINDS, but especially for living people's bios, rests firmly on the shoulders of the person making the claim. I take no position on the general suitability of sources which require registration (or a trip to the library). I think that's a matter which depends on several different factors and the overall context. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 10:49, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you Jimbo for your input. I know you have other things to do, so I'll try to be brief and limit this as my final comment on the matter. Incorporating protection against libel is absolutely vital to Wikipedia, but I wonder if the wording as it stands, especially the "without discussion" part is a bit too strong on the matter. Yes it is meant to strongly discourage unsourced negative material, but why the "without discussion" clause? The editor in mind, who is a fan of the subject of the article, began using a "Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons. Unsourced. Delete immediately" boilerplate, even removing a properly cited passage from Salon.com because it was registration only and he thought it made the subject look bad. But can't we afford the same protections to the subjects by either requiring discussion as we do to non-BLP pages to stem such knee-jerk reactions? I can't see any protections for the subjects being given up by at the very least requiring a simple note placed upon the talk page, or anything else to stem someone from blanket removal of content they don't like, especially for such a lame reason as the source is registration only (though still satisfying reputable, notable, and verifiable). That's all I promise :) --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 23:30, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Does registration required qualify as "unsourced or poorly sourced"? There may be some problem with interpretaion here. I don't think knee-jerk removals are always a bad thing. Doesn't the information get put back into the article once proper sources are given? If unsourced claims are particularly negative I would rather they be removed than {{fact}} tags were added.

<dd>It's not too much of a problem, I just don't see the harm in adding my section above. Lou is a fine editor, but he sees the Coulter article as a "hit piece" on Coulter... therefore any section he doesn't like without an explicit source or even a "registration only" source he just removes. One edit is fine, but I see this turning into a pattern, as his edit summaries now simply have a template "WP:Biographies of living persons. Unsourced. Deleting immediately". Inserting this removes the potential for knee-jerk deletions on articles, and I don't see the addition causing any harm whatsoever. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 23:09, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I for one would object to any wording which would suggest that web searches are an acceptable approach for determining the accuracy of a statement, as in <i>spending at least 5 minutes on a search engine trying to locate a source</i>. If you search the Web you are very likely to find all kinds of unreliable gossip and just plain inaccurate information from blogs and the like, with the end result that a lot of defamatory statements on living persons might wind up staying in articles when they should be removed. If Wikipedia is to be a reliable resource, there needs to be a lot more emphasis on using traditionally published material (books, and non-ephemeral periodicals) as sources.

The problem I see with relying on web searches to justify inclusion of derogatory statements is there are a lot of left-wing and right-wing advocacy sites which can be - and are (unjustifiably, in my view) - being used as sources for criticism about living persons. There are also plenty of reliable sources to be found on the web. I don't think anyone is seriously contesting using the New York Times as a source. But there has to be a line drawn somewhere. I would go so far as to suggest that <i>even if</i> a critical statement can be sourced, it should still be removed if the only available sources are from political advocacy websites of either the left or right. <a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKleenupKrew_dfad.html" title="User:KleenupKrew">KleenupKrew</a> 03:49, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(Note that the Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columnist.html" title="Columnist">columnist</a> points out that columns explicitly contain an opinion or point of view.)

<dd>Someone is missing the point here. As nae'blis says, the onus is very firmly on the person including content to back that content with high quality sources. If they don't, it should, as Jimbo says, be deleted immediately, without prejudice to its being brought back <i>with proper citations</i> or (better) after reaosnable discussionon Talk to determine the best way of presenting that information. Why should we reverse the burden of proof by requiring additional work of people who are protecting the project's best interests? It makes no sense. If it's not stated neutrally and with solid references, it should not stay a moment longer. Jimbo's comments on this are unequivocal.

<dd>This comment begs the question as to whether a citation to the <i>New York Times</i> is "poorly sourced". It's available online to anyone who joins Times Select or who pays to read that particular archived article. It's available for free on microfilm at many libraries across the United States and, I would guess, some foreign ones. The <i>Times</i> certainly isn't infallible, as it demonstrated in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, but a citation to a <i>Times</i> article is much more substantial than a lot of the stuff that's available online for free and without registration. In addition, there are still these things out there called "books". They're reputed to have some information that isn't available online. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small> <a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 23:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any somewhat controversial source should be specifically stated.

</dl>
</dd>

<p>And if the source is a blogger employed by ABC/NBC/CBS/a credible newspaper and posting on their site, then not even that should be necessary. Those are not self-published. No organization like that will allow potentially libelous material on their site.PhilO837 02:23, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree with Zoz, but against blanking. There are personal attacks against Elonka-the-editor in that AFD ("abusing Wikipedia", "very tasteless spamming"), but none against Elonka-the-article-subject. In other words, it doesn't say anything bad about ED's personal life or achievements other than as an editor of the Wikipedia. So I don't think BLP applies in this case, or it would apply to every personal attack against an editor. There is harm in blanking, as that 1) makes the article more vulnerable to another attempt at deletion on basically the same grounds, 2) hides our process, which in this case worked, and quite well (I've almost never seen an article kept with that many and that margin of votes before), 3) in general makes us look as if we had something to hide. However, as Zoz writes, this whole episode reflects much more on Danny than on Elonka. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:03, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Clearly you cannot separate out "Elonka-the-editor" from "Elonka-the-article-subject" since they are both the same person - even WP:BLP itself makes a distinction for article subjects who are editors: "<i>especially when those subjects become Wikipedia editors</i>".

<dd>Most of what's on the page is fine, so there's no real need to blank the whole thing, and just targeting the specific statements that need to be removed makes for a much clearer history for anyone going back to read the results of the RfD.

In my opinion, everything else should stay. "What is so bad about blanking?" (1) It can become a bad precedent - in the worst case, users could cite this and demand that all negative criticism of them be removed from discussion pages. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_User_conduct_3a88.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/User conduct">RfCs</a> and <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAr_c2e7.html" title="WP:RfAr">RfArs</a> are filled with negative comments / criticisms, blanking them all would be counterproductive. (2) It may be perceived as a bias in Wikipedia - <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Brandt_007f.html" title="User:Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> was not allowed to edit out a sentence he didn't like from <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">his bio</a>; IMO long-term editors shouldn't be able to remove negative criticism of them either, even if it's on talk pages and the comment is harsh. (3) Replacing archived discussions with "Courtesy blanking" and having editors to check the page history is against the <a href="../../../k/i/s/KISS_principle_ef68.html" title="KISS principle">KISS principle</a>, (4) against transparency, and unprofessional in my opinion, especially when the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">AfD</a> discussion resulted in "keep" - in favour of the subject.

<li>I noticed in the past on some articles that I was interested in that were up for deletion some of the voting members made some very disparaging comments about the people some of the articles were about. I thought even then that some went beyond civility by accusing the actors or filmmakers as being the creators of articles etc. Some of these people were insulted and made fun of in other votes for deletion pages. These comments can still be found and are even found on Wikipedia mirrors. I suppose someone who is insulted one day could still have a problem with being trashed on Wikipedia couldn't they?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How does WP:LIVING relate to our linking policy</span></h2>
<p>I've been trying to figure this out. I can tell from the policy that statements in an article about a living person which are controversial need to be especially well sourced. But how does this apply to external links? If, for example, an external site makes controversial claims about a living person, there is no official "verification" process I know of for information on an external site. Does that mean the link has to be to a site which is a reliable source in and of itself? Or is there some other rule of thumb? This is also a practical question. I'm involved in a dispute about a link to a site which claims (ambiguously) to be written and maintained by a specific famous person. What's written there is not stunningly controversial, but it does effectively link a large body of written work (the site contains fiction) with a known, published author, and contains a few offhanded "personal" remarks -- I believe the guy says his agent is worthless, for one. Is there a specific way I should interpret WP:LIVING as it applies to information on external sites? <span style="font-family:monospace">-- (Lee)<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup></span> 22:48, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. The link is in an appropriate place and not replacing real content -- it's in an external links section -- but it would seem the link I've described about is probably not usable in this case, since it fails to be verifiable. I ask in part because I've seen a lot of external links appear to be to fansites and similar; those seems to be generally considered okay even if they have a fair amount of questionable information, but the situation I'm dealing with now seems a bit more "controversial" than that instance. <span style="font-family:monospace">-- (Lee)<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup></span> 23:16, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If negative information must be very carefully sourced (understandably, to prevent libel), positive information should have the same restrictions.

Being dead does not necessarily protect from libel. Descendants of famous figures could protest too. I'm sure Martin Luther King Jrs.' descendants would not be too happy if negative poorly sourced or unsourced material was put into his article.

<dd>Your premise is quite wrong. It is a well established legal truism that the dead cannot be libeled. Libel involves actual harm due to false damage to one's <i>own</i> reputation. MLK's family has a financial interest in his "legacy" but if it is protectable by civil suits, it has to be under some other theory than libel.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Subjective labels</span></h2>
<p>How should we address the labeling (most often political) of a particular subject? If a person describes themselves one way but is regarded differently, perhaps even in contradictory fashion, by many others, what is the proper way to address this? Should we even use them? Should we just cite the subject's self-description or include that and add what others say also? I personally think the labels should go entirely unless the subject's notability revolves around these labels. For instance, it is obvious that Ann Coulter is conservative and does not like liberals and that can be easily verified. However, Michael Moore may be liberal and may criticize conservatives but does not use these labels as overtly as Coulter does. Also, Bill O'Reilly describes himself as an independent but is generally regared as conservative by others.</p>
<p>All that said, what I am asking is if there is a clear policy toward this? <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 20:09, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you answered it. In your example, Bill O'Reilly's view of himself is sourcable. "is genrally regarded as conservative" would fit under weasel words. There are sources for these labels. If the New York Times calls Ann Coulter conservative, then the label should reflect the New York Times views and attirbuted to the New York Times. But if it's a vague "most people regard Ann Coulter as conservative" it should be avoided as an example of weasel words. Generally the label should be sourced and attributed to those believing it. Otherwise the label should be avoided. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 08:37, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion on preventing related misuse</span></h2>
<p>I suggest that some section be added under "Remove ..." about how to discuss a disagreement of whether or not a source is reliable, something like this:</p>
<p>If you disagree about the legitimacy of a source used to back up an assertion, err on the side of caution and leave it out. Find the remover's talk page and ask them about their concerns. If they doesn't work, consider asking other's opinions on the talk page of the articel. If the disagreemnt continues, see <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a>.</p>
<p>Mainly what I'm concerned about is a PoV/revert/edit warrior looking at the 3RR exemption and deciding to try and defend their warring by claiming that their opponents were "posting unsourced negative material", similar to the way some past pushers have by claiming their opponents were "vandalizing". I'm not seeking a change to the policy itself but the supporting framework to so everyone understands this can't be used to justify repeated reversions without discussion. 68.39.174.238 15:37, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This makes a very interesting read for a lot of topics discussed on this page. Quote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>While there are few clear rules, there are some guidelines as to which "private facts" normally should not be subjected to public view. The following list contains several trouble areas which give rise to potential liability:</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>1. sexual relations;</i></dd>
<dd><i>2. family quarrels;</i></dd>
<dd><i>3. humiliating illnesses;</i></dd>
<dd><i>4. intimate, personal letters;</i></dd>
<dd><i>5. details of home life;</i></dd>
<dd><i>6. photographs taken in private places;</i></dd>
<dd><i>7. photographs stolen from a person's home; and</i></dd>
<dd><i>8. contents of income tax returns.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>Restatement (Second) of Torts Section 652D, comments (b), (g) (1977).</i></dd>
<dd><i>Likewise, it can be stated generally that matters of public record are not considered private facts and may be published freely:</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>1. a person's birth date;</i></dd>
<dd><i>2. the fact that a person is married;</i></dd>
<dd><i>3. military record;</i></dd>
<dd><i>4. admission to the practice of any trade or profession;</i></dd>
<dd><i>5. occupational licenses;</i></dd>
<dd><i>6. pleadings filed in a lawsuit;</i></dd>
<dd><i>7. arrest reports;</i></dd>
<dd><i>8. police raids;</i></dd>
<dd><i>9. suicides;</i></dd>
<dd><i>10. divorces;</i></dd>
<dd><i>11. accidents;</i></dd>
<dd><i>12. fires;</i></dd>
<dd><i>13. natural disasters; and</i></dd>
<dd><i>14. homicide victims.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that this refers to the first publication of such facts and makes no assumption about the notability of the person in question, whereas on Wikipedia we have <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as severe additional restraints, of course.</p>
<p>The only motivation for the "Privacy of birthdays" section seems to have been the fear that exact birth dates could be used for identity theft. While by now we have a lot of examples for the kind of damage that the other sections of <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> are designed to prevent (slander/libel, harassment if home or business addresses are published, etc etc), I am not aware of a single instance where the subject of a Wikipedia article has been the victim of identity theft because of his/her birthday date having been published on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>On the other hand it has been claimed that exact birth dates are of no encyclopedic value. I strongly disagree. Numerous arguments can be made that the exact birth date is relevant for a biographical article (for example, they are the basis of <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legal_age.html" title="Legal age">legal age</a> limits which have a profound impact on a person's life). It is a venerable, century old tradition to record the exact birth date in biographies and remember them as anniversaries, see for example <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chambers_Book_of_Days_4d07.html" title="Chambers Book of Days">Chambers Book of Days</a>. In the western world, birthday anniversaries have long been matters of great public interest and become relevant events themselves - example for today: <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> turning 80 being the topic of about 4,050 media reports <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=fidel.castro+80" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=fidel.castro+80" rel="nofollow">according to Google news</a>. Often they are not only triggering media reports, but also political developments, cultural events (how many Mozart evenings have been held on January 27 this year world wide?), scientific conferences and literary publications, etc. On de:, a biographical article is featured each day in the "selected anniversaries" section on the <a href="../../../../de/h/a/u/Hauptseite.html" class="extiw" title="de:Hauptseite">main page</a> . <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Britannica_0925.html" title="Encyclopedia Britannica">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> is doing the same, see the "Biography of the Day" on britannica.com (today it is <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Hitchcock_0cee.html" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, because he was born on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">August 13</a>).</p>

<dd>I agree. Information such as birthdays is relevant information, as long as it is properly sourced. If a birthday was published on the subject's web site, celebrated by the subject on radio or television, published in a newspaper article or profile about the person, or in court papers for the person (for example, if the subject was a defendant in a criminal trial), then that is relevant. I would object to digging out birthdays from birth and death records, from web sites like ZabaSearch and US Search, and from corporate records that are not publicly available.</dd>

<dd>On the other hand, Wikipedia should try not to be the first publisher of fact. The Florida Bar only makes a case that one should be careful when discussing items such as family quarrels, sexual liaisons, and tax returns. If a subject releases their tax returns to the public (as part of a political campaign, for instance), that is a relevant primary source. Wikipedia should not report first hand observations of person A having an affair, however, if details of person A's affair is published in a newspaper or magazine with normal journalistic standards, then that certainly should be included. If someone has a "humiliating disease" which is a "open secret" in that community, Wikipedia should wait until that is published somewhere else before exposing that information. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 00:46, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
