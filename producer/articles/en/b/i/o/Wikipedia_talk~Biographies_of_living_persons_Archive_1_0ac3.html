<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blogs</span></h2>
<p>Hi 4.250, your recent edit seems to contradict some of the stuff that follows, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which says we may use questionable sources (for the want of a better word) as primary sources, but not secondary sources. You wrote: "They should never be used as primary sources: as sources of information about their authors. If the information can be verified by another source, use that other source as a more unbiased source of information. People lie and make mistakes."</p>
<p>Did you mean "never"? I was going to add a section about when it would be acceptable. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:21, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think KISS applies here. "Don't use questionable sources" is a good and proper GUIDELINE. Distinguishing between primary, secondary, and so on is simply not necessary. Going into detail on EXACTLY when the GUIDELINE can safely be violated simply feeds into the over wiki lawyering we already have too much of. We want 17 year olds to understand this stuff, not just old hands. I do mean "never", as in if you aren't sure enough to violate a guideline to do it, just don't do it. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 02:30, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Using an example that crops up regularly: do we call Stormfront "white supremacists" (which is how most people see them) or "white nationalists," which is how they see themselves? Most sources call them the former, so we do that too. However, we often also add that they seem themselves as nationalists, using Stormfront as a source. Under your edit, we would not be allowed to do that. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:23, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure you could. This is a guideline, not a law to be administered by anal-retentives with guns. I think you're forgetting the part where this is supposed to be fun.

<dd>Thinking out loud again, and just using this as an example: <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Cohen_7f7b.html" title="Nick Cohen">Nick Cohen</a>, well known British journalist, is often regarded as a Jew in part because of his name, and in part because he has controversially supported the war in Iraq, and is accused of doing so because of his Jewish background. However, he says he isn't Jewish, although he has some distant Jewish ancestry. If he were to publish this in his biography on his blog, <a href="http://www.nickcohen.net/?page_id=5" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nickcohen.net/?page_id=5" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which has become quite a well-known blog in certain circles, and supposing it was not published anywhere else, should we be allowed to say, in your view: "According to Cohen, writing on his weblog, his Jewish ancestry is distant"? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:28, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the data is ONLY on his blog, how is it "notable"? Suppose he lies or makes a mistake on his blog. "We are not a nrewpaper" We don't DO fact checking.

<dd>I've restored the qualification that personal websites may sometimes be used, and I've listed the circumstances, but I don't know whether I've made it too complicated. I have a tendency to be wordy. On the other hand, I've been involved in editing a lot of biographies so I'm familiar with the issues that tend to come up, and I know what loopholes need to be closed.</dd>

<dd>The thing I'm trying to avoid is this: some blogs are currently allowed as sources according to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> — for example, a blog written by a professional historian could be used as a source of information about that person's field of expertise, although with caution because of the usual no-peer-review concern. But we could say "Professor Smith has argued that George Bush's analysis of the WMD situation in Iraq is self-serving" and we could link to Professor Smith's blog, so long as Professor Smith is a recognized expert on the WMD situation in Iraq. If we are allowed to do this, it strikes me as obtuse that we would <i>never</i> allow Professor Smith's blog to be used as a source on Professor Smith himself in his Wikipedia biography — saying, for example, "I am a Libran". I've therefore tried to list a set of circumstances in which it would be okay to use a weblog, and they are very limited (boiling down to: when it does no harm, and when no one objects). What do you think? If you think they should never be used, I'm prepared to be persuaded, but we need to think through the implications. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:02, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Saying "this blog says x" is different from saying "x is true (Source - blog)" further, there are blogs and there are blogs. I trust the people at slashdot to uncover the nitty gritty inside software code or to provide links to sources. some blogs have demonstated their value in some area of expertise. Hey, maybe we could say somthing about "area of expertise" being an exception? Nah, let's Keep It Simple. Just say "No" and refer them to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for posible exceptions. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 02:30, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I see what you're saying about keeping it simple. My concern is that in saying no here, and referring people to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, we're simply transferring the problem elsewhere. At some point, we need to pin down when blogs may and may not be used. It's becoming more and more of an issue, as lots of people are setting them up and are sometimes using them as alternative places to publish (e.g. academics and journalists are doing this). So the distinction between credible, third-party sources and non-credible self-published sources is starting to blur a little.</dd>

<p>No problem at all. I like planting seeds and watching others water them. I do question dealing with blogs on a guideline dealing specifically about "articles about living persons". We SHOULD refer them elsewhere for detailed instructions about blogs if detailed instructions about blogs are to be provided. But I won't touch it for a while as per your request.

<p>Well done - these look good. However, some suggestions</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a section to cover where a book by an author such as <a href="../../../k/i/t/Kitty_Kelly_1fb8.html" title="Kitty Kelly">Kitty Kelly</a> makes claims or a claim that is not supported in other books by more reputable authors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We need a section regarding claims made about other people that are not the subjects of the article and the need to be fair to them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we need a section stating that biographies should aim to inform not titillate. We should also make sure our biographies where possible are appropriate for readers of all ages. Some biographies by necessity will contain adult information ie Linda Lovelace but we should make sure that the information is appropriate for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 04:25, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think this page should include guidelines related to invasion of privacy issues. Many WP articles are about people who are (it seems) notable enough to warrant a WP article, but who nevertheless are (or consider themselves to be) non-public persons.

<dd>I agree absolutely and totally ... and I have not the slightest idea on how to even BEGIN with dealing with this.

<dd>Another point, taking into consideration the example presented about unfounded allegations that someone might have "touched" a child inappropriately, is that there would necessarily be more than simply the subject of the article involved. It would be absolutely paramount that no information could be included which might lead to the identification of any child alleged to be involved in anything like this. I'm tempted to say "particularly if it turns out to be a malicious hoax" but in actual fact it would be damaging to any such child no matter what the circumstances. This would obviously apply to other third parties, even those viewed as less vulnerable: this could so easily turn into a tool to cause maximal <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collateral_damage.html" title="Collateral damage">collateral damage</a>.

<li>in other articles we would be "neutral" in that all information might be included, but with hefty citation of sources to establish whether a given "fact" might be trustworthy;</li>

<dd>No argument as far as the subject of any given article goes.

In the theoretical example of the person maliciously accused of behaving inappropriately with a child, the fact of the accusation might be necessarily included to preserve NPOV: the name or any other details of the child should almost certainly not be.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should go further</span></h2>
<p>IMHO, this policy should go further towards placating potentially injured parties, even if that involves a minor violation of NPOV. We really, really don't want to be sued. If an allegation of sexual misconduct is published in one newspaper, and cited in WP, and turns out to be wrong, it's really not good. On the other hand, a widely reported allegation that has undergone due investigation (eg, Lewinsky) is obviously fair game. Perhaps we should require two independent sources for libellous claims? In any case, unless the allegation is really important to the person (as it clearly is with Clinton/Lewinsky), does it really matter? Does WP really lose much if an article about an astronomer is all about his work, discoveries etc, and fails to mention the credible but unproven allegation that he inappropriately touched a student once? Unless it had consequences for his work ("Smith was forced to resign from Uni of Zarba following unproven allegations of sexual misconduct"), what is the relevance?</p>
<p>Publishing anything defamatory without rock-solid proof (in the form of very credible sources) is little more than rumour mongering, and I don't think we should do it. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 15:01, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

OTOH, I find nothing violative of NPOV policy, or overly SPOV to the living subjects of WP articles, in telling editors to be extremely careful about materials that are arguably defamatory or an invasion of privacy. The defamatory part of the equation can be dealt with by rigorous application of existing policies regarding reliable sources, citations, etc. Sensitivity to privacy issues is more of a judgement call, and is not well addressed by other WP policies, imo. --<a href="../../../f/r/s/User%7EFRS_3198.html" title="User:FRS">FRS</a> 17:23, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suppose it comes down to, is a rock solid belief in NPOV worth fighting a legal battle over? Members of my family have been involved in an ultimately (after 7 years) successful legal battle. They were in the right - but the cost of the thing was horrendous. So I'm just saying, we may end up "publishing" information which is technically not libel - but the closer we sail to the wind, the more likely someone is to get sued, and that will suck for everyone. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 17:32, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>OK, rewrite first draft done. I've taken Slim's version and more or less turned it backwards — start with guidelines and rationale, save long rationales for the end. I've also written it as tightly as possible, though there's probably a lot more that can be tightened up.

<p>Morven and Nobs01 have hacked at it slightly as well. I've just gone through the above talk page and added stuff based on it. I don't think we need to denounce blogs at length - anyone who thinks a random blog (as opposed to a high-quality blog, <i>e.g.</i> <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groklaw.html" title="Groklaw">Groklaw</a>) is a credible high-quality source isn't going to be swayed by a guideline. This is a "what to do" guide for editors that have a clue, because editors that don't will not take it in anyway.</p>
<p>Anything else important that should be added? I'd still like to make it shorter. In particular, the example of the academic is way too long - do we have a shorter real-life example we can remove the names from and use? - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 18:06, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>David, I've found that even editors without a clue, so long as there's a degree of good faith, will take the policies seriously so long as there are no loopholes. If it's nailed down, they tend to work with them. Regarding blogs, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (I forget which) allows them only where the blogger is using their real name and is an acknowledged expert in the field he's being used as a source for, or is a well-known professional researcher of some kind e.g. political researcher or journalist. So anything on this page should be consistent with that. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:37, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well it says now that self-published material may be used as a source after certain exceptions have been met, then discusses how it may be listed in the further reading section or external links. But it does not specifically state that the self-published bio <i>should be specifically cited</i> as the source of content for the namespace. Also, should we presume after secondary sources become available, much of the self-published material should be replaced?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">a few comments</span></h2>
<p>I think this is a very good idea to write this, so thank you to Sarah&#160;:-)</p>
<p>A few ideas or comments just boiling in my mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikipediAhimsa" class="external free" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikipediAhimsa" rel="nofollow">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikipediAhimsa</a>&#160;: i like this page, which is more than 3 years old. It reminds me very much of the introduction of the policy proposal, in particular in describing the point of the totally abashed editor trying to correct, sometimes in all good faith, an article about him. It reminds me of this music performer, listed months ago amongst homosexual performers, correcting the wp entry, being rebutted ... and discovering that possibly 30 mirrors were repeating the claim on wikipedia. He was most polite, but answering him "yes, we made a stupid mistake, and right, we are morally responsible of 30 sites claiming this, but we can not do anything"... must have been real tough to him. I wish that we avoid such things in the future. There is a reason why so many history books do not publish information on current people, but rather wait for 20 years before doing so&#160;:-) We can not do this, but we should be *super* careful in the information we add in our articles.</p>
<p>Second point is I think that the page may be too long. But I also understand that length. What I would recommend is also making a nice and gentle page, where this is summarized and things explained gently to the newbie. This one is too long for the newbie. The page for the newbie should also mention "contacts" nearly at the top of the page. When an editor edits his own biography, he should be given a link to the policy page (this one here) and to the shortened newbie oriented page, so that he understands a bit more what is going on here and what he should do in case things get hot&#160;!</p>
<p>I am not so happy right now with the paragraph called <b>Legal threats</b>. Here is why</p>
<p>Legal threats implies a certain stance. It implies that what is important is the fact the person is making a "threat". I do not think this is a good approach to the issue. It should be more "lenient", maybe rather be something of the type "contacts in case of the editor wants to go on legal grounds" or "legal contact" or something of that type. More neutral. Not a title implying the one complaining is already an "ennemy". He might be acting in all good faith and he might actually even be right in his complaint.</p>
<p>Of course, an editor trying to "save" the page from the *bad* and *dangerous* newbie will perceive this as a legal threat. So, it may be important to differenciate two pages&#160;: one intended to the editor trying to "keep" the page as is. And one intended to the "newbie" trying to fix his biography... Because the goals of the two pages are different. The first one (for the editor) will contain guidelines of policy for the editor, as well as strong recommandations about what to do in case of legal threats, as well as recommandations to be avoid biting newbies. The second one (for the newbie trying to fix is biography) should contain quick explanations of how the system work, explanations of what is gonna happen to him if he edits with too much "energy" and who he should contact in case he wants to raise the issue with non-involved people (mediation or legal approach).</p>
<p>The other point is this one. While it make sense to tell an editor to have a legal threat be forwarded to the foundation, there is a danger in saying this. First because it will imply that the Foundation is necessarily the entity to attack (in short, the legal publisher). The second because it might imply that the editor himself is not responsible of what he writes. Which is NOT true. If an editor here keeps writing someone is a rapist, and this is untrue, the Foundation should act as soon as possible to remove the lie, but the editor writing the lie is definitly the original author of the lie, and as such, the one legally responsible. So, I believe the text should be rewritten so as to avoid to imply the Foundation is the publisher and is legally responsible.</p>
<p>I would also personally recommand against putting the office adress here, as the more often it is mentionned, the more difficult it will be to update when necessary. There is a link which might be best&#160;: <a href="../../../d/e/s/Wikipedia%7EDesignated_agent_523e.html" title="Wikipedia:Designated agent">Wikipedia:Designated agent</a>. I would also recommand against putting a phone number. Finally, adressing the correspondance to danny@wikia.com does not look very professional&#160;:-) please remove it. There is no reason to let an email adress with a first name, nor with the name of a firm unrelated to Wikipedia. It could frankly be very confusing. We are starting to receive emails adressed this way "Dear Wikia people". I do not think it is suitable.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Self-published material</span></h2>
<p>I think this is a very well-written and thought-provoking page. I fully support it as a guideline to support editors. It speaks to two audiences simultaneously - the subject of the article (who may be an editor) and the rest of the community working on the article. This page does an effective job of communicating to both audiences. While it is longer than many of our pages, I don't think it is too long for the topic.</p>
<p>I only disagree on one point. I would like to change the sentence "Blogs, personal websites, and other self-published materials are usually not regarded as credible third-party sources..." to read "... are never regarded as credible third-party sources..." and to delete the entire section currently headed as "When self-published material may be used as a source". Per <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>, "... personal websites are not used as secondary sources — and as primary sources only with great caution ..." An encyclopedia is, by definition, a tertiary source. We may go to a primary source to fact-check a secondary source but we should <i>never</i> use a primary source to create content. To do so would make us a secondary, not a tertiary source. This section creates confusion and appears to allow the use of the self-published material as an allowable source for content. We should simplify this page with a strong and simple rule that self-published material is not a credible source. Let's deal with the rare exceptions as exceptions. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:44, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. I'm thinking particularly of bios of creators of encyclopedia-worthy subjects, where the creator's blog will often contain interesting and relevant descriptions of what they did. We have a <i>lot</i> of these. <i>e.g.</i> "Doe described his anthropological work on the Xists in a blog entry [1] as: 'A complete waste of money, brains and time.'" It's an editorial judgement call, not a "never".</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This is a band-aid when Wikipedia needs surgery</span></h2>
<p>You need to explore four additional areas:</p>
<p>1) Florida statutes and case law regarding invasion of privacy. Here's one place to start: <a href="http://www.floridabar.org/DIVCOM/PI/RHandbook01.nsf/1119bd38ae090a748525676f0053b606/dfc00ac22467b7f5852569cb004cbc2a" class="external free" title="http://www.floridabar.org/DIVCOM/PI/RHandbook01.nsf/1119bd38ae090a748525676f0053b606/dfc00ac22467b7f5852569cb004cbc2a" rel="nofollow">http://www.floridabar.org/DIVCOM/PI/RHandbook01.nsf/1119bd38ae090a748525676f0053b606/dfc00ac22467b7f5852569cb004cbc2a</a></p>
<p>2) State and federal law that distinguishes and defines a private person as opposed to a public person.</p>
<p>3) Wikipedia as a special case: Anyone can come along and sabotage a biography, which means that biographies on living persons have to be locked down in some fashion. A court would take a dim view of Wikipedia's "anyone can edit anytime" if someone attempts to present this as a defense of Wikipedia in a legal proceeding. Remember, it is an open question whether Wikipedia would be considered immune from torts under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as an interactive Internet service provider. Even if it would be, there are more than a few legal scholars who already argue that Wikipedia is playing a completely different role than, for example, a provider such as BellSouth, and should be treated differently under this law.</p>
<p>4) Subjects should be notified that a biography is in progress, and they should be invited to participate, and if they prefer not to have a biography, then it should be deleted. This relates to the above point: Many subjects will not enjoy the prospect of checking their bio every day if it isn't locked down, and would prefer that it be deleted. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Brandt_007f.html" title="User:Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> 04:27, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"One man's gossip may be another man's news, but distinguishing between the two is often the key in determining whether the press is guilty of "invasion of privacy." Whether an article or broadcast is newsworthy, whether the information was gathered in an objectionable fashion, whether truthful information is nonetheless highly offensive -- all are considerations in weighing individuals' claims against the news media. Invasion of privacy is a tort, a civil wrong, which can lead to jury trials and potential claims for compensatory and punitive damages. It also places judges in the unfamiliar and uncomfortable role as "editors" of last resort. The right of an individual to be free from invasion of privacy can be expressed in several different ways. Sometimes it is called the right "to be let alone." Cooley, Torts, 29 (2d ed. 1888). Often it is seen as a geographical area, "a kind of space that a man may carry with him into his bedroom or into the street." M. Konvitz, Privacy and the Law: A Philosophical Prelude, 31 Law and Contemporary Problems, 272, 279-80 (1966). Invasion of privacy is a relatively recent addition to American law. Rather than evolving from the English common law, as did libel, invasion of privacy can be traced directly to an influential article by Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, later to be a Supreme Court Justice [Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193 (1890)]. They argued for the creation of a private remedy -- a lawsuit -- to vindicate privacy rights. Writing before the era of electronic eavesdropping, telephoto lenses, and other modern technology, Warren and Brandeis prophesied that "mechanical devices threaten to make good the prediction that `what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from the housetops'." Id. Not surprisingly, American courts today do not look kindly upon the media in these cases. However, the media's exposure to liability can be minimized through a grounding in privacy law. A two-step process determines whether the press is liable for invasion of a person's privacy: [...]" <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 06:07, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Defamatory statements</span></h2>
<p>The policy reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Potentially libellous or defamatory statements not sourced to highly credible verifiable sources should be removed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Andries changed this to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Statements that are normally considered potentially libellous or defamatory not sourced to highly credible verifiable sources should be removed. However statements perceived by a person as defamatory or libellous, only because of his or her extraordinary claims about himself do not demand such a high degree of credibility. For example, if a person who has made the extraordinary claim to having invented a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetuum_mobile.html" title="Perpetuum mobile">perpetuum mobile</a> then questioning or criticism of this claim, though perceived as defamatory, by this person or his believers does not need to be sourced to a highly credible sources, but instead normal standards of credibility and verifiability apply here.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above misinterprets what defamation and libel is. Defamation:<i>false accusation of an offense or a malicious misrepresentation of someone's words or actions</i>. Libel: <i>a false and malicious publication printed for the purpose of defaming a living person</i>. Criticism of a person is not libel or defamation. Making false accusations is. As we, as editors, cannot make value judgments in respect of the truth of falseness of a statement made against a person, we have to rely on the guideline of "reputable sources" and provide highly credible and verifiable information as it pertains to accusations.</p>

<dd>But a person who has invented a perpetuum mobile may feel that questioning of his claims is a false accusation and hurts his reputation and is thus <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a>. I think that questioning of such claims does not need such highly credible sources when compared to e.g. an assertion that a scientist (whose notability is unrelated to his sex-life) had an extra-marital affair. I mean, in the case of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a> questioning of his claims of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materialization.html" title="Materialization">materialization</a> is seen by his followers as a false accusation and hurts his reputation and is thus <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a>. Following the current version of the guideline means that we can only write that <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uri_Geller_f080.html" title="Uri Geller">Uri Geller</a> is a fake if a highly credible source says so, not just the private opinion of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Feynmann_554a.html" title="Richard Feynmann">Richard Feynmann</a>?

<dd>No, Andries. Libel has a component of malicious intent. i.e. a person <i>knowing</i> that the statement he is making is false and making it anyway with the purpose of harming their target. This comes to play not so much about claims of superhuman powers, but about allegations of sexual harassment against a person, for example. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 23:52, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

Several proponents of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a> believe that the critics of Sathya Sai Baba (incl. me) have malicious intent by accusing him of sexual harassment. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 23:56, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, but the main difference is that this is related to his notability: he made claims of purity and attracted followers as a consequence. This claim is extraordinary and he has to provide extraordinary evidence for his extraordinary claims. The burden of proof is not on his ex-followers, who say that he has sexual relations as most people have (though some of them are abusive and constitute sexual harassment). So normal standars apply here, not extra highly credible sources. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 00:09, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

If a notable person was fired from his post because he was found guilty in a court of law to have been sexually harassing a subordinate, and we write about that instance in this person's biography, that would never be considered libel, would it? And why not? Simply because it is a verifiable fact that he was fired for that reason.

I can then write in XYZ's biography at Wikipedia what this independent and reputable person witnessed.

If I get these, I can write this in the biographical article of XYZ.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">When does biography cease being a biography?</span></h2>
<p>In reviewing other encyclopedic forms, biographies are concerned with the person, and discuss the merits which demonstrate the qualifications for entry. But does the policy address at what point does an entry cease to be about the person, and more about what brings that person the notariety? Two examples, (but not to be construed as comments on the following Wikipedia entries for either example):</p>
<ul>
<li>At what point does a biography of Isaac Newton tip into an extensive explaination on the theory of gravity?</li>
<li>At what point does a biography of former British Secretary of War John Profumo tip into an complete explaination of Christine Keeler and the subsquent scandal known as the Profumo Affair?</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that this is really rather subjective, but biographies are about the person and should be NPOV. <a href="../../../o/n/c/User%7EOnceBitten_67fa.html" title="User:OnceBitten">OnceBitten</a> 15:34, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would argue that you cannot separate the one fromn the other. After all, a person's notability is based on the person's life-work. A summary of achievements of the person can be included with links to articles discussing these achievements if warranted. In the case of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Profumo_f46d.html" title="John Profumo">John Profumo</a>, the article as it stands now, (one long paragrah about the affair, and very little about his lifework, makes the article not NPOV. I would summarize the long paragraph and provide a wikilink to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profumo_Affair_72af.html" title="Profumo Affair">Profumo Affair</a>.

<p>Looking up the word biography, I find <i>"An account of a person's life written, composed, or produced by another: a film biography; an oral biography."</i> from the American Heritage dictionary.</p>
<p>When I want a biography on Abraham Lincoln, I don't need a complete run through of the Civil War, thats why there is an article on the Civil War. When I want a biography about Abraham Lincoln, I don't need an examination of Mary Todd Lincoln's eccentricties unless they impact the man and his administration.</p>

<li>I deleted the sentence "Strive for an article that both the person's greatest fan and greatest enemy could not reasonably dispute." I find the reference to "greatest enemy" problematic.

<li>I deleted the sentence advising editors to send legal threats to the Foundation and not reply to them, following Anthere's point above.</li>

<p>I posted this to the policy site since it is terrible important if you decide to take this path it seems inevitable that it will lead to Wikipedia style control of the internet. For instance I wrote This is can very dangerous for doing this may make Wikipedia a mere tool of a totalitarian government, such as in the notorious Walter Duranty case <a href="http://www.nytco.com/company-awards-pulitzer-note.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytco.com/company-awards-pulitzer-note.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. I suggest you read the material in this citation very very carefully, e.g. from citation immediately above:</p>
<p>"Taking Soviet propaganda at face value this way was completely misleading, as talking with ordinary Russians might have revealed even at the time. Duranty's prize-winning articles quoted not a single one — only Stalin, who forced farmers all over the Soviet Union into collective farms and sent those who resisted to concentration camps. Collectivization was the main cause of a famine that killed millions of people in Ukraine, the Soviet breadbasket, in 1932 and 1933 — two years after Duranty won his prize." El Jigüey 12/25/05</p>
<p>In Castro's case he uses a number of reporters including CNN's Lucia Newman to whitewash his situation. It is said by reliable although sources that Newman has turned in tape of dissidents to the Cuban authorities. It is wise to recall that after Saddam fell CNN was forced to fire a reporter filing from Bagdad (Peter Arnett)for exactly this kind of reporting <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/31/1048962706289.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/31/1048962706289.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Exceptions</span></h3>
<p>Exceptions as the one suggested (which I deleted, in italics below), could be made to apply to not only religious leaders, but to government officials, heads of governments, politicians, etc</p>
<dl>
<dd>In principle, criticism sections should be reserved for ideologies, policies, political views, and philosophies rather than people. <i>An exception to this rule occurs when a person is a proponent of a belief system that hinges around his reliability, such as is the case with many religious founders.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>...I argue that that "exception" is not applicable, as assessment of reliability of a person, is not in the domain of possibility for Wikipedia editors. Wikipedia is not a place to assert the morality of a person, their beliefs or their orientation, neither is the place to advocate for or against a political or religious point of view. That's better left to to the soapbox, a pamphlet, a critic's blog, or an newspaper editorial. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 23:02, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Humbug!!!!!!!!! To remove this "exception" would insulate totalitarian tyrants of whom there a still a good number in the world from criticism in such a way the more they repress their people and the dissemination of information the better they will look. El Jigüe 12/25/05</p>

<dd>I don't know if WP can make the assertion one way or the other. It seems to me that frequently criticisms of politicians hinge on their personal lives or aspects of their behaviour not directly related to their time in office (eg, Bush or Kerry's war records). I don't personally see the relevance or agree with this sort of dirt-digging, but if there have been entire books written on the subject, it must be relevant to someone. If Karl Marx was a rapist, however, I would probably want to know about it if I was researching <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">him</a>.

<dd>Of course. Plagiarism, fraud, doping are aspects that can pass the test of verifiability, and if relevant to a person's life-work, these should be included. Other aspects, such if a person is an hypocrite, blasfemous, obnnoxious, etc, etc. cannot as these relate to value judgements that are <i>not</i> verifiable, and do not belong in our encyclopedia.

<dd>Okay, hypocrisy may be a value judgement, but if a religious leader e.g. prescribes sexual abstinence for his or her followers then automatically his or her sex life becomes of interest for his or her biography, because deviation from his own asserted values are likely to be of interest to the reader, because of perceived hypocrisy. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:46, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That applies to politicians, and to many public figures as well.

In the case of <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Delay_eec9.html" title="Tom Delay">Tom Delay</a>, he is a member of Congress and as such his reputation as a person is paramount for his political career. If Tom Delay was involved in corruption, this is definitively relevant for his biography. The <i>only</i> reason why we can include information about possible corruption in Delay's article, is that these are verifiable and from highly reputable sources. The <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litmus_test.html" title="Litmus test">litmus test</a> is on the reputability of the sources and their verifiability. And even in those cases in which the sources are verifiable and reputable, a biography of a person does not need to be presented from the viewpoint of his critics/oponents/detractors,(neither from the viewpoint of his supporters). That is what this guideline is attempting to hopefully describe and assist with. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 22:24, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">request clarification of physicist example</span></h2>
<p>On the section about people in this gray area between notable and non-notable, I think the example could be improved. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An academic who has a Wikipedia article because of his work in <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physics</a> is alleged to have touched a student inappropriately during a party. She tells her story to the university's student newspaper, and the story is picked up by a satirical magazine writing about sexual relations between academics and their students. No other newspaper repeats the claims, to which the academic has not responded. This allegation should probably not be placed in the article — it is not relevant to his notability, he is only marginally notable outside his work, it originates with a single witness and unsworn testimony, the sources are not particularly credible, no mainstream source has picked up the story and his life may be seriously affected if the allegation is spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the credibility of the source really a deciding factor? What if there were multiple credible sources?

<dd>On the other hand, I am of the school of thought that says that marital status and number of children (if known) should be included if it comes from a verifiable, published source.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">When to name a person</span></h2>
<p>What rules should apply about when to reveal the true name of a person known by an alias if they strongly try to keep it secret, and protest it's inclusion. This is brought up by <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandy_Alexandre_%28porn_star%29_299c.html" title="Brandy Alexandre (porn star)">Brandy Alexandre (porn star)</a>. Now in this specific case, I think revealing the name is ok *if* there are very good reliable sources. However, i'm posting this question here, as I can imagine other cases where we might have a tougher decision. For instance, what if it's illegal to reveal a name. For instance, Canadian courts regularly ban the publication of names of defendents (especially juvenille ones), but their names are published in US papers, and ultimately Wikipedia. I assume US courts sometimes issue similiar bans, which presumably effect the home of Wikipedia (but I don't know). Another case might be where a secret agent's identity is revealed, and it's not lawful to reprint it. Anyway, I'm just curious a) What is the current policy and b) what do people think the policy should be and c) maybe I missed the old discussion on this, and you can point me to that discussion. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:55, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Beback. What JWSchmidt and Matthew Brown said here makes sense, but the wording of the policy should be clear; readers shouldn't need to ask questions on the talk page to resolve apparent inconsistencies in the article (see my question about the physicist example above). The second sentence quoted by Will Beback <i>does</i> seem to suggest that bios of living people shouldn't include criticism. (If criticism from notable critics belongs on those critics' articles, presumably criticism from non-notable critics belongs nowhere at all.) This can't be what it's supposed to mean... it's inconsistent with the preceeding paragraphs, which say bios <i>can</i> include criticism of the subject.</dd>

<li><i>If a person is notable enough to have an article in Wikipedia, their criticism of others can be discussed in their own biographical articles, not in the biographies of others. A biographical article should be about notable persons, not about their critics.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>How about rewording it like this:
<ul>
<li><i>A biographical article should focus on the subject, not their critics. Non-notable criticisms of the subject should be excluded, or placed in the biography of the critic.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>I may have arrived too late, but it seems to me that if a biogrpahical article has a critic who has cited the extreme negative aspects of the subject's entry these should be noted, and not glossed over because they are produced on a smaller scale than those of the subjects pundits- this would be in the case of someone relativelyt unknown who fell into deeper obscurity, and during that time developed tendencies that could be construed as racist and or anti semitic.. and since the relative obscurity of the subject has cloaked their late in life negative behavior, not a whole lot of documentation exists on the subject... my point here is that by blanketing the entry with a no critics allowed clause, we may very well negate later aspects of a subjects life. It seems important to get all sides of a story, no matter how obscure, before throwing any and all criticisms away.<a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.244.7.12.html" title="User:216.244.7.12">216.244.7.12</a> 05:51, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is "negative"?</span></h2>
<p>This guideline mentions "negative", but what is negative? The assessment of a trait or event as negative is subjective. For example, some people consider homosexuality negative. Others do not. I would rather have this re-worded more objectively. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:34, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Negative in this context it relates to negative traits about a person, as per a value judgement vs. a fact. If a person sexual orientaton can be verified as homosexual, that is a fact, not a value judgememt. On the other hand, saying for example that a person has an "aggressive disposition toward others" is a negative value judgement. The difference between a verifiable fact andf a value judgement is very easy to establish. That is why the guideline states that "Wikipedia is not a place for editors to assess the morality of a person, their beliefs or their orientations, nor the place to advocate for or against a political or religious point of view." <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 19:35, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">False suggestion of NPOV based on number of adherents</span></h2>
<p>This article falsely suggest that the weight given to opinions depends on the nr. of adherents. It is not the number of ignorant adherents that matter to determine the weight, but scholary and scientific and other informed opinions. For example, we do not allow the physics-related article on motion to state that an object makes a warped curve even if there are no forces on the ball, only if many people (I heard 30%) believe this. Does this mean that we allow 30% of the space in the Wikipedia article on motion to this clearly incorrect view? Of course not, because this is not an informed opinion, but the opinion of lay people. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:13, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you in some ways, but I think both expert opinion and lay opinion matter. For example, even though virtually all experts agree that species diversity arose by <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, we still mention in that article that the idea is more controversial among the public at large. I think your example of the moving ball is interesting. I agree that we shouldn't mention in whatever relevant article that 30% of people hold this misconception. But that's because in the ball example, I doubt that 30% of people really <i>believe</i> this. It may be their best guess if you quiz them on it, but I suspect they'd be happy to accept the scientific view of the matter if they were reminded of it. So, in my opinion, it's not really a minority view in the same sense as Creationism. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 20:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been thinking about it, and this is what I came up with: You speak of "<i>ignorant adherents</i>", but that it itself is a value judgement. A critic of <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> can claim that the billon Muslims are "ignorant" and if that critic is notable, or the criticism of that person is published by a reputable source, we could by following NPOV, describe his POV and criticism of Islam in the article about Islam. Every religion or faith has its detractors and critics. Same applies to the people heading these religions as their spiritual leaders. In many cases, the number of critics is infinitesimal in comparison with the number of people that not only don't criticize it, but that support it. When we describe that faith or write a biography about its spiritual leader(s), we ought to describe the criticism and opposing views, in proportion to the critic's notability. Now, if there is a critic that is not only notable for his criticism of others, and that notability implies a separate article in Wikipedia, we can then under <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> explore in detail the criticism he has levelled against a faith or a religious leader in <i>his</i> article. This is applicable not only to bioagraphies of religious leaders, but of politicians, writers, and scientists as well. That is what this guideline speaks of when it reads:
<dl>
<dd><i>Many persons that are notable enough to have an article in Wikipedia about them are likely to have detractors, opponents and/or critics. Their views can be presented in a biography providing that these are relevant to their notability, based on reputable sources and in a manner that does not overwhelm the article. Note that for each detractor a public figure has, this person may have thousands that do not share these detractor's views and by default their views will not be represented in the article. We should be careful not to give a dispropotionate voice to detractors, opponents or critics as you could be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">representing a minority view as if it were the majority view</a>.</i> <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 16:59, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that your interpretation of this guideline contradicts the basic principle of Wikipedia that is we do not allow multiple articles with different POVs on one subject i.e. article 1 with POV1, article 2 with POV2, article 3 with POV3 etc. Instead, we should make one article on a certain subject that is a weighted mix of POV1, POV2, POV3 etc. My question is how do we determine the weight given to POV1, POV2, POV3 etc in this one article? I have developed a methodology for assessing weight. What do you think of it?<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:28, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

I am ignorant about nuclear physics which is not a value judgement, but a fact. I do not blame adherents for being ignorant, but it is crazy, of course to use the nr. of adherents to determine to weight given to a certain opinion. Of course the beliefs of ignorant adherents of a religious leader should be described, but not in a biography, but under a section or article "Beliefs and practices". <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 17:36, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Ignorant adherent" is most definitively a value judgement. Same as saying "blasfemous scientist" or "heretical scholar" from the opposing POV. I am not asserting to consider the number of adherents to determine weight, rather the <i>number</i> of critics and their <i>notability</i>. Consider this: if a religion has 10 milion adherents, and have have a dozen critics whose only notability is the fact that they are critics of that religion, what weight would you give them in the religion's article? I would argue for a small mention in the article. On the other hand, a religion with a billion of adherents but a highly notable person (e.g. a very notable author or scholar) making critical comments about that religion, you will expect that the article about that notable author or scholar to contain a high percentage of his criticism, and the article about that religion a very small mention, if at all. It all makes good editorial sense, really. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 18:12, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I continue to disagree with your statement that "ignorant adherent" is a value judgment.

<dd>I would suggest you ask other editors to evaluate your assertion that calling adherents of a religion to be "ignorant".Can you imagine the uproar if you decide to label Christians, Sikhs, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, and Buddhist as "ignorant adherents" just because their beliefs are not supported by views of secular scholars? Spare me the Jihad, brother. As per your proposal to calculate weight, I wish you good luck with it. You can present it at the talk page of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 20:01, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are also adherents of a religions who are not ignorant, but what I mean to say is that if scholarly sources assert that religious leader X did Y then this should be stated as such in the article, regardless if the religious leader has billions of adherents who think otherwise. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 20:12, 19 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course, but the <i>weight</i> given to that scholarly source will depend on the notability of the scholar, and maybe be number of other notable scholars that share that POV. You can try this: try to get a scholar (journalist, author, etc,) that criticizes the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> to be featured prominently in his article. That would be only suitable if the said scholar has the notability and standing to warrant his mentioning in the Pope's article. Otherwise, at most, that criticism shoukd be a small mention or footnote in the Pope's article, if at all. That is why <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> includes the aspect of <b>undue weight</b>.

<dd>Jossi, well may be I should have done that, but I think it was clear from our discussions here and the many that we had elsewhere that I did not agree with the guideline and that I wanted to change it in a way that gave both a minimum and a maximum to the criticsm fraction. Now it gives only a maximum which I think is strange and somewhat diverging from the NPOV policy. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 01:20, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To give an example why a minimum is necessary too. A long biography of <a href="../../../u/r/i/Uri_Geller_f080.html" title="Uri Geller">Uri Geller</a> with one sentence space given to detractors breaks NPOV policy, I think and this should be stated in this guideline. I admit that this is a difficult matter and that you have tried your best. There are no easy answers, I am afraid. Also I think that the guideline should explicitly state that witholding relevant negative information about public persons may be harmful too e.g. in the case of a politician who is running for election. It is not just that writing negative things should be limited (for obvious reasons), but also witholding negative aspects. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 01:36, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That may be your perception, but no one is arguing for withholding negative information. The arguments made are <i>for</i> inclusion of critics and detractors POVs <i>providing that these are relevant to their notability, based on reputable sources and in a manner that does not overwhelm the article</i> and <i>Negative information related to a person's notability should be mentioned if solidly verifiable</i>. I am afraid that it is not possible to have a guideline that numerically quantifies proportions of criticism in articles. That would be an absurd and unattainable proposition. Rather, we ought apply the policies such as <i>NPOV says that the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints, in proportion to the prominence of each.</i>, to the best of our abilities <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 04:10, 20 February 2006 (UT</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Privacy of birthdays clarification needed</span></h2>
<p>In the privacy of birthdays section, it says "it is more common for the public to know which year someone was born without knowing his or her exact birthday". I think this needs to expand/get clarified a bit. To say "it is more common" implies that only most of the time are people's exact birthdate not public information, which in turn leaves open for debate who's exact birthdate can be published or not. This issue came up in the Brian Peppers debate, and people were deleting his exact birthdate despite him being a sex offender and having his exact birthdate released as public information on his sex offender website profile. I think we need to clarify if it is ok or not to release the exact birthdate in cases of non-public figures who's exact birthdate has been made public by the government. I would certainly think there wouldn't be any problem with doing so. Thoughts? <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 02:08, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If such DOB was published by a reputable and public source, I see no reason for not including it in an article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 02:47, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I propose a rewrite of the section to the following:</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Privacy of birthdays</b></p>
<p>Wikipedia includes exact birthdates for many famous people, but including this information for some people should be handled with caution. While many well known living persons' exact birthdays are widely known and available to the public, the same is not always true for marginally notable people or non-public figures. With identity theft on the rise, it has become increasingly more common for people to consider their exact date of birth to be private information. When in doubt of the notability of the person in question, it is best to err on the side of caution for adding specific birthdates. It may be advisable to simply list the year of birth rather than the exact birthdate. Some things to consider when adding an exact birthdate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has the person in question had mainstream media coverage?</li>
<li>Has the person in question taken action intended to increase their notability? (Given interviews, been a guest on a talk show, etc.)</li>
<li>Has the person in question's date of birth been published by a reputable and public source?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer to all of the above questions is no, it is advisable to leave out the exact birthdate of the individual in question. <s>Exceptions can be made in cases where the government has made the information publicly available, such as a sex offender or criminal.</s> (crossed out due to addition of the last bullet-in such cases it will always be published by a reputable and public source)</p>
<p>Feel free to comment or suggest any changes. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 03:04, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Rather than list exceptions, we can simply add an extra bullet as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Has the person in question had mainstream media coverage?</li>
<li>Has the person in question taken action to increase their notability? (Given interviews, gone on talk shows, etc.)</li>
<li>Is the birthday available from a public source such as a court judgement, government publication, etc?</li>
</ul>
<p>I will make that addition.

<ul>
<li>(edit conflict - please give the rest of us a <i>little</i> time to react) I really like the opening paragraph. Privacy must be the default. I do believe that the sentence at the end should be changed to "If the answer to <s>all</s> <u>any</u> of the above questions is no, ..." We should have a fairly high hurdle against the inclusion for living people.<br />
I also believe that the original wording of the last bullet was better. The revised wording of the last bullet may be indefensible in some jurisdictions. My birth certificate is technically a public record since it is on file in the county courthouse where I was born and at the time, accessing it meant physically traveling to the courthouse, knowing enough to request the right record and paying a copying fee. With the advent of searchable databases and electronic security threats, courts and legislatures are making more nuanced decisions about privacy. Information that is "public" when fragmented can become "private" when aggregated into a database (such as Wikipedia) and placed in a context prone to abuse. The case of the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Files_ca23.html" title="Nuremberg Files">Nuremberg Files</a> comes to mind but that's an extreme example. I remember reading cases closer to our situation. Of course, this is an area with conflicting precedents and with strongly held opinions on both sides. In most cases, the exact birthdate is not necessary to the understanding of the biography. In those cases, we should err on the side of protecting privacy. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 04:11, 24 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I've reverted the changes for now to allow more discussion. I have to disagree with changing "all" to "any" though, as I think that would mean deleting quite a few birthdates out of articles that we currently have that haven't posed a problem before. I wouldn't be opposed to rewording the last bullet to be less inclusive though <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 04:21, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>re: "all" → "any" - Can you give examples of biographies that would be affected? I couldn't think of any. Most of the examples that I could quickly find are entertainers and politicians who clearly do qualify for both the first two.

<p>Just so you know, I tend to err on the side of more information, and birthdays are useful, especially if they are published. While it is probably crossing the line to go to a courthouse or a Zabasearch to look up an individual's birthday, many times so-called "non-notable" people will have profiles done of them, and sometimes they will have birthdays published in the newspaper. I like the original statement better, which allows the placement of said information. One example of people that would qualify are the many fashion models we have on WP. Their agencies publish profiles of them that often include their birthday (if not their birth _date_). I will continue to add that information as appropriate. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 03:26, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added a section about admins maintaining their privacy if their wish to maintain their anonymity as Wikipedia administrators. Admins can also cover for each other in deleting articles about admins if those articles expose the identity of an admin that wish to remain somewhat anonymous. The obvious problem being managed is that a Wikipedia admin might be stalked by blocked users if their true identity is known. There has only been once such case so far and it is recent. The text reverted under a new sub-section name of <i>Wikipedia Administrators</i> under the Privacy section was:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Wikipedia Administrators who are notable persons in their own right are permitted to delete and otherwise block biographies written about themselves and their notable immediate family members if they feel that such articles compromise any anonymity that they wish to maintain as administrators, in particualr so that they can minimize being stalked by blocked users.

One administrator may take such a deletion action on behalf of another administrator.</i></dd>

<dd>I don't think the page should be made policy yet, as long is it continues to have meaningful changes made to it.

At some point it should be policy, but lets leave it for now.

<dd>I removed the privacy of birthdays thing because it didn't seem to make sense. If a birthday has been published by a reliable, mainstream publication, it's no longer private. If it hasn't been published, or is published only in a disreputable publication, then we shouldn't be adding it anyway.

<dd>During the Brian Peppers debate, his exact birthdate was published on his sex offender profile, which was released by the government - The most reliable source we can expect for this info. There were 2 administrators who were deleting his birthdate because he was a "non-public figure" and they didn't think we should be publishing birthdates of non-public figures. Needless to say I strongly disagreed with their logic, and so did many other editors, and there was a revert war over including it or not before Jimbo came in and deleted the page. That is why this needs to be in in the policy, so we either know it can be added or know it can't.

<dd>I see. Thanks for explaining. It seems to me that this kind of example would be covered by the policy. If the information has been made public by a reliable source, we can use it. However, if a person complains, we should bear in mind that BLP recommends sensitivity, particularly for non-public figures. The question to ask is: is the date of birth relevant to the person's notability? Clearly, it wouldn't be unless it was an article about, say, a 50-year-woman who became known because she had an affair with a 14-year-old boy, and even then the exact date probably wouldn't be relevant. So I would say, in a case like Brian Pepper, that if he complains, we should remove the date; but if he doesn't, we should leave it in. Do you know whether he complained? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:06, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Someone claiming to be a relative of his complained that we had an article on him at all, not specifically mentioning the birthdate as far as I know.

<dd>I've looked through the archives, and I can only see two people who argued very briefly that the date of birth should be left out. No one made a big deal of it, and I think they were just trying to pare the article down to the absolute minimum: the date of birth wasn't in itself an issue. I'd say the policies and this page are pretty clear: material may be published by us if already published elsewhere, but if someone complains, show a bit of sensitivity so long as the issue doesn't go to the heart of why they're notable. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:30, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I remember birthdays coming up but in a completely different context. (I'm afraid I don't remember the article but I do remember the arguments which were made.) Technically, your birthdate is a matter of public record since it's recorded on your birth certificate. But it is sufficiently difficult to find the paper copies (since you generally have to go in person to the county courthouse where the person was born) that birthday is often used as a piece of data when authenticating your identity (for example, on a banking application). Given that it is commonly used for identity and that it can be used to commit identity theft and that identity theft is the fastest growing class of crime right now, we should use extra caution before publishing the birthdates of living persons. There are, of course, exceptions for people who are clearly public figures but people who have put themselves that far in the limelight already have to take extra precautions against identity theft. For the rest of us, if the article can survive without the birthdate, we should leave it out in the interests of privacy. I agree that if a birthdate is not reliably sourced, it should come out. But that's a minimum. Even if you do have a reliable source, it still may not be appropriate to include a birthdate in the biography of a living person. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 02:00, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Very valid points. I would think that for anyone where this would even remotely be an issue, a birth year would suffice -- then people can figure out how old the person is but there's a much lessened chance of identity theft or other potentially damaging behavior. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 18:51, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe I should give some examples of the type of things I'm concerned about. I'm a fan of many obscure singer-songwriters that play intimate shows to small groups of fans, but generally can enjoy having the same level of privacy of average citizens. Someone recently wrote an article for one such artist, possibly someone who knew him personnally, because the original version included an exact birthdate and the names of his parents.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AJ_Roach&amp;oldid=48954314" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AJ_Roach&amp;oldid=48954314" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> I removed this, but now the cat is out of the bag and copies of the wikipeida article appear elsewhere.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22AJ+Roach%22+born+%22December+23,+1975%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22AJ+Roach%22+born+%22December+23,+1975%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> In another example, it is here on wikipedia that I learned that <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_Foucault_6545.html" title="Jeffrey Foucault">Jeffrey Foucault</a> and <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kris_Delmhorst_b608.html" title="Kris Delmhorst">Kris Delmhorst</a> are married--these artist don't publicly advertize this relationship. The only reliable source I found to back this up was a single article in the Boston Globe that said, "oh, by the way...," In our article on Foucault, his marriage is mentioned in the second sentence. I like the idea of wikipedia having a policy that says "hey some details aren't relevant and it's better if we choose to leave them out."

<dd>In cases where privacy is not an issue (e.g. the person currently publicizes their birthdate on their web site), I like showing the exact date. One minor utility, is it helps disambiguate between people with similiar names. I find it handy when matching bios between different languages wikis. Maybe one day, we'll even be able to have software convert the birthdate into a current age. So, I'ld hate to see a loss (or failure to capture) the data. Basically, my rule is, if you have any reason to think the exact birthdate is being withheld by the subject, then we should withhold it. But, if somebody is giving it out, by all means show it. Perhaps for now, we should simply ask for sensitivity on the issue, without formulating an exact rule. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:40, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

The people who need protection are notable non-famous people. Somebody who publishes a new cancer treatment in a medical journal is seeking notability, but not necessarily fame. Also, I object to the "Reputable and public source" wording. Things like the eSorn Sex Offender List, which list with Brian Peppers, is an example of a reputable public source, but the people on it, are argueably private figures. It's also redundant to say reliable, because theoretically all sources of information we use are suppossed to reliable. I suggest for living figures we could require an up-to-date online publication that is well known nationally or internationally. For instance, if a birthdate is pubished at CNN.com, we do no added harm by showing it. If somebody's birth was announced in a paper newspaper in 1985, then our use of the date *might* pose harm in a few cases. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 09:11, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If judging by the comments made on the mailing lists, it seems to me that upgrading this guideline to policy (either in its current form or suitably amended) it is very much necessary, in particular as the profile of Wikipedia becomes more prominent.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dead people</span></h2>
<p>Regarding categories, one issue/problem with having a living-specific policy, is we could have conflicts with regard to dead people. For instance, the policy says living people must be convicted of a crim Consider the wording:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>For example, add only people convicted of a crime in a court of law to Category:Criminals, and make sure the conviction was not overturned on appeal. See Wikipedia:Categorization of people.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Does this also apply to dead people? If it does, we should say so explicitly here, and elsewhere. If it doesn't, we have a major consistency issue. Currently, there's a disagreement over sub-cats of <a href="../../../c/r/i/Category%7ECriminals_c838.html" title="Category:Criminals">Category:Criminals</a> as to whether people famous for committing crimes, but who never were convicted, should be placed in the category. For instance, a renowned (lond dead) brothel operator, is known definatively to have committed a crime, but may never have been convicted. Since living and dead people go in the same category, some common approach seems warranted. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 15:41, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The issue is resolved in the minds of competent editors who understand <i>why</i> we are careful in labeling living humans as criminals. No amount of detail in policy and guidelines can replace people actually knowing what they are doing when they edit. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 16:48, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently, you feel you are the competetant editor, and I am not. Please, enlighten me, and inform me what the policy is in terms of dead people known to have done criminal activity, and not convicted of it.

<dd>Added: I think it's important to note a distinction between categories, and other claims within a biography. Those other claims are contained only within the biography article, so we can easily treat living bios with extra sensitivity, beyond that we would dead people, especially long dead historic figures. But, when a category has both living and dead people, it is not so easy to treat them differently. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:03, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>you feel you are the competetant editor, and I am not</i> You misunderstand me. I have no idea who you are or what you are good at. I am saying <b>it depends</b>. How long has he been dead, how much evidence is there he is dead, how much evidence is there he belongs in a category, is the category made irrelevant by time or other factors (Christ was executed for being a criminal, heads of state have been executed by conquoring kings as criminals), is defamation a factor, is a lawsuit a factor, does the category help people find things or is it just a way of insulting or is it mindlessly following a rule?

<dd>These were the examples that brought this to light, but I don't want us to focus to much on specific cases (note: I did revert myself, and put back the category). My concern here, is the illogic have having different rules for inclusion in the *same* category. Treating one group better then another within the same category seems to be a form of bias. Where living and dead people are in the same category, we should go by the higher standard (e.g. one for living people) and use that standard for all people. If we want a lower standard for dead people, we should have a separate category for them (e.g. "Category:Deceased criminals"). Perhaps <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> should apply to all entries in a category, if any entry may be a living person. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:17, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Exactly. Things are considered criminal here that are perfectly legal in other countries. Who are we to label them criminals? Unless we define criminals as people who violated the law of the country they were in at the time of committing the act.

<dd>Andries, you need to read that sentence in context with the first part of the section that reads" <i>[critics] views can be represented so long as the material is relevant to the subject's notability, is based on reputable sources, and is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article, or appear to side with the critics' material.</i> This is 100% compatible with the content policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<dd>Also note that there is no such policy of <b>due weight</b>. The policy of NPOV refers unambiguosly to <b>undue weight</b> in this context.

<p>The template can be placed on the talk pages of biographies, so that new editors know what to do, and so that subjects of bigraphies can see what policies apply and who to contact if something goes wrong.

<dd>I think advice on what people should do about their own biographies, perhaps belongs in <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> (bio subjects are often sent there). I have suggested on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAutobiography_b78f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Autobiography">Wikipedia talk:Autobiography</a>, that people seeing negative unsourced statements should *not* wait for assistance from other Wikipedians, but should instead just remove such stuff. You're idea of a list of editors willing to help such people is still good (and can go in either/both places), but I don't want people to think they have to tolerate negative unsourced statements about themselves for one second. Hypothetically, if somebody says you were implicated in a Kennedy assassination (for a purely random example), please don't ask for help first, just remove the junk. Nobody should revert you, and if they do, then you can go to <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> for some help (e.g. blocking the offender). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:32, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rob, I agree that subjects should be allowed to remove unsourced negative material, but I've seen it happen several times that they end up being blocked for disruption or 3RR, or they make a legal threat and get blocked indefinitely. I think this is happening less and less because the Foundation has made it clear that it takes living bio issues very seriously, but even so, I think it's helpful if a subject can be directed quickly to WP:BLP where he can find information abour the policies and who to contact if there's a problem. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:30, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps there ought to be a template for the article itself as well? Living people with articles about them seem (from their statements in other media) to frequently arrive at Wikipedia with no idea how to use the site, and too upset to go through the documentation carefully, and they tend to either go away and say bad things about Wikipedia or mangle the article reporting what's wrong with it. Something like: "This article describes a living person. If you are this person and wish to provide corrections, please add to the discussion page". At least in the case of Jaron Lanier, his initial response was to add his discussion of the article to the article itself, where it was quickly removed (along with any changes to the actual article content he had made). I suspect that if there had been directions for him on a page he saw, he could have resolved the issues without the frustration. 66.92.72.41 15:59, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some advice please. There is a page about Z, the leader of a group. Editor A was a former member of Z's group and believes it is a cult. On the Z article talk page, A expressed his opinion that the "Z's group broke up my parent's marriage." Editor B, a current member of Z's group, removed the comment based on this policy. (I think that removal can be justified.) Would it be justified to remove the same comment from A's talk page discussion with editor C? (Neither A, B nor C are accusing others of violating WP:CIVIL, ie this is not part of a rant). <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 17:32, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The argument that the rules which apply to article space "logically shouldn't be limited to" article space seems to me to fail to take into account the major differences between article space and non-article space. In article space, Wikipedia might be construed as endorsing any claims it repeats. In non-article space, where people are signing their posts, it is clearer that people are speaking for themselves and not on behalf of Wikipedia. I must confess I'm unclear on how such a <i>major</i> policy point came to be made during a "light copy edit"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49558727" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=49558727" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>; the post of Jimbo's that is provided as a reference <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/046433.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/046433.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> is clearly discussing article space (the only place where {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_needed_0ed6.html" title="Template:Citation needed">citation needed</a>}} tags are used) and <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html#Biographies_of_living_persons" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">Wikipedia:Blocking policy#Biographies of living persons</a> doesn't say "if the material is unsourced, or incorrectly sourced," it says "the material is unsourced, or incorrectly sourced, and <i>may constitute defamation</i>."

<dd>I find Gimmetrow's example above to be a perfect illustration of why "this applies everywhere" is taking things way too far -- is Gimmetrow seriously suggesting that Editor A cannot express his own opinion about his own personal experience until a reliable source has published "Z's group broke up the marriage of Editor A's parents"? (For that matter, it's highly disturbing that a policy about "biographies of living persons" is being used to justify removal from the talk page of an article, not about living person Z, but about Z's <i>group</i>. Where exactly does this logic of "well, it <i>isn't</i> about a living person, but it's about something <i>associated with</i> a living person" stop?) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:04, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um, no, that's not what I was suggesting. In fact, I disagree with the removal of material from the talk page. Editor B has been using the policy (negative material about the living subject of a biography may be removed from the article and associated talk page) to delete all negative material, even items of a non-rant nature that relate to the other editors understanding their respective backgrounds. (Article is about Z himself, btw.) On no other controversial page I follow is similar, non-rant content deleted from talk pages. Nevertheless, it seems <i>possible</i> to support it based on the former policy, and in fact editor B has basically threatened other editors with violation of this policy if such discussion happens again. The "article and its talk page" part has been in place for a month, and while it does seem a bit much to extend to talk page, it's specific and applies to only two pages. Extending this to all wiki is a <b>bad idea</b>. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 20:31, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Gimmet, the point is that Wikipedia is a public website, so when we post material on it, we are publishing it. Anything false and harmful is therefore a potential libel; and the law apart, we also have a moral responsibility to be fair to people.

<dd>Be kind to newbies. I'm trying to figure out the policies. I'm interested in this because on a few other pages, discussion that is much more negative and propagandistic is left on the talk pages. I'm fine that some things are not OK on an article talk page, but it seems that both me and AF have a problem with extending the policy to all of wiki. If you want to comment on my specific example, here's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AFrancis_Schuckardt&amp;diff=56860130&amp;oldid=56768091" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AFrancis_Schuckardt&amp;diff=56860130&amp;oldid=56768091" rel="nofollow">diff</a>. The discussion relates to the arbitration hearing on this article. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 00:42, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AFrancis_Schuckardt&amp;diff=56860130&amp;oldid=56768091" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AFrancis_Schuckardt&amp;diff=56860130&amp;oldid=56768091" rel="nofollow">example</a> is exactly the type of thing we should remove, on sight, if unsourced. People with a personal involvement in something, who are saying somebody hurt them (or their loved ones) are particularly problemetic, because there's potential for a maliscious intent (I'm not saying that's the case here). If it's not published, it shouldn't be included. The one big difference between article space and talk space, which I'll concede, is that we shouldn't be "picky" about footnoting/detail in talk pages. For instance, if I say <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a> was with the Klan, I probably don't need to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/23/elec04.h.duke.ap/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/23/elec04.h.duke.ap/index.html" rel="nofollow">footnote</a> every sentence, as its readily available in many authoritative sources. However, the same fact (and all related ones) should be thoroughly cited in the article, with footnotes galore (especially certain ones, that are disputed). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 18:27, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I appreciate your response, and I'm glad someone responded. Yes I can see that it could be problematic. But sometimes these issues need to be discussed somewhere, and the editor in question won't even allow a link on the talk page to an external site set up to discuss these issues. If google caching is an issue, then it would seem obvious: prevent caching of user pages. Apparently Antaeus Felspar above also has some concern with "applies everywhere." <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 17:23, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

My father filed and won an "Alienation of Affection" court case in Ohio against the man I claimed broke up my parent's marriage. For this reason, I would claim that my input in the article was not libelious. How fine is the detail on this. Does every negative comment on the talk page about a living person need a reference? If there is already a statement in the artilce claiming that the subject of the article breaks up marriages, could a person write on the talk page: "My parents are another example of what is referred to in the article." <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBernie_Radecki_e722.html" title="User:Bernie Radecki">Bernie Radecki</a> 00:19, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What if Mr. Foo says Mr. Bar is a pedophile? What if nobody else has ever made that allegation, and there's no evidence to support it. Do we allow it in Mr. Foo's article, just because it was said by Mr. Foo. In such a case, we would be the first independent publisher of the that allegation. Just because somebody has an article, doesn't mean they should be given a pulpit to preach from it. If Mr. Foo is truly notable, and people care about Mr. Foo's opinions on Mr. Bar, they'll be covered independently. For instance, we can easily cover the <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_Chicks_777c.html" title="Dixie Chicks">Dixie Chicks</a> criticisms of Bush, because they're widely covered (and similiar criticisms have been made by countless others). Also an inherent danger of personal web sites, and blogs, is the author (Mr. Foo) can retract/reword anything, at anytime, with no explanation, with no record in archive.org or google cache, or anywhere else (archival against consent is copyvio). In such cases, one could never prove Mr. Foo actually said what we claimed he did. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:00, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disputed statements from personal site as source</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Foo's personal website says that Mr. Foo did X. This fact is not published in any other reliable source. The counter-claim exists, but not in a reliable source that can be used in a wiki article. Perhaps it's in a blog (not reliable), perhaps Mr. Foo has even admitted the contrary in person or private letter (not verifiable), or in maybe the source doesn't fall under fair use for some reason. Is the statement that "Mr. Foo did X" allowable in the article? What about "Mr. Foo states that he did X"? What, if any, notice should be taken that this is disputed in sources wiki considers unreliable?

<dd>In your example above, Gimmetrow, it is verifiable that Mr. Foo made or makes claims A, B and C. And that is what we can report in the article about Mr. Foo.

<p><a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a>, you are missing an important point. As Wikipedia editors it is not our job to determine the truth or decide which point of view is most valid. Because we take this position, it doesn't matter if a particular fact appears in an article or not if it is not verifiable, notable information that is supported by reliable sources. If something is disputed by a non-valid source, editors without a point of view about the topic are not too likely to care one way or the other if the information is left out of the article. It is possible that harm can come to a living person if someone plants false information about him or her. For that reason, we need to be careful about repeating information that conflicts with that reported by an individual in this situation. The best course of action might be leaving the information out completely until the conflict is cleared up.</p>
<p>Traditionally, individuals self-report their educational and employment history on CV's that they give to outside organizations. For that reason, it is unlikely to matter if their college graduation is self-reported on their web site vs. another organization's web site. If we are lucky, we can find CV's posted on an employer's web site or the person might have a profile available from a business or professional organization. Often these organizations require people to sign statements that the information is valid and sometimes it is validated. Since self reporting is the most common method of getting this type of information, if I saw a conflict between self reported information on an individual's web site and information in a published profile, I might carefully explore the matter by checking publications dates, looking for corrections, or looking for more published sources to double check the information. Unfortunately, it is possible that an "opponent" is knowingly exploiting an innocent publishing error or even planted the error in a borderline reliable source, like an interview with a reputable news organization. For this reason, like I said above, completely removing the information might be the most appropriate response if a living person complains about the information in an Wikipedia article or if there is a conflict that you have not completely resolved. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 17:07, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>FloNight, I understand what you're saying, I said much the same above - in most cases the facts involved would be too unimportant for an encyclopedia. The appropriate approach would be to either leave the information out, or perhaps to report it in the simplest way possible as "Mr. Foo says he did X". The other statements might appear in an article if supporters or critics of Mr. Foo get involved. The issue seems to be that there is only one "reliable source" here, a weak source that could be self-serving. Would the existence of blog-level dispute be grounds to exclude mention of Mr. Foo's claim as "contentious"? Even if the dispute were planted by an "opponent", it would mean some opponent finds the claim contentious enough to create a dispute. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 17:32, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An important distintion, Gimmetrow. Statements of critics of Mr. Foo can be described in the article of Mr. Foo, if their POV is reported by a reliable published tertiary source only. A blog is not considered a reliable source (unless the blogger is a notable expert on the field which that Blog is about). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 17:50, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Take it to an extreme and you may see this clearly. Imagine a blogger starting a blog "redmondSucks.com" by an ex-employee of Misrosoft, in which he writes that higher-up Microsoft executive XYZ is an alcoholic, based on the blogger's witness accounts. Would you consider adding that information to that excutive's article in WP? Of course not. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 17:59, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is not the scenario I'm talking about. I'm imagining a positive statement executive XYZ makes, perhaps that he donated $B to charity C, but which is disputed in a non-verifiable way. Not mentioning either claim or dispute would be fine. If the claim were mentioned, would it be considered self-serving or contentious or otherwise objectionable? Would it be contentious to say that "nobody disputes this"? Would it be contentious to say not that XYZ claims it, but that it <i>did</i> happen, since all reliable sources are in agreement on this? (I mention the latter because I recall a discussion where some editor was arguing exactly that - if all reliable sources agree the encyclopedia can state it as if it were "truth.") <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 18:12, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

A blog claims that he has not such <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_pitch.html" title="Perfect pitch">perfect pitch</a> and that ths is a self-serving statement by Mr. Foo. As per guidelines, we <i>can</i> state Mr. Foo's claims of perfect picth, and we <i>cannot</i> state that it is disputed, as a blog is not a reliable source. Also, we cannot state that "nobody disputes this" as that statement is not not verifiable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 20:03, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think we'd need a real example, because these hypothetical ones may not be including all relevant factors. The opposition can't positively affirm that evidence is excluded. The way to write articles is simply to report what all reliable sources have said, and perhaps add "according to" if the source isn't very good. "John Doe, chief executive officer of Doe Inc, became a well-known contributor to Charity X in 2005, according to his website." Or if the source is the NYT, cite the article after the sentence, because they are regarded as a very mainstream, reliable source and so "according to" wouldn't normally be needed. But be careful not to use "according to" in a way that undermines what the source says. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:12, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello again <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a>&#160;: - ) The term "self-serving statement" needs to be used with care. Remember that the real living people that we are talking about are much more than subjects of Wikipedia articles. It probably would never occur to them that someone would see the ordinary statements found on their web site as <i>self serving</i>. In the example I used above about the CV, many people would be insulted to have their CV labeled as a "self-serving statement." We need to be careful with the language we use. This something that experienced Wikipedia editors have learned over time and the reason that <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> was written.

<p>I have some concerns about this sentence: "Editors should remove any unsourced or poorly sourced negative material from biographies of living persons and their talk pages, and may do so without discussion and without regard to the three-revert rule." First, just from a technical perspective, doesn't this mean that we have a guideline (BLP) trumping policy (3RR)? I understand that there is a push to make this policy but regardless of the merits, I would advocate taking out the invitation to violate 3RR until this is policy. Having said that, I think that it should <i>not</i> be policy, as it undermines the spirit of 3RR which is that if your reversion is proper, others will support it. What I find especially troublesome is the phrase "poorly sourced" as this is an invitation to POV, I think. If something is clearly defamatory -- well, let's say I restored the Siegenthaler article to its former horrid state, and continued to revert back to it. Would an individual editor need to violate 3RR to protect the article from me? I think what would happen is multiple editors would be elbowing each other out of the way to undo what I had done, and I would be swiftly blocked. Why is that not enough? Also: editors may make multiple “without discussion?” That seems utterly contrary to the spirit of WP. I would love to have everyone’s input. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 18:52, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Disagree. Sometimes open discussion is not desirable. The information must be removed ASAP.

<dd>Since leaving the material in can cause real world harm, we remove the problematic material first and discuss it later. Deleting the material does not stop discussion and development of consensus. It stops the harm that may occur to real people and Wikipedia if harmful information is allowed to remain on the site. Jimmy Wales has said:</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"I can NOT emphasize this enough. There seems to be a terrible bias among some editors that some sort of random speculative 'I heard it somewhere' pseudo information is to be tagged with a 'needs a cite' tag. Wrong. It should be removed, aggressively, unless it can be sourced. This is true of all information, but it is particularly true of negative information about living persons."</dd>

<dd>IronDuke, what you say is correct for pages that are watched a lot, but there are lots of bios that few people have on their watchlists, and for those pages, editors have to be able to remove unsourced or badly sourced negative material, even if someone else is constantly trying to restore it. The vandalism policy also trumps 3RR, as does the banned user policy, so we're not introducing a precedent here. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:16, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you both for responding so quickly. I see what you both are saying, but it seems to me that the only solution to someone inserting bad info on a BLP is to call for help. It isn't going to do any good reverting more than three times, not in the long run. And again: "without discussion?" That seems so contrary to everything else here. What do you think of this: a BLP notice board, monitored by admins, could be created and after a first reversion of bad info on a BLP, editors could leave a warning template on the other user's talk page and report it at the BLP notice board. That will solve the problem and get the bad info off WP a lot faster than silent, multiple reversions. Slim, as to your point: reversions in regard to vandalism and banned users are policy, not guidelines, right? I hope I'm not nit-picking here, but this is only a guideline and I think the issue is serious enough that it should either be policy or editors should not be encouraged to violate 3RR. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 22:28, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Editors should remove any unsourced or poorly sourced negative material from biographies of living persons and their talk pages, and may do so without discussion; this is also listed as an exception to the three-revert rule."</p>
<p>The essential phrase "Editors should remove any unsourced or poorly sourced negative material" occurs twice in this article, and it's badly writen because it's not clear. Does it only refer to negative material? Or is unsourced material meant to be singled out whether negative or not? It can be read in two possible ways:</p>
<p>Editors should remove any unsourced (or poorly sourced negative) material</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Editors should remove any (unsourced or poorly sourced) negative material</p>
<p>This issue has actually come up, in the context of bio of a living person in which some editors seem to think that so long as material is not negative, it really needs no good source. Thus, neutral "info" material or stuff they have from private emails, they believe is includable, simply because it's not libelous. I would argue that for non-famous persons, it's an invasion of privacy. See the Talk page for <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_McCoy_8b87.html" title="Houston McCoy">Houston McCoy</a> for more. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">Steve</a> 18:38, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The original sentence was "unsourced negative material". "Or poorly sourced" as added to clarify "unsourced." Neutral "info" directly from the subject of the bio is generally includable if relevant, but privacy concerns could prevent inclusion. Truly unsourced material can be removed per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which is a major policy; <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is only a guideline. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 19:15, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that we need to be citing sources. However, let's be realistic. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does not say to remove all information that is unsourced. If we did that, a huge number of articles would completely disappear because they have no source whatsoever. I think it is clear that this BLP guideline is aimed at preventing libel. As such, there is no added imperative to remove unsourced positive or neutral statements from articles on living persons - no more so than our general desire for accuracy and sourcing, and clearly unsourced statements are allowed (not desired) in general. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 21:01, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's say there is an individual who has an article in Wikipedia but who has had very little media coverage and coverage has been primarily negative (say it dealt with his denying the holocaust occurred, allegations that he embezzeled funds from a political party and numerous charities in 1988 and then again in 1994 and 2002, and his participation in starting a soup kitchen in 1996 but that he had to leave due to an allegation of misappropriation of funds. He was only convicted once in 1994). Let's say this individual has a website in which he denies the negative media allegations and claims that the media is against him due to his personal political view that President Bush is controlled by the Israeli state. No media outlet has ever published or mentioned the individual's thoughts on this subject. The individual would like the Wikipedia article on himself to expound on his political theory because he feels that is what he is known for. Further, he objects to the inclusion of the negative material since he feels it is his politcial theory that he is known for. Should the article be primarily about his political theory since his website serves him as a verifiable resource? <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBernie_Radecki_e722.html" title="User:Bernie Radecki">Bernie Radecki</a> 22:32, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, you clearly have a specific case in mind and it would be helpful if you told us what page you're talking about. However, speaking only in generalities, his personal website is <i>not</i> a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable source</a> for any but the most uncontroversial of topics. I might trust a personal website to pull an occasional quote or to correct an entry on hair color but would not rely on it as the basis for the whole article. Furthermore, the website would be a primary source. Citing it would make Wikipedia a secondary source. Encyclopedias, however, are <i>tertiary</i> sources by definition. In general, personal websites do not meet the requirements of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">Wikipedia:Verifiable</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 23:06, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For a person to have an article on Wikipedia, they must be notable in a Wikipedia specific encyclopedic way. This means that they must have <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> about their area of notability. We can use their own web site to help fill in <i>appropriate</i> background details about their life. Depending on their area of notability, we <i>might</i> also use it to expand or clarify their opinions on various topics. Agree that we need to know specifics of the biography to answer the specific issues raised in the question. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green">talk</font></a> 23:21, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>[Francis Schuckardt] is the article I am involoved with although my example above was contrived. In the actual case, there is media coverage on his starting a splinter group from the Catholic Church, allegations of incompetance to be in charge of a church, alleged drug and sexual abuse, allegations that he considers himself to be the Pope, and coverage on the unique or bizarre beliefs and practices of his church. The media coverage started in the early 80s and has occurred as recently as 2005 on MSNBC. Francis Schuckardt's unpublished religious belief is that the Catholic Church in Rome has lost the faith due changing its teachings after Vatican Council II in the late 60s. He considers himself as a bishop of the real Catholic Church. A member of his church started a website after the Wikipedia article was created and has now copied a lot of Shuckardt's unpublished material on the state of the Catholic Church from the website to the Wikipedia article. This case is now in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Francis_Schuckardt/Evidence" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Francis_Schuckardt/Evidence" rel="nofollow">arbitration</a> One of the arbitrators has posted this quote: "If the subject or a their representative edits the article they may offer information correcting the article or that information may be available through a personal website, blog or other self-published material such as an autobiography. Such material should be used in preference to contradictory unsourced material". I am wondering how much of his unpublished beliefs on the state of the Catholic Church should be in the article. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBernie_Radecki_e722.html" title="User:Bernie Radecki">Bernie Radecki</a> 23:50, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To clarify through a somewhat contrived example, if I edit the article and say "The bishop's hair is black" but don't provide a source, you can look to the blog or personal website to overturn that edit and say "No, it was dyed in that picture. The bishop's hair is red". But if someone pulls up a New York Times article which says "The bishop's hair is really blonde", that takes precedence over the non-independent cite.<br />
Of course, none of the sourcing has any bearing on whether or not the bishop's hair color is relevant to the article. The decision about what to include and how much of it to include is an editorial decision to be worked out on the article's Talk page. Your original question was "Should the article be primarily about his ... theory since his website serves as a verifiable resource?" The answer to that question, I believe, is no. The article should <i>primarily</i> be about the things which are independently sourced. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 00:50, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here is just one more question. What if the New york Times article reads: "His barber stated that the bishops hair is gray." Would this published statement that contradicts the bishop's website trump the bishop's website assertion or would you have to give both viewpoints like this: "Although the bishop's website shows him to have red hair, his barber told reporters that his hair is gray."<a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBernie_Radecki_e722.html" title="User:Bernie Radecki">Bernie Radecki</a> 14:56, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Something like the latter would seem appropriate. Even if multiple independent sources agreed the hair was gray, it may be appropriate to also state that his personal website still says it is red. How much this dispute is covered would depend on how important the hair color is to the article. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User%7EGimmetrow_3628.html" title="User:Gimmetrow">Gimmetrow</a> 17:38, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>His website may be used as a source of information about himself in an article about him. How much of it should be included would depend on the article and the context. It shouldn't be so much that it crosses the line from being encyclopedic to turning Wikipedia into a platform for his beliefs. Where that line is drawn is a judgment call for the page editors. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:04, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been watching that article for a while and made comments in its talk page. IMO, the article as written is too long, tedious to read and incomprehensible to all but to insiders. Given that there is very little tertiary sources on the subject, that article needs to be reduced to a much shorter version. Less is more in these situations. As editors of this page are currently under arbitration, I am awaiting to see its result before commenting any further. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 05:00, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps it is against protocol for me to even bring the topic up at this time. I was just curious, that is why I used a contrived example originally.
