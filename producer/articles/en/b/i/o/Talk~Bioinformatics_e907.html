<p>I propose a discussion / breakdown of the common themes which bring together many of the things which are considered 'Bioinformatics' applications or areas of research: for example I'll attempt to start one here:</p>
<p><b>Data-reduction</b> and <b>Visualization</b> <i>Seeing</i> can often be equated with <i>understanding</i>, especialy in diagnostics or in interpretation of results. With the recent increased capacity for acquiring data in biology, the human observer can often not <i>see</i> the entire set of results which can be <i>seen' by the instrument, so we employ computational techniques to reduce the data while maintaining some of the more important underlying meaning, and we present this data in a visually accessible format.</i></p>
<p><b>Integration</b> Likewise, an observer can seldom <i>see</i> all the ancillary data that has been previously observed related to a new experiment. Bioinformatics approaches strive tie togher the relevant data</p>

<p>Why isn't there any discussion of the computational analysis of (non-coding) RNA in this article? In my opinion, RNA secondary structure prediction is one of the successes of bioinformatics. I see that there was a dispute between Bioinformin and Alan Au about RNA Bioinformatics, but surely no one objects to including text on RNA secondary structure prediction, or RNA structure prediction in general? Or do they? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcat100_71dd.html" title="User:Blackcat100">Blackcat100</a> 03:06, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm a newbie, so hope I dont screw this up -- This is addressed to Magnus. The page you link to above, <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequence_analysis.html" title="Sequence analysis">sequence analysis</a> says DNA sequence analysis is the determination of the nucleotide sequence of DNA. That sounds a little different from my idea of the usage -- <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequencing.html" title="Sequencing">sequencing</a> is the term used to determine the sequence of nucleotides, whereas <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequence_analysis.html" title="Sequence analysis">sequence analysis</a> in the context of DNA/bioinformatics is the computational analysis of predetermined sequence to extract information from it. --<a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenkatr_n_89d4.html" title="User:Venkatr n">Venkatr_n</a></dd>

<p>Re: Section on Genome annotation. Although you could argue that Haemophilus was the first free-living organism to be completely sequenced (publsihed July 1995) it should be noted that significant amounts of sequence from other species were completed before (S.cerevisiae Chromosome III (1992), Chromosomes II, VIII &amp; XI (1994), Chromosomes I &amp; VI (1995) and 2.2 Mb of C.elegans (1994)). All of these projects had software systems for the annotation of genome sequence and therfore it is misleading to state that the system for the analysis of Haemophilus was 'first'. It would be better to keep this section general and encourage interested people to the 'Gene prediction' page. Affe 02:43, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel a bit disturbed by the early mentioning of systems biology in this articel. Bioinformatics indeed has a large overlap with systems biology, but there are many, many parts in Bioinformatics that are not really parts of systems biology: protein and RNA folding are if at all at the very edge of SB (they rather intersect with computational chemistry and computational physics), as well as many drug discovery topics are not really SB. The list of non-SB bioinformatics topics can be extended arbitrarily -- just think of the large and diverse areas of phylogeny reconstruction or DNA computing.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, I propose to simply eliminate the systems biology sentence.</p>
<p>Any objections?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>agree</b>: From some viewpoints, systems biology is one component of application of computational biology. From other viewpoints, it can be considered an approach or a philosophy or a paradigm, and others might consider it a field unto it's own. In any case, I don't think it belongs as the second sentence. <a href="../../../j/e/t/User%7EJethero_5908.html" title="User:Jethero">user:jethero</a></li>

<p>On the page move discussion I raised the question of whether there was a distinction per se between the terms Bioinformatics and computational biology. Even if there's only contextual differences (one journal, country, institution, or interlocuter vs. another), it might be worth noting in the article. Is there anything in bioinf that's notably held not to be in compbio? If so, what, and in what contexts? And vice versa, is there anything in compbio that's not in bioinf? In what contexts is either term preferred over the other? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 05:28, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My reading of the above listed NCBI definition suggests that the sentence <i>"The terms bioinformatics and computational biology are often used interchangeably, although the former is, strictly speaking, a subset of the latter."</i> may no longer be accurate. I believe the two to be overlapping rather than one inclusive of the other. Specifically, my experience indicates that bioinformatics has grown to encompass sociotechnical issues (e.g. usability) not normally covered by traditional computation biology. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 04:09, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article titled "bioinformatics" is now much broader than <i>just</i> bioinformatics (as it discusses protein structure prediction, computer simulation of bio systems, etc.) We should reverse the redirects, so Bioinformatics redirs to Computational biology, and Computational biology has the content now at Bioinformatics. -- <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephBarillari_83cd.html" title="User:JosephBarillari">jdb ❋</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosephBarillari_0a57.html" title="User talk:JosephBarillari">talk</a>) 18:14, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> I see no discussion of the logic of such a change on the talk page, or any objection to content beyond the scope of the term "bioinformatics", which AFAIK explicitly includes all of the above, and is the more usual term, as I've encountered them. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 22:47, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There's no discussion of the logic of the change on the talk page because (a) the request to move was added all of four hours ago, and (b) the "move requested" banner says that the discussion will take place <b>here</b>, not there. I admit that bioinformatics is a loosely-defined term (due to its novelty and lots and lots of hype), but the root of the word is <a href="../../../i/n/f/Informatics.html" title="Informatics">informatics</a>, a field into which some things in the article obviously fall (biodatabases, for instance), and some things less obviously fall (physics-based protein structure prediction, for instance). In a complete Wikipedia, the Bioinformatics article would discuss a subset of the comp. bio. article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephBarillari_83cd.html" title="User:JosephBarillari">jdb ❋</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosephBarillari_0a57.html" title="User talk:JosephBarillari">talk</a>) 02:46, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, you're not obligated to discuss it there first, but if there was any feeling that the title was a poor fit to the subject, surely it would have come up <i>already</i>, in the course of editting the page, one way or the other? Y'know, someone saying "stop, you fools, that's not bioinformatics!" (or less melodramatically, but you get the idea). Yes, bioinformatics is the informatics of biological systems; how is that any different from computational biology? I've never heard a bioinformatics talk on biodatabases, but I've been to several (so described) on protein sequencing and structure. I still don't follow the distinction you're getting at, and it's not one I've ever heard a bioinformaticist/computational biologist make. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 06:26, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not at all uncommon in the literature. <a href="http://www3.oup.co.uk/jnls/list/bioinformatics/scope/" class="external text" title="http://www3.oup.co.uk/jnls/list/bioinformatics/scope/" rel="nofollow"><i>Bioinformatics</i></a> says it's concerned with "new developments in genome bioinformatics and computational biology", indicating both that there is a distinction and that the fields are close enough to be covered in the same journal. Likewise, <a href="http://www.liebertpub.com/publication.aspx?pub_id=31" class="external text" title="http://www.liebertpub.com/publication.aspx?pub_id=31" rel="nofollow">Journal of Computational Biology</a> says that it includes (among other things) "new tools for computational biology" and "relational and object-oriented database technology for bioinformatics". That there is overlap between the fields is undeniable, but that shouldn't stop us from picking the more general term. As to why no-one mentioned it before, I suppose that most people simply don't care. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephBarillari_83cd.html" title="User:JosephBarillari">jdb ❋</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosephBarillari_0a57.html" title="User talk:JosephBarillari">talk</a>) 15:27, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see that these demonstrate anything less than a 100% overlap, and certainly not that either term is more general than the other. The very title of the first journal is an assertion that Bioinformatics includes the full generality of the scope of the article. Possibly this is a matter of transatlantic usage: certainly the use of (unqualified) informatics to mean computing science is more common right of the Atlantic than to the left. If bioinformatics were to carry the same sense that "Medical informatics" does (i.e. medical information science) than I'd agree with you, but that's not the case, certainly as far as how it's used around here. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 19:48, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose</b> It is good as it is. Suitable references can be made to Computational Biology and refining its definition. Morever, the public perception for the word Bioinformatics is greater than for computational biology. One wouldnt want to see the user redirected to a new location when he wants to know something about Bioinformatics (which has enough to talk different things than Computational biology).<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatarajanganesan_0eab.html" title="User:Natarajanganesan">Nattu</a>
<ul>
<li>Er, we redirect people all the time from specific terms to general ones when we only have articles for the latter. I suppose the correct way to do this would simply be to <i>write</i> a cbio article, move the appropriate parts of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioinformatics.html" title="Bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a> there, and link back and forth. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephBarillari_83cd.html" title="User:JosephBarillari">jdb ❋</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosephBarillari_0a57.html" title="User talk:JosephBarillari">talk</a>) 15:27, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But it's <i><b>not</b></i> a more general term. The second remedy here seems to me to be worse; this is not two distinct topics, this is a single topic with two names, both of which are fully covered in the present article; and for which there's already a redirect, so there's no possibility of anyone 'missing' the article. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlai_39a8.html" title="User:Alai">Alai</a> 19:48, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly oppose</b>.

<dd>It's the fact that, because I am a mathematics person, I find that there's a slight difference between Bioinfo and Comp. Bio. I looked at it from a point of view, that Computational Bio should only be a small portion of Bioinfo. Put it this way, in a way, Bioinfo is a broader term than Comp.

<li>I think of bioinformatics as primarily concerned with sequence analysis and function prediction (genomics mainly, I guess) while computational biology is less concerned with deducing information from nature, while more concerned with predicting information about nature via simulations of biological processes.

<p>In the following I discuss some editing history of this page and try to justify my actions, weighing in on defining the distinction between bioinformatics and computational biology.</p>
<p>On March 17th, 2006, I contributed to the Wikipedia definitions of bioinformatics and computational biology by reversing "former" and "latter" in what came before to result in the following sentence, thereby more closely rephrasing the definitions from BISTI at NIH:</p>
<p><i>The terms bioinformatics and computational biology are often used interchangeably, although properly the former typically focuses on algorithm development and specific computational methods, while the latter focuses more on hypothesis testing and discovery in the biological domain.</i></p>
<p>I also added the distinction and phrases of "technique-driven research" and "hypothesis-driven research" in <i>Although this distinction is used by National Institutes of Health in their working definitions of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, it is clear that there is a tight coupling of developments and knowledge between the more hypothesis-driven research in computational biology and technique-driven research in bioinformatics.</i></p>
<p>On July 28th, the first sentence was changed anonymously to:</p>
<p><i>the former typically involves the manipulation of large biological databases, whilst the second includes model building and simulations.</i></p>
<p>I disagree with this change because I think that neither "manipulation of large biological databases" nor "model building and simulations" is sufficient to describe what either bioinformaticians or computational biologists do in practice respectively.</p>
<p>As a sampling of research activities of bioinformaticians and computational biologists, please see for example <a href="http://www.birc.au.dk/bioinformatics2006/program.php" class="external text" title="http://www.birc.au.dk/bioinformatics2006/program.php" rel="nofollow">the program</a> of <a href="http://www.birc.au.dk/bioinformatics2006/" class="external text" title="http://www.birc.au.dk/bioinformatics2006/" rel="nofollow">The Nordic Bioinformatics meeting in 2006</a>.</p>
<p>Below I describe what I believe is a consensual view of the definitions of these terms and their distinctions. I define the fields in terms of the training, competence, interests and activities of the people who practice them.</p>
<p>A computational biologist is a biologist, while a bioinformatician need not be a biologist. A biologist is someone who:</p>
<ol>
<li>is conversant -- to the level of an undergraduate biology degree -- with the fundamentals of the major biological subdisciplines of cell and molecular biology, organismal and developmental biology, physiology, and population biology including ecology, evolution, and systematics,</li>
<li>can critically read the biological literature in their own and related fields of expertise or research, regardless of the technical mode of inquiry used,</li>
<li>can converse with other biologists in their own and related fields of expertise and research.</li>
<li>can recognize and interpret a biological result or discovery in their inquiries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Computational biologists are biologists who conduct hypothesis-driven biological research on a computer. Their research can be published -- without collaboration or coauthorship by other biologists -- in biological journals that are not specialized for bioinformatics or computational biological research. Advances in computational biology need not involve technical advances in the areas of bioinformatics or statistics, but they often do. Rather, such advances usually involve the creative application, extension or synthesis of methods to test biological hypotheses or make discoveries that lead to new hypotheses in the biological domain.</p>
<p>In contrast, one can find today many practicing and accomplished bioinformaticians that have never formally trained in biology and would never call themselves biologists. Among their ranks include computer scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, and physicists. While bioinformaticians can and do carry out computational biological research in collaboration with biologists, they also conduct valuable and interesting research that nevertheless does not advance biological knowledge <i>per se.</i> For instance, bioinformaticians might concentrate on creating, improving and extending algorithms or solving mathematical, computer scientific, or physical problems that have been inspired by biological systems, or posed and reframed from the management and analysis of biological data. Again, such research need not have direct or obvious biological application nor immediately advance biological knowledge to be published and appreciated by the bioinformatics community.</p>
<p>Other examples of bioinformatics research are the creation of new methods for the visualization or mining of existing data to increase the value or utility of existing biological data. These methods become part of computational biological research only first when a biologist uses them to advance biological knowledge.</p>
<p>In a further example, an algorthmic improvement for more efficient estimation of a known statistical quantity of biological interest may be a valuable advance in bioinformatics but is not computational biology until it is applied.</p>
<p>Getting back to the article and the changes made: bioinformaticians do much more than manipulate large biological databases. They abstract the formal nature of biological data and discover and improve algorithms and representations for working with these data and kinds of data. Computational biologists need not be involved in simulation and model-building but rather use every and any available or imaginable technique of bioinformatics, statistics, simulation and model-building that they can muster in order to investigate and discover biological phenomena.</p>
<p>I believe that my views about these definitions lie close to those of other workers in our fields. With this in mind I will revert the sentence that was changed, not out of disrespect for the anonymous author, but to make this article more closely agree with what I believe to be the consensual perspective of working bioinformaticians and computational biologists who are my colleagues. I certainly welcome further discussion towards collaborative improvement of the article on this point. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Ardell_0342.html" title="User:David Ardell">David Ardell</a> 04:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To help alleviate this confusion, the NIH in July 2000 published an official <a href="http://www.bisti.nih.gov/CompuBioDef.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.bisti.nih.gov/CompuBioDef.pdf" rel="nofollow">Working Definition of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</a>:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"<b>Preamble</b></dd>
<dd>Bioinformatics and computational biology are rooted in life sciences as well as computer and information sciences and technologies. Both of these interdisciplinary approaches draw from specific disciplines such as mathematics, physics, computer science and engineering, biology, and behavioral science. Bioinformatics and computational biology each maintain close interactions with life sciences to realize their full potential. Bioinformatics applies principles of information sciences and technologies to make the vast, diverse, and complex life sciences data more understandable and useful. Computational biology uses mathematical and computational approaches to address theoretical and experimental questions in biology. Although bioinformatics and computational biology are distinct, there is also significant overlap and activity at their interface.</dd>
<dd><b>Definition</b></dd>
<dd>The NIH Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative Consortium agreed on the following definitions of bioinformatics and computational biology recognizing that no definition could completely eliminate overlap with other activities or preclude variations in interpretation by different individuals and organizations.</dd>
<dd><i><b>Bioinformatics</b></i>: Research, development, or application of computational tools and approaches for expanding the use of biological, medical, behavioral or health data, including those to acquire, store, organize, archive, analyze, or visualize such data.</dd>
<dd><i><b>Computational Biology</b></i>: The development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>What I take home from those definitions is that (1) a distinguishing characteristic of bioinformatics is that it is concerned with data (generally large data sets or large volumes of data), whereas computational biology includes all uses of computers for biology; and (2) a distinguishing characteristic of computational biology is that it is a branch of biology (i.e its goals are to understand life) wheras bioinformatics includes mathematical and computational goals (such as understanding forms of structure in data sets). I would argue strongly that the two subjects deserve separate Wikipedia pages. <a href="../../../m/g/l/User%7EMglg_c3b1.html" title="User:Mglg">Mglg</a> 21:17, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kind of <b>Disagree</b>, I wouldn't mind this section to be moved to a new article with a link from bioinformatics article, but the content is worth of wikipedia, providing some clean up. There are few dead links and pages linked to that do not contain much. In addition, there is a confusion between research groups who actually publish some work and/or develop some bioinformatics applications or servers and groups only providing technical support in bioinformatics for their institution but do not contribute per se to the field, the latter should not be linked here. The problem is that, many research groups often provide some level of bioinformatics support.

<p>Than genetic algorithms is the opposite of computational evolutionary biology seems a little bit odd to me, as the genetic algorithm was merly inspired by (schoolbook) biology, and have very little to do wiyh biology except for the name (and the fact that it often occures in the bioinformatics literature for solving difficult problems, probably partly because of the name), since it in fact has nothing to do with biology.</p>

  The terms bioinformatics and computational biology
  are often used interchangeably, although the latter
  typically focuses on algorithm development and specific
  computational methods.

<p>I'm a newcomer to this page, but I saw it flagged at WP:WPSPAM, courtesy of the {{Cleanup-spam}} tag. The only link that looked at all dubious was bioinformatics.net, so I removed it, and the cleanup-spam tag as well. The front page of bioinformatics.net does look like a link farm, though it's conceivable someone might find it useful. That site is a redirect to bioinformatics.vg, a domain belonging to the Virgin Islands, the well-known hub of bioinformatics research. There is no reference to bioinformatics.net in the present article. If there is a reason to keep the link, please discuss here. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 22:52, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Much of this discussion and page deals with trying to describe what bioinformatics is by either enumerating it's parts, or defining it in contrast to something else, like 'computational biology' (or trying to insist they are the same thing). The remainder of the page tends to be a battle between people adding thier favourite legitimate bioinformatics resources, tools, publications, centres, and others trying to trip them down (because of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRECTORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRECTORY</a> and spam)</p>
<p>I don't have an exact quote, or a reference as it was presented during a talk, but this very rough paraphrase might start us thinking about this page in a slightly different way.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Every major advancement in the field of Bioinformatics is a direct result of a new type of data being generated, from a real experiment, which is in a form or volume that we did not yet have the capability of understanding. Then there is a scramble to understand this new data. Once the new tools are available, there is only so far you can go with the existing data. Eventually, there is another new experiment done, and a new type of data emerges. -- MICHAEL WATERMAN, University of Southern California in a lecture at ISMB2006, Fortaleza</dd>

<p>From this, I think we might be able to find a focus or thread through some of the content, and perhaps a way of identifying what have been core 'bioinformatics' breakthroughs, versus what are areas and fields and disciplines that simply make use of computers and computational methods and expertise, or focus on lists of people, books or software that call themselves 'bioinformatics'. (To be clear, I am not saying these things are not bioinformatics, in a broad sense)</p>
<p>To go along with this, I would propose that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove all current 'references' that are not used as inline citations (move them to a 'list of books' if we want). It's almost impossible to remain NPOV and exclude some books and papers and not others. -- <a href="../../../j/e/t/User%7EJethero_5908.html" title="User:Jethero">Jethero</a> 05:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>remove all external links, move them to the 'list of bioinformatics research groups' or a similar page and have a policy of no external links (unless they are inline citations). They invite spam, and also legitimate additions that we don't have room for but can't eliminate without violating NPOV or upsetting a fan -- <a href="../../../j/e/t/User%7EJethero_5908.html" title="User:Jethero">Jethero</a> 05:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>continue to remove all software references (move them to a list of bioinformatics software if we want). same arguments -- <a href="../../../j/e/t/User%7EJethero_5908.html" title="User:Jethero">Jethero</a> 05:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>remove all but the slightest trace of the 'computational biology vs. bioinformatics' debate from the top. The intro paragraph is much too long, compared to other 'dispiplines of science' pages, and confusing for someone not familiar with either term. -- <a href="../../../j/e/t/User%7EJethero_5908.html" title="User:Jethero">Jethero</a> 05:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>set up sections which encourage additions of names and dates in bioinformatics (famous bioinformaticians, watersheds, large projects in the past) -- <a href="../../../j/e/t/User%7EJethero_5908.html" title="User:Jethero">Jethero</a> 05:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the field develops rapidly, but we don't yet have the perspective to neutrally call paper/tool/discovery A more important that B, so we should focus on things that have been established as 'notable' in the past, say 5+ years, and get that right. This is another way to avoid the article reading like it should contain a list of tools and resources that are relevant today. (NCBI's GenBank, established in 19xx, was critical for xxxx rather that just a link) -- <a href="../../../j/e/t/User%7EJethero_5908.html" title="User:Jethero">Jethero</a> 05:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
