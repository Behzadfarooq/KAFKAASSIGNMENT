<p>This article in its current state seems to fail to grasp one of the main propositions of evolution. That is that there is no such thing as progress in evolution. Organisms adapt via natural selection to suit their environment. This is not progression but adaption. Therefore to argue that regression is a contrary view is nonsensical. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajts_74ac.html" title="User:Majts">Majts</a> 04:07, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have completed some edits to correct the articles inaccuracies. However now it really looks ridiculous as it now consists of tenuous arguments followed by rebuttals. I can't see how this article can survive but would be prepared to work with any suggestions <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajts_74ac.html" title="User:Majts">Majts</a> 04:35, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reverted your edits for being redundant and at times erroneous (man is not an ape), but I reinserted part of your opening paragraph back in, as it was somewhat useful. The first thing the article said was that there is no such thing as "progress", so I don't see how the article failed to grasp that. I'm still looking for a better title by the way (the "(biology)" really should go) but I haven't thought of a good one yet. Any suggestions? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 11:46, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest "Devolution (<a href="../../../f/a/l/Fallacy.html" title="Fallacy">fallacy</a>)" If it is agreed that progress and regression are nothing to do with evolution then how exactly does "devolution" differ from evolution. Surely that means devolution=evolution and there is nothing more to say. I suggest that you also have a look at the article <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">ape</a> as it will give you some more info on the fact that man is in fact by definition a member of its great family. Arguing against this is like contending that we are also not <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammals.html" title="Mammals">mammals</a> <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajts_74ac.html" title="User:Majts">Majts</a> 14:45, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like your suggestion and have moved the article. As for the human/ape question, I have to look into it a bit more. This seems to be a newer classification. Though scientifically humans should be classified as apes, I don't think it means that they are universally accepted to be so. Since "ape" is not a scientific term as <i>Hominoidea</i> is, it is defined by laymen as much as by scientists. If people have used the word "ape" for hundreds of years to mean tailless simians excluding humans, scientific taxonomy cannot change that overnight and have it universally accepted. The OED (1991), for instance, defines ape as "A member of the <i>Simiadae</i>, having no tail or cheek pouches; including the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang-utan, and gibbons." No mention of humans. Certainly when most people talk about apes, they do not mean to include humans. It is a question of language as much of as science, as far as I can tell (and I think the <a href="../../../a/p/e/Ape.html" title="Ape">ape</a> article should address that better). As such I think that debate should be kept out of this article, though a slight rephrasing of the paragraph in question might be in order, as it contradicts the statement that humans are apes. I'll look into it a bit more. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:02, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow - I never realised it was a point of contention nowadays that mankind is a member of the ape family. Oh well maybe it will take a few more years for the language to catch up with the science&#160;;) Your move prompted me to be bold and rewrite the article. I have also removed the Vonnegut reference because I couldn't see the relevance as Vonnegut didn't even use the term. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajts_74ac.html" title="User:Majts">Majts</a> 21:34, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The effects of systematic and methodological persecution are factors which might cause devolution in any organism; that is why "Methodological operations (m. o.)" are considered to be criminological study material with regard to human beings.</p>
<p>Persecution causes mental retardation, mental illness, and atrophy of muscles and bones even when diet is optimum. Beadtot 10/19/2005 00:53, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure the effects of persecution do cause physical and mental effects, but that would not qualify as "devolution", however it maybe defined, as it has no bearing on <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_inheritance.html" title="Biological inheritance">biological inheritance</a> --<a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajts_74ac.html" title="User:Majts">Majts</a> 01:48, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps the "royal birthmark" examples show devolution of skin replication among specific families. The strawberry-like birthmarks are found on the necks of those families' members, as if a disabling grip might become necessary.

<p>Really, I'm not talking about "misconceptions of evolutionary theory". I'm talking about structural degeneration of the human organism. Just because some appendices are surgically removed, and many books claim that the definition of 'vestigial' means 'lacking any function', do women quit forming them when they conceive children? Certainly not, and foreskins continue to protect penises. But most people see no reason to perpetuate strawberry-shaped "royal birthmarks".

<dd>As the article is solely about "misconceptions of evolutionary theory", which you are seemingly not referring to, then you are surely on the wrong talk page. If you have evidence that birthmarks pose some difficulty to evolutionary theory, then maybe you should address these concerns within the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> article.

<p>I removed this newly added section from the article, as it doesn't deal with the devolution fallacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1892, the Austrian Jew and zionist <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Nordau_1404.html" title="Max Nordau">Max Nordau</a> published his book <i>Entartung</i>, or Degeneration, which became an instant hit in the western world. Nordau describes the human body and civilization as very fulnerable, always threatened by decay. According to him, society is constantly atacked by decadents, who try destroy the complicated whole by claiming independence. This independence is used to quell (self)discipline, organization and responsibility. He compares the decadence of experimental artists, hedonists and others with viruses and disfunction in the human body and the decay of the human body after death, being eaten by small insects. This book influenced notorious lawsuits against <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Dreyfus_b173.html" title="Alfred Dreyfus">Alfred Dreyfus</a> and the Nazi policy of outlawing <i><a href="../../../e/n/t/Entartete_Kunst_3892.html" title="Entartete Kunst">Entartete Kunst</a></i> (Degenerated art).</p>

<dd>'The term "devolution", which normally means a delegation of powers, is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the evolution of a species into more "primitive" forms.'

<dd>Allthough i am a socialist, i am an advocate of the liberal ideal of freedom of speech. I have the impression that an attempt of censoreship is being performed here. Wikipedia is not about deleting undesirable information, but about presenting all information to all the people in the world. I want to note the peculiarity of the nazis taking over a term <i>Entartung</i> introduced by one of the founders of zionism. Not being able to represent this knowledge will mean that only nazis and their allies will discuss and present information dealing on degeneration. I protest against the word 'erroneously'. My experience tells me that enemies of a certain expression can become one of the defenders. It is better to keep a neutral point of view.--<a href="../../../d/a/a/User%7EDaanschr_498e.html" title="User:Daanschr">Daanschr</a> 13:55, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Sentence one of this policy states: 'The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting views.

<dd>You are mistaken. Devolution refers to a fallacy, in which biological evolution is seen as progresssion to an ultimately superior form. Degeneration, as used by Max Nordau, refers to decaying moral standards and decadence. This is not an issue of neutral poin of view, this is an issue of irrelevance. Max Nordau's views on civilisation are irrelevant when discussing biological evolution. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 13:53, 16 August 2006 (UTC)'</dd>

<dd>Nordau refers to the decadent forces as primitive. He is an advocate of higher forms of life (humans) and civilization (western civilization). So the book of Nordau belongs to the heart of the issue described in this article.--<a href="../../../d/a/a/User%7EDaanschr_498e.html" title="User:Daanschr">Daanschr</a> 14:01, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to be wildly jumping to conclusions here. There is no censorship. Max Nordau's views deal with society, not biology, and as such, they are irrelevant. Freedom of speech is not the issue. And biologically speaking, there is no such thing was a higher form of life.</dd>
<dd>For your information, the term Entartung was not introduced by Nordau himself. Nordau objected to what he felt was the degeneration of society. He felt that society should fiercly defend against immorality, to ward off the societal degeration of which he speaks. He knew nothing of biology. And if you'll look at the article again, you'll find it deals with a fallacy concerning biology. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 14:05, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nordau uses the terms evolution and devolution. He may not be a biologist, but he uses knowledge attained from biology. I agree that there are no higher forms in life, but lifeforms can't be made equal as well. It is an ethical issue, a matter of opinion. Dealing with the questions 'what to do' or 'what is right' instead of the question 'how does it work'. The term 'erroniously' is not neutral and not scientifical. It has nothing to do with biology either.--<a href="../../../d/a/a/User%7EDaanschr_498e.html" title="User:Daanschr">Daanschr</a> 14:23, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What about: The idea of devolution started in the 19th century. <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Nordau_1404.html" title="Max Nordau">Max Nordau</a>'s book <i>Entartung</i> (1892, english: Degeneration) was influential in the western world as an advocator of this idea. Nordau was afraid that complex organisms, like a human or a civilization came into existence out of pure chance and could fall apart. The falling apart of civilizations could be prevented by trying to stop 'decadence' and 'anarchy'. He wanted society to stop devolving by punishing people who claim independence, lose (self)discipline or try to become primitive.--<a href="../../../d/a/a/User%7EDaanschr_498e.html" title="User:Daanschr">Daanschr</a> 21:04, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One type of the literary genre of science fiction (and some subsequent forms of humor) neither purports to predict the future whatsoever nor serves as a springboard for an adventure story, but provides affronts to the intelligence of the reader as a form of entertainment (e.g., <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firesign_Theatre_7a2f.html" title="Firesign Theatre">Firesign Theatre</a>'s comedy album "Everything you know is wrong!" and <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slack.html" title="Slack">Slack</a>). The classic examples of this are the stories first by <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Jos%C3%A9_Farmer_abf7.html" title="Philip José Farmer">Philip José Farmer</a> but more better known by <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Pratchett_8474.html" title="Terry Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> in which the world is described as flat. Similarly there have been stories which tickle the concept of progress by inverting it. One short story describes <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoplasm.html" title="Protoplasm">protoplasm</a> as the ideal form of life and that everything subsequent was a disaster brought about by an error of judgement. Such notions are not meant to be taken seriously after one has read them, but while one is reading them one is supposed to be captivated by the notion.</p>

<p>It doesn't mention the word devolution, but it could be rewritten. I think that the sense of humour of postmodernists and science-fiction writers has made the idea of devolution ridiculous.

<p>" Opponents of evolution use the teleological argument for the existence of God, and seek to displace evolution as the central organizing concept in biology. " -- Ok... where in all that is reasonable and historically accurate is someone getting this? Creation has been believed for 6,000 years. The concept of Evolution isn't even a century old yet. Evolution is trying to diprove Creation, not the other way around. In fact, even after Evolution was established, Creation was still taught in the public schools as fact until the 1960's.

<li>The American band <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devo.html" title="Devo">Devo</a>, which is named after the concept of devolution.</li>

<p>I assume we here are talking about regressive evolution, the reduction or total loss of a trait (a non-functional character), within a lineage over time? Or more than one trait for that matter. Like the eyes in cave species or the wings on the kiwi. Must not be confused with pedomorphosis, where traits from the embryonic or juvenile stage (who often but not always reflects an organism's evolutionary history) is kept in the mature individual as well, even if this phenomena can cause some characteristics to degenerate over time, which is what regressive evolution is really about. Personally, I think the article could be a little clearer. 193.217.195.160 12:36, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
