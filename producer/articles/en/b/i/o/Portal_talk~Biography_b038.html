<p>I may have just not found it or it may have already died... but... has anyone started looking into a sort of <b>academic genealogy tree project</b> within the Wikipedia environment? I know there are independent projects/databases run by some Universities but that is usually very limited and not searchable/updateable through the web. Collaborations welcome!</p>
<p>I am a scientist/science historian but can't do the software (maybe like <a href="http://www.wikitree.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikitree.org" rel="nofollow">Wikitree</a>?). Given a development of a code of conduct and some sets of rules (sources to be rigorously trackable, what constitutes a student-mentor tie (PhD?)) I could see this to be a very useful encyclopedic tool. While sifting through orbituaries and books for an article about a German chemist of the 1800's I found that the information on who did his PhD where was usually retained in the sources about the students, not in the sources about the mentor. An on-line tool would even out that gap (e.g., <i>I want to know who studied with (name)</i>).</p>

<dd>My feel toward that is that for some cultural or language-group adjectives such as <a href="../../../f/r/e/French.html" title="French">French</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a>, a clear disambiguation exists: The <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Québécois</a> surely speak French and are <i>French</i>, but not citizens of France. the same could be said for the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrians</a> (they don't speak Austrian, they speak German), or the Americans, who speak English but are not from Britain. <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_People_45ae.html" title="French People">French People</a> takes the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Québécois</a> into account and is thus more accurate. It makes much more sense! And if the convention does not allow for that then it is not a good convention and needs adjusting - or do you want to be called a citizen of the UK even though you are American? So far my humble opinion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarboxen_c1e3.html" title="User:Carboxen">Carboxen</a> 00:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've noticed that at least the French and German Wikipedias, on any biography article, give the birthplace and deathplace at the beginning of the article, rather than merely the year of birth and death. That is, they give it of the form "Billy Bob Williams (born December 12, 1969 in Hicksville, Alabama; died November 6, 2003 in Gator's Creek Georgia)". English Wikipedia articles of course, give those places somewhere in the article, but not at the very beginning like that. Why isn't that a standard for the English Wikipedia? Or even better, why is it a standard for those other Wikpidias? (I tried asking on the German one, but they just directed me to tutorials that tell you that it must be done, but not why.) <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 05:16, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I always liked that style too. Its the Encyclopedia Britannica style. I have to search to find where someone is born or died, and sometimes its not in the biography. Sometimes the death place isn't in the last paragraph, its in the last sentence of the first paragraph. I guess its too late to change. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 04:14, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Not sure about the use of Category:Nationalities by occupation. For instance I found <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shai_Agassi_1acf.html" title="Shai Agassi">Shai Agassi</a> been categorized as American entrepreneur though he is Israeli and Chief Executive of a German company, been only for some years CEO of an American Company. But as far as I know hasn't attended American nationality.</p>
<p>So my question. What is more important: Nationality or location of business?--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Eisenburger_f11e.html" title="User:Peter Eisenburger">Peter Eisenburger</a> 14:45, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My opinion is, that in today's day and age of globalization, such distinctions are often fading among people of public exposure/interest - especially for artists, scientists, managers. For instance, for cases or people who live for &gt;10-15 years in a country different from their citizenship, like the Canadian artist in the US, the American engineer in Germany, the said CEO of a company in the US, this definitely needs to be addressed.</dd>
<dd>I have no problem calling somebody living and working in the US in occupation XY an <i>American XY-ist</i> or so, irrespective of nationality/citizenship. However, for some people that only works one way: Americans are more accepting to calling people in their country <i>Americans</i> irrespective of citizenship, but are probably more reluctant to do so for their own kin abroad (is the American businessman in Dubai an Arab businessman?). All should be treated by the same standard here. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarboxen_c1e3.html" title="User:Carboxen">Carboxen</a> 00:42, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is labeling the first paragraph in a biographical article as "biography" redundant? I don't see other encyclopedias using this convention. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodorus_Jacobus_Frelinghuysen_4d4a.html" title="Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen">Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen</a>.

<dd>The place to ask these questions is at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIOGRAPHY_cf6c.html" title="WP:BIOGRAPHY">WP:BIOGRAPHY</a>, but to answer, yes, it's redundant for short biographies where that is all the article is.

<dd>To be honest, you also need to establish the notability of this guy, why is there an article about him? Does he meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>? Likewise, if the children aren't notable, they shouldn't be included either. For instance, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_W._Johnston_ef05.html" title="John W. Johnston">John W.

<dd>I think that is 100% wrong! Notability determines whether you get an article in Wikipedia, not whether you get mentioned as a child of someone notable. If someone consults the article they may assume incorrectly that the person only had one child, the famous one. Once a person is notable the names of their children should be included in a biography. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 05:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

The sources it has right now are primarily either Plutonium's own sites or threads in Google Group discussions. There is one article from <i>Discover</i>, where a few sentences speak about Plutonium. I find it hard to believe that this all adds up to a <b>B</b> rating ...

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Portal_talk%7EBiography_b038.html" title="Edit section: Richard Walter - Fraudulent Article">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Richard Walter - Fraudulent Article</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Walter_a72e.html" title="Richard Walter">Richard Walter</a> seems to have been created with a large amount of false information, perhaps gathered from a phony/ anonymous press release posted at <a href="http://www.richarddwalter.com" class="external text" title="http://www.richarddwalter.com" rel="nofollow">"www.richarddwalter.com"</a>. Walters's false testimony was actually confirmed in NY v. Robie Drake. In 2003 and again in 2006 his testimony was determined to be false, misleading and could be presumed perjurious on at least one point (perjury being a very specific type of false testimony) by a fedeal judge.</p>
<p>This is all confirmed in the judge's ruling at: <a href="http://www.corpus-delicti.com/drake_v_Portuondo_2006.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.corpus-delicti.com/drake_v_Portuondo_2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">"NY v. Robie Drake"</a> (2006). The acrobat file here was obtained from <a href="http://www.nywd.uscourts.gov/decision/decision.php" class="external text" title="http://www.nywd.uscourts.gov/decision/decision.php" rel="nofollow">United States District Court, Western District of New York</a>. Just select judge John Elfvin's rulings for March 2006 re: the Drake case. You'll need to select more than 100 documents per page to see it. Get the drake file.</p>
<p>I editted the many factual inaccurancies in the page with references to the court record online and articles regarding Mr. Walter's false testimony. However an anonymous editor immediately swooped in and removed those edits. I have reverted the page and posted a warning to the anonymous editor. Now Buzzle45 (<a href="../../../b/u/z/User_talk%7EBuzzle45_f037.html" title="User talk:Buzzle45">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Buzzle45_a0b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Buzzle45">contribs</a>), an original anonymous creator of this false information page designed to rescue Walters flailing credibility, has stepped in to replace anonymous editor <span class="plainlinks">24.240.17.187 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.240.17.187.html" title="User talk:24.240.17.187">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.240.17.187_e7f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.240.17.187">contribs</a> • <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall.ch?domain=24.240.17.187" class="external text" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ipall.ch?domain=24.240.17.187" rel="nofollow">WHOIS</a>)</span>. I am not certain these are two separate individuals.</p>
<p>At any rate, I expected that whoever created the page would change the edits and that this issue would become something that needed an official look - as there are quite a few dedicated and obsessed people determined to keep the actual substance of this court ruling from being public. It hurts Walter, and it hurts more than a few because of their association with him.</p>
<p>Anonymous editor 24.240.17.187 has removed the Richard Walter page at least six times aleady and has also removed this section from the Talk: Richard Walter page at least six times, since 3/18/07 to prevent me from even having a civil discussion about it with others. Buzzle45 (<a href="../../../b/u/z/User_talk%7EBuzzle45_f037.html" title="User talk:Buzzle45">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Buzzle45_a0b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Buzzle45">contribs</a>) has done the same. Not exactly actions that are conducive to resolution, let alone communication. They just don't want the ruling public because of their hero worship (that's assuming that one of the individuals is not actually Richard Walter -this a very distinct possibility).</p>
<p>This information is not libelous. It is corrective. It is the posting of a court's ruling using the court's own document. The Wikipedia entry currently states that Walters was exonnerated by the judge in the Drake case. This is not just false, it is beligerantly deceptive at this point.</p>
<p>Note please that I am the only person in this dispute who must testify in court on a regular basis, under oath - and that I am also the only one willing to be identified.</p>
<p>As it stands, the article is full of false and bloated information about Walters that is designed to prop him up despite the court ruling - so that those who use Wikipedia as their primary nfo source (and there are many too many) will be misled. It is a disgrace to the professional community, and it is the furtherance of a weakly crafted fraud.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to contact me for further assistance.</p>

<p>Brent continues to write libel.</p>
<p>To accuse someone of perjury is a serious charge. Mr. Turvey makes that claim on his own websites, but that is a matter between Mr. Walter and Mr. Turvey to settle in civil court.</p>
<p>I hold Wikipedia to a higher standard.</p>
<p>In reading the court document, in the final ruling in the Drake case, the judge overturns the appeal.</p>
<p>In his opinion, the judge states that Mr. Walter "may" have committed perjury (which he did not), but he rules that such an issue is a moot point because Mr. Drake does not have the basis for appeal.</p>
<p>Thus, Drake's appeal, and all of its allegations are ruled false.</p>
<p>I welcome you to read the decision on Lexis-Nexis and not Mr. Turvey's version on his websites.</p>
<p>While on Lexis-Nexis, I would also encourage you to read about Mr. Turvey's false statements under oath in Mississippi last year and his previous false statements under oath regarding his employment by the Sitka, Alaska Police Department as a detective. (Mr. Turvey lost in court in his bid to claim that he was employed as a detective in Sitka).</p>
<p>Because Mr. Turvey was not allowed into the AAFS, he has spent his short career creating his own organizations and schools. His organizations are nothing more than him and a few of his former "students" posing as a substitute for the AAFS.</p>
<p>Still, the bitterness of rejection has never been exorcised from his soul. He maintains a website that lists several well-respected forensic pathologists as "frauds" (Mr. Walter is not his only victim).</p>
<p>With all due respect, his situation reminds me of a jealous child in the playground who wants to "take his toys and play on his own".</p>
<p><br />
I suggest that the Richard Walter page remain permanently locked in its pre-March 17th state.</p>
<p>Please disregard Bturvey's threat to "show why wikipedia can't be trusted as a source in my class". He has many more enemies than friends; no one will stand in his defense. 02:37, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
