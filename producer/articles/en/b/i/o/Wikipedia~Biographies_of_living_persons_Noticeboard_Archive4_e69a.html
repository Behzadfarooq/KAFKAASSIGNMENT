The article already has extensive and more than adequate amounts of criticisms included already, including reference to Berlet's writings. Yet Berlet incessantly tries to insert multiple paragraphs from his own largely unknown work into the article, and refusing all that time to address numerous issues about his work, which he feels he has a right to include without needing to discuss with other editors. And despite countless requests, he continually uses the derogatory phrase "Newmanite cult" in the talk pages and in edit summaries. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 04:11, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Show me a source in the literature on therapeutic modalities--(a journal article, a statement from APA etc) that cites Chip Berlet and/or his claims in a discussion of Newman. The only mention to be found anywhere in the scholarly literature is in a review of a Newman book (Nissen M et al <i>Theory &amp; Psychology</i>, Vol. 9, No. 3, 417-426 (1999) where the Berlet report <a href="http://www.eastsideinstitute.org/booksunsciendknowreview.html" class="external text" title="http://www.eastsideinstitute.org/booksunsciendknowreview.html" rel="nofollow">is mentioned and dismissed.</a> Berlet's "expertise" is self-proclaimed, and not recognized with respect to Newman. His terminology ("totalitarian cultism") is invented, and has no corroboration in sociological or psychological literature. Please show me a countervailing view if you have one. Likewise, the so-called "editorial oversight" of PRA is self-proclaimed as well, and partisan. It is not suitable as an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabyDweezil_b9a0.html" title="User:BabyDweezil">BabyDweezil</a> 17:52, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article is about Fred Newman, not therapeutic modalities. I do not see why criticism may only be included if it comes from a critic on some approved list. Beyond that, you are no more likely to be persuaded by repeated assertion than I am, so I see no point in simply contradicting each other. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 18:08, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Adminstrator William Connelley referred me to this section BLP for an organization "Landmark Education" as BLP is supposed to handle organizations as well. One of the sources used for a major negative, defamatory statement is a forgery. Here is the quote first from Admin William Connolley:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the crucial point here is the apparent forging by the AmPats. And I don't understand what Sme is doing by adding *both*. The fact that the official one doesn't have Landmark Education suggests at best that Smeelgova hasn't read it. Adding the non-official AmPats, which is near identical apart from the (presumably deliberate) false insertion of Landmark Education, only makes sense if Smeelgova is aware of the difference. In fact I can't think of a way to interpret this that makes sense os Smeelgova's behaviour - you may have a case for complaint William M. Connolley 22:23, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article on Landmark Education has a section on a classification by the government of Austria of Landmark Education being a cult/sect. The section gives two references: one from the web site of the US State Department and one from American Patriots (an unoffical site with advertisting on it). Both sites purport to have the same "status of religious freedom in Austria 2006" report, and they differ by two words: "Landmark Education." <b>Request</b>: I request that you redact the whole section on Austria labelling Landmark Education a cult. <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 04:04, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Here is the statement in the Landmark Education article, together with the real US State Department reference and the forgery:</b> In 2006 the government of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a> listed Landmark Education as a <i>Sekte</i> (cult), along with the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scientology_879d.html" title="Church of Scientology">Church of Scientology</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Church_2f2f.html" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a>, and other groups:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of groups <b>termed "sects" by the Government</b> were small organizations with fewer than 100 members. Among the larger groups was the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scientology_879d.html" title="Church of Scientology">Church of Scientology</a>, with between 5,000 and 6,000 members, and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unification_Church_2f2f.html" title="Unification Church">Unification Church</a>, with approximately 700 adherents throughout the country. Other groups found in the country included Divine Light Mission, Eckankar, Hare Krishna, the Holosophic community, the Osho movement, Sahaja Yoga, Sai Baba, Sri Chinmoy, Transcendental Meditation, <b>Landmark Education</b>, the Center for Experimental Society Formation, Fiat Lux, Universal Life, and The Family. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also note that not only has User:Smeelgova re-added this forged-source report, but also put <b>termed "sects" by the Government</b> and <b>Landmark Education</b> in bold. Smeelgova has repeatedly re-added this redacted material, even after being warned of the forgery. <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 04:10, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tried to check: the American Patriots version doesn't seem to be a forgery; in fact, the official German language version of the same US government report, hosted by the US Embassy in Vienna, agrees with it and lists the group. (<a href="http://vienna.usembassy.gov/de/policy/rel_freedom_rep_austria.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://vienna.usembassy.gov/de/policy/rel_freedom_rep_austria.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). Also, here is the original German text of an earlier version of the Austrian government's report, the <i>Sektenbroschüre</i> of 1999: <a href="http://www.ilsehruby.at/Sektenbroschuere.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ilsehruby.at/Sektenbroschuere.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. It lists Landmark Education under "Psychogruppen" (psycho groups) - Other sources: The Roman Catholic church in Austria lists it as a "Psycho-cult" (<a href="http://www.dioezese-linz.or.at/pastoralamt/weltanschauungsfragen/psych-einleitung.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dioezese-linz.or.at/pastoralamt/weltanschauungsfragen/psych-einleitung.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>). <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 09:43, 20 November 2006 (UTC) [That's just Oberoesstereich, not all of Austria.] and it comes with a warning as well: Der Begriff "Psychokulte" wurde ursprünglich geprägt, um Gruppen zu kennzeichnen, deren hauptsächliche Wirkung in der Veränderung der menschlichen Psyche besteht. Diese Definition läßt trotzdem keine klare Einordnung von Gruppen unter dem Begriff zu.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I guess then there are several things here. First it is possible that Landmark Education wrote to the US State Department to redact the material becuase LE *never* had operations in Austria. There is a world of difference between being a "Psychogruppe" and a "Sekte." Further, even the Vienna Embassy version merely states that it is an "other group" not a "Sekte." <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 10:56, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There were court hearings on the subject in Germany where a similar Senate committee was forced to retract the position that Landmark Educaiton espoused a world view. <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 11:02, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The other thing I noticed is that: A) This is a publication of the US government, not Austria. B) The German language version of it does have Landmark Education, whereas the English language version of the exact same report does *NOT* have Landmark Education. My guess is that Landmark Education wrote to the US government to remove Landmark Education and only took into account the English-language version. In any event, I don't see any source that Austria ever called it a "Sekte", but a "Psychogruppe." <a href="../../../s/m/1/User%7ESm1969_68e2.html" title="User:Sm1969">Sm1969</a> 11:12, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Her psychiatric condition should have no bearing on the matter. I could easily compile a list of Wikipedia articles about mentally ill (or allegedly mentally ill) persons. However, I do think that it should be tightened up - for instance, is reference #3 supposed to account for the claim that "She says she lived in a submarine village beneath Great Salt Lake as a young child until she was kidnapped and taken into Germany at age 4 by Nazi agents"? It's unclear from the article, and the link goes to a newsbank article that can't be directly accessed. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 18:15, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article makes no evaluation of that statement. However, it is a fact that she publicly claimed to have lived her childhood in an underwater submarine base.

<td style="border: solid 1px silver; padding: 8px; background-color: white;">
<p>I'd like to ask for administrative assistance regarding <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">User:Idleguy</a>'s editing of <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingrid_Newkirk_3294.html" title="Ingrid Newkirk">Ingrid Newkirk</a>. She is the president of <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals_5e68.html" title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a>, an animal-rights group. Idleguy's editing in the past indicates that he has strong anti-animal rights views. His editing of Ingrid Newkirk's bio is rising to the level of malice, in my view.</p>
<p>He added to the Early life section, without context <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ingrid_Newkirk&amp;diff=89011215&amp;oldid=87930180" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ingrid_Newkirk&amp;diff=89011215&amp;oldid=87930180" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2003, she made some shocking revealations [sic] stating that "I'd go to work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals myself" adding that "I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day." <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/06/23/EDG11DC9BK1.DTL" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/06/23/EDG11DC9BK1.DTL" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "shocking revealations [sic]" was his own opinion. While the quote is correct, it is not a full quote, and he left one important sentence out that gave some context. The background is that Newkirk used to work in a pound, and was upset by the methods used to put the animals to sleep. She therefore used to go to work early so that she could do the day's killings herself, because she felt she was gentler with the animals. The full quote is here, from an interview with The New Yorker:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would say, 'They are stepping on the animals, crushing them like grapes, and they don't care.' In the end, I would go to work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals myself. Because I couldn't stand to let them go through that. I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day. Some of those people would take pleasure in making them suffer. Driving home every night, I would cry just thinking about it. And I just felt, to my bones, this cannot be right. <a href="http://www.michaelspecter.com/ny/2003/2003_04_14_peta.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.michaelspecter.com/ny/2003/2003_04_14_peta.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both the original New Yorker source, and the source that Idleguy used, contained the sentence "Because I couldn't stand to let them go through [that]." Idleguy left that sentence out, joining the sentence before it and the sentence after it with "adding that," thereby giving the impression that Newkirk enjoys killing animals. He should also have included the rest of the quote to give the full context.</p>
<p>His next edit summary was also a violation of BLP: "the lady seems like an unethical person running a so called ethical organization." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ingrid_Newkirk&amp;diff=89018423&amp;oldid=89011215" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ingrid_Newkirk&amp;diff=89018423&amp;oldid=89011215" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> The edit that accompanied this was meaningless: "She has often made statements that question the ethics behind such statements, especially given that she leads PETA, an organization for ethical treatment," plus a quote from Newkirk, one that is often misquoted. When an anon tried to fix the quote with a correction from PETA in a letter to the editor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ingrid_Newkirk&amp;diff=89239126&amp;oldid=89233287" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ingrid_Newkirk&amp;diff=89239126&amp;oldid=89233287" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Idleguy reverted, saying that letters to the editor aren't reliable sources. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ingrid_Newkirk&amp;diff=89239643&amp;oldid=89239126" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ingrid_Newkirk&amp;diff=89239643&amp;oldid=89239126" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> But of course they are if they're from the organization that has been misquoted.</p>
<p>I've warned Idleguy about BLP, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Idleguy#Your_edits_to_Newkirk_and_PETA" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Idleguy#Your_edits_to_Newkirk_and_PETA" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> but he's paying no attention, and I can't take further action because I'm editing the article. An adminstrative warning would be appreciated. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:57, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Not a dispute, just something worth looking into. She holds public office in New Zealand. The article gives no references as such, but following up one of its external links I confirm that her own official web site caller her a "transsexual and former sex-worker". It doesn't specifically say "prostitute", though (as does our article), and "sex-worker" can cover a lot of ground. Someone may want to look into this one in terms of improving citation. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Asking admin to look at this page - there are about 5 entries citing his book (note, the link is dead/invalid) that appear to be an attack.

<dd>I discussed this issue today with the editor who is adding them. I have found off-wikipedia verification that the quotes, though weird theology, are accurate quotes from the book in question. I would suggest, though, that the article should be expanded as it currently gives undue weight to the individual's sexual philosophy. This same user was adding essentially the same paragraph to other articles, for example, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Baptist_6ff1.html" title="Independent Baptist">Independent Baptist</a> and <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>. I have explained to him that <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> says that we should not give undue weight to minority viewpoints and he has read the policy and agreed. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 04:46, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Depending on the edit of the moment, the section dealing with Richards' recent onstage racist remarks is longer than the rest of the article, completely ignoring concerns about "undue weight", as well as often being copyright-violation cut-and-pastes of the entire transcript. I recommend the article be completely locked until the throng of editors gleefully eager to overdetail every single nuance of this issue calm down. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 01:59, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Possible POV - if I've interpreted that correctly. I don't know if the people reading this are familiar with the Richards' controversy going on right now. Today (Wednesday), Richards hired a publicist who announced that Richards is Jewish after Richards was accused of making anti-Semitic comments as well as racist ones. On the other hand, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jewish_Journal_of_Greater_Los_Angeles_5a9c.html" title="The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles">The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles</a> wrote an article specifically on that Richards is <b>not</b> Jewish. Since this is becoming frequently reported on in the media, I added that Richards' publicist says he is, and the Journal says he isn't. According to our article on the Jewish Journal, it's a reliable source, yet an editor claims it is not and keeps removing the bit about what the Journal said, leaving only what the publicist said. I think it's a clear case of conflicting cases and both should be put it in (i.e. this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Richards&amp;oldid=89605984#The_Laugh_Factory_incident" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Richards&amp;oldid=89605984#The_Laugh_Factory_incident" rel="nofollow">version</a>). Am I right or does anyone have an opinion on the matter? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 08:50, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A couple of anonymous users and a newly-created account keep re-adding blatantly libelous material to this science-fiction author's biography, claiming that he expressed 'virulent hatred' of Muslims under an alleged Internet pseudonym, and that 'many readers' believe he likes to 'gratuitously insult' Muslims in his books (among other derogatory accusations). Needless to say, there is no sourcing for any of these allegations.

<dd>as the person libelled by user:Merzbow above, I feel it appropriate to respond that the comments were posted in a section entitled "Criticism" which is wholly appropriate. I editted them a short time ago so as to express a more neutral POV. As these are major criticisms of Stirling's work that reccur frequently, they are appropriate for a section titled criticism, IMHO. Unless these biographies are meant to be panegyrics or press releases? If Merzbow continues his libels against myself and his vandalism of this page, I would request he be banned from further tampering and libel. --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStampcollector_42a6.html" title="User:Stampcollector">Stampcollector</a> 00:30, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>After skimming the edit history, it seems that this article started life as a promotional article on Neil Jenman (the early versions look a lot like as a press release or lift from a personal website) and there's an edit war between Jenman or his supporters and someone who doesn't like him very much.

<dd>The journalist Sacha Kester wrote in 2003 an article in the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant about spiritual seekers who go to India to find a guru. In that article Kester wrote that SSB is a good example of a guru who is a swindler. Kester further wrote in the article that "<i>the sorrow of those who after years of devotion saw through his deception is indescribable. The jewels and watches that he materializes are hidden in his chair. Followers who make large donation are given preferential treatment. He advises ill people not to take their medicine.</i>" She further wrote that he "<i>invites good looking young boys for a private interview</i>" and explicitly described SSB's sexual habits with these boys.

The source of the edits appears to come from different IP addresses. I have removed Tsakmakas three times already, and each time it is added back. There is no verifiable source to show that Tsakmakas is indeed part of Yzerman's name. If someone can come up with a credible source that says his full name includes Tsakmakas I will of course not edit it out any longer. However, as a 20+ year fan of Yzerman's, I have yet to see that name mentioned anywhere. This Wiki article is the first I've seen it. I am concerned this is going to develop into an edit war and would like it settled before it does. AuntieNancy19 19:58, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

As can be expected, the sections now attribute misinformation to sources that those sources do not say. For example, they have removed information sourced to the Boston Globe, and then inserted their own points of view in its place to make it appear that the Boston Globe is reporting their own opinions. This seems grossly unfair to any reader who would actually come here looking for accurate information, let alone to the public figure and the newspaper. My attempts to remove such misinformation and misattribution have been greeted with threats of blocking over 3RR rules. They are also removing any sourced information that does not conform to their point of view, claiming that the sole purpose of the article is document "achievements" and any source they don't like (including prominent critics like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Roeper_578e.html" title="Richard Roeper">Richard Roeper</a>) are so biased that their reporting of basic facts can't be used.

<dl>
<dd>As the article explains, his brother has claimed he admitted to planting the bombs in the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior_c6ae.html" title="Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior">Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior</a>. This claim is made in a reliable source which we mention. This is widely considered a terrorist attack in New Zealand, and was apparently even labelled as such by France. As such, accused terrorist bomber is probably a fair label <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 19:15, 29 November 2006 (UTC)~

<dd>There has been no justice action or indictement whatsoever, in France, New Zealand or anywhere else, therefore the term "accused" is libelous, you just have unsourced hearsay.<a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 19:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You don't need an indiciment to be accused of something. As per the discussion in the talk page, I feel the current wording is more informative so won't be chaning it but this doesn't mean I think it was wrong to label him an accused terrorist. If someone has been accused by a reliable source of commiting a crime, by definition he is accused of the crime. In this case, there is no doubt he has been accused by his brother of being the bomber. There is little doubt that the sinking of the <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainbow_Warrior_5473.html" title="Rainbow Warrior">Rainbow Warrior</a> is considered a terrorist attack. Hence someone accused of being involved in it, would be an accused terrorist. You are perhaps confusing the difference between the legal term (I believe accused has a specific meaning in the legal sense) and the word. You might want to take a look at other articles like <a href="../../../j/o/u/Category%7EJournalists_accused_of_fabrication_or_plagiarism_7880.html" title="Category:Journalists accused of fabrication or plagiarism">Category:Journalists accused of fabrication or plagiarism</a> and <a href="../../../w/r/o/Category%7EWrongly_accused_terrorism_suspects_d37c.html" title="Category:Wrongly accused terrorism suspects">Category:Wrongly accused terrorism suspects</a>. In many of these cases, AFAIK no indicement or legal proceedings were ever carried out. In the latter for example, in many cases, these people were never prosecuted or indicited, simply held at Guantanomo and then released <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:54, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think the goal of this policy is to protect wikipedia. The way the article is written, I think Royal could sue wikipedia with good chances of success. <a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 13:30, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There appears to be legitimate concern about sourcing and relevance. A claim is being made that is sourced by blogs, and the blogs are being considered reliable, since they are "science blogs". Yet the material being sourced is your average run-of-the-mill blog ranting, not scientific information. I don't think this is proper, and I would like some others from this group to check it out and comment at <a href="../../../w/i/l/Talk%7EWilliam_A._Dembski_baf6.html#BLP_Noticeboard_response" title="Talk:William A. Dembski">Talk:William A. Dembski#BLP Noticeboard response</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>There is a poorly sourced quote (personal blogs quoting an obscure personal blog) of one of the moderators (DaveScot) of Dembski's blog. First of all why is a moderator of Dembski's blog being quoted in Dembski's autobiography when the moderator's quote wasn't even on Dembski's blog to begin with and did not represent any opinion of Dembski? Secondly, why are personal blogs quoting another personal blog allowed as a source? No one can even verify that the DaveScot moderating Dembski's blog is the same DaveScot who commented on the other blog. Anyone can use any name they want for a handle on blogspot blogs. It's the most poorly sourced quote I've ever seen on Wiki and it is a potentially libelous quote. The editor doing the insertion (FeloniusMonk) is adamantly opposed to removing it even though it violates Wiki rules of reliable sources and especially the rule about immediately removing potentially libelous material in living person biographies. 72.183.101.183 08:52, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We’re having serious problem on the <a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> board with editor <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs">user:David Fuchs</a>. He seems determined to add the following libelous information about Oprah Winfrey:</p>
<p><i>Others see Oprah as too powerful, wielding too much influence in everything from what people wear to what people buy: appearing on her show can bring greater financial success to the item, as evidenced by several books such as <a href="../../../a/_/m/A_Million_Little_Pieces_d14e.html" title="A Million Little Pieces">A Million Little Pieces</a> (see Oprah Book Club above). Others are disgusted that Oprah is considered for a Nobel Peace Price when she has done little but thrown "excess money at poor people." These factors and others have led to several anti-Oprah sites appearing.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>It’d be one thing if he had notable sources he could quote for his anti-Oprah rant, but instead all he provides for sources are anonymous anti-Oprah web pages (which he may have created himself &amp; is trying to use wikipedia to advertise) and a student article. It’s my understanding that the references one is required to cite in order to justify trashing a living person should be much higher. I cite the following from Wikipedia’s living person policy:</p>
<p><i>Editors should remove any controversial material about living persons that is either unsourced, relies upon sources that do not meet standards specified in Wikipedia:Reliable sources, or is a conjectural interpretation of a source. In cases where the information is derogatory and poorly sourced or unsourced, this kind of edit is an exception to the three-revert rule. These principles apply to biographical material about living persons found anywhere in Wikipedia, including user and talk pages. Administrators may enforce the removal of such material with page protection and blocks, even if they have been editing the article themselves. Editors who re-insert the material may be warned and blocked. See the blocking policy and Wikipedia:Libel.</i></p>

It also contains factual inaccuracies. I have discussed with the user on the Discussion page. However, he is absolutely certain that he is right. He is also obviously polarized against the political party (Parti Québécois) of which André Boisclair is the leader; thus, this user cannot provide a NPOV on the subject, and it shows. He has also reverted my latest version THREE TIMES, arguing that everything that he wrote is factually correct. His version also contains various typos. It also refers to an external article in the Globe and Mail; however, this article is editorial in nature, and contains information that had been later disproved.

<p>Current content of the biography page:<br />
- Boisclair being called a "party animal in Quebec City's night-life scene", which is unacceptable vocabulary in a Wikipedia article and could be considered libel (note: the fact that this statement was taken from a newpaper's editorial doesn't justify its presence in Wikipedia)<br />
- emphasis on the fact (?) that Boisclair is a drop-out and doesn't have an undergraduate degree (a note about his Master's degree is buried further down on the page)<br />
- focus on allegations (with link to editorial/opinion texts)<br />
- lenghty discussions about purported scandals<br />
- extensive coverage of criminal accusations against a member of Boisclair's team, despite the fact that Boisclair was never accusated ("guilty by association?" our anonymous wikipedian says so in the Discussion page)<br />
- misleading entry about Boisclair being the leader of a "secondary school" students movement (it was at COLLEGE level)<br />
- misleading entry about Boisclair "resigning" right after a financial scandal (in fact, he resigned because he wanted to takes a Master's degree course; the scandal happened years later)<br /></p>
<p>What is missing from the biography page:<br />
- anything about André Boisclair's achievements as a Minister of Environment<br />
- a respectful coverage of André Boisclair's political life<br /></p>
<p>THIS WHOLE ARTICLE IS FILLED WITH LIBEL.</p>
<p>This page has been built by somebody who publicly states that he dislikes André Boisclair and his political party. The man who wrote the page, and who personally controls the content, refuses any improvement, correction, or opinion that is contrary to his own, despite the fact that the new content I tried to add has reliable references. Instead of accepting the changes, the anonymous user simply REVERTS the whole page (he's done this at least FOUR TIMES with my changes) and then cherry-picks some minor modifications. -- <a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHugo_Dufort_c2ee.html" title="User:Hugo Dufort">Hugo Dufort</a> 04:32, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article violates Wikipedia's guidelines for biographies of living persons.</p>
<p>First of all, the article is highly biased. When blatant POV statements are removed, the author promptly reinserts them (See history and discussion pages.)</p>
<p>Second, the article is factually incorrect. For example, it claims that the Freemans own SIX houses, which is not accurate. Additionally, a good portion of the article is actually written about Patsy Freeman rather than Bill Freeman.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the author of this article has a personal vendetta against the Freemans. I am requesting this article be replaced by a neutral article about Bill Freeman's life and his work as a Christian speaker and writer such as his numerous writings and speaking engagements across the country. If a neutral version of this article is repeatedly tampered with, I request that it either be locked to prevent further vandelism, or deleted entirely to prevent the propogation of misinformation.</p>

<p>I am Josh Mirman. After trying to get my own article removed this summer because I find it unnecessary despite created by fans of some projects I made, it was left up because I was told I can't really decide such a thing. However I try to at least keep certain things factual and accurate if it is to remain up, but even moderators revert things to previous entries, ones that include slander and false input. Can we try and remove the entire article again?</p>

<dd>A week after your reprimand, “Fighting for Justice” hurled the following rude remark at me (see Westerfield History page): “STOP EDITING THE ARTICLE TROLL”. I suppose I should be grateful: this is MILD by his standards.196.15.168.40 08:31, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Comment on archiving: What is important is not whether the discussion is archived or not, but that something be DONE. I originally reported it here because my edits to the article were being constantly vandalized. Two MONTHS later, that hasn’t stopped. Someone must explain to “Fighting for Justice” what “neutral” means, and then ensure that he abides by Wikipedia policy. For example, the article MUST include evidence that Westerfield DIDN’T have child porn; and it MUST include evidence that Danielle had prior ACCESS to his motorhome. Neutrality is particularly important in the case of a living person.196.15.168.40 04:25, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I called you that, because you exhibit the behavior of one. You are constantly putting in information to make David Westerfield seem innocent, or wrongly convicted. The article is already very kind to him. Almost all the notes, with the exeception to the last one, put DW in a positive light. Yet you still complain it is not neutral enough. College age does mean adult age. What do you have against calling them adults? Link 8 is biased and YOUR original research. Your other links is the same information as in link 8. Link 8 is your soapbox, which was tagged as biased. You saving it without the tag is deceptive. Link 7 is hard to follow. The replies are all over the place and your arguments with another user are not special. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 09:05, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Reply to “Fighting for Justice”: So you admit you are guilty of a personal attack on me. I put in information which balances an incomplete, biased article. Let’s look at one of the notes (not the last one). Does the “Peeping Tom” allegation really put DW in a positive light? If we look in Link 7 (the Archived discussion), we’ll see how flimsy the evidence for that is. It was based on two things. One is that his estranged ex-wife suspected he spied on neighbors (but admitted she never caught him); the other is that the neighbor behind him said she had seen him - but that was the embellished version of the story, which was after the prosecutor had mentioned the binoculars in his opening statement. Yet you want to delete that link. Both his children were in college at the time, and they weren’t “mature” students but were of normal college age (18 and 21). They were described in a media report (which I quoted) as “college students”, so why are you so strongly opposed to that? Link 8 is a collection of verified evidence pointing to innocence. It states clearly what it is, both in the article (“Critical examinations of the evidence can be found at”), and in the link. And it was due to your soul mate and predecessor, TripleH1976, that it was tagged POV. Which was redundant because it states itself what it is: “Guilty? The verdict left many dissatisfied. ...” And, as I’ve pointed out many times, it’s NOT original research but source-based research. If you can follow the trial testimony - which the lay people comprising the jury were required to do - then you should be able to follow Link 7. And you have advantages over them, such as you can do a computer “Find” on the text.196.15.168.40 04:03, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You've been putting in information since March of this year. How much more do you need to balance? Who is the "many" that were unsatisfied with the verdict? Did you count them? Are they your friends? How much is many? 15? 30? 100? 1500?? What? Source-based research that's a term you invented. Where does wikipedia tell you you can do this? What other changes do you propose? That Damon got his back rubbed? That he kissed and snuggled with another woman who wasn't his spouse? Will that kind of stuff make the article neutral in YOUR opinion? The smoking of marijuana? The fact that the family ate pizza? The cancellation of the ski trip? If it weren't for myself and TripleH1976 I bet this type of stuff would be in the article. The article would be a cry festival for Westerfield. A good chunk of the article is positive to the child-killer. I bet ALL child-killers would love an article like this one. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 07:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Regardless of what you think of the other's view, this is way over the top. I've gone back and taken a look at some of the disputed edits. 196.15.168.40, I see that a couple of times, you added links to page history and to the talk page. Please take a look at <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a> - discussing Wikipedia is a really bad idea - this site is mirrored constantly and having self-references in there breaks the mirrors - that absolutely cannot be there no matter what the reason. Fighting for Justice, when reverting, rvv (with two v's) means "vandalism". No good faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is ever vandalism. The current dispute seems to be whether to include the text "Some members of law enforcement, such as Detective Chris Armstrong, concluded that this was <i>not</i> child pornography". Please see <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">WP:AWW</a>. Saying "some people" is a bad idea. Was this detective the only one who believed it was not child pornography? If so, just say that. The other dispute seems to be over whether to call two people "adults" or "college students". Obviously most college students are adults. Can you explain the heartache one way or the other? If they are 30-year-olds working on their second phd, they should probably be called adults ... if they are 18-year-old freshmen, they should probably be called college students. The bottom line on all of this ... please be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> ... and remember that Wikipedia is not the place for pushing an agenda. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, if we can focus on the article and not who is doing what to spin what, etc., maybe we can get somewhere. BigDT, maybe you can weigh in on this - the line about Det. Armstrong appears to be from a raw trial transcript published somewhere. The actual text is a defense lawyer who wants to hear Armstrong say that the material wasn't pornography but the judge refuses to let him say that. That's it. Apparently no one has ever reported on this anywhere. I'm not even sure it's relevant and God knows a defense lawyer is going to be biased (he's <i>paid</i> to be biased!). To me, allowing a line in this article saying that even Armstrong disputes the pornography based on that would be against <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, etc. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 13:54, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I know wikipedia is not a place to push an agenda. I've told User:196.15.168.40 this as well and he just doesn't get it. He thinks this is a place to retry the case again. He wants to right the wrongs he thinks happen. Armstrong's statement should not be included, because the transcript is about a defense lawyer trying to get that statement in. And you know what? He was DENIED. The transcript is hearsay and, not only that, we have no clue if Armstrong saw EVERYTHING Westerfield had. It goes against everything we do know about the child porn conviction. If this man didn't own child porn, why was he indicted for it? Why did the jury convict him of it? His lawyers knew he had that's why they build a defense for it. They tried to pass it off to his 18 year old son. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 20:07, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please try to leave speculation as to 196.15.168.40's motives out of it - Wikipedia is about the product, not the personality. It would be easier to resolve this problem if you guys would quit with the personal jabs. As for the question itself - Detective Armstrong - there are two issues. One is whether he actually said it or not. If he is quoted somewhere as saying it, ok, that's fine, but if the only source is the unsubstantiated statement of the defense lawyer, I don't know how useful that is because there's no context. Did he say it just before the trial in a deposition? Did he say it the first day of the investigation? There's no context there. The second issue is what position he was in. Was he one of 100 detectives working on the case or was he the lead detective? If 100 people looked at it and one thought it was not child pornography, you don't want to give undue weight to the statement ... on the other hand, if he maintained from the beginning until the end of the case that there was no child pornography, then that's a meaningful statement. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 00:05, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In that case, will you agree with me the statement is poorly sourced? According to the biographies of living people policy controversial or poorly sourced statements are to be left out. You are right context is sorely lacking. Did he see the same stuff that was shown to the jury? If he did I find it very hard to believe he would say it wasn't child porn. I don't believe he saw all the material. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighting_for_Justice_4e45.html" title="User:Fighting for Justice">Fighting for Justice</a> 03:56, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Composite reply to discussion:</p>
<p>The evidence from members of law enforcement that this is not child porn, is (see the Westerfield Talk page): “there was a police report (by Detective Armstrong) quoted by the judge in court; the testimony of a member of the police (Watkins) who had worked alongside the author of that report (and who denied disagreeing with Armstrong’s conclusion) (the judge overruled the hearsay objection); possibly the same police report mentioned in a media report; the decision of an Assistant U.S. Attorney (quoted in the sworn affidavit for a search warrant); and the conclusion of a former member of law enforcement (Lawson) (ex the Secret Service, the DEA, and the US Customs Service, where he specialized in child porn crimes) (in a court document). ”</p>
<p>Very early in the case, Armstrong was asked by Lieutenant Collins, who was in charge of the Robbery and Special Investigations Unit, to evaluate the images. He did so and produced a report. The defense wanted to call him as a witness, but the judge (acceding to the prosecution’s request) wouldn’t allow EXPERT opinion (so much for a fair trial). The judge explicitly stated that he HAD read Armstrong’s report, so I don’t see how there can be any doubt that it says what the defense attorney says it does. As to the opinion of law enforcement officers other than Watkins and Armstrong, someone in the FBI presumably thought there was child pornography there, otherwise they wouldn’t have (unsuccessfully) approached the Assistant U.S. Attorney - unless it wasn’t a serious attempt, but just routine procedure to do so. Regarding the local police, I would quote Lawson’s statement: “None of the images in the computers themselves or the loose media are of the type normally presented for prosecution for child pornography cases. We feel certain that the law enforcement personnel of the San Diego laboratory are aware of this, which in our opinion, calls into question the governments initial refusal to allow the defense to have copies of the media.” That indicates that the DOMINANT opinion (perhaps even unanimous opinion) in the Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory, was that this was NOT child porn.196.15.168.40 20:15, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Take it to an appeals court then. if his conviction is overturned then come back here and we can include it in the article.

<dd>BigDT asked for more information about Armstrong’s statement so I gave it. I have proved that he DID say it, and that it’s a MEANINGFUL statement. I now await BigDT’s response.196.15.168.40 19:02, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
