	    <p><i>Thats not NPOV1</i></p>
<p>Read-Only Memory (ROM) chips are much slower to read than Random Access Memory (RAM). <i>True. See later.</i></p>
<p>The storage capability of a ROM is also an issue, computer programs placed in ROM must be small and limited in features. In addition, BIOS code is a guarded trade secret, and the handful of vendors are often obfuscated their BIOS code to protect it from reverse-engineering. As technology advances, the features and functionalities built into the BIOS code begin to remove most of the limitations, or provide a workaround for them.</p>
<p>Most systems these days copy the BIOS code from the slow ROM into the faster RAM. <i>Known as shadow RAM... done to speed up the BIOS routines.</i></p>
<p>The latest BIOS code support Plug and Play hardware components and Operating Systems, making system configuration much easier. Also, more and more manufacturer's license BIOS technology and optimize it to work with their components or systems.</p>
<hr />
<p>My main reservation about the bits I cut out are: a) It views BIOS just a the PC BIOS everyone initially thinks of b) I'm not sure of its NPOV c) BIOS'es (in the PC ROM sense) are more like bootstrap roms than anything else, as most OS'es don't even use low level BIOS routines anymore.</p>
<hr />
<p>Made several additions based on coding BIOSs for Phoenix Technologies. Though most people today equate BIOS = firmware = PC BIOS = boot, the first time I saw the term 'BIOS' was in 1981 source code from IBM's Technical Reference Manual. Thus, BIOS may be specific to the IBM PC, though it's meaning may have expanded in the last 20 years. Robert Keller</p>

<dd>I had thought that the greek bios represented the connection that bonds your soul to your physical self. In a sense, that could be comparable to the computer bios, I guess. -Wisestfool, added July 30th</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Actually to be more accurate.. the greek bios is the connection between the spirit and the body. Much like electricity (spirit) is applied to the element (body) in a light bulb, and the result is light (life,soul,bios). Life and soul are interchangable words for the greek bios. Spirit, soul and body are what make up our triune nature. - added November 17th, 2004</dd>

<p>I think the whole BBS section needs to go. Its more of a suggestion than a specification. As far as I know the "BBS API" is just the PnP and PCI config space which the BBS suggests a BIOS read to get device information. Granted, its been 5 years since I read this "specification", but it was no specification the last time I saw it. It pointed out issues and problems but didn't have hard-line solutions for most of them. Furthermore, the issues it did try to solve, if implemented, no one would use/buy the result. Has there been an update since the original? If so, I haven't seen it. In short, BBS should not be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Some comments about the article: “which at a minimum drives the keyboard and provides primitive output to a display. ” This is incorrect. There is no need for keyboard support and the output to a display is misleading (especially on the primitive note). For example, A server BIOS has no need for keyboard support and for USB keyboard, the BIOS needs only to support USB HID’s and not act as a driver for the KBC. Rather, at a minimum, the BIOS initializes memory and programs the memory controller. Also, it discovers and initializes buses on the system (be it PCI, ISA, PCI-E or whatnot).</p>
<p>As for the primitive output display – it seems this “primitive” aspect should be something more about ASCII which could be on a local display or sent out say a serial port to a remote display. In the latter case, the display function, strictly speaking, is not supported. Maybe it would be better to say it would support ASCII console (at a minimum). That could be local or remote.</p>
<p>“most modern BIOS implementations” I would say all BIOSes are modern, maybe contemporary would put a finer point on it.</p>
<p>“My main reservation about the bits I cut out are: a) It views BIOS just a the PC BIOS everyone initially thinks of b) I'm not sure of its NPOV c) BIOS'es (in the PC ROM sense) are more like bootstrap roms than anything else, as most OS'es don't even use low level BIOS routines anymore.”</p>
<p>I am not sure what this is referencing, but it has an inaccurate characterization in it. That is to say, sure contemporary OSes no longer use the runtime services provided by the BIOS, but they are still provided. It is still a useful thing to be able to boot to DOS. If we are talking about this stuff, then it seems fair to mention ACPI as well.</p>
<p>As to EFI, I can draft up something if you would like. It is going to be the new PC standard. Starting with longhorn, and theoretically afterwards the only MS supported firmware interface. There are some introductory things about it on Intels website.</p>

<p>I was researching on the net, and I found <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/bios/bios_Int13h.htm|a" class="external text" title="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/bios/bios_Int13h.htm|a" rel="nofollow">bunch of stuff that says</a> that the BIOS is also used to simply talk to the hard drive.</p>
<p>That is: Beyond it's use as a boot device, it also hosts code that is used to read and write data to and from the disk.</p>
<p>I am not an expert at computer hardware, so I hesitate to edit the article.</p>
<p>But if this is true, or even if it was just historically true, I think that the article should mention this kind of thing.</p>
<p>It should perhaps say something like, "Historically, the BIOS was used for low-level disk drive access. The operating system running on the CPU didn't directly talk with the disk drive; instead, it would send signals to the BIOS by way of interrupts, and the BIOS would then perform the low-level disk drive manipulations."</p>
<p>That said: Maybe this is still true! I really don't know how it works. I turned to this article for help, but it seems to be purely about bootstrapping the system.</p>
<p>I see that there is a wikipedia page <a href="../../../b/i/o/BIOS_interrupt_call_fd78.html" title="BIOS interrupt call">BIOS interrupt call</a>, but I think it should be worked into the article, rather than just left as a link at the bottom. Just reading the BIOS page and not following the links at the end, it appears that the BIOS is purely for bootstrapping.</p>

<p>All microprocessor-based systems have the equivalent of the BIOS (some non-PC examples - mainframe computers, Tivo, television set-top boxes, network routers). But BIOS is an IBM Personal Computer term. I believe more generic terms are boot rom, boot monitor, boot loader. This article ought to be say that the name BIOS is for PCs. The article <a href="../../../b/o/o/Booting.html" title="Booting">booting</a> is a more generic introduction to this subject. <a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDyl_bfb4.html" title="User:Dyl">Dyl</a> 17:11, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Eh - I would say no not at all. The BIOS as introduced on the original PC provided system analysis, configuration, boot strapping AND an OS/Hardware interface. Most mainframes have different facilities for doing these things - that is, the main frame equivalent would really ONLY do a bootstrap. On mosy mainframes, system analysis is done by a 3rd agent - diagnostic software, configuration is done with direct hardware manipulation, and the OS is writen specifically for the computer in question and doesn't require the abstraction layer of the PC BIOS.</p>
<p>Older routers may have a bootstrap and Hardware Abstraction layer, but the actual need is more dependant upon the OS being used and not the hardware as suggested by the assertion that all micro-procprocessor based systems have the equivalent of the BIOS. It would be relatively simple (and is basically common) to create an OS that performs all fundamental BIOS operations completely to increase efficiency. So there definately is no "need" for a BIOS.</p>
<p>Additionally, most set-top boxes and contemporary routers actually have a full blown BIOS inside not disimilar to a desktop BIOS, but usually with the ability to enter BIOS configuration disabled or secured. This is especially attractive when the OS in question would like to make use of an industry standard interface such as ACPI or SMBIOS.</p>
<p>Well, in summary, like I said in length - no.</p>
