<p>I have a copy of "Sprawl City" if you would like to borrow it. Since it is slightly out of date but still a good source for some information, I would be willing to lend it to you. I organize the MARTA Pub Crawl, which is coming up November 4th. Even if you're not a drinker, you could drop by at the beginning to pick up the book. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubieTurtle_7153.html" title="User:AubieTurtle">AubieTurtle</a> 20:16, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry for having to deal with that Kokayi guy. Much of the article came from you in some form or fashion and thanks a lot for that, it has starting getting better and better. As AubieTurtle mentioned, this guy just likes trouble, because he was involved in a lengthy arguement on the CfPT board on the walk left, stand right rule on escalators. Thanks again and hopefully this guy will go find some one else to argue with. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmazingracer_72d3.html" title="User:Amazingracer">Amazingracer</a> 04:18, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Once the Kokayi situation is dealt with what else do you thing we should before possibly resubmitting the article for quality review? <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmazingracer_72d3.html" title="User:Amazingracer">Amazingracer</a> 05:02, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I got a copy of the Sprawl City that <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubieTurtle_7153.html" title="User:AubieTurtle">AubieTurtle</a> recommended. There are a few useful statistics which I am planning on putting in the article (it cites 44% as the percentage of non Fulton &amp; Dekalb liscence plates in MARTA's parking lot, which was previously deleted from the MARTA article because it had no citation). Unfortunately it tackles a lot of other issues outside of MARTA, and also was published in 2000, which limits its usefullness. I would like to see some more discussion of MARTA's history (since it's planned reach and its current state are so drastically different). Probably we should spin some talk off into a metro Atlanta public transit article, where we can compare different transit agencies in metro Atlanta. I'd also like to keep working on the station pages...one of my goals before the end of the year is to get more pictures of each station, and I also want to list connections to other transit agencies (CCT, GRTA, CTRAN, etc) on station pages. I could request fare collection information from MARTA to update the station pages; would that constitute original research? I am not sure what else is needed to get a higher rating on the article...can we get some feedback comments from the <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:trains" class="extiw" title="wikia:trains">wikiTrains</a> group? <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiomedeng_153e.html" title="User:Biomedeng">Biomedeng</a> 13:33, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The fare collection would be great to have. If there was a way to make it publicly viewable to all then I dont think it would count as original research. So far the only thing I agree with Kokayi on is that the fare information needs to be cited on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_MARTA_stations_83bd.html" title="List of MARTA stations">List of MARTA stations</a>. My only thing about the pictures of each station is that on MARTA's website it says photography is prohibited in the stations and on the car, without written permission and that photos can not be posted on the internet <a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/photo_policy.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.itsmarta.com/newsroom/photo_policy.htm" rel="nofollow">MARTA Photo Policy</a>. So that's my only worry there otherwise I would have already taken a picture of all the stations on my way to and from State. Now it does not say anything about taking pictures outside the station(ie. entrances). While im not new to Wikipedia, I still do not understand its inner workings, so Im clueless would get us out of B rating. I know one of the main things was that much of the information on the page was not cited, but that seems to be fixed now. And same with grammatical errors, I believe most of those have been fixed as well. Also the idea for a central Atlanta transit page is a great one, we could even go so far as to create an Atlanta Public Transit Project page like this one <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Washington_Metro_0b98.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Washington Metro">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Washington_Metro</a>. This would allow us to have a dentral page to discuss and also flag articles for errors or what not. Thoughts on that?
<dl>
<dd>I have a favor or two to cash in at MARTA, so perhaps I can work on getting the fare collection data without having to do a formal open records request, but I still feel as if it might be perceived to be original research since the data is not normally publically available. I had also noticed MARTA prohibits photography...perhaps a picture of the outside of each station would suffice? If MARTA prohibits the photography, does posting a picture against MARTA will violate wikipedia policies? We already have some pictures of MARTA on the article. As for the rating I say let's go ahead and get the page re-evaluated and see if the score has changed. I very much like the idea of a central transit article for Atlanta. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiomedeng_153e.html" title="User:Biomedeng">Biomedeng</a> 16:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I added the article to the assessment list. Forunately the list is much shorther than the mediation list so we should here back shortly. Also I noticed Kokayi hasnt been squawking about, did you know what the outcome of your reporting him was?
<dl>
<dd>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Kokayi_reported_by_User:Biomedeng_.28Result:.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Kokayi_reported_by_User:Biomedeng_.28Result:.29" rel="nofollow">3RR Kokayi report</a> to follow the outcome (looks like they are 2-3 reports away from mine). I guess he is taking a breather, especially since we stopped reverting his reverts. He probably thinks he has already won since we have been ignoring the ridestore issue. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiomedeng_153e.html" title="User:Biomedeng">Biomedeng</a> 17:51, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Im not sure where the pictures on the article actually came from, so for all I know they could have been taken with permission or probably even bummed from the MARTA web page. Thats interesting that MARTA owes you favors, mind if I ask how that came about? I will try and get some snap shots of the outside of some of the stations I ride through. <a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmazingracer_72d3.html" title="User:Amazingracer">Amazingracer</a> 17:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't elaborate about that online, but just leave it at the fact I have a connection or two on the inside who would get me public information (like fare collections) if I asked nicely. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiomedeng_153e.html" title="User:Biomedeng">Biomedeng</a> 17:51, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for getting my back on the Lindbergh Center RideStore. I don't understand what this guys deal is. I have reverted his edits and cited my facts.

<dd>I see he reverted the article again, and saw on the mediation page that you reported him. Thanks for being on the ball like that. I don't have class tomorrow, so to put the final nail in the coffin, I will venture up to Lindbergh and see what signs and directions are there. (I only ride from Arts Center to Five Points to get to State, but I have been to Lindbergh Center once and couldve sworn there were sign pointing to Marta HQ.)<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmazingracer_72d3.html" title="User:Amazingracer">Amazingracer</a> 03:07, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I felt that when you accepted the case that me, AuTiger, AmazingRacer and Kokayi had all made our cases prior to your acceptance on the cabal page and the MARTA talk page. I for one did not respond after you accepted the case because I was waiting for you to respond to my concerns (I didn't have anything new to contribute to the discussion). In the interest of continuing to work on the article I would apprecaite it if you could review the case and the talk page and contribute some suggestions to facilitiate the discussion to help us through the impasse. Also AmazingRacer was part of the second cabal case that was closed, but he was never added to the first case which you chose to mediate. He might have more actively participated if he had been included.

<p>I love the official pages you've found to reference that article. However, you keep removing an article from the student newspaper, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Technique_d83a.html" title="The Technique">The Technique</a></i>, as spam. I haven't found an article for all of the other restaurants, but I assure you that the 'Nique doesn't print press releases. If the 'Nique says Tin Drum is good, then it really <i>is</i> that good.&#160;:) Aside from that, how would one go about expanding that article? I can't think of much "History," but the GT website about Tech Square seems to have a lot of information. —<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDisavian_f80f.html" title="User talk:Disavian"><sup>talk</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Disavian_e056.html" title="Special:Contributions/Disavian"><sub>contribs</sub></a>) 22:27, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no problem with the accuracy of the Technique as a source, but what I do have a problem with is posting a subjective food review (good or bad) on a restaurant when you are simply seeking to reference its existance. I would certainly welcome a Technique article talking about the opening of Tech Square and a list of the restuarants/stores. I thought it was better to use a reference that listed all restaurants and doesn't attempt to evaluate their quality. The food review isn't exactly spam, but the glowing Tin Drum review in my opinion taints the objectivity of the article because it looks like one restaurant is being advertised as better. (Also for the record I do think the Tin Drum has good food.) In general I prefer more factual and quantitative information on wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>A history section might be good that details the planning that went into the planning, land aquisition, and construction. I am sure that this kind of project was in the works for years.

<p>I noticed you rated the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Atlanta_Rapid_Transit_Authority_4f24.html" title="Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority">Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority</a> article B-class. I've made quite a few edits to the article since it was last assessed B-class by Wikiproject rapid transit. I was curious to know if you independently assessed the article as B class or if you just rated it the same as the wikiproject rapid transit rating? If you had independently concluded it was B class could you give us some feedback on the talk page of the article? We are interested in improving the article to GA class.

<dd>Thanks for clearing it up. I've been reading <a href="../../../g/a/c/WP%7EGAC_00ed.html" title="WP:GAC">WP:GAC</a> and still want to make a few more updates before nominating the article. Although it appears that nominations are a somewhat dynamic process (not just pass/fail, there is time for improvement during the nomination). Unfortunately many of the other regular editors of the MARTA article have not been around in the last 1-2 months, so it has been primarily me making major edits. While I have made improvements I am hesitant to go it alone in the GA nomination. I'll keep watching some of the GA nominatons for other articles to see if I can get a better feel for what else I can do to the article. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiomedeng_153e.html" title="User:Biomedeng">Biomedeng</a> 02:18, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Hey Biomedeng, my old pal <a href="../../../r/c/s/User%7ERCSIRCSIRCSI_70f6.html" title="User:RCSIRCSIRCSI">RCSIRCSIRCSI</a> has taken back up to including rankings on the BME and BSBME articles again. Since I'm clearly the most vocal one against it, I think it may be a good idea to step back from this a little and let other people speak out...if anyone else cares enough. I was hoping you would revoice your opinion in the discussion since this guy seems to think having 3 frequent editors against adding the content is "no big deal". On the bright side, he hasn't called me any names like last time...yet. Thanks! -<a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a> 17:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good luck...I've had my share of edit wars and was even called a biggot all it did was burn me out on wikipedia. I've revoiced my opinion. Definately the raking should not go on the main BME article, and if it belongs anywhere it would be on the Bachelor's of BME article. Glad to see that you filed the sock puppet report (Bme diddy is a ridiculous username anyway). I like how you have improved both of these articles. Maybe it is time to start pushing for GA nomination for BME? I think the images need some work (need to find better illustrations of BME and the article subtopics) and get some more references. What do you think? <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiomedeng_153e.html" title="User:Biomedeng">Biomedeng</a> 03:40, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah I'm glad it all turned out ok...that guy was getting on my last nerve. I was actually concerned that no admins watch the page at all until Steel came in and fixed it. He's now my favorite admin, haha. Yeah I agree that the BME article still needs some work. I like some of the pictures, but the arrangement could be better (since they are just the entire right side at the moment) and still need some more cited statements to broaden the world view. Someone is gonna say something if our "international" view is the US, Canada, Europe and Australia. We may want to start gathering together the criteria and post a todo list on the talk page.

<dd>I think a to do list is a great idea. Well it sounds like we are just missing Asia (and perhaps Africa/Middle East if they have BME programs), and I know there are biomedical engineering departments in China and possibly Japan as well. Anyway I think you have at least attempted to remove the blatant US slant from the article. I really like the pictures that are clearly engineered devices, like the artificial heart. But some of the pancreas pictures look like powerpoint slides and give me horrible flashbacks to sitting in boring undergrad lectures. I also think the picture should clearly correspond with the section it is next to. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiomedeng_153e.html" title="User:Biomedeng">Biomedeng</a> 20:29, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
