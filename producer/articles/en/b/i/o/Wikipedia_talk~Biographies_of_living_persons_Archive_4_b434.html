<p>Wikipedia is not a finished product. Issues arise that need to be discussed openly to arrive at a conclusion. The use of user space to carry on a discussion about what is or is not proper to put in the encyclopedia is a perfectly proper use of user space. BLP is about what we publish as our current encyclopedia article about someone. Carrying that to the talk page is somewhat unjustified but people have abused that space so it makes some sense since we can use user space instead to carry on conversations that include trying to find useable sources for negative data that was published at un unuseable source like some random blog. User space is included in our defamation policy and <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">WP:WWIN</a>. That's good enough. It would be harmful to the effective functioning of wikipedia as a NPOV encyclopedia to systematically limit discussion <i>anywhere</i> on wikipedia of negative unsourced material. NPOV trumps BLP. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 23:54, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sory, but no. Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a personal web page, neither it is an open discussion forum. And the issue is not about <i>censorship</i>. It is about abuse of Wikipedia server's to defame.

<dd>Extremely wrong on many, many, many levels, absolutely yes. But think of the situation where User X is libeled/libelled on User Y's user page. User X could sue Foundation W to release the name of User Y, so as to make it possible to sue her. Foundation W could be forced to spend an awful lot of money resisting. A motivated plaintiff with a credible case can REALLY cause a lot of strife, even if they don't win. See <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_104b.html#High_profile_lawsuits" title="RIAA">HERE</a>.

<dd>Censorship? We are guests here and Wikimedia makes the rules. They are not obligated to accomodate every wish a user might have, or to even be democratic.

<dd>Quite a few Wikipedians, including administrators, bureaucrats, and who knows what other opinion leaders, are high-school or university students, or very recently were such. While they have a lot to contribute to Wikipedia, they rarely will have been involved in lawsuits, let alone have pockets deep enough to be thought of as targets (auto accidents, etc. excepted). What they know is what they've read here or elsewhere. In my wikiexperience, a lot of the potentially troublesome edits are made, or are supported, or are thought of as perfectly fine, by this enthusiastic crew of very young adults. IMHO we need to be VERY strong and specific about libel-related matters, because we can't expect the young people to have much life experience, pre-existing knowledge, or meaningful judgment about the subject. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 23:39, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes. The issue here is harming people (from an ethical POV) and libel (from a legal one), and in neither case is there any excuse to exempt userspace, since it is picked up on Google just as easily. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 17:19, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks, I made the change.

<dd>I have considered this previously, and I think it should apply to all mentions of living people, including editors. However, this needs a separate and detailed discussion, as it would necessitate a widespread cultural change to be implemented. It bars labels that are now used two-a-penny to brand people as vandals, trolls and vanity editors, for a start. The positive aspect is that it would necessitate a more careful and considered approach in dialogue. I think the net effect would create a much more pleasant working environment. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 18:13, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems like the same reasoning works for both editors and non-editors, unless there is a legal reason for us to give greater protection from libel to public figures. I think we can either limit BLP to article space (which is contrary to Jimbo's instructions as I understand them, and so a bad idea), or we include all living people under BLP. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 19:39, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The essense of this policy is that there are moral and legal and practical reasons to treat articles about living people with a special sensitivity that would be out of place forarticles about buildings and such. This is an issue that is best defined in terms of its boundaries by the heart rather than by trying to come up with "bright lines". Calling a living person a "troll" on an article about them (which needs verifiability, relevance, and so forth) is very different than saying we as a community will behave towards editor Bush_Sucks in accord with our perception that his edits as documented in his contributions can be accurately characterised as Trollish (generally abbreviated to "Bush_Sucks is a troll.") <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 20:10, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I've been concerned by the way the recent death of Steve Irwin was handled on the pages <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Irwin_a65f.html" title="Steve Irwin">Steve Irwin</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terri_Irwin_6bcc.html" title="Terri Irwin">Terri Irwin</a>. I have commented on the relevant talk pages, and the responses have been courteous and sensible, but I wonder if this is worthy of some wider debate. In short, I found it disquieting that the content on these pages was so bluntly edited and in so incredibly short a time (ignoring the inevitable vandalisms, which are not what i am talking about). For example, having the whole Steve Irwin article edited into the past tense <i>immediately</i> upon hearing the news of his death seems unnecessarily brutal to me, and seems to serve no useful purpose. The same with changing Terri Irwin's article from "wife" to "widow". My preferred means of handling the events would have been to insert a Breaking News box at the top of the Steve Irwin article, stating that Steve had been reported killed, then that box would be updated to reflect the incoming news. During that time, the main body of the article would been left essentially untouched (or even locked). Once the news settled down, the article could have been re-written. Now I have found that this point of view is not necessarily a popular one here, but I have had some comments of support. I don't want to compormise Wikipedia's reputation for being incredibly up-to-date, but I think that that reputation could be kept intact in a more sensitive fashion (ie, mention the news as it is happening, but don't completely re-write the article while the news is still fresh. That looks over-eager to me. Anyway, whatever the concensus view turns out to be on this subject, I think that these kinds of situation warrant some considered and documented WP policy, if only to prevent the same old arguments happening every time.

<p><b>BLP official policy:</b> "While Wikipedia discourages people from writing new articles about themselves or expanding existing ones significantly, subjects of articles remain welcome to edit articles to correct inaccuracies, to remove inaccurate or unsourced material, or to remove libel." This policy appears to be a smokescreen. At the very minimum, there is no enforcement, and no provision for redress if a subject of an article feels that he is prevented from implementing the policy. There are numerous admins on Wikipedia who contend that a banned user who is the subject of an article forfeits this welcome, and has no right to "correct inaccuracies, to remove inaccurate or unsourced material, or to remove libel." That makes this BLP a dead letter, and it isn't worth the pixels it takes to display it. Remember, it takes only one admin to ban a user forever. I was banned by Gamaliel on April 5, 2006 because I was trying to explain that a new federal criminal law affects many Wikipedia editors. I appealed my ban to the mailing list and have proof that my appeal was received, but my appeal was ignored. I have been repeatedly reverted while attempting to correct information on my article. --Daniel Brandt 68.90.165.190 06:18, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, somebody in contruction of Wikipedia has forgotten to give blocked users access to Arbcom and ANI request pages to defend themselves, and also access to their own BLP articles and talk pages, if they have them.

<p>Welcome, Daniel Brandt, to the policy <i>you</i> inspired. It is important that even banned people such as yourself have the chance to speak concerning what wikipedia has to say about them both on articles about them and on articles that mention them in passing. It is also important that wikipedia do its best to present verifiable, unbiased, encyclopedic, nonprivacy-invading information on every subject a concerned citizen might need to know about. You are such a subject. Your life and activities have been about civil rights and other things a concerned citizen has a right to know about. You have more than a mere voice on a talk page. You have the ear of newspapers and a site of your own as well as other sites you frequent. You do not lack a voice. Wikipedia has not been deaf to you. But, no, you don't get to own the article about you. But, in any case, thanks for saying that living people ought to be treated special.

<p>Doesn't the nutshell seem to imply that for articles <i><b>not</b></i> about living persons one can be a little less (alhtough probably not a whole lot) rigorous about adhering/enforcing the NPOV and V policies? Is this correct? Or is a slight "laxity" on such articles as condemnded as ever as it is here, if you get my drift?

<dd>We have a lot of unsourced science articles written years ago whose deletion would be considered vandalism. Sourcing everything will take time and the priority is where being unsourced can cause the most damage. Deleting thousands of articles simply based on rigorousness would damage wikipedia to no good end. That is also why we delete <i>negative</i> unsourced data on bios of living people - not to make it all nicey nice but because that is a priority because of potential damage. Nicy nice unsourced stuff in a bio of a scum-bucket who should not get elected can cause damage of a different kind and thus <i>source or delete immediately</i> can be important for nonnegative data in an article too. Please never forget we also delete true but not relevant to noteability data for not-so-important persons as they have a legal and moral right to privacy. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 04:01, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Modifying policy page?</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure how appropriate it is for Filceolaire to modify the policy page, particularly since his edit summary concludes that the Enquirer is not a reliable source. At one time, it is true that the Enquirer was not much more reliable than The Weekly World News. However, after several lawsuits some years back, they have vastly improved their journalistic practices. I would challenge anyone who believes that they are unreliable to provide any examples from, say, the last three years, where they got a story wrong. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 17:08, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, but it is not going to happen because (1) the german solution is far better and some version of that will be implemented in wikipedia within a year (2) there is a very influential active and longstanding wikipedian subset of people (the word "group" would mistakenly connote organization) that is all about maximum freedom to the point of anarchy (3) Jimbo himself appears against it - perhaps for fear of killing the goose that lays the golden egg (the exact recipe for wikipedia's success is a matter of guesswork). <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 08:51, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing the "nutshell" synopsis</span></h2>
<p>Two of us have now removed the "nutshell" synopsis at the top of the page in favor of merging it back into the opening paragraph. The "nutshell" boxes were created on the premise that not all readers will read the whole page. And that's a reasonable assumption given the number of policy pages we have and the size of some of them. However, new users did generally read the opening paragraph and then skimmed the rest of the page.</p>
<p>The nutshell box was an interesting experiment but it is becoming increasingly clear that the infobox format is actually distracting readers from the real meaning of the page and is causing more harm than good. It presents an incomplete understanding of the issues and has led new readers to false conclusions. They are inevitably a cursory and incomplete explanation of the page. Half the time, they are completely redundant to the opening paragraph of the policy page. Few readers actually read them because they get lost among the other boilerplate infoboxes like the "this is official policy" box. The "nutshell" box on this particular page is not redundant but only because the opening paragraph has effectively been chopped in two. This creates a split in the flow of the opening paragraphs and decreases the readability of the page. We should not be deliberately placing barriers in the way of the readers' comprehension of the page.</p>
<p>The text of the nutshell box on this page should be merged back into the introductory paragraph of the page. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">user:Crum375</a> has reverted that edit saying that it needs talk-page consensus. Personally, I think he/she is splitting hairs. Whether or not the text is presented in a paragraph format or an infobox format is a relatively minor style question. The meaning and even the wording remains unchanged. However, since Crum apparently feels quite strongly about this, I ask for the community's opinion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 01:55, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, obviously this has further implications than just this specific page/policy, as one would expect that a uniform style or meta-policy should be maintained across the various policies that currently have a nutshell. I personally find the nutshells very useful, and have found them even more useful in my early days before I had the chance to read the policies proper in greater detail. I think it may make sense to move this discussion to a more general area, and put it to a community consensus or vote, applicable to all relevant policies. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:43, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nutshells are a useful official summary. The content of the nutshell <i>should</i> be repeated in the intro (not necessarily exactly) because "Few readers actually read them because they get lost among the other boilerplate infoboxes like the 'this is official policy' box.". <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 10:30, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMHO, nutshells are useful, but often too brief. In the non-Wiki world, multi-page policies, etc. often have an Executive Summary of a half to a full page. We don't have them here, and IMHO they could be very useful. I use this executive summary of the [WP:BLP] policy:</dd>

<li>Biographies of living people should be written responsibly, conservatively, and in a neutral, encyclopedic tone.</li>

<li>Information available solely on partisan websites or in obscure newspapers should be handled with caution, and, if derogatory, should not be used at all.</li>
<li><i>(For non-public figures such as family members):</i> Editors should exercise restraint and include only information relevant to their notability. ...Material from primary sources should generally not be used unless it has first been mentioned by a verifiable secondary source.</li>
<li>In borderline cases, the rule of thumb should be "do no harm." Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a tabloid. It is not our job to be sensationalist, ...</li>
<li>If someone appears to be pushing an agenda or a biased point of view, insist on reliable third-party published sources and a clear demonstration of relevance to the person's notability.</li>
<li>The views of critics should be represented if their views are relevant to the subject's notability and are based on reliable sources, and so long as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article or appear to side with the critics' material.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">When in doubt...</span></h2>
<p>WP:BLP instructs user only to remove unsourced <i>criticism</i>, not unsourced content that praises individuals. The question I pose is when unsourced content that <i>could be construed</i> as criticism is present in an article, shoulda a user assume that WP:BLP applies and remove the content without discussion? For example, on the article on <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendrick_Meek_8d39.html" title="Kendrick Meek">Kendrick Meek</a> there is a section titled "The One Florida Sit In." The content in this section, none of which is sourced, could be damaging for Meek's reelection campaign because it shows discord between him and Governor Jeb Bush, or it could be a rallying cause because he's standing up to the entrenched interests. In summary, when in doubt about a content's affect on a living person, should we remove the content without discussion? I think so. <a href="../../../d/r/k/User%7EDRK_a91a.html" title="User:DRK">DRK</a> 04:03, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia articles about living people can affect the subject's life.</span></h2>
<p>"Wikipedia articles about living people can affect the subject's life." - IMO that's pretty much the rationale for this policy. Well, the <i>real</i> rationale is bad press from the Siegenthaler fuss and Danny's ever-ringing phone. But this sentence encapsulates why living bios need the closest of attention. It may help alleviate the problematic use of the word 'sensitive', which has been taken in practice to mean 'sympathetic point of view.'

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nuts (again)</span></h2>
<p>I personally think the nuts are a very useful addition to the policy/guideline pages, and help with a quick appreciation and retension of the key salient points of a policy. We have been through this before. I think that prior to removing them there should be a discussion, and consensus for doing so, and whatever is decided should be applicable to all relevant pages. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 23:11, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If there is discussion, then we should wait for a resolution and community-wide consensus. This is not an issue for one page only, but for all the WP policies and guidelines, potentially. To many editors, this is the face of WP, while they learn (and review) the ropes. To me personally, reading the nutshells was very helpful and is still useful even today. I am sure I am not alone.

<dd>I like those sentences very much, especially the second one. It would be good if the words "affect the subject's life" could somehow be made more specific about the "affecting".

<dd>Also, improper content in living people articles can have special effects outside the lives of the subjects themselves. It can incite edit wars, retaliation, etc. It can diminish Wikipedia's reputation, cause us trouble, etc., through reactions from neutral readers, from friends and supporters of the subjects, from accurate news reports of non-neutral content, and so forth. All of this can happen with other articles, of course, but it seems to me especially likely with stuff about living people. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:03, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As you say, other articles can have this effect too. For example, articles about 'living organizations', religions, etc. In this case, I think David Gerard's wording is actually pretty reasonable - when a person's <i>life</i> can be affected by an article, it can elicit all kinds of responses, from mild to severe, as you mention. But I am not sure we need to go into the possible responses inside the nutshell (or even in the article, per <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEAN_fad7.html" title="WP:BEAN">WP:BEAN</a>). <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 14:28, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just a stray thought, but I think the goal of some who add negative info to BLP articles is precisely TO affect the subject's life, ie., destroy their reputation, prevent their re-election, etc. It is unfortunate that there are far too many editors who use this project as their own personal cudgel. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 14:38, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>You should all read this (you need to log in, but these things happen). It answers a pile of relevant questions for Wikipedia: notability, how to write a good bio, research ... fantastic stuff. Our best bio articles resemble a well-written obituary, whether the person is alive or not, and too many of our bio articles only become any good at all when the subject dies and we have good newspaper obits to crib from - this article should be helpful to good editors in making good bio articles that are certainly up to NYT quality - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 16:12, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for chiming in. I believe, as far as I know, that Tbeatty made the comment that this gentleman "lied" and later provided a reference which didn't state that a lie had been committed. The comment made by Tbeatty was on one maybe two talk pages that I know of, and never in article space. I can provide the links, but I'll assume you believe me on this matter. However, of course, there really is no reason to be misrepresenting the wording of a reference anywhere, but just wanted to clarify that this only happened on a talk page, so I felt it was a grey area and somewhat unclarified. Now that we know where this issue stands (and it should be obvious anyway), all should be expected to not do this kind of thing in the future.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 10:34, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I saw that as well, his comment above, indicated, in my opinion, that there was some latitude to be expected in userpages, but not much of course. At this point, I am merely seeking complete policy clarification so this can be enforced universally...as there are many folks that are indeed violating talk pages and userpages in this manner.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 11:34, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think there's much latitude in "using userpages to attack people or campaign for or against anything or anyone is a bad idea". I think it's time for a clean-up. Obviously standards have been allowed to slip and become lax. Tightening them up can only be in wikipedia's interest as a reputable organisation. Obviously it's a question of pointing people to Jimbo's quote in the first instance, and I'm sure most users will take that on board responsibly. Those that don't can be helped to do so. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC) (trying to take a wikibreak)

<dd>Yes, certainly. The questions I need answered is what is the cut-off...where is the dividing line between free speech and libel? I suppose it's a matter of making the best call, and obvious breaches of misrepresentations need to be dealt with immediately.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 12:16, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the line comes where the credible sources stop and the blogs begin, which is pretty much what Jimbo was saying. We also need to be careful about apperaring to draw inferences form what the reliable sources say, of course. When in doubt, take it to Talk first. Of course we can discuss the appropriateness of a given link or phrase on Talk, provided it is not patently ludicrous, but I completely agree that Tbeatty did a wrong thing here, and that from the perspective of one who pretty much shares Tbeatty's view of Jones. Once you are aware that a given statement is viewed as problematic, the utmost care is demanded in restating it. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 12:48, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think you mean Tbeatty said that about Jones (and it is not a good idea to repeat it endlessly). I presume also that Tom Harrison has not said he (Tom Harrison) is racist, that there are not any verifiable secondary sources that say this and that there are no racist remarks that Tom Harrison has made on wiki, which would justify the accusation. Firstly it is a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. Secondly, <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">User:Tom harrison</a> is a living person, so entitled to the same courtesy as anyone else (per BLP or other relevant guidelines) so BLP does apply.

<dd>(Sorry, corrected.) I agree. That means that removing, and blocking for, at least some personal attacks is required by BLP policy, and deserves the same enthusiastic action that some have reserved for BLP issues. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 14:34, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In the case you mention of an attack on Tom Harrison, BLP isn't necessary, as it's covered by <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.

<dd>Hardly, and what was done was only after weeks of arbitration during which the charge was repeated and enlarged upon (details minimized to avoid drawing in others who were the primary target of the attacks).

<dd>I wasn't aware of the case, but if such an accusation had been made, I would have no reservation about warning the user not to make it, and, in the event of persistence, blocking that user, until such time as they refrained from doing so, under <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">NPA</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">CIVIL</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">BLP</a> and on the basis that it is totally unacceptable to use wiki space for such a purpose.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Jimbo's guidance</span></h3>
<p>Jimbo's guidance is stricter than necessitated by libel, just as wiki's image fair use policy is stricter than legally required. He's also indicated that wiki is not a "free speech zone for trolls"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=72839403&amp;oldid=72838894" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;diff=72839403&amp;oldid=72838894" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_is_a_troll_2a9e.html" title="Wikipedia:What is a troll">Wikipedia:What is a troll</a> includes, "spreading some personal views in an inappropriate way." Jimbo's comment reinforces the existing guideline against polemic on user pages.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:USER#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:USER#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> It is a divisive and provocative practice to use them for polemic, and mitigates against a desirable collegiate environment. It might be useful to think how someone working on a standard work, e.g. Encyclopedia Britannica, would be expected to present themselves (i.e. in an intellectually objective manner) in order to maintain the reputation of their employer. This is entirely different from using user (sub) pages in a NPOV way to draft an article or to build up sound referenced material which can be used subsequently in an article.</p>
<p>There are two separate, but sometimes related, issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>"absolutely meticulous attention to detail when writing about living persons"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tbeatty&amp;diff=78472459&amp;oldid=78472329" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tbeatty&amp;diff=78472459&amp;oldid=78472329" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>"using userpages to attack people or campaign for or against anything or anyone is a bad idea"</li>
</ul>

<dd>NPA relates to editors. Libel relates to anywhere.

<p>I presumed that the caveat "not in full, not just stated flatly like that" was because BLP is primarily aimed at writing articles, so obviously there are likely to be aspects which don't apply, but that the points relating to placing negative material about living people on wiki do apply. A concerted effort to maintain this mandate will raise wikipedia's ethical and behavioural standards.</p>
<p>In implementation (to quote Jimbo again) "That is not to say that every single case of this type deserves a block; admins must make careful judgments about particular cases." I don't want to harp on about Tbeatty, but in that case I based my decision on the fact that I had pointed out that it was unacceptable, that this warning had been removed with a flippant edit summary indicating that it had not been taken seriously,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tbeatty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77666877" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tbeatty&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77666877" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and that similar material (not justified by the source referenced) had been posted again. The block was preventative to stop more being posted, as I considered that Tbeatty showed no sign of accepting this should not be done. I think my judgement was correct, as an even worse statement was subsequently posted, which was then removed "per Jimbo Wales" by MONGO,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tbeatty&amp;diff=78249638&amp;oldid=78244012" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tbeatty&amp;diff=78249638&amp;oldid=78244012" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> and even now he (I presume from the anon post) is continuing to maintain he was right.</p>

<dd>I support removing personal attacks and blocking to prevent them, and I think BLP applies to you and me as well as to George Bush, and I'm glad we agree about those. I have been disappointed and annoyed to see how we rush to correct some things and how apathetic we are about others. But, we need to be careful to not make too much from Jimbo's rather cautious statement. Removing the comment from Tbeatty' page was the right thing to do, we now know. I'm not sure we know a lot more than that. I thought BLP did not apply in user space. That's not the case, but neither is it the case that "BLP applies to user pages" in full or without qualitication. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 22:54, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is necessary to pay "absolutely meticulous attention to detail when writing about living persons" (Jimbo Wales quoted above), one of whom I happen to be also. The statements above that I have accused Tom Harrison and Tbeatty of libel are a classic case of "a conjectural interpretation of a source" per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_negative_material" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Remove_unsourced_or_poorly_sourced_negative_material" rel="nofollow">WP:BLP</a>.

<dl>
<dd>It says, <i>"Description of a libel repeats the libel and is still a libel, that is why I refactored."</i> It does <i>not</i> actually say that the refactored statement or the original statement <i>is</i> a libel. The original statement was a dangerous one to make (accusing someone of lying in their professional work) and we shouldn't hang around to find out whether it is libel or not. We should get rid of it to protect the project from the possibility of libel. If it is indeed a libel, then describing it increases the libel. I assumed Tom Harrison didn't know this, or else he would not have repeated it, as he is an admin and a responsible editor, so I pointed it out to him for information. I refactored it for the same reason as the original needed to be refactored, namely it is a very dangerous one to make and we shouldn't hang around to find out whether it is libel or not — because, if it is, then <i>description of a libel repeats the libel and is still a libel, that is why I refactored.</i></dd>

<p>Just a thought reading this... if the <i>subject</i> of the comment is known and identifiable, be they editor or subject of an article, BLP should plus NPA should apply. As in, if Tom Harrison were a known, living person, who could be libeled: Tom Harrison of Somewhere USA, known quanity. But "XP"--whos that? It's a fictitious alias. In that case, only NPA counts. Another way would be if Bill Gates were libeled, NPA counts. If he edited under the secret alias of User:RedmondGuy5, then only NPA counts, <i>unless</i> it was established that RedmondGuy5 is in fact Bill Gates. Then both again. That would seem most logical, straightforward, and plain.

<p>Most of this talk is about clarifying that the caution applied to BLP is in fact mandatory in mentions of living people, wherever it occurs on wiki, including user space. There is also discussion on its applicability to editors, which I do not think has been considered previously.

<dd>That content policies are mandatory applies everywhere, and if the user space is the exception then, again, why is <i>that</i> not in the intro or nutshell? Until the third bullet of the first level two section there is nothing original on this page. That it applies to user space is important; that it supercedes 3rr is important; the various analyses of subjects editing articles about themselves is important. Make that initial, rather than the exhortations we have initially at the moment. "We must get the article <i>right</i>." We must make it verifiable (if that is the definition of <i>right</i>), which may or may not be true (if that is the definition of <i>right</i>). Again, that applies everywhere. I read the Jimbo bit and our sentence misses the target, because, simple as it is, it seems to imply we should be able to deduce final truth statements, which we cannot do.

<dd>I have watched the "big three". "Sofixtit" is an excellent piece of advice in general on Wikipedia, but is not practically or theoretically sensible on policy pages. Practically, your edit won't stick because people are conservative re original introductions to our policy pages and will revert you (this is a good thing, IMO). Theoretically it makes no sense, because (assuming good faith intent) one's working within policy, to refine policy, validates policy (i.e., you aren't fixing anything, but talking about how to <i>say</i> it). For instance, I'm not suggesting some overturning of BLP, but only suggesting clarity re how orignial it is. Let's immediately, clearly, state how the application of this <i>differs</i> from the normal application of the content policies. This isn't something to "fix," but rather something to render clearly. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 00:30, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>The template used on the talk pages of BLP (<a href="../../../b/l/p/Template%7EBlp_8ef7.html" title="Template:Blp">Template:Blp</a>) says "This article must adhere to the policy on biographies of living persons. Negative material that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous. The three-revert rule does not apply to such removals. Concerns relative to this policy can be addressed on the living persons biographies noticeboard."</p>

<p>Anyway... <i>I</i> didn't like the policy as worded, because I think we should indeed be "neutral", which doesn't mean "neutered" or "sympathetic". However, isn't this policy supposed to be to reduce the likely of legal action against the Foundation? What exactly <i>is</i> the origin of this policy? If it's something Jimbo or the Foundation have mandated, I think this is a change too far. If it's a policy from our community, then I'd propose changing it even further and having it apply only to potentially libellous material. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 14:12, 4 October 2006 (UTC) PS Please be careful when making changes to <a href="../../../b/l/p/Template%7EBlp_BLPtext_df14.html" title="Template:Blp/BLPtext">Template:Blp/BLPtext</a> (check and double check spelling before hitting save), it's used on over 100,000 pages and every save adds a crazy number to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">job queue</a>.</p>

<p>I think we should distinguish things that are 'bad' in an article, like unsourced or poorly sourced material, from things that are <i>unacceptable</i> for WP, which is either vandalism or <i>negative material about a living person</i>. Bad things need to be fixed in the normal edit cycle, whereas unacceptable things need to fixed <i>on sight</i> with a complete immunity from 3RR or involved-admin rules. Therefore, I would specifically <i>not</i> use the term <i>controversial</i> where we really mean <i>negative</i>. Controversial material about Madonna, say, could be that she once ran the Boston Marathon and came in 10th (just inventing). That could be reverted if poorly sourced, let's say, but not with a 3RR exemption. OTOH, if the claim is that she ran the Marathon and cheated (e.g. took the bus), that would be <i>negative</i> and hence deletable-on-sight with 3RR exemption. In summary, I think we should be very careful about conflating negative and controversial, and the most critical rule in BLP is about <i>negative material</i>, not <i>controversial</i>. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 14:29, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Crum375. The word <i>negative</i> is vital in this policy. <i>Negative</i> material about a living person is a very special kind of beast, and if this material is not sufficiently sourced (if there is <i>any</i> doubt about this whatsoever), then negative material must be removed immediately. Let's not dilute this simple message. The problem with using a word like "controversial" is that it asks the editor to <i>predict</i> the reaction to the content, because controversy is by definition all about the reaction the content causes. "Negative", on the other hand, is a relatively simple judgement that any editor can make based solely on the text. So let's keep this policy's special treatment of <i>negative</i> material, and if necessary, add an extra policy for the treatment of "otherwise controversial material". So, to summarise, first we ask "Is this material about a living person?" Yes. Then we ask "Is this material negative?" Yes. Then we ask "Is this material poorly referenced?" Yes. <i>Then we delete it.</i> If the material survives these tests, then we and only then should we proceed to ask "Is this material controversial?" The priority here must be clear... we are trying to stop people and their reputations from getting hurt by wild negative comment in Wikipedia. That's surely the primary objective of the BLP. THanks. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeborkman_778f.html" title="User:Leeborkman">Leeborkman</a> 14:50, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm afraid the balance is tipping too far. Surely the intent was never to sift out all unsourced negative material, while retaining the unqualified praise. Material about living people must be carefully sourced, but the policy is not fundamentally different from that on any other subject, except in the immediacy. On Byzantine history, we can leave in a cite request for a few weeks until someone gets to the library. If we say something about Madonna, the citations have to be there when the material is added. Not to say that there is anything negative to say about Madonna, who is a perfectly wonderful person by all accounts. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 15:30, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Negative" is an entirely POV criteria while "controversial" is an objective criteria. Further, what is positive about one person ("this person was number one at X, Y, and Z") can be negative about other people ("then so-and-so must be lying because he says he is number one at Z"). Is it negative to say the author of "Why I'm a famous whore" sleeps around? Is it negative to say Clinton is a liberal? Is is negative to say Coulter gets attention cause she's pretty? The issue is both privacy and what is controversial about a living person - yet unsourced properly; not what I or you would not want said of us (altho that's a good clue for what is controversial). "Negative" gets at the heart of the motivation for the policy while "controversial" gets at the heart of its implementation criteria. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 18:27, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think this is a Foundation issue designed to protect WP from libel related law suits. If an article has an unsourced or poorly sourced <i>negative</i> material about a living person, it could lead to the Foundation getting serious flak, and hence must be fixed <i>instantly</i>. If the article lavishes undeserved (i.e. poorly sourced) praise on someone, then sure that's not good but it can follow the normal civil WP process to get fixed. If we lump the two together, we dilute the handling of the critical issues with the non-critical. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 18:42, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>IMHO there are two levels of concern here, and we have a tendency to confound them. The highest level is concern about unsourced or poorly sourced negative material that could be libelous on its face, and is obvious lawsuit bait. That stuff should and must be removed immediately, from articles, user pages, and everywhere else. (It's like a rabid pit bull in your front porch--you MUST get rid of it NOW.)</dd>

<dd>The second level of concern, also high, but lower than the above, is for less obviously libelous material, hateful/harmful/mean-spirited material, etc. That stuff should be very carefully guarded against, not only for possible libel reasons, but for concerns about harming, pissing off, etc. living people, as well as concerns about Wikipedia becoming a non-encyclopedic repository for whatever negative cruft can be found and sourced. Though we don't want it in the encyclopedia, it doesn't necessarily have to be deleted as soon as it is noticed, and it might be OK to leave some talk about it on the discussion page. (It's like the saliva of a rabid pit bull who drooled on your front porch--clean it up, please, but you can take some time to find a mop and disinfectant.) <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 19:20, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I support David's proposal to shift the language from "negative" to "controversial", mostly because in almost all actual cases I have seen in practice, these amount to exactly the same thing. In general, I think anything unsourced that anyone at all objects to (positive or negative) should be removed pending sourcing. (While noting, of course, that anyone who attempts any magic tricks by repeating my words as an incantation designed to override reasonable standards of what is or is not controversial will discover that in my infinite power, I have hidden a magic charm in this quote which will turn you into a toad.

<dd>I don't think I support this change. Material could be unsourced and negative without being controversial, unless controversial is going to be defined as negative, in which case why make the change. "Professor Smith gained 50 lbs in weight during her tenure." There's nothing controversial about it, but it's negative and it's unsourced, so it needs to be removed immediately. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:41, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd rather have some real examples (with name changes or whatever) if going to the extent of a special rule - an extra axiom - is what the case demands. Quite possibly I am wrong; but, by crikey, the bends this puts in NPOV just seem too bad for the encyclopedia's qualit to stand. I've floated this on wikien-l as well, hoping for added ideas on the matter that don't require Jimbomancy - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 00:03, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No mere rule will stop the malicious for a second even as it hamstrings editors of good faith. Look, you already know the answer to your worry: if they act in a clearly stupid way and try to wikilawyer, the sensible people say "uh, no" and deal with them appropriately. Phrasing things overly didactically does not change anyone's actual behaviour or thinking, and it just gives wikilawyers a playground. You should have learnt this by now with the disaster that is the robotic overapplication of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Now we get people complaining about their Wikipedia bios having press errors or lies that have been perpetuated, and which they can't get changed at all. Because newspapers are "reliable sources" and their own blog where they try to refute the newspaper lies are not "reliable sources." Thus meaning WP:RS has had the direct opposite effect it was intended to, all because it was written didactically to be applied robotically. Well done.</dd>

<dd>I am thinking of this change as a move from *just one type* of controversial material (the negative kind) to a more NPOV approach of *all kinds* of controversial material (negative, positive, or just highly questionable). "Professor Smith gained 50 lbs. in weight during her tenure" is precisely the sort of nonsense that should be shot on sight when people see it without references.

<dd>Heh... I came here to talk about a problem with the application of this policy and see that it had already been predicted in the conversation above. Specifically, on the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_L._Cook_4bba.html" title="David L. Cook">David L. Cook</a> page there has been a lovely little edit war where the fact that Cook lives in Charlotte, North Carolina has been repeatedly removed as 'controversial' and thus in violation of this policy. You see, 'controversial' can mean <b>anything</b>... all it takes is for someone to dispute it for any reason whatsoever and it becomes 'controversial' and they feel free to violate 3RR. To make matters even more bizarre... the person removing the change had accused the user adding it of <b>being</b> David Cook. Sooo.... why exactly would he sue Wikimedia over something <i>he</i> added to the page? As the situtation evolved, the user has claimed to work for Cook's management company and this seems to be born out by sleuthing performed by the user they are in dispute with... but they still refused to allow the 'controversial' text! So a reference backing up the claim was added... but it was from a page controlled by David Cook and apparently that page didn't have his home town listed a few days ago. So that dastardly David Cook went and <i>created</i> a reference and it must not be allowed because it isn't verifiable and David Cook could sue us for having this unverified controversial material about him in his article!</dd>
<dd>I understand the intended goal in expanding this from 'negative' to 'controversial'... but we need to consider not what the policy <b>means</b>, but what people will think/claim it means. Can we expand on the wording a little to explain that it only applies to things which would be controversial to the subject of the article... or one of their professional/personal rivals? 'Joe Average is the lowest scoring cricket player of all time' and 'Joe Average has outscored all other cricket players' would be 'controversial'. 'Joe Average lives in Duluth, Minnesota' should not be. Yes, it is possible that Joe doesn't really live in Duluth and it would be good to get a reference backing that up... but I hope that everyone agrees neither Joe nor anyone else is ever going to sue Wikimedia over it and thus it isn't something that needs to be shot on sight and 3RR ignored et cetera... or what this policy should then say is that <b>ALL</b> facts about living persons must be properly referenced... gender, height, age, citizenship, birth name... everything. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 12:32, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. Not "ALL facts". Just ones that are CHALLENGED. You know. Questioned. As in "I think this fact should be sourced or removed" said by someone not trolling (and we should AGF). "unlimited reversions and blocks" is no part of this. If it is on a BLP and unsourced and questioned, then remove it or source it. Period. Where someone lives can be controversial for reasons that are not made public. Say a guy has a girl in one city and a girl in another city and pays rent for both. Now lawyers or the IRS get involved. If you have any creativity you can write the rest for yourself. It's not our place to decide that a detail about someone's life it important enough to have displayed for all the world to see yet unimportant enough to not bother with proper sourcing. If it is that trivial, it doesn't belong here in the first place. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 15:40, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My point was that "just ones that are CHALLENGED" is effectively equivalent to "ALL"... because people can, will, and indeed already do challenge anything and everything for all sorts of reasons. Yes, scenarios can be constructed where the location someone lives could be 'damaging'... but in most cases it isn't... and certainly not when it is being taken off an online bio from the person themself. My understanding is that this policy was introduced to deal with information which on its face was potentially damaging to someone... if we want to expand that into the hypothetical realm of information which <i>could</i> be private and <i>might</i> theoretically cause some problem... then as you say a scenario can be imagined for ANY fact to fit that criteria. You say that unlimited reversions and blocks are "no part of this"... but the policy says otherwise. It states that this policy is here to deal with material which is so potentially damaging that users should ignore 3RR to revert it, admins should ignore usual strictures against blocking those they are in content disputes with, et cetera. To me that doesn't sound like it should apply to 'anything that anyone challenges for any reason'... and if it IS going to then we should just say that ALL facts on living persons have to be referenced to avoid uncertainty and/or abuse of the process. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:57, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Challenges occur one at a time and thus are effectively <i>not</i> equivelent to saying "all". Think of it as a procedural definition that in fact will never encompass "all". Your understanding that "this policy was introduced to deal with information which on its face was potentially damaging to someone" is incorrect. It was introduced to deal with editors using existing wikipedia policy to treat living people as if they were no more important than some random building that had an article about it; with privacy at the top of the list of problems that this was causing (see <a href="../../../w/a/s/User_talk%7EWAS_4.250_abb7.html#Talk:WP:BLP" title="User talk:WAS 4.250">User talk:WAS 4.250#Talk:WP:BLP</a> for more details). Ignoring 3RR is about stuff that is agreed is inadequately sourced. When one guy says it is inadequately sourced and others disagree then ignoring 3RR is cause for a block. Saying "that ALL facts on living persons have to be referenced" more than we already do at the Verifiability policy and this policy is just stirring up trouble to no good end. Yes, we want everything in wikipedia to be referenced somewhere eventually, but editing needs to be a thoughtful process and throwing around universals ("all") is detrimental to a thoughtful process. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 18:43, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my view, deliberately leaving things ambiguous and relying on 'good judgement' to sort it out is far more "detrimental". It leads to disagreements which eventually come down to, 'my judgement (as an admin / arbitor / consensus judger / whatever) takes precedence over yours'... which in the <i>best</i> cases may lead to the right content, but still inevitably seems like bias to those on the receiving end. If any fact on a living person <i>CAN</i> absolutely require sources to remain displayed and 3RR <i>may</i> be ignored (if someone judges that it is 'agreed that sourcing is inadequate'... agreed by whom? Certainly not the person adding the info) then I think it would be far less disruptive and abusable to just say that all facts on living people require sources... because, under the scenario you describe, the moment someone 'challenges' them that becomes the case. If that goes too far then we should define the conditions under which sources are required for inclusion, 3RR goes out the window, and content disputes become blockable... because if we don't these subjective evaluations <i>will</i> be applied inconsistently amongst our 4,062,353 registered users (and countless anons) and it <i>will</i> generate a great deal of needless aggravation. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:39, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>(edit conflict - to Tom)</i> Do you think it is a good idea to set up a situation where the difference between 'User A gets blocked' and 'User B gets blocked' is a subjective interpretation of semantics on the word 'controversial'? I just see endless headaches in that future. I agree that finding the right phrasing is tricky, but urge that we try rather than saying, 'oh we will just stomp those who misapply it'. It is a <i>given</i> that people will take 'controversial' to mean 'anything that &gt;I&lt; want to challenge... even if it is just because I do not like the person adding it'. That's not some hypothetical problem, but a bedrock certainty of human nature... and a valid definition of the word 'controversial'. Spelling it out with less 'wiggle room' can only help avoid trouble. How about, '...text which seems defamatory or possibly biased (either positively or negatively)'? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 14:37, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I do not object to improving the wording, but spelling out too much invites wiki-lawyering. I too see endless headaches in the future. It strikes me that one way I might avoid them is to avoid anything dealing with living people.

<dd>You say "<i>It is a given that people will take 'controversial' to mean 'anything that &gt;I&lt; want to challenge</i>". That <b>is</b> what it means between editors that AGF with each other. But it is important to retain the word "controversial" rather than replace it with "anything anyone challenges" because AGF is not <i>in spite</i> of evidence so it can be appropriate to ask "what's controversial about the way we say X?" when the issue is not so much no source but the quality of the source or the wording of the claim. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 15:50, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While the example given above, "Professor Smith gained 50 lbs. in weight during her tenure", would be controversial even with refeences, as soon as I read it I thought of a possibly acceptable context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Smith spent 10 years as Assistant Professor of Ethics at the university's School of Nutrition. During her tenure Professor Smith gained 50 lbs. (22.7 kg) in weight. Professor Smith is 74 in (188 cm) tall. When she joined the school's faculty she weighed 130 lbs (58.9 kg) and could barely walk the stairs to her office without having to stop halfway to gain her strength. When she left to take a position as Full Professor of Ethics in the School of Law she weighed 180 lbs (81.6 kg) and took the stairs two or three at a time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the proper references, the professor's wight gain is interesting and relevant.</p>
<p>However, I also thought of this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Smith spent 10 years as Assistant Professor of Ethics at the university's School of Nutrition. During his tenure Professor Smith gained 50 lbs. (22.7 kg) in weight. Professor Smith is 64 in (163 cm) tall. When he joined the school's faculty he weighed 105 lbs (47.6 kg). When he left to take a position as Full Professor of Ethics in the School of Law he weighed 155 lbs (70.3 kg).</p>

<p>It is still relevant. Would it be acceptable?</p>

<p>It is a collection of frequently written email newsletters which are also archived on a website. The newsletters are the personal conjectures (written as fact) of one man about another man whom he hates, and he sends the mailings to thousands of people (including spamming some), and some of them then post his "opinion pieces" on Usenet, discussion groups, and numerous websites, since they also hate this man. Under deposition the man who writes the newsletters was forced to admit that his conjectures were "euphemisms" for what he believed to be true. They are very specific conjectures, including charges of criminal acts, for which he could produce no proof under deposition. This particular source is used many times here at Wikipedia, and because a number of editors also hate this man, they adamantly insist on using it as a source in articles and as an external link. -- <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFyslee_abcc.html" title="User:Fyslee">Fyslee</a> 18:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are taking the quote <b>totally</b> out of context. He is refering to words we use to describe living persons (including each other) on talk pages like this one. He is <b>not</b> talking about words used in articles based on verifiable sources. Articles must be as accurate as possible. We don't sugarcoat the verifiable truth. Period. We say it in clear plain nonemotional language. Some controversies require quoting <i>others</i> who use emotional language - those we put in proper NPOV encyclopedic context. (specifically he was responding to my immediately prior comment that included "<i>Since I wrote the above, I looked into the situation a bit and discovered I do know of Steven Jones of 9/11 crackpot-theory fame after all.

<dd>I was asked to comment here, but the shift of context is so great, that I am struggling to figure out how. First, we, as Wikipedians, ought to comport ourselves with the highest standards of love and respect for the dignity of others, particularly for the subjects of our articles, even if we find them somehow distasteful. We are encyclopedists, but more, we are wikipedians, and to me that means something about how we should interact with others. We are not editorialists, we are not bloggers. If we privately judge someone to be a crackpot, fine, we make that judgment to ourselves, and then we write with love in a way that preserves their dignity. We say things like "Your views are not generally accepted by mainstream science" or "We are unable to publish your original research, please try to get it published in a peer reviewed academic journal."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The separate question you seem to be asking about is whether "crackpot" websites and conspiracy theories be used as sources for articles. Well, obviously, no. My point is that there is no reason for us to be insulting about it. Our choice is not between "be insulting" versus "accept what they say". The right answer is: be kind, but be firmly in possession of our rational faculties, and make serious editorial judgments in good faith to the best of our abilities.--<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> 23:34, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Relatives of famous people who fail WP:BIO on their own.</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes the relatives (usually children) of famous people get into the press briefly, usually because of some embarrassing incident. In a typical case, the incident is covered widely in the press, so there is no issue of verifiability, but the incident may be the only reliable, verifiable information of sufficient importance to bother writing about. Since <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline, not policy, it can validly be overridden (or interpreted) by consensus, and we can validly have a biography of a person whose exploits would be completely non-notable if he or she were not a relative of a genuinely famous person.</p>
<p>My concern is, what is the proper application of our NPOV policy to this type of case? Unlike the typical biographical entry, the negative incident is not likely to be balanced by other information, creating a negative impression that may well not be fair. The solutions I can think of are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the biography. This requires consensus on AFD.</li>
<li>Merge the article into the famous person's biography, where it will have context and not be expected to be a complete biography. This requires consensus, but a less formal one than AFD.</li>
<li>Flesh out the article with self-published information from the person's My Space account (or whatever).</li>
<li>Commit original research to include what positive information one can find from other primary or doubtful sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is the proper way to handle this? I avoid naming any specific article because I am interested in the general approach, and whether there should be something in the policy about this type of case. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 22:53, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In every example I can think of, the preferred solution has been option 2 above - merge the verifiable content into the famous person's biography and let the experts watching that page keep it in balance. Failing that, it should be deleted. Expanding the page by adding unverifiable content or original research just makes a bad article worse. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 00:11, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I would be OK with #2 if there is not enough verifiable content for a decent stand-alone article. However, a seperate article for this relative makes sense if their more famous relative's page is already too long. There is also nothing wrong with #3 if it is done sensibly (I.e. sourced as self=promoted, no reasonable doubt as to whot eh My Space article is, etc.). Number 1 (deletion) is a bad choice. Some people are famous for negative things, that is not our fault. As to number 4, using doubtful sources is not recommended for any article, let alone a BLP. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 00:27, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sorry, there is an option zero (or five) if you prefer -- just leave it as a stub (or very short article) that only talks about the embarrassing episode and nothing else. If it is consensus that this is fair, there is no issue. I am thinking about the "do no harm" aspect quoted by WAS, and whether this has any impact on a case where the only notable thing about the person is negative, and the only positive things are non-notable. Is there a point at which it becomes non-current, or should a 30-year-old have a bio that contains only her arrest for indecent exposure during Mardi Gras at the age of 20? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 15:08, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Option 5 - leave it as a stub, is completely acceptable. There are people who are known only for one bad act. If that is the case, then that is all the article needs to include, if that is all that is verifiable. As to time limits, there is no reason to decide that in advance. In 30 years, editors can decide if the article is still useful to anyone. Perhaps Mardi Gras is no longer celebrated in 2036 and readers of that time period are fascinated with information about the event, maybe they could care less. Let them make the decision. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 15:19, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Living people who only have <i>one</i> thing that unbiased reliable secondary sources can be found for; almost without exception should not have an article about them. If the event is important, then the event can have an article about <i>it</i>. The key to the living people policy that that people are to be treated as people, not mere objects we assemble a data base on. Articles about them can affect their lives. If an article on a living person can not be both verifiable and balanced then whether they are a public person or a private person becomes a critical criteria - if private (example - they are some nobody who got arrested) then ax the article; while if public (example - they have gone out of their way to seek publicity) then keep the article. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 16:50, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It depends on the case, of course, but in general I disagree. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Carter_e808.html" title="Billy Carter">Billy Carter</a> is only famous for being the brother of a famous politician and for being a "colorful character" (some might say he is "a screw-up"). Our article on him lists nothing positive about him except that he was in the Marines, if you count that. He simply hasn't done anything great in his life to bother writing about. It's not our fault that is the way his life has turned out. To delete his article or to merge it into Billy Carter would be a big mistake. He is famous enough to have his own article, and that article correctly spends its time on what he is famous for. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 17:06, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just read your post again and I see you are placing a big emphasis on it being <b>one</b> thing. I think it depends on what the "one thing" is. To me, Billy is notable only for one incident, but if you read his article there are a couple of things there, so maybe he does not fit your defintion. Again, it is hard to say for certain without a concrete example. If the "one" thing they did is to stage a school massacre, then of course that is notable. As to your suggestion of writing about the event rather than the person, I don't think it matters. Our entire policy on this is misguided. Libel against Bill Gates is libel whether it is in <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> or <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleshlight.html" title="Fleshlight">Fleshlight</a>. If Joe Shmoe is famous for participating in one famous event, it really doesn't matter if the name of the article is <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Schmoe_cfb1.html" title="Joe Schmoe">Joe Schmoe</a> or famous event. We have to avoid libel in either case, which is why our focus purely on biographies is only a very small part of what needs to be done. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 17:23, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One more thought: some police departments make a point of publishing the names of people who have committed certain crimes, and newspapers publish them. Although I'm not suggesting that we need an article on each of these people, I don't see why there would be a legal liability to us if there is no problem for the newspaper. Again, I don't think we should rush to create such articles, but I don't see them as a legal problem, either. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 17:26, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I said "Although I'm not suggesting that we need an article on each of these people,.." however, people are claiming it is a lible problem, hence the second part of my statement "...I don't see why there would be a legal liability to us if there is no problem for the newspaper." Speaking from a legal standpoint, anything a newspaper in Florida can do, we should be able to do, I would expect. As to whether it is moral or not, that is clearly a matter of opinion. There are some that would hold up the news-institutions as having high standards of moral conduct. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 15:07, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I, for one, never mentioned libel. I was discussing facts that are widely published and undoubtedly true. The question is one of fairness, both to our readers and to the subject of the biography. It seems to me that a biographical main article should be, or be able to be made, reasonably comprehensive. Even a biography of <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Ridgway_1801.html" title="Gary Ridgway">Gary Ridgway</a> should include more than just the murders, although clearly that is the major point of interest, and sources exist to do that. In the case of the drug-addict daughter of a politician, that may be impossible using reliable sources. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 01:51, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comments. I suppose that the policy does not need clarification here. In the case I am thinking about, the proposal to merge has resulted in accusations of bad faith by some editors who see merging as equivalent to deletion, or preparatory to a plan to surreptitiously delete it, and therefore who see it as politically motivated <i>a fortiori</i>.

<dd>I think this is an excellent question. Under US law, corporations have many of the same rights as individual citizens. I don't know how this plays out with respect to libel specifically. However, I do know that libel about Bill Gates is libel whether it occurs at <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> or <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> or <a href="../../../x/f/m/Xfm_Manchester_db89.html" title="Xfm Manchester">Xfm Manchester</a> or at Housewife Bangers. The title and supposed main subject of the article make no difference as far as the liability is concerned. For that reason, I think our focus on living persons is too narrow to be anything more than a very incomplete fix for the problem. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 01:34, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If you focus on companies/corporations, then you'd have to include organizations, institutions, religions, movements, political parties etc., which of course are broader categories than than just 'companies', which would then encompass a large part of Wikipedia article space.

I doubt a false claim about the derivation of <a href="../../../p/i/_/Pi.html" title="Pi">Pi</a> would result in a law suit or even a nasty letter to the Foundation (well, you never know), but obviously there are many types of organizations, not just corporations, and of course world wide, who could be offended and threaten legal action.

<dd>In answer to the question from Ansell - my personal opinion (based upon an incomplete knowledge of all possible facts, as usual) is that this policy does little to prevent libel. Clearly, higher powers at Wikimedia (including at least one lawyer, Brad Patrick) feel the policy is helpful, so I will assume they know something I don't. For example, it may be a legal defense to at least show that "we tried something". As I said, though, since I can libel Bill Gates at an article that has nothing whatsoever to do with Bill Gates, this policy is very incomplete, at best. I think more emphasis on <a href="../../../l/i/b/Wikipedia%7ELibel_9d80.html" title="Wikipedia:Libel">Wikipedia:Libel</a> would potentially be a good idea to help us address all our other articles that are not biographies of living people, but where libel could occur due to a malacious editor.

<p>I believe this expansion would be unnecessary. Companies, corporations and other organizations are by definition <i>public</i> persons. They do not have the same implicit right to an expectation of privacy that a natural person has. Organizations expect to get discussed and factor publicity (positive and negative) into their decisions in ways that few humans would do. While it is possible to libel a company and in theory the standards are the same, in practice there is a much higher threshold. You can say some pretty awful things about <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wal-Mart_0d83.html" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> and not get in legal trouble. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 14:52, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I posted this at the other proposed policy page, and will mention it here as well for consideration. If negative press about Megacorp, LLC is uncovered by a reliable source, it would be negligient to not report on it at least in passing. For example, a very small incident could be handled safely by a line or two, with a link or two to RS detailed it more fully. I simply mean that this proposed policy should not be used to shield organizations or corporations from "bad press" simply because Google or other SE results will have disproportionate weight via Wikipedia being what it is. The goal is not to assist in spin control or minimizing negative associations for the subject of an article, but to be the sum total of human knowledge as Jimbo has said. And, of course, companies are not and never will be people to have hurt 'feelings'. The legal comes first, but that should be the only concern when speaking in terms of organizations and corporations. Whether or not Megacorp (or whomever) is happy with a site with a future Pagerank of "1" has links to things they want to eventually fade from public view is irrelevant in the scheme of what we do. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 16:41, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>BLP states that we should "remove unsourced or poorly sourced controversial material" from biographical material about living persons found anywhere in Wikipedia. So my questions are:</p>

<dd>Just to repeat what I've said elsewhere about this, Youtube should not be used as a source, except in the sense that there might be clips of documentaries or other films that counted as reliable sources. But in cases like that, the source is the documentary, not Youtube, and providing a Youtube link would only be done as a matter of courtesy to the reader. It would be like finding a blog that hosted a copy of a NYT article that was no longer available on the NYT site. So long as we had no reason to believe the article might have been tampered with, it's fine to link to the blog. But the source is the NYT, not the blog, and the full citation should be for the NYT article.</dd>
<dd>If anyone objects, on BLP, copyright, or on any other grounds, just remove the link to Youtube, but the citation to the film Youtube was showing should stay (not all source material has to be online), and should stand or fall as a reliable source on its own merits. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:09, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>I fully understand the concerns with libel, but I have to say: the way this is being applied, it seems like some figures who are "controversial" at best are getting a free ride. The way this is being interpreted, it seems that positive remarks about them can be sourced to their own web site, or a local paper that probably printed their press release intact, etc., but negatives need to come from major mainstream media, and neutral media at that.</p>
<p>For an example, of what I'm talking about: take a look at the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Newman_ad8f.html" title="Fred Newman">Fred Newman</a> article. People are objecting to citing Chip Berlet's writing on Newman on the theory that Berlet is non-neutral and that his book was published by the organization he works for (which people are characterizing, I think misleadingly, as "self-published").

Wikipedia does not exist as some pure, ethereal document, floating alone in space - this is a real document with real effects on real people in the real world. It is simple human courtesy to completely reject negative comment until it can be shown to meet all of the relevant standards for notability, verification, etc. Continually raising the original motivations for creating the BLP policy (whatever those motivations might have been) just muddies the waters. This is a simple ethical principle. Forget the legalities. Behave ethically.

<p>Even forget about the legal consequences. What's the right thing to to? Real damage to reputations and lives can occur for inaccurate or unnecessarily harsh criticism. Time is on Wikipedia's side. There is no publishing deadline. If an editor doesn't get in that last little negative or controversial tidbit by 5 pm, no harm is done. Conversely, if he rushes and get's it wrong, huge harm can be done for no apparent reason. Even journalists can point to deadlines as excuses for getting it wrong. Wikipedians have no excuse. Erroring on the side of "thin" is always better than erroring on the side of "thick." So what if the positive comments outweigh the negative for a time? The opposite is infinitely worse. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 06:23, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me that most of the issues that arise in biographies of living persons come from people who dislike the subject of the article wanting to include any negative information they can find into the article without a regard for sourcing. To counteract this, maybe Wiki can create a checklist guideline an editor has to go through before adding an edit to a biography of a living person. For example, things an editor should consider before an edit is:</p>
<ul>
<li>their opinion of the subject;</li>
<li>is the edit negative;</li>
<li>is it sourced;</li>
<li>is it from a source that complies with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>;</li>
<li>is the edit being presented in a neutral tone</li>
<li>is the edit relevant (meaning is it something that persons decades in the future will care about or is it simply the latest tabloid gossip).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure there are more guidelines that can be added but perhaps if editors thought more about what they are doing, there would be a decrease in the amount of libel that gets posted at Wiki.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Invasion of privacy issue is not mentioned adequately</span></h2>
<p>There is a reference to "false light" under "Use of categories," and this refers to a Wikipedia article, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invasion_of_Privacy_0bb8.html" title="Invasion of Privacy">Invasion of Privacy</a>. But from the footnote at the bottom of that article, which leads to a long essay posted on the website of the Florida bar, it is clear that "false light" is but a tiny part of the invasion of privacy issue. This is important because Florida is the Wikimedia Foundation's declared and preferred jurisdiction. There needs to be an entire section on the sort of statements -- even if they are true statements -- that might be actionable under Florida's laws. Moreover, the statute of limitations for libel in Florida is two years, but for invasion of privacy, due to a quirk where the legislature forgot to include it on a list under a new law, is four years. That's what an appeals court in Florida said about the statute of limitations for invasion of privacy. Maybe the legislature will fix this soon, but maybe not. --Daniel Brandt 216.60.71.219 04:14, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This policy potentially voids Wikipedia's 47 USC 230(c)(1) protection</span></h2>
<p>As an attorney, I have to wonder if Wikipedia has any legal counsel and, if so, if that counsel has reviewed this new "Biographies of living persons" policy for its legal soundness or lack thereof. As a longtime Wikipedia user and contributor, I worry that this policy has drastically increased Wikipedia's exposure to liability. In an attempt to improve, Wikipedia may have opened a door to its own destruction.</p>
<p>In a simplified explanation, federal law -- specifically 47 USC 230(c)(1) -- protects a system such as Wikipedia against liability for <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a>/defamation. When an online service provider cannot control the content before it is published, federal law thus protects it against defamation claims because it is legally not considered a publisher. With this new "Biographies of living persons" policy, however, Wikipedia has assumed the role of editor and thus potentially voids its 47 USC 230(c)(1) protection. In an attempt to shield itself against litigation, Wikipedia may have significantly increased its legal liability. I would encourage interested parties to read the following for a clearer picture of how 47 USC 230(c)(1) protections can be voided: <i>Gentry v. eBay, Inc.</i> 99 Cal.App.4th 816 (2002); <i>Barrett v. Rosenthal</i> 114 Cal.App.4th 1379 (2004) (and the appeal, when it's published); <i>Carafano v. Metrosplash.com</i><a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/23FE0B8E8A5093C188256D810068FB6F/%24file/0255658.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/23FE0B8E8A5093C188256D810068FB6F/%24file/0255658.pdf" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that the various sources discussed at <a href="../../../s/e/c/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act_d2cb.html" title="Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a>, such as Ken S. Myers's excellent analysis, were written/published <b>before</b> this new biography policy was instituted.</p>
<p>All of this is not to say that incorrect or defamatory material shouldn't be removed from articles. It's Wikipedia's self-insinuation as editor that worries me. By adopting a special policy for biographies of living persons with a higher standard of care, and thus becoming more systematically active in editing, Wikipedia stands on shaky ground, in my opinion. 207.69.138.10 17:44, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I too am an attorney, though not a specialist in IP or defamation law, and certainly not Wikipedia's lawyer. My reaction is that I think it is very highly unlikely a court would hold that voluntarily aspiring to higher standards for our content should reduce the site's legal protections, but I will read with interest the cases you cite.</dd>

<dd>Brad, the key issue is this: does the more hands-on policy make Wiki a "publisher" and therefore void the 47 USC 230(c)(1) protections? A number of attorneys I know, who specialize in cyberlaw, feel that a site needs to be as "hands off" as possible in order to maintain 47 USC 230(c)(1) protections. The new biographies policy is more hands-on. The million-dollar question, therefore, is whether that moves Wiki into the domain of publisher and thus void its 47 USC 230(c)(1) protections. This issue has yet to be tested. <i>Rosenthal</i>, in part, directly addresses this issue, but has yet to be decided and, since it's in a state court, it's not binding on other courts, which will only further muddy the waters. I think it would be wiser for Wiki to maintain the same standard for bios as everything else and not draw additional attention to this issue. That's only waving a red flag for some pissed-off person who has a biography on here to test the issue. That would be very expensive.207.69.137.200 00:33, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have a personal opinion, which is that the answer is generally no with at most narrow exceptions. Precisely because of concerns you raise, I don't think a further legal discussion here would be appropriate, though I will be glad to share my views privately with the Office if they should happen to ask me. (Please also note that although my username includes "Brad", I am by no means Brad Patrick; the presence of two lawyer Brads is a pure coincidence, and I can only plead that I was here first.&#160;:) ) <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:08, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Crocks, disavowing liability is no protection. As I noted to Brad above, the issue turns on whether the more hands-on, more focused policy moves Wiki into the domain of publisher, thus voiding its 47 USC 230(c)(1) protections.

<dd>I am not a lawyer. I am a layman. The anonymous user who started this section has proposed a legal hypothesis stating that an online provider who publishes a policy about permissible content in biographies can be considered to have "control" over said content <i>before</i> it is published and therefore assumes the role of an editor. Do I have that right?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Frankly, I don't see the logic. First, Wikipedia can <b>never</b> control content <i>before</i> it's published because of the nature of Wikipedia's design. Publication of what I'm writing now, for example, is instant the moment I hit the "Save page" button, and Wikipedia has zero control whatsoever over what I wrote prior to that event.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Second, the editors of bio articles on Wikipedia are all volunteers, and many of them are happy to have a guide for reference. That's the function this policy serves, to say "if you see something wrong according to these rules, then revert it." I am simply not seeing how this policy weakens Wikipedia's legal protection.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do agree that Wikipedia has become too policy and procedure oriented, however. I suspect, though, that this is a response to growth, a way to manage a much larger population of contributors (and vandals, and spammers, etc.) than ever before. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 20:59, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Amatulic, here is where you need to read the caselaw. The important legal distinction is whether Wikipedia moves from provider to publisher with this new policy. "Publisher" is an important legal distinction in defamation law. If a court deems it has become a publisher, then the 47 USC 230(c)(1) protections are voided. This is an issue that has yet to be tested by a trial court. What may seem <i>logical</i> to you, as a layperson, doesn't mean that liability doesn't exist. The 47 USC 230(c)(1) is fast-changing and evolving arena. With this policy, Wiki has painted a target on itself begging to be tested. I think that's unwise. Litigation of this sort would be extremely expensive. That's what the defendants in <i>Rosenthal</i> are learning; they pissed off a rich doctor and thought they had 47 USC 230(c)(1) protections. The subsequent litigation and appeals showed otherwise. 207.69.137.200 00:33, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
