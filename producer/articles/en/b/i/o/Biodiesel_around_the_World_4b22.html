<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiesel_around_the_World_4b22.html" title="Edit section: Australia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Australia</span></h2>
<p>The Fuel Standard (Biodiesel) Determination 2003 was signed by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_18.html" title="September 18">18 September</a>. The determination sets out the physical and chemical parameters of the Biodiesel standard. It also sets out the associated test methods that the Government will use to determine compliance.</p>
<p>Biodiesel subsidies are to be phased out by 2011, after the passing of the Fuel Tax Bill 2006.</p>
<p>Australian Farmers Fuel (SAFF) began retailing B100 in South Australia in 2001 and now also sells B20 (marketed as "Premium Diesel") at some 52 service stations across 4 states. SAFF currently sells B100 at 14 of these service stations.</p>
<p>All of the metropolitan trains and most of the metropolitan buses in <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> (capital of South Australia) operate on a B5 blend. The South Australian Government has stated that it will soon move to B20 or possibly higher blends.</p>
<p>Several councils (local Governments) across Australia are using B20 (including Townsville City Council, Adelaide City Council, Sydney City Council and Newcastle City Council).</p>
<p>In February of 2005 the first retail outlet for Biodiesel opened in the Sydney suburb of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marrickville.html" title="Marrickville">Marrickville</a>. It offers B20 and B50 blends to the general public, and caters to qualified fleets wishing to utilize B100.</p>
<p>2006 saw the second rollout, after SAFF, of Biodiesel by a service station network. Gull, a <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australia_84d0.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australian</a> based company, introduced B20 Biodiesel to several Gull service stations on April 3 which has since expanded to a total of 21 sites of purchase. In addition, pure Biodiesel (B100) along with other blends can be purchased in bulk. Gull is also involved with the Western Australian Government to provide B5 Biodiesel for use in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transperth.html" title="Transperth">Transperth</a> buses. Eventually the fleet will be provided with B10 or B20 blends. Currently seven percent of Transperth's bus fleet is running Biodiesel.</p>
<p>More recent news is the launch of reeFUEL biodiesel in Sustainable Townsville, North Queensland. reeFUEL sells only B100 and at time of writing, September, 2006, was selling 50,000 litres per week into a community of about 160,000. This is believed to be the highest penetration of biodiesel per capita in Australia. See www.reefuel.com for more information.</p>

<p><a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> opened a commercial biodiesel refinery in March 2005. It is capable of producing 12,000 m³ (3.2 million US gallons) per year of biodiesel fuel. Feedstocks can be a variety of <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunflower.html" title="Sunflower">sunflower</a> seeds, <a href="../../../s/o/y/Soybean.html" title="Soybean">soybeans</a>, or <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castor_bean.html" title="Castor bean">castor beans</a>. The finished product will be currently a blend of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum_diesel.html" title="Petroleum diesel">gas oil</a> with 2% biodiesel and, after 2011, 5% biodiesel, both usable in unmodified diesel engines. As of 2005, there were 3 refineries and 7 that are planned to open. These three factories were capable of producing 45.6 million of litres per year.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrobras.html" title="Petrobras">Petrobras</a> (the Brazilian national petroleum Company) launch an innovative system, making biodiesel (called H-Bio) from the petroleum refinary. In Brazil, castor bean is the best option to make biodiesel, because it's easier to plant and costs less than soybean, sunflower or other seeds.</p>
<p>On December 27, 2006 Brazil's government announced they will advance the 5% biodiesel blend mandate to 2010 instead of 2013.</p>

<p>NExBTL diesel, in contrast to rapeseed methyl ester, is a clear and colorless <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraffin.html" title="Paraffin">paraffin</a>, and contains no oxygen. It is used to improve the quality of petro-diesel; its' quality is higher since it has a homogenous source, namely plant-synthesized fatty acids. It doesn't require any special engine repairs and it doesn't foul systems. It is produced by direct hydrogenation of the plant oil (chemically, triglyceride) into alkane, water and carbon oxides on a nickel-molybdenum catalyst. The total CO<sub>2</sub> produced in the entire lifecycle is only 0.45 to 1.33 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/kg oil, in contrast to transesterified fuel with 1.4-2.0 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/kg oil, or mineral diesel with 3.4 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/kg oil. <a href="http://www.termo.hut.fi/Ene-39/4006/biodiesel1.ppt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.termo.hut.fi/Ene-39/4006/biodiesel1.ppt" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Therefore, it's not only an "oil derivative" like ester.</p>

<p>Biodiesel is now being produced locally in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> for use in three-wheeler motor rickshaws. These engines actually run on regular diesel fuel or CNG, but in the past <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerosene.html" title="Kerosene">kerosene</a> was used because it was far cheaper, and worked just as well. However, kerosene was dirty and wasn't as clean-burning. Biodiesel is rapidly replacing both kerosene and diesel as a more efficient, cheap, and clean alternative. Today plans are being chalked out to cultivate <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jatropha.html" title="Jatropha">Jatropha</a> plants on barren land to use its oil for biodiesel production. Now it is used for Railway engines and the plantations are recommended to plant these plants everywhere in unused areas through government sectors. Biodiesel is being used experimentally to run state transport corporation buses in Karnataka. University of Agriculture Sciences at Bangalore has identified many elite lines of Jatropha Curcas and <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pongamia_pinnata.html" title="Pongamia pinnata">Pongamia pinnata</a>. Large scale activities have been initiated quite recently. For example, large-scale plantations have been initiated in North-East India and Jharkhand through an <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memorandum_of_Understanding_f0a8.html" title="Memorandum of Understanding">Memorandum of Understanding</a> signed between D1 Oils and Williamson Magor. The hilly areas of the North-East are ideal for growing this hardy, low-maintenance plant.</p>

<p>Biodiesel is not yet sold on the market, things start to change and biodiesel is been produced in two small-scale experiments. The amounts produced in these experiments are up to 10,000 liters a month. The lack of production of biodiesel in Israel is in contrary with the Research and Development abilities of the country, for Israel is a center of development for agriculture technologies.

<p>Biodiesel called the Envo Diesel was launched by the Prime Minister Datuk Seri <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdullah_Ahmad_Badawi_8dc2.html" title="Abdullah Ahmad Badawi">Abdullah Ahmad Badawi</a> on Tuesday 22 March 2006 <a href="http://www.mida.gov.my/beta/news/view_news.php?id=2550" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mida.gov.my/beta/news/view_news.php?id=2550" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>. Malaysia currently produces 500,000 tonnes of biofuel annually and the government hopes to increase this number this year. Envo diesel blends 5% processed palm oil (vegetable oil) with 95% petrodiesel. In contrast, EU's B5 blends 5% methyl ester with 95% petrodiesel. Diesel engine manufacturers prefer the use of palm oil methyl ester blends as diesel engines are designed to handle 5% methyl esters meeting the EN14214 biodiesel standard, which palm oil cannot meet.</p>
<p>Projects requiring Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil as feedstocks have been criticized by some environmental advocates. <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends_of_the_Earth_6bb5.html" title="Friends of the Earth">Friends of the Earth</a> has published a report asserting that clearance of forests for oil-palm plantations is threatening some of the last habitat of the <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orangutan.html" title="Orangutan">orangutan</a>.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_www.foe.co.uk.818"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/o/Biodiesel_around_the_World_4b22.html#endnote_www.foe.co.uk.818" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/o/Biodiesel_around_the_World_4b22.html#endnote_www.foe.co.uk.818" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></sup></span> Also, in a column for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a>, writer <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Monbiot_d1d1.html" title="George Monbiot">George Monbiot</a> claimed that land clearance by cutting and burning large forest trees frees large amounts of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon_dioxide.html" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> that is never reabsorbed by the smaller oil palms.

<p>The palm oil industry has recognized this concerned and in conjunction with the WWF has formed the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil RSPO<a href="http://www.rspo.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rspo.org/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> which endeavours to ensure development of palm oil in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>With the increase in awareness and importance attached to environmental issues such as global warming, more environment-friendly fuels are being developed as alternatives to fossil fuel. One such fuel, which has been gaining prominence in recent years, is biofuel. Clean and renewable, biofuel has been touted as the answer to the issue of the diminishing of energy reserves. Led by Y. Bhg. Tan Sri Datuk Dr Yusof Basiron, former Director General of MPOB, MPOB has been the pioneer and is at the forefront in researching into palm biodiesel project. Since the 1980s, MPOB in collaboration with the local oil giant, PETRONAS, has begun to develop a patented technology to transform crude palm oil into a viable diesel substitute. This process involves the transesterification of crude palm oil into palm oil methyl esters or palm biodiesel. It has also been successfully demonstrated in a 3000 tonnes per year pilot plant located in the MPOB headquarters.</p>
<p>Palm biodiesel has been systematically and exhaustively evaluated as diesel fuel substitute from 1983 to 1994. These included laboratory evaluation, stationary engine testing and field trials on a large number of vehicles including taxis, trucks, passenger cars and buses. Exhaustive field trials with 30 Mercedes Benz of Germany mounted onto passenger buses have been successfully completed with each bus covered 300,000 km, the expected life of the engines.</p>
<p>The advantages of palm biodiesel, drawn from the field trials are no modification of the engines is required, good engine performance, cleaner exhaust emission and comparable fuel consumption in comparison with the petroleum diesel. The palm biodiesel can be used neat or blended with petroleum diesel in any proportions. Recently, to overcome the long standing pour point problem of palm biodiesel (pour point = 15°C), MPOB has developed a process to produce low pour point palm biodiesel (-21°C to 0°C) which is suitable for temperate countries.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Commercial PE Arriva trains running on palm biodiesel</p>
<pre>
   In the recent development, the palm biodiesel produced from the 3 000 tonnes per annum capacity pilot plant in MPOB headquarters has been exported to Prignitzer Eisenbahn (PE) Arriva. PE Arriva is a subsidiary of UK-based Arriva group. Arriva is one of the largest transport services organizations in Europe and operates an extensive range of services including buses, express and commuter coaches, trains, taxis, ambulances and ferries. This has shown that palm biodiesel can be used in commercial trains without any problem. To-date, a total of 136 tonnes of palm biodiesel has been supplied by MPOB (36 tonnes) and MPOB technology licensee, CAROTINO SDN. BHD. (100 tonnes) and exported to PE Arriva to power their commercial trains. For operation in the winter season, a heating device is needed to be installed in the trains. Such heating device is not required if low pour point palm biodiesel is used.

</pre>
<p>3D Layout of Palm Biodiesel Plant</p>
<pre>
   To promote palm biodiesel as in global biodiesel industry, MPOB has committed to assist (technically and financially) to build three 60 000 tonnes per year palm biodiesel plants in Malaysia together with three companies. The plants also include 30 000 tonnes per year low pour point palm biodiesel. 
</pre>
<p>The production technologies have been licensed to two companies, i.e. LIPOCHEM (M) SDN. BHD. for normal palm biodiesel and OILTEK SDN. BHD. for low pour point palm biodiesel. Interested parties can contact them directly for further enquiries. These biodiesel produced are mainly for overseas market. Palm biodiesel technology has great potential for commercialization as diesel engine application is widespread all over the world, especially in the agricultural and transport sector. The patented palm diesel technology is now in place - it is being exported to a company in Korea. This demonstrates that MPOB is able to develop and export Malaysian indigenous technology and thus further boost up the image of MPOB as an R &amp; D centre of excellence.</p>

<p>Thailand was the first country to launch biodiesel as a national program on July 10th 2001. It was reported that the work was initiated by the Royal Chitralada Project, a royal -sponsored project to help rural farmers <a href="http://www.royalchitralada.or.th" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.royalchitralada.or.th" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. International co-operation among ASEAN country was also starting by the Renewable Energy Institute of Thailand (Dr. Samai Jai-In) and Asia-Pacific Roundtable for Sustainable consumption and Production (Dr. Olivia Castillo, <a href="http://www.aprscp.org/news/chaircorner.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aprscp.org/news/chaircorner.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>). The primary aims of the project in Thailand are:</p>
<ul>
<li>an alternative output for excess agricultural produce</li>
<li>substituting diesel imports</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2007, several biodiesel plants are operating in Thailand using the excess palm oil / palm stearin and in some cases, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Waste_vegetable_oil.html" title="Waste vegetable oil">waste vegetable oil</a> as raw materials. The production capacity is about 1 million litre/day and should reach 2 million litre by early 2008. About 400 petrol stations are now distributing B5 (5% biodiesel with 95% diesel) in Chiangmai and Bangkok. The national biodiesel standard has been developed based on the European standard. The target of the Government is to mandate B2 by 2nd April 2008 and to increase to B5 by 2011 which will require almost 4 Million litres/day of biodiesel <a href="http://www.dede.go.th" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dede.go.th" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>Biodiesel is commercially available in most oilseed-producing states in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. As of 2005, it is somewhat more expensive than fossil diesel, though it is still commonly produced in relatively small quantities (in comparison to petroleum products and <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethanol.html" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>). Many farmers who raise oilseeds use a biodiesel blend in tractors and equipment as a matter of policy, to foster production of biodiesel and raise public awareness. It is sometimes easier to find biodiesel in <a href="../../../r/u/r/Rural.html" title="Rural">rural</a> areas than in cities. Similarly, some agribusinesses and others with ties to oilseed farming use biodiesel for public relations reasons. As of 2003 some tax credits are available in the U.S. for using biodiesel. In 2004 almost 30 million US gallons (110,000 m³) of commercially produced biodiesel were sold in the U.S., up from less than 0.1 million US gallons (380 m³) in 1998. Projections for 2005 were 75 million gallons produced from 45 factories and 150 million gallons (570 million liters).<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0718/p01s04-ussc.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0718/p01s04-ussc.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> Due to increasing pollution control requirements and tax relief, the U.S. market is expected to grow to 1 or 2 billion US gallons (4,000,000 to 8,000,000 m³) by 2010. The price of biodiesel in the United States has come down from an average $3.50 per US gallon ($0.92/l) in 1997 to $1.85 per US gallon ($0.49/l) in 2002. This appears economically viable with current petrodiesel prices, which as of 09/19/05 varied from $2.648 to $3.06.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/o/y/Soybean.html" title="Soybean">Soybeans</a> are not a very efficient crop solely for the production of biodiesel, but their common use in the United States for food products has led to soybean biodiesel becoming the primary source for biodiesel in that country.
