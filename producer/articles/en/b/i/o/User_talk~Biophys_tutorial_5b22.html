<p>Introduction should mention that it is <i>alleged</i> and not an undisputable fact. It is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>, but those sources, as far as I can see, do not conclusively prove it. It is notable for being an <i>idea</i> which has been written about and is part of Russia's political landscape, but it shouldn't be presented as a fact.</p>
<p>Just giving you some suggestions to make this article more likely to be supported (seeing as you're walking on <i>very</i> thin ice and have many enemies, and seem likely to lose the deletion review vote). <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 08:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to the sources, this is a Russian phenomenon, it should be noted in the lead. Also, 'Internet brigades' seems like another invented name - unless it is used by most sources, I recommend 'online disinformation by Russian intelligence' or something like this.

<dd>An important objection raised by people in the deletion review is that it's too Russia-focused. How about splitting it into several sections, one for Russia, another for China, another for whatever other country does something similar? <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 23:21, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you both! You or anyone else are welcome to edit and improve this article. I have to think about the title. The title proposed by Piotrus (may be Active measures online?) assume a slightly different and a wider subject, which could be also just fine. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 20:17, 1 April 2007 (UTC) OK, let us keep this version as it was edited by Esn. But I will also try to prepare a different version as proposed by Piotr - in a separate project page.

<p>Too many things are sourced from the "eye for an eye" link, which has two strikes against it: it is Russian (English sources are preffered unless no English source can be found to replace what is referenced by the Russian one) and it is a collection of articles more than a single article. Statements should referenced by specific sections or, prefferably, by an English source. Particularly problematic is that this Russian-language source is the <i>first one cited</i>. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 03:46, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The term "internet brigades" is problematic because no news organization has used it (not as far as I can see, anyway). As such, it is a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> (see: <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms</a>). Perhaps a better title would be "State-sponsored online information warfare". <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 04:02, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The only English article that's put a name to them is the "Guardian" China one, which called them "secret internet police", so perhaps that would be a better title. It depends on if we want the article to be about that particular group of people or about "State-sponsored online information warfare" (which may take other forms). I'm changing it to "secret internet police" for now. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 04:07, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this second version is not good for the following reasons. <b>First</b>, we have aready <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_warfare.html" title="Information warfare">Information warfare</a> article. This warfare is almost always "state-sponsored". So the only new thing is "online". But computers and online communication are always a part of modern <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_warfare.html" title="Information warfare">Information warfare</a>. This subject simply does not stand as an independent article. <b>Second</b>, this subject is too broad (it would then include online propaganda against Poland, Baltic states, Georgia, and USA in internet newspapers controlled or owned by Gazprom or Russian government; online defamation campaings against opposition journalists, writers, and politicians, such as <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victor_Suvorov_c686.html" title="Victor Suvorov">Victor Suvorov</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Politkovskaya_ee36.html" title="Anna Politkovskaya">Anna Politkovskaya</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/v/Yevgenia_Albats_183a.html" title="Yevgenia Albats">Yevgenia Albats</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Litvinenko_be48.html" title="Alexander Litvinenko">Alexander Litvinenko</a>, <a href="../../../a/k/h/Akhmed_Zakayev_6baf.html" title="Akhmed Zakayev">Akhmed Zakayev</a>, or <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Berezovsky_b4d4.html" title="Boris Berezovsky">Boris Berezovsky</a>, and <i>information war with Chechen separatists</i>); I only wanted to tell about "web brigades" as in Russian wikipedia article. <b>Third</b>, the psychological operations by a secret police teams against civilians can hardly be classified as "warfare". <b>Finally</b>, "State-sponsored online information warfare" (e.g. against Chechen separatists) is conducted openly and by many professional journalists who work for Russian government, not by secret agents. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 03:20, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Still, I am probably wrong. In order to survive this article must be more general, either as you suggested or as suggested by Piotr. I will work with it, but some outside help is probably needed. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 04:22, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well's there's always a fuzzy grey area around any article topic. Your main challenge now is to choose a fuzzy grey area which is narrow enough to allow adequate space for your original topic, but is broad enough to be a legitimate article even if the Russian section is deemed controversial. In other words, even if the FSB section is drastically cut until the debate over it can be sorted out (which will probably take longer than anyone would like it to), it shouldn't invalidate the entire article. A five-day AFD simply isn't enough time to evaluate that section. Your main goal should probably be to create an article topic into which the FSB section can be comfortably nested, while not being its centrepiece - and at the same time, to not make it so broad that the FSB section will be seen as taking up too much space percentage-wise. <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 05:33, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are quite a few uses of "alleged" slipping into the Chinese section. As I see it, the main problem is that it's based on only one article. It's a <i>notable</i> article, but the section is still basically just paraphrasing a single article. If we can find some more articles, then we can start attributing different arguments to different articles and do away with all these uses of "alleged". <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 05:33, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is interesting that editing style of Wen Hsing is very similar to that of Vlad Fedorov. He also adds "alleged" to every sentence several times, which makes articles not readable. We can bring more references about China. But everything depends on scope of the article. Is it narrow (merely "internet squads") or much wider (online disinformation, active measures online, online "warfare")?<a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiophys_7fdc.html" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> 15:39, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
