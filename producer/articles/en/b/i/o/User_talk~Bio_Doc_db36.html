<dd>OK, fine.

<p>No, it's not a content dispute. It has to do with the fact that he has a God complex about certain aspects of science, and cannot seem to tolerate open discussion.

I am utterly failing to understand the amount of time you're devoting to this. Why not go do some Parkinson's Disease research, maybe get an article published somewhere.

So, let's see if I have this right: "I have written over twenty volumes on medical biochemistry." Wow! Volumes, like books? So, how many pages per volume? And can I buy them at a medical publisher or Amazon? - "All of it has already been arranged for international publication." Oh. Arranged for publication. So, ummm, it hasn't quite been published yet? Did you at least get an advance? And what else have you done? "What I have otherwise written has already been translated in to seven languages and has been published in over 150 countries." I wonder what otherwise written means. But it has been published, and translated, no less. I'm curious about those works. Could you share what they are? After all, you've hunted down the works of those of us who have published. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfsnow_eafc.html" title="User:Profsnow">Dan</a> 19:56, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>I haven't hunted down, and couldn't care what anyone else here has published. How could some trivial paper that nobody ever reads compare with a contractual commitment for the worldwide publication of twenty volumes&#160;?And yes, volume means one of a series of books. You might find having a dictionary useful. What's the point in giving you details of other translated publications. Can you speak German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Swedish&#160;? You're still desperately looking for something to find fault about, but just end up looking a fool whenever you find out the facts. Jealousy's a terrible thing.</b> --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneral_Tojo_7_c52e.html" title="User:General Tojo 7">General Tojo 7</a> 21:31, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I guess the point is credibility. You make prolific extravagant claims about your accomplishments, but never once has it been anything that could be proven - all we have is your word. And the constant evasions, everywhere you've posted and every time you're questioned, accompanied by attacking the questioner, brings your credibility into serious doubt. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfsnow_eafc.html" title="User:Profsnow">Dan</a> 16:10, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>You make the illogical mistake, as most people do of finding out somebody's credentials in order to decide if they are right or not. I judge everything on its merits. I have met supposed world experts in Parkinson's Disease. I have no regard for reputations. I instead easily slaughtered them scientifically because they had obviously never studied biochemistry in their life. There is nobody alive that has a better scientific knowledge of Parkinson's Disease than I do. However, I don't care if the contributors to the PD page are Professors of Neurology or total beginners. I judge them on what they write concerning the issue. I don't evade anything. My attacks on questioners are due to the fact that they have lied about me, censored, deleted and constantly reverted. I'll take anyone on solely scientifically but there is nobody here that can handle me. So instead they try, and totally fail to shut me up, in order to try to make their naive views prevail.</b> --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneral_Tojo_12_ed8f.html" title="User:General Tojo 12">General Tojo 12</a> 17:41, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
