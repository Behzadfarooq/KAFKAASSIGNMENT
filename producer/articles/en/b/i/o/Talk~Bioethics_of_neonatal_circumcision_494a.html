<p>Forgive me if this is already covered but is it considered NPOV for an encyclopia article to include a conclusion?

<dl>
<dd>I don't know about its being NPOV, but having a conclusion smacks of original research. An essay has a conclusion to sum up the points the author was trying to make. An encyclopdia article should be a summary of the conclusions that original researchers have already come to in their published work. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 05:39, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Robert Blair, what on earth were you thinking when you made this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bioethics_of_neonatal_circumcision&amp;curid=1210949&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bioethics_of_neonatal_circumcision&amp;curid=1210949&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=0" rel="nofollow">edit</a>? Are you aware that Wikipedia has an NPOV (neutral point of view) policy? I've made necessary changes to bring it some way towards neutrality. I've removed Van Howe (since it is flawed and far from definitive), and instead have noted the controversy and linked to medical analysis of circumcision. This improves the article because readers now have access to <b>all</b> the information, rather than just Van Howe's tripe. I've also removed the sentence about physician's refusal because it is covered elsewhere in the article. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 15:31, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Robert Blair, why did you revert my edit to the human rights paragraph? I carefully read the links and edited that section for factual accuracy.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is nothing in Smith's article to suggest that The Netherlands Institute of Human Rights shares Smith's belief's - it's not a formal statement on her employer's behalf. It should say that it is her opinion.</li>
<li>Again, Gulbrandsen does not appear to speak for Norwegian Council for Medical Ethics. It's just a letter in a journal, and an individual's interpretation. The paper discusses ritual circumcision only (which should be mentioned explicitly), and doesn't seem to discuss human rights - only ethics.</li>
<li>Lastly, why did you remove the explanation of the purpose of Attorneys for the Rights of the Child? (", which campaigns against circumcision,"? It's perfectly true, and informative.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've reverted your revert. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 00:21, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jakew, your sentence reads <i>One author's interpretation of a statement by the</i> Norwegian Council for Medical Ethics <i>claims that the Council has determined that ritual child circumcision violates important principles of medical ethics.</i> This seems to be redundantly qualified. (interpretation...claims that) Please correct. And I invoke your "principle of one". "One author" should be "An author", so as not to suggest others in the Council state the opposite. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 01:28, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>The Norwegian report is simply reporting the action of a professional body - The Norwegian Council for Medical Ethics. it is not a letter. There is no controversy about it. All of this qualification is unnecessary and inappropriate. - Robert Blair (sig added by Jakew)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is most certainly a letter, by a single author. Your change is bad, but I cannot currently undo it due to the 3RR. I have made some NPOV changes to the article (please stop this POV pushing. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>). - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 02:20, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
It is not a letter. It simply is a report by a reporter of an event. It should be no more controversial than a report of a traffic accident. It was published in a Norwegian medical journal. My change is correct.</p>
<p>Also, there is no controversy about the foreskin being protective. It protects against meatitis, meatal ulceration, and meatal stenosis. This is well documented in the literature. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Blair_1706.html" title="User:Robert Blair">Robert Blair</a> 03:24, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Incorrect. It appears to be a letter, by a Pal Gulbrandsen.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, there is indeed controversy about the foreskin being protective. While it is true that some authors claim protection against the meatal problems you mention, <i>it is impossible to <b>diagnose</b> these problems in an uncircumcised child.</i> That is to say: there is no way of knowing whether uncircumcised children have fewer problems or not - they just can't be recognised and treated. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 03:29, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Seems that the pro-mutilation side (even if correct) isn't actually <b>diagnosing</b> higher rates of HIV in the intact men in the US. They are projecting it, even before we are born. If your side can claim broad magical powers of the mutilated penis, why does this not hold when the protection is based on having the whole organ? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 14:51, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is not a letter. Gulbrandsen is a reporter, reporting the news. He does not represent the Norwegian Council on Medical Ethics. This is a news report.</p>
<p>I have revised the text to eliminate the controversy and therefore, I have removed the disputed tags because they are no longer necessary.</p>

<dd>It quite clearly is a letter. What possible reason do you have for believing otherwise?</dd>
<dd>I have removed your hopeless POV pushing, and restored the disputed tags. It is considered very bad form to remove a disputed tag before a dispute has been cleared up - please do not do so again. I reverted rather than editing, because you completely reverted my hard work in NPOVing your previous edit. You're obviously just going to replace my carefully NPOVed text with POV rubbish, so there appears little point in trying. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 22:29, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A google search of the website produces 555 articles by Pal Gulbrandsen. Clearly, he is a staffer/reporter for the journal, not a contributing letter writer.</li>

<li>Jacqueline Smith is/was on the staff the Netherlands Institute of Human Rights. Her paper was published in a book produced by the Institute. The book is named <i>To Baehr in Our Minds: Essays in Human Rights from the Heart of the Netherlands</i>. If the Institute did not accept her conclusions, it would not have published the paper.</li>

<p>I've made a number of changes to the article. Some comments are in the text, but to summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction: tried to streamline it and ensure that it is NPOV. It's ok to summarise different views here, but we shouldn't make a case either way, or even present all the evidence. An introduction ought to be concise.</li>
<li>Added comment about AAP Bioethics approval of AAP statement.</li>
<li>Removed cite of Hill on "parent-centered" view. We should not cite an opponent of that view when describing a view. This is like citing a Creationist group when giving a description of evolution.</li>
<li>Changed links to original sources, where available.</li>

The use of Moses et al. (1998) to refute sexual evidence is inappropriate since this article was published prior to the publication of many recent articles on sexual effects.</p>

<dd>It is entirely relevant, as a discussion of the evidence in 1998. Some studies have been published since that time, but none have investigated the question of the alleged sexual nature of the ridged band. I have restored it, added a caveat about Denniston's claim (articles in a non-peer-reviewed journal are less credible), and added other studies. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 19:29, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>DanP, would you explain why you feel the article benefits by including views on medical benefits rather than ethics? - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 00:14, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You raise a good point. I took my quote entirely out-of-context, and I can see where it could be interpreted as medical. In the paragraph I meant to quote more appropriately, at issue was the notion that the child-centered-view is not served by the medical debate. There is a lot of overlap, I suppose.

<dd>It is a cheap shot and off-topic. Plus there is an indirect reference to <i>Flesh and Blood: Perspectives on the Problem of Circumcision in Contemporary Society</i>, which presumably is the source for the data (I haven't read it). We should say what an article says, not what it doesn't say. If not, this would open up a new avenue of Wikipedia bias, as we ought to add disclaimer to every instance where an article isn't peer-reviewed.

<p>Jakew, you need to state a reason for a revert, such as factually inaccurate material. Knee-jerk type shout of POV pushing are not satisfactory. "I don't like it" is not sufficient. You have not provided justification for your revert and I have undone it.</p>

<dd>Robert, I've tried time and time again to get you to read Wiki's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> policy, but you continue to make such POV edits. Not only this, but when I try to work with you, editing for NPOV, you just replace it with your own version without comment. You ignore objections on talk pages. You remove disputed notices in spite of the fact that it is perfectly obvious from the edit history that there is an ongoing dispute. Needless to say, I'm running out of patience with you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here is an explanation:
<ul>
<li>You replace a carefully balanced description of studies claiming both benefits and harms of circumcision to two literature "surveys" (both by Fleiss) that claim protective roles of the foreskin. Where is the balance? Where is the comment about surveys highlighting increased risks caused by the presence of the foreskin?</li>
<li>You replace the "alternative view" to Povenmire (re the AAP Bioethics approval of the AAP policy) with a rather irrelevant statement about the AAP.</li>
<li>You insert the following statement which is a) not correct English, and b) unsupported. "however, are limited to the granting of permission for diagnosis and treatment of disease,<a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/AAP/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/AAP/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> but non-therapeutic circumcision is neither."</li>
<li>You include the comment about AAP "although it appears to be in conflict with their previous declarations." - this is incredibly POV. If you had said "though some argue that is it in conflict..." it might be better. But as it is, you're just pushing your POV.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So let's summarise: you've replaced balanced, NPOV discussion with one-sided "studies" by anti-circ activists that support your POV. You've replaced disagreement with your fellow activists with vague and irrelevant statements. You've included unsupported (and non-English) statements. And you've pushed your POV when discussing those who disagree with you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>POV pushing that deserved to be reverted, and was. If you'd like to propose future changes first on the talk page, I'm happy to help you try to ensure that they are NPOV. But this sort of thing is riduculous. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 14:01, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Jake, the article has been revised to meet your stated objections. The literature surveys, one by Fleiss and one by Cold, provide information on the functions of the foreskin. This is essential background to any ethical discussion. They do not address whether any particular foreskin should be excised. Information on that is provided by links to other articles as you suggested.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Blair_1706.html" title="User:Robert Blair">Robert Blair</a> 17:41, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, if you insist, we'll keep Fleiss and Cold (although I have to say because both are written by NOCIRC activists who have been known to be less than scrupulous with the truth somewhat lessens their credibility), but we'll include Moses et al and Schoen in order to balance things.</dd>
<dd>"Non-therapeutic circumcision of children is a preventable injury." is a POV statement. Injury<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=injury" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=injury" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Damage or harm done to or suffered by a person or thing</li>
<li>A particular form of hurt, damage, or loss</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So clearly if one sees circumcision as harmful, one thinks it an injury. If, however, one regards it as an improvement, it is not. Hence it is POV. I've restored the original phrasing.</dd>
<dd>I've removed subheadings for views as their description is inherently POV.</dd>
<dd>I've removed "however, are limited to the..." as it is still not a complete sentence.</dd>

<p>Jakew: you are trying to counterbalance information on loss of function with claimed medical benefits. This is unacceptable. You must counterbalance loss of function with articles that claim no loss of function if you can find them.</p>
<p>It is not appropriate to introduce alleged medical benefits into this article because they are discussed in the medical analysis article. The alternative is to introduce articles showing a net harm caused by circumcision.</p>

<dd>Robert, you've already introduced "loss" of function - hence implying a disadvantage of circumcision. The obvious balance for this is articles showing benefits.</dd>
<dd>Since you feel it is not appropriate to introduce benefits, I'm sure you'll feel that it is equally inappropriate to introduce harms. Hence, I've removed the studies you cite.</dd>
<dd>Above, you'll find discussion of Fleiss and Cold, and why I chose to include a balance. Medical benefits are clearly relevant to ethics, but as I say, we can remove both. However, including your papers but no balance is simply POV pushing, and is not an option.</dd>
<dd>Saying "without medical indication" is redundant, as I've commented in the text.</dd>
<dd>I've commented out "to grow and develop free from preventable illness or injury", since without the comment that anti-circ activists consider circumcision to be an injury, it is irrelevant and out of place.</dd>
<dd>I've also tidied up the quotes.</dd>
<dd>Otherwise, I've no other major objections to your edits. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 13:03, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jake:</p>
<p>When you use a heading like "Mainstream view", you indicate that that view is more favoured than the others and the other views are fringe views. That is not accurate because some very responsible people and organizations are taking up something other than what you call the mainstream view. Such POV pushing is completely unacceptable under WikiPolicy.</p>

<dd>Ok, I see what you mean. Equally, "traditional parent-centered" and "child-centered" are unacceptable, since they imply that one is centered on the child's best interests, and the other is not (in truth, both are based on different interpretations of "best interests"). I'm removing the headings altogether until we can agree on headings that we're both ok with. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 18:24, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
The article needs headings to make it readable.</p>
<p>Parent-centered simple indicates that the parents' feelings are put first.</p>
<p>Child-centered means that the child's best interests are put first.</p>
<p>They are descriptive, not POV pushing.</p>
<p>If you don't like that please suggest some other neutral descriptive heading.</p>

<dd>Robert, temporarily removing headings so that we can find some we both agree on is hardly POV pushing. Please try to keep your edit summaries realistic.</dd>
<dd>Yes, I agree that headings will improve the article, but not if they're misleading or POV.</dd>
<dd>The problem lies in the fact that <i>every</i> point of view on the subject puts the child's best interests first. I challenge you to find me a parent who doesn't act in what <i>they perceive</i> to be in their child's best interests.</dd>
<dd>The difference between the positions is that what you call the "child-centered" view assumes that non-circumcision is always in the best interests of the child. In other words, it takes best interests out of the hands of those close to the child - parents, medical professionals, and so on, and assumes that the only one competent to make that judgement is the ethicist proposing the view. Maybe we should talk about "Parent-incompetent" and "Parent-competent" views. - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 12:20, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Infant circumcision is ethical, provided the patient chooses it</li>

<p>I don't see anything incoherent about this. Essentially, it's a statement to the effect that someone should be able to choose to have a circumcision, but that this choice should not be made for them in their infancy by their guardians.

<dd>Actually it isn't. The Eskimo have their own language. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people don't speak it. That issue is entirely separate, and is really irrelevant. I'm fairly certain that infants can't consent to a medical procedure. Anyone without language skills doesn't have the same cognitive ability that someone with language possesses. It's not that these infants can't speak English, or can't write in French, but rather that they have no concept of language. Without that, they have no ability to comprehend the world in a way that would allow them to consent to a medical procedure. . . .wow. that was long&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike.lifeguard_8da6.html" title="User:Mike.lifeguard">Mike.lifeguard</a> 15:18, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anti-circumcision activists claim that the foreskin is an important erogenous zone and that its loss results in decreased sensation and plesasure. This can explain the decreased HIV infection rate: If a man's pleasure is decreased, he will find sex less pleasurable. Finding sex less pleasurable, he will be less diven to have sex as often. Having sex less often, he is less likely to have unprotected sex with an infected partner. If the rate of unprotected sex with infected partners decreases, so too will the incidence of HIV infection.

<p>This is in regards to the recently added powerpoint link; on slide 36, there are no units so I am unsure, but it appears that this study shows that male circumcision seems to increse a womans risk of contracting HIV.

<dd>Merge it into <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">circumcision</a>? No. Circumcision is already a juggernaught, it needs to be broken into more subpages itself. Merging this page before that point would be counterproductive. I can't imagine that we can't find enough sources for a good article: we should find sources to back up the currently unsourced claims and delete any claims that can't be sourced.<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherk_821b.html" title="User:Christopherk">Christopher</a> 12:50, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"we should find sources to back up the currently unsourced claims" - with respect, I think that's a mistake. That's how opinion pieces are written, with the framework existing first, and the sources slotted into the holes. To achieve a balanced, thorough article we need to use an approach more like a systematic review, carefully identifying every relevant article, then building the article's structure from the sources. Harder work, I must admit, but I think that it's essential with controversial subjects.</dd>
<dd>I take your point regarding merging, though. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 13:01, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find it easier to add references than to rewrite an article. If sources can't be easily found, then the claim has to go, but we should at least make an effort to provide sources before we delete.<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherk_821b.html" title="User:Christopherk">Christopher</a> 20:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, I don't think it's essential that we're in complete agreement on this, since we clearly agree on the immediately pressing task: identifying sources.
