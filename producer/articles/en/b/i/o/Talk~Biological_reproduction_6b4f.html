<dd>The strong association between sexual systems and reproduction leads to a biased (at the least) view of sexuality as part of reproduction. Thanks for pointing this out. Actually it is perfectly legitimate to view the sexual processes as separate from the reproduction.

<p>I disagree with the recent edit to remove the statement that sexual reproduction has the advantage of being able to mask "bad" genes. While not all dominant genes are good and not all recessive ones are bad, it is certainly the case that species survive better because they can mask those bad genes that are recessive. Perhaps I worded it poorly, but I think it is a sentiment that needs to be included. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesmusik_3e65.html" title="User:Jamesmusik">Jamesmusik</a> 17:45, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Species survive better because good traits get selected for, not because they mask bad genes. With sexual reproduction, every generation the offspring are slightly different from each other. The ones with good (or "better") genes end up having more offspring themselves. That's how alleles get selected for. It is not the case that species survive better <b>just because</b> good dominant genes mask bad recessive ones. As you said, not all dominant genes are good and not all recessive ones are bad. It's just how the genes work in their environment. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 01:22, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not saying that it's <b>just because</b> good dominant genes mask bad recessive ones that species survive better. It is, however, undeniable that more individuals of species survive when disadvantageous traits are masked by more advantageous ones. For instance, the incidences of <a href="../../../c/y/s/Cystic_fibrosis.html" title="Cystic fibrosis">cystic fibrosis</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_muscular_atrophy.html" title="Spinal muscular atrophy">spinal muscular atrophy</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phenylketonuria.html" title="Phenylketonuria">phenylketonuria</a> are <b>much</b> lower than they would be otherwise, simply because the alleles that cause them are recessive. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesmusik_3e65.html" title="User:Jamesmusik">Jamesmusik</a> 07:36, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not saying that you're saying that it's "only because". I am saying that genes will get selected for based on their ability to help the species cope with its environment. Even apparently "bad" recessive genes stick around sometimes because they might have some unforseen good values too. That's another of the strenghts of sexual reproduction - keeping a larger variety of genes in the pool alive. For the sake of the argument, your statement "It is, however, undeniable that more individuals of species survive when disadvantageous traits are masked by more advantageous ones", is sadly wrong. Now, I personally don't know any competitive advantage to having the <a href="../../../c/y/s/Cystic_fibrosis.html" title="Cystic fibrosis">cystic fibrosis</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_muscular_atrophy.html" title="Spinal muscular atrophy">spinal muscular atrophy</a> genes but I do know that there are many recessive genes for <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemoglobinopathy.html" title="Hemoglobinopathy">hemoglobinopathies</a> such as <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thalassemia.html" title="Thalassemia">thalassemia</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sickle_cell_anemia.html" title="Sickle cell anemia">sickle cell anemia</a> and so on where the "defective" bad genes used to make a big difference in survival because individuals who had those genes were resistant to <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a>. It was the case that malaria was so widespread in the world (and still is, to some extent) that having these bad, recessive genes gave you a survival advantage. Now that we have good treatments for malaria, those genes just seem bad to most people. Similarly there might be some situation where there is a competitive advantage to having the CF gene but just because I can't think of one does not mean that there isn't one. So there are some environments where some genes are good and others where these genes are not. More members of the species survive when their gene mix is suited to the environment, not because they have more advantageous dominant genes masking bad ones. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 11:32, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here are two articles that argue directly that the masking of deleterious alelles is the direct reason for the existence of diploidy: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=2034274&amp;dopt=Abstract|Perrot" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=2034274&amp;dopt=Abstract|Perrot" rel="nofollow">V, Richerd S, Valero M.

<dd>Yes, the existence of diploidy may initially have came about as a way to mask deleterious mutations. Any deleterious mutations that turned out to be dominant would be strongly selected against and recessive ones would be masked to some degree. However, my point is that the real strength of sexual reproduction is the recombination of genes every generation. As each offspring is different genetically (though related) from each other, those who genes expressed some combination which was more favourable ended up having more offspring themselves. I will go back to the sickle cell mutation example - if a set of parents had a new mutation that caused sickle cells today, it probably would be selected against over many generations as the resulting anemia would give those who inherited it a disadvantage. However, put the same parents in tropical Africa a thousand years ago where malaria was endemic and a large proportion of the population would be expected to be infected over their lifetime and instead there would be strong selection pressure to keep the gene, despite the resulting anemia. Random mutations are deleterious or advantageous although I agree most would be deleterious. <b>Sexual reproduction leads to stronger selection for good mutations, selection against deleterious mutations and therefore quicker evolution.</b> It's not the masking of bad mutations, that's a side point. It's about selecting against them. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.tan_6c56.html" title="User:Alex.tan">Alex.tan</a> 01:52, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You seem to be missing my point entirely. I'm not saying that masking deleterious genes is more important than or has contributed more to selection than the free and quick exchange of DNA in sexual reproduction, but that it is an advantage, nonetheless, to be able to mask deleterious genes, a point clearly made by both of those articles above. In particular, Otto and Goldstein put forth and substantially prove the "masking hypothesis" that masking is so advantageous that it leads to diploidy in the presence of free recombination. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesmusik_3e65.html" title="User:Jamesmusik">Jamesmusik</a> 01:59, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please stop changing the "Life without reproduction" text. The concept you are apparently promoting is based on a lack of understasnding about the subject. The concept borders on nonsense and probably the subsection should be deleted alltogether. However, as you added it to make a point (although it is not clear what that might be), it has been retained; but it cannot be left in the form as originally written. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 06:57, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, abiogenisis; but it is not some kind of "exception" to species reproduction. And "sports" is a prefectly legit word in botany/horticulture that describes mutations that arise spontaneously. Possibly the sentence you are objecting to could be written better, but it certainly does make sense. It is <u>species populations</u> that evolve, so the idea that there is some individual organism that becomes the "founder" of a new species (e.g,, all humans came ultimately from the one and the same single individual mother) is a misconception. Therefore, anything that implies there was one individual that is the start of all complex life on earth shows a misunderstanding of the processes of evolution and reproduction. But I think the way you have it described now, removes the objections I had, with the possible exception of the singular "ancestor" - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 04:40, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, evolution is typically defined as change in allele frequency in a gene pool over time, the phrase "species populations" is a bit unusual, but I know what you mean. It's a different question from whether there is a single individual which is the ancestor to all living things, or a single living ancestor to all humans. That the species <i>Homo sapiens</i> does not have a single original individual who was dichotomously not the same species as his/her parents is different from saying that there is no <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitochondrial_Eve_90ed.html" title="Mitochondrial Eve">Mitochondrial Eve</a>. I realize you're not making claims about the latter, but and only talking about the former. However, I'm not sure that abiogenesis producing a <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetative_reproduction.html" title="Vegetative reproduction">vegetatively reproducing</a> individual isn't a case where it is reasonable to assume a single founder. Speciation is a bit different from abiogenesis, they are two different things.

<p>Parentheses are a legitimate punctuation. I do not understand why you think they should be removed from writing. Also, some of your other changes completely destroy the flow of the sentences. It is possible to simply use shorter sentences, although that may or may not improveme understanding. Nonetheless, certain words (such as "that") are helpful to establish relationships between different parts of a sentence. While I agree, there are many ways to say the same thing, on the whole your changes have not been an improvement on the English. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 17:27, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Been so long I hardly recall what the "dispute" was about. BTW, those are parentheses not "brackets". And, in a very real sense, parentheses are a form of mixing footnotes into text. Many ideas are important to the presentation in a written passage, but some may seem (to the author) somewhat peripheral to the main flow of thought or main point. Footnotes are a valid way of handling such "parallel" contributing ideas. But Wikipedia is not really set up to use footnotes in that manner (can be done, but is better suited to printed media). Parenthesis are another option. Thoughts in parentheses are meant to be taken as "extra" information, important, but outside the main thrust of the sentence. THe informatio is frequently a clarification of the word or thought preceeding. Note use of parantheses in this paragraph; the sentence could stand alone, but some readers will ask "why do you say Wikipedia is not set up..." The related ideas could be separated by a semi-colon or even a printer's m. Parentheses are just one option for a writer to order the thoughts being conveted. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 19:11, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>I apologize for the poor phrasing of my edit, but I do have some concerns with the accuracy of the current sexual reproduction section. It says that all species "have two different adult sexes". But earthworms, for example, are all hermaphroditic. Plant species also commonly produce both male (pollen) and female gametes in the same plant. These organisms do not have two different adult sexes. Also, from "Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation" by evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson, there are a few rare species (including slime moulds) that have many sexes, not just two. Again, these species do not have two different adult sexes.<a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> 19:21, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When people talk about Sexual reproduction they mostly mean Gender reproduction (ie Male/Female). But there is another class of reproduction Hermaphroditic reproduction which both partners have male &amp; female reproductive organs. I believe that these pages should be created talking about the specifics of their reproduction techniques. Also the stub Evolution of Genders which is a related topic needs some help. I hope that I'm not straying too far from the topic by asking for assistance.

<dd>This article (and the one at <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_reproduction.html" title="Sexual reproduction">Sexual reproduction</a>) suffers from a confusion of concepts between sex cells (gametes) and the organisms that produce the sex cells. The correct sense here should follow consistently through the text (or certainly within a paragraph), and I think it is about the organisms involved, not the gametes.

<dd>They're not particularly confusable concepts. I don't think there's a serious need to consistentify articles.

As for <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_reproduction.html" title="Sexual reproduction">Sexual reproduction</a> I'd say it's got more serious problems (It would be nice to see less of a taxonomic focus, some discussion of fun sex things like meiotic drive (oof! there's no <a href="../../../m/e/i/Meiotic_drive.html" title="Meiotic drive">meiotic drive</a> article?!), and maybe a nice clear discussion of the difference between sexual reproduction and conjugation). <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 04:16, 5 January 2006 (UTC)
