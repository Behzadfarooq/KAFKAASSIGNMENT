	    <p>A <b>biosecurity</b> guarantee attempts to ensure that ecologies sustaining either people or animals are maintained.

<p>Differing concepts of biosecurity are evolving in many professions. So far the field has focused on attempts to establish uniform standards of risk referencing - <i>see</i> the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodiversity.html" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a> debate and health security. Nevertheless, many professional groups believe that their internal <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_ethics.html" title="Professional ethics">professional ethics</a> and professional standards are sufficient to contain all relevant risks (which may be medical, agricultural and so on).</p>
<p>This fact emphasises the difficulty in agreeing common standards - definitions and requirements depend on, among other things, national, ecological, military, diplomatic and professional concerns. Consensus holds that biosecurity is a government responsibility, but beyond that, mandates of various government agencies include:</p>
<p><i>the development of guidelines on equitable and fair access and benefit-sharing of genetic resources, the ethical implications of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biotechnology.html" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, international governance of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biotechnology.html" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosafety.html" title="Biosafety">biosafety</a>, including rule making under the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Organization_3f67.html" title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a> and other regimes</i></p>
<p>In 2006, the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/futures" class="external text" title="http://www.oecd.org/futures" rel="nofollow">International Futures Program</a> of the <a href="../../../o/e/c/OECD_bdbe.html" title="OECD">OECD</a> launched the <a href="http://www.biosecuritycodes.org" class="external text" title="http://www.biosecuritycodes.org" rel="nofollow">biosecuritycodes.org</a> website. This site, available in English, French and a limited Japanese version, is dedicated to providing an active resource of global information on oversight mechanisms - particularly codes-of-conduct for the biosciences research community – to help advance these efforts and promote responsible oversight of the biosciences. The site contains key information, categorized geographically, on governmental, institutional, academic, and private sector biosecurity actors along with worldwide biosecurity legislation, events, terminology, and background materials.</p>
<p>A sampling of current (2002) national and professional mandates include commitments of</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.maf.govt.nz/biosecurity/" class="external text" title="http://www.maf.govt.nz/biosecurity/" rel="nofollow">NZ agriculture and forestry</a> "to protect New Zealand's unique biodiversity and facilitate exports by managing risks to plant and animal health and animal welfare" as one of several agencies in the Biocouncil "managing exotic pests (or recent incursions)". Critics, including the <a href="http://www.greens.org.nz/docs/category.asp?cat=68" class="external text" title="http://www.greens.org.nz/docs/category.asp?cat=68" rel="nofollow">NZ Greens</a>, argue that these measures are insufficient to protect even against normal crop risks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.biosecuritycenter.org/nbrctoc.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.biosecuritycenter.org/nbrctoc.htm" rel="nofollow">USDA and pork producers</a> to protect food "animal health" via "cleansing and disinfecting", "personal protective equipment", "carcass disposal", "nutrient management" and monitoring of "reportable diseases". Medical emergency response measures, especially in the military, emphasize the same concerns - but with respect to humans.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.asa-cssa-sssa.org/biosecurity.html" class="external text" title="http://www.asa-cssa-sssa.org/biosecurity.html" rel="nofollow">US scientific societies</a> to redefine biosecurity largely in terms of "countering terrorism", and not in terms of addressing unintentional man-made threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, no single set of guarantees can be said to represent biosecurity - just as no such set of guarantees clearly characterizes <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_security.html" title="National security">national security</a> or any other form of security.</p>
<p>Historically, as with other public safety, fairness, and closure concerns, a nation-state attempted to assure biosecurity by <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">tax</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade.html" title="Trade">trade</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tariff.html" title="Tariff">tariff</a> and active <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodefense.html" title="Biodefense">biodefense</a> measures. More recently there has been a trend towards more sustainable measures such as <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safe_trade.html" title="Safe trade">safe trade</a> rules for <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosafety.html" title="Biosafety">biosafety</a>, an example of which is the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosafety_Protocol_70a4.html" title="Biosafety Protocol">Biosafety Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>These are claimed to minimize the exposure of people and natural ecologies to alien organisms via trade or warfare.</p>

<p>The destruction of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Center_57c9.html" title="World Trade Center">World Trade Center</a> in Manhattan on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_Terrorist_Attack_dd31.html" title="September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack">September 11, 2001</a> by terrorists, and subsequent wave of anthrax attacks on U.S. media and government outlets (both real and hoax), led to increased attention on the risk of bioterror attacks in the United States. Proposals for serious structural reforms, national and/or regional border controls, and a single co-ordinated system of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biohazard.html" title="Biohazard">biohazard</a> response abounded.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washtech.com/news/software/12514-1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washtech.com/news/software/12514-1.html" rel="nofollow">US Corporate investment in all forms of physical security</a> <i>has expanded steadily in recent decades on news of hijackings, hostage crises, bombings, office shootings, kidnappings and employee lawsuits.</i> Ira A. Lipman, founder and president of <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guardsmark.html" title="Guardsmark">Guardsmark</a> Inc said: <i>People are very concerned about their security needs and think they're in a war-like environment. People are going to spend the money because they don't want the problem... People are not going to have this kind of loss of life.</i></p>
<p>Some anticipate that this will lead to a much more rigorous biosecurity standards, building on <a href="../../../n/o/r/NORAD_7fc6.html" title="NORAD">NORAD</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/f/NAFTA_941e.html" title="NAFTA">NAFTA</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization_of_American_States_a97a.html" title="Organization of American States">OAS</a>, and an improved <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosafety_protocol.html" title="Biosafety protocol">biosafety protocol</a> as corporations attempt to shift costs to government. Such measures may well prove necessary in the light of the ever-larger number of individuals and organisations with the ability to construct weapons of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_warfare.html" title="Biological warfare">biological warfare</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosafety.html" title="Biosafety">biosafety</a> precautions, biosecurity tends to be active; countermeasures include monitoring statistics for patterns which suggest emerging epidemics, ensuring sufficient stockpiles of the appropriate vaccines or other medicines required to contain an outbreak, public health education and alertness, widespread use of sophisticated pathogen detectors.</p>
<p>Some seek to minimize risk or expenses by political measures such as unified <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeland_defense.html" title="Homeland defense">homeland defense</a> or by extending agricultural isolation zones into <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecoregional_Democracy_fdc7.html" title="Ecoregional Democracy">Bioregional democracies</a> - forcing political borders to conform to natural ecologies - but this may be at odds with traditional national and cultural borders.</p>
<p>So far, such measures have met with little success.</p>
<p>Some say active preventive measures are unlikely to be acceptable to the general population in peacetime. There could be general vaccination against <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_warfare.html" title="Biological warfare">biological warfare</a> agents, but the public is unlikely to accept potentially harmful vaccines for such agents. States do not currently routinely vaccinate against likely biowarfare agents - partly because the risk associated with most vaccinations is greater than the perceived risk from <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_warfare.html" title="Biological warfare">biological warfare</a>.</p>
<p>Others point out that a <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccination.html" title="Vaccination">vaccination</a> program, even if imperfect, could reduce the risk of biological warfare by making the agent addressed less attractive as a weapon, and that in many cases government policy denies the public the choice of being vacccinated.</p>

<p>Currently in North America, three complementary strategies exist:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodefense.html" title="Biodefense">biodefense</a> measures assuming the most threats are local and short-lived.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/Biosafety.html" title="Biosafety">biosafety</a> measures heightening the scrutiny on people or goods at borders, and making pessimistic assumptions as per <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precautionary_principle.html" title="Precautionary principle">precautionary principle</a>.</li>
<li>health security measures ensuring early warning and universal insurance by guaranteeing that the most vulnerable populations are regularly monitored.</li>
