<p>Maybe I'm just nervous about more mini wiki wars, but I'm not entirely sure that it's a good idea to include a lot of content about graduate BME education. In general, graduate education in any field is either about expanding the depth of the undergraduate education (i.e. masters degree) or delving in depth into a very specific area of the field (i.e. doctoral). On the research side of things, a lot (if not most) of major research in BME is done at universities, powered by the tedious labor of slave...errr..."graduate researchers"&#160;:-P. On that note, it's probably not a bad idea to talk about the contributions made to the field by universities, especially at the graduate level, but we should probably steer away from talking about aspects of graduate programs since there is way too much variability and specialization at that level (IMHO). Any thoughts? -<b><a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/q/u/User_talk%7ECquan_6cf6.html" title="User talk:Cquan">talk</a>, <a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_Desk_4424.html" title="User:Cquan/Desk">AMA Desk</a>) 19:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess what I was thinking was discussion of the necessity (or not) of a graduate BME degree for certain jobs. It seems to me that there are more BME grad students than those of other Engineering fields and it may lend itself to be more similar to life science programs in that sometimes an undergrad degree is job limiting. Obviously this is my opinion and has a strong US slant. I do think the article needs a few sentences/paragraph in the article about BME graduate education (even if it is to acknowledge that most universities with undergrad BME also offer MS and PhDs in BME, and maybe some graduate degree statistics). Right now the article reads like BME is only an undergrad degree. Also there are some statistics I was told once about how BME has the most minority and women of all other engineering programs...I can't remember if they were for undergrad/grad, but I'll do some digging. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiomedeng_153e.html" title="User:Biomedeng">Biomedeng</a> 19:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would this not be better as a separate article? I'm also not sure what value it brings - it will go out of date quickly and is not encyclopedic. Comments? Jimmyfixme 18:04, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The field is still relatively new and since there is a section on training, a list of universties is useful since they serve as a good gateway to a lot of information as most of them have more information on their educational programs and research. Listing universities for other fields may not be as useful since who knows how many schools are accredited in say, electrical engineering...a lot. The number for BME is still pretty small, so it's worth listing imho. <a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a> 19:17, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok on that line, listing the "top programs" is an inherently biased thing, especially without citations or reasoning for it (removed). I also go back on what I said about keeping a list...I think it's too tempting for people to mess with and doesn't especially add anything. I left the link to the ABET list and if anyone knows about BME/BE accrediting in other countries, please add a link so the coverage is more representative. Also having a selected list of schools to link to at the end is a bit biased unless every single school is listed, so that's gone. If anyone has a better idea how to handle this, please feel free. Hope this doesn't ruffle too many feathers.<a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a> 22:34, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is in need of a serious overhaul. The intro needs to be shortened significantly to a single overarching paragraph with the details - the bit about universities, the large-ish bit about clinical engineering - and re-worded to sound more professional. There should be more talk about the specifics regarding the different types of bioengineering - biomaterials, biosignals, medical devices, imaging devices, implantable chips. The whole discussion about the FDA could probably be cut down to a single short paragraph. In general, the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_engineering.html" title="Electrical engineering">electrical engineering</a> article, which has been a featured article, is a great template for what this article could be.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the policy is around here for major revisions. I could re-write it, but I'd hate to go through all that work to have someone just revert it. I'm just thinking that making a bunch of small changes won't really cut it here, so we might as well change the whole thing at once. I'll watch this for a few days, and if no one objects, then I'll try to make some large changes. -eykanal, 4/24/06 16:07 EST</p>

<p>The artice has been changed and now seems to cover both Europe and the united states equally, eliminating the u.s bias which was the reason for the template.</p>

<dd>I've added more material all over that (hopefully) expands the world view of the article and hopefully cuts back on any U.S. bias. This was with some difficulty as, being an American, I don't know as much about what BME is like elsewhere and had to rely on google to dig some sources up. If anything, the article may fall under the perview of a developed country-centric view, but I think that may be unavoidable. I'm removing the template for now and we'll see what people think. -<a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a> 01:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I've been looking for a complete list, but cannot find one online (only selected individuals who posted the honor on their sites).

<p>When I majored in biomedical engineering, the curriculum emphasis was more on electrical and electronics aspects. I'm sure it depends on the school and your elective classes. Biomedical engineers are working on research and development of electronic applications such as myo-electric control of limbs, signal processing for imaging applications, biomedical instrumentation for EEG and EMG and cardiac vector imaging, etc. Basically there are two kinds of engineers in the world: mechanical and electrical. Engineers either identify with one or the other: so maybe we could recognize both in the introduction. I'd be glad to help if I may. <a href="../../../m/b/b/User%7EMbbradford_5097.html" title="User:Mbbradford">Mbbradford</a> 08:30, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anything you can do to reduce the bias of the article would, of course, be helpful, however, I think you will find little agreement that there are "two kinds of engineers" or that an appreciable percentage of engineers fall into electrical and mechanical categories. Software engineering, quality engineering, process engineering, industrial engineering, chemical engineering, <i>etc.</i> are all examples of engineering disciplines that fit neither category well. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_K_S_85c9.html" title="User:Robert K S">Robert K S</a> 19:03, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>yeah I think if you go around calling all engineers either mech or electrical, a lot will get mad...I reworded the sentence in question in the article to remove all this engineering variety bias.<a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a> 20:32, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could we discuss how biomedical engineering draws upon the knowledge and expertise of other areas of engineering? I'm in my second year of my combined degree of chemical engineering and biomedical engineering at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_New_South_Wales_02d5.html" title="University of New South Wales">University of New South Wales</a>. At UNSW, biomedical engineering is a postgraduate degree which can be combined with certain undergraduate engineering degrees. The combined biomedical engineering degrees offered are bioinformatics, chemical engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, materials engineering, mechanical engineering, mechatronics engineering, software engineering and telecommunications engineering. When I was trying to decide what field of engineering I was going to combine biomedical engineering with, I spoke with the head of the school. I asked him whether or not some of the combined biomedical engineering degrees were really relevant to the field of biomedical engineering. He said that they would not have developed every combined degree if some of them did not offer students decent career prospects after graduation. Which explains the obvious reason why there isn't a combined civil engineering/biomedical engineering degree! In conclusion, I'd have to say that biomedical engineering is quite a broad field and isn't limited to single fields like electrical engineering and mechanical engineering.<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_James_c7f8.html" title="User:Just James">Just James</a> 04:31, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../b/m/e/BMES_0e01.html" title="BMES">BMES</a> recently published a request for the NRC to consider expanding the taxonomy of BME research doctorate programs <a href="http://bmes.org/pdf/vol30_1.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://bmes.org/pdf/vol30_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (see page 10).

<li>Biomedical devices and instrumentation</li>

<p>I may be beating a dead horse here, but personally I'm getting sick and tired of people insisting on listing "blah school is ranked #1 in blah field by blah", especially since it's usually U.S. News, with which there is more than enough <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_and_university_rankings.html" title="College and university rankings">controversy over the rankings</a> to warrant being weary of including it in a general article that isn't about the particular institution or department. If people have the dire need to fulfill their fame and glory itch with regards to their school, I think they should try doing it with tangible factors that display something substantive, such as research volume, number of citations in papers, etc... Per my being irked by this greatly, I've removed the JHU ranking from the training section, which I would like to remain gone at least until there's more discussion about whether it's worth including. I'm done with my rant...for now. -<a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a> 00:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Cquan that the US News, or other rankings, are not objective enough to include in an encyclopedia articles. If anything they belong on the schools article in a section about how well the school's departments are perceived to be. Is there any official wikipedia guidance on this? Surely this issue has been addressed previously. <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiomedeng_153e.html" title="User:Biomedeng">Biomedeng</a> 00:56, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This topic seems to be absent on other engineering articles, like <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_engineering.html" title="Mechanical engineering">mechanical engineering</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_engineering.html" title="Chemical engineering">chemical engineering</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_engineering.html" title="Electrical engineering">electrical engineering</a>, the last one being a featured article. I think that should be a cue that this topic does not belong on a general article on a field. Also, I've found in some cases, such as the similar section on the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Science_in_Biomedical_Engineering_530e.html" title="Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering">Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering</a> page, the people adding these are usually associated with whatever university they are promoting...which in the BME case is almost always Johns Hopkins. Officially, the only relevant wikipedia guidance is a general caution to avoid: self-promoting, spam/advertising, citing unreliable or highly biased sources, or treading out of neutral point of view. I would very much like to see this page become a featured article some day, but it will not if it looks like a school advertisement. -<a href="../../../c/q/u/User%7ECquan_4312.html" title="User:Cquan">Cquan</a> 01:30, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see any real need for rankings on any engineering article. For one, they change yearly. Second, most engineers know basically what the top schools are.

<dd>I disagree, I did not know about JHU's bme ranking before actually applying, its hard to believe, but ranking is something that is becoming more and more suppressed as lesser schools also call their programs as biomedical engineering, further cheapening the degree--<a href="../../../r/c/s/User%7ERCSIRCSIRCSI_70f6.html" title="User:RCSIRCSIRCSI">RCSIRCSIRCSI</a> 17:27, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am of the opinion that rankings of universities should remain independent of any article outlining a certain field of science. This is something I believe regardless of the truth of the rankings. When someone is interested in educating themselves about a topic, I am fairly ceratin they will not be interested in which school may or may not have the best program. Further, rankings of schools should be listed in a rankings article, not in an arbitrary article about a certain aspect of science. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that this information is out of place in this article despite the truth of the statement. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrey_Knight_1ce_74f8.html" title="User:Grey Knight 1ce">Grey Knight 1ce</a> 18:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your personal belief is what makes you want to put this bit of information in this article in the first place. What I'm trying to say is that our beliefs on this matter are relevent. A consensus has already been reached about whether or not this information is pertinent. That consensus says it is not. You have yet to list reasons why you feel it is pertinent. I'm saying that in an article designed to give a brief summary about a particular field of engineering, it is not important to list which schools have the best rankings. Such information should be put into an article that explains precisely that. The ranking system itself, is also flawed. These rankings are based on universities only in the US which may not be an accurate indicator of which universities are, indeed, the number 1 ranked in this field. The basic message I'm trying to portray here is that your ranking system is based on a sample much too small to have relevence to this article. If you'd like to include the rankings in this article, perhaps include a portion that says "For a current list of Biomedical Engineering rankings for US schools go here" perhaps include it under "External Links" or even "related information" but it does not belong in this article. Despite what you BELIEVE or not. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrey_Knight_1ce_74f8.html" title="User:Grey Knight 1ce">Grey Knight 1ce</a> 18:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another issue is that these rankings are US rankings, but this is meant to be a world-wide encyclopedia. I still oppose the use of these arbitrary rankings because they do not add value to the article on the subject or the article on the bachelors degree and the are simply do not provide objective information (this is coming from someone in one of the top 3 BME departments according to these surveys, so I am not bitter about the survey results). Please if you want some kind of ranking come up with a useful, measurable, objective statistic (most governent research money, largest faculty, highest average standardized test scores, department with the most National Science/Engineering academy members, etc, etc). <a href="../../../b/i/o/User%7EBiomedeng_153e.html" title="User:Biomedeng">Biomedeng</a> 03:23, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
