<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question concerning an image</span></h2>
<p>At the head of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">new anti-Semitism</a> article is an image by Senay Dennis. Nowhere in the article is there text saying who's claiming that the image is anti-Semitic (only linked references to fairly respectable blogs connected to news sources). In this light it is arguable that Wikipedia itself is saying that the image is anti-Semitic (particularly given the image's file name Image:NewASAnti-Semiticposter.jpg). Does <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> policy apply in this type of case? Thanks. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 11:46, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Surely you jest. The image depicts unnamed persons, wearing <a href="../../../y/a/r/Yarmulkes.html" title="Yarmulkes">yarmulkes</a>, with fangs, gloating over a burning planet.

<dd>I'm not arguing one way or the other actually. What I'd like clarification on is whether or not a case such as this would fall under WP:BLP or not?

<p>Netscott was the person who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=71601636&amp;oldid=71547009|insisted" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_anti-Semitism&amp;diff=71601636&amp;oldid=71547009|insisted" rel="nofollow">on labelling the image as "Anti-Semitic"</a>, against the strong objections of other editors.

<dd>Huh? The article doesn't say it's anti-Semitic; you're the one who is insisting it must be labelled that way. Now that you've gotten your way, you're trying to have it deleted for that reason.

<dl>
<dd>As has been explained many times, the image didn't imply anything of the sort; rather, it was an example of different meanings people take from the debate over New anti-Semitism. It could equally well be described as an anti-Zionist image, yet another proof that New anti-Semitism doesn't really exist. You're the one who insisted that it be labelled "anti-Semitic", so you could then get it deleted on those grounds. You've now tried three entirely different grounds on which to get it deleted. That's duplicitous and disruptive. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 00:59, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In fact you are misrepresenting the history of this Jayjg. The issue of BLP did not arise until just in the last day or so when SlimVirgin went ahead and added [the artist's] name to the image. It was only at that point that a very valid concern about Wikipedia publishing libelous content about him became an issue (as it is now). From edit 1 on this issue I have strove to bring the formerly non-descript caption into line relative to neutral point of view (which is what I still am pushing for). Fortunately some progess towards such ends has been achieved but there still is a bit of way to go particularly now with the artist's name associated with his work on Wikipedia. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 01:05, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The only reason we had to find the artist's name was because you were insisting it be deleted otherwise. Now you keep listing the artist's name, and deliberately linking it to anti-Semitism. <b>You</b> are deliberately trolling, and endangering Wikipedia.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Misuse of BLP</span></h3>
<p>I am very concerned about Netscott repeatedly posting the name of the artist and then linking that name to discussions about anti-Semitism — supposedly in order to express BLP concerns but, in so doing, causing BLP problems. He has posted the name so often now, despite being asked not to, that I am convinced he is deliberately trolling in order to cause trouble. There is no benefit to Wikipedia from these repeated posts about this artist. None. Can I ask people to be alert to the possibility that this is trolling, and to remove the artist's name if it is posted gratuitously? Whenever I remove it, he simply posts it again elsewhere. Many thanks, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:10, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I should add that the only reason I added the name to the image page in the first place was because Netscott and Liftarn wanted to have the image deleted on the grounds that we could not claim fair use unless we knew the artist's name. I therefore posted the artist's name to the image page. Netscott has now pounced on this to repeat the name over and over and over on numerous pages, discussing the name in terms of alleged anti-Semitism, and claiming that I am causing BLP problems. It's disgraceful trolling in my view, and there appears to be no end to it. But if I remove the artist's name from the image page, you can be sure that Netscott will revert me. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:15, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have made many edits and reversions to that erticle. Quite frankly, it's starting to look a lot like WP:OWN. I would suggest you take a break from editing that particular article for a few days (Netscott as well) and return after you've had a few days to calm down and reflect. Once you start assuming other editors are trolling or being disruptive merely because they disagree with you it becomes hard to get any meaningful work done. Mexcellent 01:35, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not "pretending" but I am indeed very concerned about Wikipedia being libel for labeling this artist's work (and thereby himself) anti-Semitic.

<dd>Jeff is, IMHO, quite right.

<dd>Maybe so, and it probably does not violate BLP. Just consider whether it really adds to the article. You should also consider whether we as Wikipedians should be aggregating personal data and publishing it in one place.

<dd>The protection was entirely justified in this case. HW has been edit warring over a well-sourced insert on the subject of the article and making allegations of BLP violations despite the fact that several users clearly detailed that there was no BLP violation, nor defamation, nor anything (see article talk page).

The Gannon article also has a category of "courtesans and prostitutes". The sources cited to verify this claim are, for the most part, editorials written by authors who can arguable be called biased. While these sources allude to Mr. Gannon being a male prostitute, in none of them can be found evidence that he ever actually engaged in prostitution, which is a crime in nearly every state of the US. I have removed these statements several times, citing <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, from <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Gannon_c068.html" title="Jeff Gannon">Jeff Gannon</a>, and from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_prostitutes_and_courtesans.html" title="List of famous prostitutes and courtesans">List of famous prostitutes and courtesans</a>.

I requested an advocate from AMA, and since my dispute is with an admin, another admin, <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Chess_65ea.html" title="User:Fred Chess">Fred Chess</a>, was assigned as my advocate. The advocate has briefly examined the sources, and also cannot find evidence to support the claim that Gannon ever engaged in prostitution, and also points out that he believes that prostitution is a crime.<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrockspot_f91a.html#AMA_request" title="User talk:Crockspot">User talk:Crockspot#AMA_request</a> There is no evidence that Gannon has ever been arrested, charged, or convicted of prostitution.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I am not seeking any sanctions against Gamaliel, I simply want the statements removed, or solidly sourced (which I don't believe can be done at this time). Perhaps a protection of the articles after editing is also in order. Gamaliel and I are of different political persuasions, and have had several disagreements in the past, however this one seems so clear cut to me, and speaks to the basic credibility of Wikipedia as a whole. I am afraid that his personal feelings toward me may be clouding his objectivity on this one. I generally try to handle my own disputes, but this one is beyond my ability to resolve.</dd>

<dd>One may possibly argue from these sources that there were nude photos of him online, that there may have been pricetags associated with these photos, or that his sexual orientation may be other than heterosexual, but one cannot verify that he ever actually engaged in prostitution, and therefore calling him such in his biography, catetgorizing his biograpy as such, and listing him on a list of famous prostitutes, is inappropriate and against Wikipedia policy as set forth in <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>.// <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 16:01, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a BLP issue. BLP changes the rules about consensus and discussion due to potential defamation and strawman arguments. Cut first, then discuss and build consensus. The burden of proof shifts to the editors who want content to remain.

</dl>
<p>Here is my take on this. I had posted it elsewhere, it seems more appropriate to bring it here. At <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_famous_prostitutes_and_courtesans_2938.html#Alleged_male_prostitutes" title="Talk:List of famous prostitutes and courtesans">Talk:List of famous prostitutes and courtesans#Alleged male prostitutes</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">User:Crockspot</a> and I are having a disagreement about the threshold of reliability required by WP:BLP. If I understand him correctly, he is saying that regardless of the caliber of a source, there must be multiple independent sources. Those sources must not have any axe to grind. And perhaps he is claiming something even more restrictive than that, which I'm not quite picking up. I find the second requirement a bit troubling, because it is hard to say who does and does not have an axe to grind. In this case, the two sources I provided, which were rejected as inadequate, were:<br />
1. An opinion piece, published in <i>The Guardian</i> in the UK, which states as fact that the individual in question was a prostitute. As most of you know, the UK has pretty much the world's toughest libel laws, so that if the individual had any intention of challenging this, then that was the ideal venue to do so<br />
2. A piece (originally from <i>The Nation</i>, but reprinted on CBS's website) that says that the individual "apparently was seeking customers as a gay, military-oriented prostitute."<br />
Since then another editor has found two articles from the <i>Washington Post</i> asserting, respectively, that the individual's "naked pictures have appeared on a number of gay escort sites" and that he "was offering his escort services for $200 an hour, or $1,200 a weekend". So, if these don't add up to enough, I'm a bit bewildered. Is Crockspot correctly interpreting this rule? If so, I believe we have an enormous amount of material about living people that does not meet this level of citation, probably the bulk of it. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:31, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>From my experience in the industry, opinion pieces generally don't go the same fact-checking and vetting processes as regular articles. This generally makes them a poor primary source, which seems to be the use in the article. As a source in general, The Guardian is reliable. The Washintonpost is reliable. I believe <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> apply a higher standard of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Tone and bias of sources may have to be vetted on an individual basis for inclusion in an article. Under an ordinary article, using a dubious source may not damage any one individual and wikipedia can move slow to correct it. Under a biography of a living person, there is possibility of harm and reputation to the person and their career via wikipedia. Most states will recognize that accusations of homosexuality are defamation per se, <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander.html#Defamation_per_se" title="Slander">Slander#Defamation_per_se</a>. In english, we are well down the road to a judgement in a potential defamation suit, its already assumed the statement is defamitory. This seems to be why Crockspot is raising such a stink, and he has the exceptions granted in the power of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> to do so. Make sure the sources used are rock solid in any BLP article. Also, editors who revert such material are to be held accountable, not the editor deleting the material. Further, the fact that wikipedia has an enormous about of material that doesn't pass a high bar of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is quite agreeably disturbing. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectrawn_42d2.html" title="User:Electrawn">Electrawn</a> 03:30, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have been trying to make the editors above aware that BLP has a higher standard, and that standard has been evolving. I didn't feel that I was being adequately heard, and that is why I brought it here. It is true that there is an ENORMOUS amount of libellous material on Wikipedia, and that is one of the reasons I have been pushing for a task force specifically charged with dealing with these issues. This noticeboard is a good start, but we need to really crack down. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 12:21, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>On further contemplation, I think that the strongest statement supported by the sources is something along the lines of "Some have alleged that Gannon is a male prostitute".

<dd>Well, it would be directly quoting news stories in the <i>Post</i> to say that "[his] naked pictures have appeared on a number of gay escort sites" and he "was offering his escort services for $200 an hour, or $1,200 a weekend". <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36733-2005Feb18.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36733-2005Feb18.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27730-2005Feb15.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27730-2005Feb15.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> That's rather more specific than the mealy-mouthed "some have alleged", and much more verifiable. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 19:30, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it said "According to an editorial in the WaPo, blah blah blah (in quotes)", with a link to the article, then it conceivably would be more of a grey area. Wikipedia is merely presenting the information reported, and allowing the reader to draw their own conclusion as to its veracity. Is it still a violation of BLP? I'm not sure. (In some cases, it might be preferable to use the mealy-mouthed approach, for brevity's sake, ie., when the quotes are long, or there are a lot of them.) But that is a far cry from listing Gannon on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_prostitutes_and_courtesans.html" title="List of famous prostitutes and courtesans">List of famous prostitutes and courtesans</a>, even with the same source links. Just appearing on that list is having a conclusion drawn about him. Perhaps another article called List of famous alleged prostitutes and courtesans would be more of a grey area, though I am not recommending the creation of that article. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 19:57, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the bar is set the same as in mainstream media/journalism. You say the word alleged until convicted by a court of law. Until someone even attempts to charge him with anything, calling him a alleged prostitute is still shaky ground. If he says it in a direct quote "I am a prostitute" and that was published in a reliable source, then that can be included in wikipedia. An article from a reliable source claiming he may be a prostitute should be identified as such and use direct quotes. XYZ at the WSJ says QRS may have been involved with an escort service. This still makes wikipedia look like tabloid journalism. Further, an escort service and prostitute are seperate things. While escort services are often fronts for prostitution, one does not imply the other. Naked pictures of a guy on a website with the phrase $200 an hour probably wouldn't hold up in a prostitution court case, nor can it hold up in wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElectrawn_42d2.html" title="User:Electrawn">Electrawn</a> 23:35, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, absurd. The reports have been repeatedly published in major news sources and as such, are prima facie verifiable.

<p>At this point in the discussion, it is clear that Gannon's inclusion on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_prostitutes_and_courtesans.html" title="List of famous prostitutes and courtesans">List of famous prostitutes and courtesans</a> is unjustifiable. He has never seen the inside of a courtroom over prostitution, nor made a public admission. He cannot be listed as a known prostitute.

<dd>A very obvious conclusion? That, sir, is the very definition of Original Research. Escort does not necessarily equal prostitute. I can't believe you are still arguing this point after so much discussion. I can think of two other "conclusions", like maybe it was a sting operation in conjunction with law enforcement? Or perhaps he was trolling for victims in a blackmail scheme? Admittedly you would need a fair amount of tinfiol to believe those conclusions, but the fact is, we do not draw conclusions on Wikipedia.

<dd>I am acting as the advocate of Crockspot. I will try and clarify certain things my advocee is concerned about.</dd>
<dd>Starting with my advocees main concern, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. At one place in (<a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Use_of_categories" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP#Use_of_categories</a>), it gives this example about categories: "<i><a href="../../../c/r/i/Category%7ECriminals_c838.html" title="Category:Criminals">Category:Criminals</a> should only be added when [...] the person has either been convicted or has pleaded guilty."</i>
<ul>
<li>Q: Isn't prostitution a form of criminality? Has Gannon either been convicted or pleaded guilty to this charge? If no, then why is it insisted that the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Category%7ECourtesans_and_prostitutes_22f1.html" title="Category:Courtesans and prostitutes">category:Courtesans and prostitutes</a> is added to the article <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Gannon_c068.html" title="Jeff Gannon">Jeff Gannon</a>? Is it impossible that Jeff Gannon never actually never commited prostitution?</li>
<li>My advocee stresses the importance of completely relying on the sources, so that only verifiable and undeniable truths are mentioned. This is also supported in <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#What_is_excluded.3F" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research#What_is_excluded?</a> where it is stated "<i>An edit counts as original research if it proposes any of the following: [..] It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;</i>". Since nowhere in the sources can it be concretely proven that Gannon actually committed prostitution, my client believes this to be original reserch. Instead of this, he wishes that the articles in question only mentions the undisputed claims, such as Gannon having <i>offered services</i> as a male prostitute on several web-sites.</li>
<li>My advocee also wants it to be clearly written within the article what the sources are. Instead of presenting conclusions made by various newspaper as facts, the article should state clearly in the text that, for example, "it was concluded in several newspaper editorials that Gannon was a prostitute [1] [2]".</li>

<p>Since the case on one side has now been succinctly stated, I will state other side.</p>
<p>I would like to make it clear: I think the <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Gannon_c068.html" title="Jeff Gannon">Jeff Gannon</a> article currently goes on much too long about this, and gives much too much salacious detail, but I feel like there is an effort afoot to suppress entirely the mention of something that is by no means libelous, and is well worthy of mention. Please note that I had never made an edit related to Gannon until I saw <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">User:Crockspot</a> trying to remove this, at which point I got involved in the effort to show that this could be well cited.</p>
<p>These are the cited news stories (from the <i>Washington Post</i>); I'm not the one who found these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Kurtz_9076.html" title="Howard Kurtz">Howard Kurtz</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27730-2005Feb15.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27730-2005Feb15.html" rel="nofollow">"Online Nude Photos Are Latest Chapter In Jeff Gannon Saga"</a>, <i>Washington Post</i>, February 16, 2005.</li>
<li>Howard Kurtz, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36733-2005Feb18.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36733-2005Feb18.html" rel="nofollow">"Jeff Gannon Admits Past 'Mistakes,' Berates Critics"</a>, <i><a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i>, February 19, 2005.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows—or I certainly think allows—us to say "According to the <i>Washington Post</i> 'Gannon was offering his escort services for $200 an hour, or $1,200 a weekend' and had 'a Web page, which he paid for, featuring X-rated photos of himself.'" I, for one, would consider that to make the matter quite clear. If that can't be shorthanded as "prostitute", then fine, but this is like having to say "it appears that the side of the cow that is facing us is brown."</p>
<p>For what it is worth, here are the other sources I have cited on the matter:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1416370,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1416370,00.html" rel="nofollow">A hireling, a fraud and a prostitute</a>, <i>The Guardian</i>, February 17, 2005.
<ul>
<li>This is an opinion piece; I cited this mainly because it was published by a major newspaper in the UK. If Gannon wished to make any claim of libel, presumably this would have afforded him the ideal venue: UK libel laws are pretty much the toughest in the world. The fact that he did not see fit to sue <i>The Guardian</i> or Blumenthal should settle any serious question of libel once and for all.</li>

Listing him on that page is basically saying that Wikipedia is passing judgement on him and categorizing him as a prostitute. If you want to quote the sources in the <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Gannon_c068.html" title="Jeff Gannon">Jeff Gannon</a> article, I don't have a major problem with that. There just shouldn't be any editorializing or conclusionary language in the Wiki part of the text. Other articles on Wikipedia should not refer to him as "Jeff Gannon, male prostitute" either. That is libel. The furthest other articles that refer to him should go is "Gannon, alleged by some to be a male prostitute" (citations). A hypothetical example: I can find possibly thousands of sources calling President Bush a moron. Even members of parliament of Canada have been quoted in the press calling him a moron. Lots of people think he is a moron. But does he meet the dictionary definition of a moron? No. Can Wikipedia refer to him as "President Bush, a moron..."? No. Can Wikipedia say "Some high profile govt. officials have been quoted calling the President a moron. (citation)."? Yes. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 14:38, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As to the fact that Gannon has never sued a British newspaper for libel, that is irrelevant. You are drawing a conclusion that because he didn't do X, it means Y is true. That is flawed logic, and again, is original research. Just as the fact that Gannon refused to deny or even discuss these issues with the Washington Post is not a confirmation that their allegations are true. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 14:46, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As to there being a "movement afoot" to remove the information entirely, I suggest you read <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> very carefully. If I am convinced something is libel, I am to remove it with no discussion. It is not my responsibility to rewrite the information to my satisfaction. The responsibility for that lies squarely on the shoulders of those wanting the information included. Simply reverting repeatedly my edit can be construed as repeated reinsertion of libel, which is a gross violation of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, and is a blockable offense. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 14:53, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In my opinion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeff_Gannon&amp;diff=73909210&amp;oldid=73907711" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeff_Gannon&amp;diff=73909210&amp;oldid=73907711" rel="nofollow">this diff by Derex</a> is pretty good.

<dd>I don't think that the Wikipedia should lower itself to this kind of discussion. He's been named in the press as a prostitute, and he's not sued for libel. However, there is quite a good chance he's given it up (either for personal reasons, or because the publicity made it impossible for him to carry on). He has his life to lead and it won't be easy to recover from what's been said about him already. How would we feel if he committed suicide now, and one of the factors was people reminding him of those days, based on what they saw about him in here?

<dd>Basically, a few editors are trying to push their POV with original research, and use their arguments to build a "consensus" to support their extrapolation of "facts"(<i>OR</i>) between sources. One such "fact" they have been trying to push is that Barbara Schwarz has never won a lawsuit. This is not true. I've contacted some people in Utah, and she has filed and won at least 2 civil suits. Also, she has been granted most of her FOIA requests but the editors on her article only seem to be interested in presenting the negative part of her story. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 16:28, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>She probably won/settled several cases and perhaps signed a gag order not to talk about it. It must be difficult as private person to win against the federal government. It is much easier to sue private folks. I strongly suspect that Ms. Schwarz figured out very quickly that courts help the government and that she, esp. without an attorney, might not win. I asked myself why she didn't stop suing them and googled some of her postings. I found an answer. She continued to sued them to have a documentation of the curruption within agencies and courts. This should be mentioned in the article on her. -- Vicky</dd>

<dd>And still, you do not understand. In the "reference" (a usenet posting) you just gave a "Barbara Schwarz" says she won settlements in the USA. The statement could be interpreted in a number of ways, but there is nothing there that says she has "never won a case in the USA". Seems like you just want to argue. This is the last time I will discuss this point: There is not reliable source to support any claim that Barbara Schwarz hasn't won a case in the USA.

<dd>Wrong logic. The correct reasoning is: 1) there is no source to claim that Barbara Schwarz has ever won a case, but over 80 showing that she has lost; 2) she admits that she has never won a case; 3) there is no reason that Barbara would falsely claim that she has never won. Therefore: she has never won a case.

<dd>To answer 1:); yes there is. According to published, verifiable sources and Schwarz herself, it is a verifiable fact.

<p>What we can say VERIFIABLY is that she didnt win lawsuit #1 thru lawsuit #105 in the list of lawsuits she was involved in that was published by Lexis. We can also say, Judge So-And-So says this about the case -- and Justice So-and-so says that Ms. Schwarz has filed 35 previous frivilous claims, or whatever other relevant claims he has to say. We can point out the word "DISMISSED" that appear in each of the lawsuits that she has appeared in as a plaintiff and cite the specific 80+ cases where the words "DISMISSED" appear. It will be painfully obvious to the reader that the lack of any mention of Ms. Schwarz having won a case -- will indicate that she likely hasn't won any. And the talk page discussion on the topic will bear that out as well. There is no counter-evidence showing Ms. Schwarz has won any U.S. case, however it isn't necessary to specifically state that in the article. Just say, she lost #1, lost #2, lost #3, ....., and lost #105. Cite each of the cases she lost and be done with it. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 20:26, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

When asked to cite the numbers of the cases she's won, you can't, despite her own admission she has won none; when asked to cite proof of inappropriate psychological detention by German government; you can't, and then you state you're getting a box of documents from Germany, in German, and wanting to put them into the article.

<dd>Yes, she has threatened to get an attorney and sue Wikipedia. I believe that is one of the reasons she is blocked. I think if she gets enough money together, she can also sue the SLCT, but I don't know. Anyway, you still defend your tendency to engage in original research. Do you intentionally make things up, or do you honestly believe in the things you make up? Linda Simmons Hight said NOTHING about disconnection, yet you try to interpret her words to match your original research. It is NOT a false accusation that you engage in original research. You, Orsini, have engaged in original research, either intentionally or unintentionally, you have. I know what original reserach is, my assessment of it is not incorrect just because you think it is. You seem to think a lot of things that are not real. 1. You think when someone says they won settlements in the usa that it means "they never won a case in the usa" 2. You think that when someone says they are "clueless about someone" that it means they wish to disconnect from the person. 3. You think USENET is a reliable source. 3. When someone points out these things to you and says you're engaging in original research, you choose to accuse your critic of misunderstanding. The misunderstanding is on your part, Orsini.

Tilman, can you provide references that state "She has never won a lawsuit"? You wrote "She has never won a lawsuit" in this discussion.

Her abuse of the FOIA has been notable in government circles dealing with FOIA matters; her carpet-bombing and follow-up frivolous pre-se litigation for nonexistent facts led to sanctions being applied by the <a href="../../../s/c/o/SCOTUS_92d6.html" title="SCOTUS">SCOTUS</a>, including a prohibition on filing non-criminal petitions. Under the FOIA, a department must pursue a records search even if the documents being requested from it pertain to allegations which are clearly ridiculous. For example, <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/foia/Appeals/FOIA-Decisions/01-0140.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncua.gov/foia/Appeals/FOIA-Decisions/01-0140.htm" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> She is known as the individual filing the most FOIA requests and is notorious in government circles for making outlandish requests for information, then pursuing litigation when the evidence fails to support her delusions. When all of this has been done by a German citizen whose legal status in the United States is questionable at best, and who also has a history with the scientology cult as its German president, her notability becomes evident. In addition to the articles in the Usenet, there are four published newspaper articles and many cites in government documents online which meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standards; the articles on the Usenet and the newspaper articles are not the only sources. Problems with the article began when one editor began deleting source material meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and it led to an edit war, with the article’s subject wanting the article deleted because it doesn’t reflect her views, for example the Nazi Secret Service infiltration of the US government. Members of the scientology cult appear also to be agitating to have the article removed, together with the rest of the series of scientology articles in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 05:24, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are lots of people who dink with the government this way. They are called 'Crazy People' but they are not notable simply because they are crazy. What concerns me is your use of the word 'cult' which implies a bias against scientology. I have seen this before in Wikipedia where someone becomes 'notable' because their association with an organization is a way to impugn that organization. Some editors have used this association in order to reinforce their own bias or agenda when in fact the two things have little to do with each other. It is my impression that discrediting scientology seems to be the reason to include this person rather than her own notability. Scientology should be covered in a neutral and objective way, but not as an anecdotal list of members that can be skewed to inlcude certain unbalanced persons to make the organization look unbalanced. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 05:40, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Orsini is biased, look at some of her comments on the talk page, she goes on ranting about the organization even though we're trying to talk about Barbara Schwarz. Several other editors involved are also biased. One has written books against the organization, one spends his life on usenet against it, the other also spends his life on usenet/wikipedia/elsewhere against it, and one other person is closely connected to individuals involved with the death of their founder. I'm not giving any names or handles. Also, note the "facts" chosen for the article and also the "facts" ignored. They ignored the deprogramming even though there are secondary references in support of those claims. There is one other highly notable event, involuntary pschiatric treatment. Those sources are difficult to get because they are in German, in Germany and kept secure. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 17:31, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>HResearcher, I would suggest to you the scientology cult's training and treatment of Barbara Schwarz has been instrumental in her behavior towards the courts, the legal system, and to others who cannot accept her version of events. The other editors and I are interested in the presentation of verifiable facts in the article, not unsourced or poorly sourced material. Nor is it the intention of the editors working on this article to create a piece of tabloid journalism. I note again your personal attack with accusations of bias; the only bias I have is towards insisting upon the citation of factual and verifiable evidence from reliable sources, and claims by the scientology cult don’t fit this criteria. The facts you're choosing to ignore yourself in relation to this "involuntary psychiatric treatment" are that in September 1984, Schwarz was facing charges about the attempted intimidation and blackmail of Klaus Karbe (Amtsgericht Munich, Geschaeftsnumber 462 Cs 115 Js 3953/83). This was cited by her in her own multi-part series. In part 27 of that series, she also states her mother had serious concerns about her treatment in the hands of the cult whilst Schwarz was in Los Angeles. The deprogramming attempt you cite did not take place until November 1987. If scientology is not directly responsible for her current state of mind, it is certainly a significant influence on it, and its significance in her life cannot be dismissed. It’s worth noting also you have removed material from the article which met and exceeded <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standards, while falsely claiming it violated <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> because it wasn’t favorable to the subject, and at least two admins failed to agree with your unique interpretation of this policy. When presented with verifiable facts, you’ve dismissed them as “original research.” You have also stated your willingness to remove what you consider to be poorly sourced material from the talk pages, after the verifiable sources you insist upon have been cited to you over and over again on the same page; you have made personal attacks and failed to assume good faith with the other editors; you have made statements to provoke people, and you have made extraordinary claims about the German government and its involvement with Schwarz's detention for which you have not provided any evidence. The last straw has been your groundless accusation of libel you have just made on the article talk page, and your attempts of intimidation not to participate in the discussion there. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 19:34, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>According to Barbara's 92 part story, it wasn't the treatment by Scientology which caused any harm, so I don't know why you're suggesting a biased view of scientology when this discussion is not about Scientology. Again you seem to be engaging in original research with some kind of anti-scientology agenda. If she attempted to blackmail or intimidate Klaus Karbe, that is no reason for involuntary psychiatric "treatment". What Germany did was a human rights violation. Yes, the deprogramming attempt by Cyril Vosper took place several years later, what's your point? And what you are forgetting is the psychiatric treatment and deprogramming attempt may be responsible for what you call "her current state of mind." What is your source for her current state of mind? A citation please! Or is it original research again? Or is your source USENET postings by all the trolls who flame Barbara Schwarz? I'm not here to defend myself or my past actions, but I will not cease to point that you consistently use original research to influence other Wikipedia editor's ideas about Barbara Schwarz. You keep on using original research, Orsini, go ahead and see where it gets you. You still have not cited reliable sources to back up your claims that: 1. Barbara Schwarz has never won a lawsuit in the USA, 2. Her church wishes to disconnect from her. 3. Barbara has a certain "mental condition" 4. Those conditions are due to the treatment by Scientology. You haven't presented sources, yet you continue to push that POV and you act like these unsourced claims are grounds for your arguement. There is no point in further arguing this until you present references to these negative claims about Barbara Schwarz. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 10:17, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. If <i>lots of people dink the government this way</i>, I'm sure you can cite similar examples where a foreign national has abused the process of FOIA law and the court system in a similar extent matching that of the article’s subject. 2. The word <i>cult</i> in relation to scientology has been used in many published media articles, and it has tried to sue for being described as "the cult of greed and power", and it lost. <a href="http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/2nd/989522.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/2nd/989522.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> A sow's ear remains in actuality a sow's ear, no matter how much spin is placed upon those trying to sell it as a silk purse. 3. Ms Schwarz was not merely a <i>member</i> of it; <b>she was the national president of scientology in Germany</b>; therefore she’s of far more significance in that cult than its kids spruiking on the pavements for "free personality tests". Since she has become a source of embarrassment for scientology, they have attempted to deny any association with her; please see the discussions in the article’s talk pages on this issue. 4. Her notability has been discussed <i>ad infinitum</i> on the talk pages; note also the comments here by <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">User:ChrisO</a>. 5. Her former position of leadership in the scientology cult is <i>part</i> of her notability, not the sole grounds of it; please read the article. 6. The subject of scientology has been covered in a neutral and objective way in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>, which is infuriating to the cult since these articles are not echoes of it's propaganda. 7. Sole reason of citing Barbara Schwarz's involvement with the scientology cult cannot skew it to appear more unbalanced than numerous criminal trials and courts of inquiry, and its own behavior independent of her, has already conclusively established it to be. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 19:24, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

She was also notable enough to have been mentioned in 2 books in regards to her Scientology deprogramming. And lastly, on 3 seperate occassions this article was subjected to a vote for deletion with the notability concern being a specific focus each time.

<dd>To people that suggest that these are claims that are "poorly sourced" or "unsourced" -- you are obviously not paying attention. Each claim in the article is supported by numerous sources -- including, in most cases, an admission by the subject that the events occured. If you want to suggest that Ms. Schwarz's own words written to Usenet can't be used here, you might consider that these words are verifiably hers. She admitted in the newspaper article that she published her multi-part life story on Usenet. And, in any case, Mr. Bauder suggested that we add her own words to give the article more balance, or to present her side of the story, since he didn't think "her side" was explained sufficiently. But you guys are laboring under a false premise -- Wikipedia has no obligation to present a biography with 1/2 positive information and 1/2 negative information. When a person is primarily notable for something negative, then it makes sense that an article about them will include the things for which that person is notable. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 01:32, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

You have stated several times now she's won lawsuits; what are the case numbers? Repeating "she's won cases" over and over will not make it any more verifiable without them. A long list of the cases she's <i>lost</i> already appears on the article talk page. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 02:32, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, you are wrong, Orsini, the article was poorly sourced and discussion continues to be poorly sourced and often based on original research / extrapolation and it was/is being done in a way as Tbeatty has expressed concern, however the issue is not notability. The issue is direct violation of WP:BLP "poorly sourced negative comments/claims". Orsini has made original reserach to include negative comments in the talk page and some of those ideas have made it into the article. Also note Orsini's comment about Barbara Schwarz' current mental state. I'd like to know the source of that. --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 10:56, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hresearcher suggests that the article uses Usenet as the primary source of information. This is incorrect. There were 80+ lawsuits that were cited and there were numerous newspaper articles cited. Admin and ArbCom member, <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_Bauder_722b.html" title="User talk:Fred Bauder">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fred_Bauder_4e85.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fred Bauder">contribs</a>) inserted Barbara's own words from Usenet because he felt that it would provide balance to the article. The only reason Usenet was cited at all was because it gives a verifiable place where Barbara has had a chance to explain her side of the story. Previously the article did not give as much prominence to the viewpoints only expressed by Barbara in Usenet, but what are we to do when a senior admin and ArbCom member says that they need to be included? <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 20:10, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She wants to be left alone, that's not insane. We should just write articles on living individuals, who clearly are public persons. My proposal, don't step on a slippery legal road, remove the article and let's have some peace. If Ms. Schwartz is bound for more fame, she could be portrayed at a later point in time, when the public person part indeed is somehow clear. I don't think that she qualifies under the definition of public person. It looks that some individuals are interested in her but she isn't interested in permanent public exposer. She hasn't even got a website! The critics of Scientology should look for another outlet to bash Scientologists. Wikipedia is not the right place for such games. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBragg_Sauce_12fa.html" title="User:Bragg Sauce">Bragg Sauce</a></dd>

<li>There's not a lot of "nasty talk"; there's a lot of <i>carefully sourced</i> discussion of behaviour which Marsden has quite notably and publicly been <i>accused</i> of in the past, which does not draw any conclusions about her guilt or innocence. The article has been continually subject to vandalism by two editors for months; one of those two editors has variously identified themselves as either Rachel's sister or Rachel herself, and the other one is Rachel's personal friend <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Bourrie_ce95.html" title="Mark Bourrie">Mark Bourrie</a>, who is involved in arbitration over his edits to <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Kinsella_5d74.html" title="Warren Kinsella">Warren Kinsella</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Bourque_%28journalist%29_a0ca.html" title="Pierre Bourque (journalist)">Pierre Bourque</a>. Both appear to take the position that BLP prohibits <i>any</i> negative material <i>at all</i>, whereas BLP actually prohibits <i>unsourced</i> negative material, and quite explicitly states that properly sourced material stays <i>in</i> the article whether the subject likes it or not. And prior to their complaints about Marsden's article on September 5, User:64.26.170.175's <i>only</i> previous edits were to one of Bourrie's banned sockpuppet user pages. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 17:26, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Marsden was a well-known figure in Canada long before she ever became a pundit. I think it would be against NPOV policy <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">to give undue weight</a> to her punditry when she is known more for her involvement in numerous harassment controversies than for her political positions or writings. This perceived unbalance is the fault of Marsden's own actions - not of biased editors. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeedubber_00ec.html" title="User:Geedubber">Geedubber</a> 05:37, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Involovment in several harassment controversies" involves one case with a former boyfriend that resulted, basically, in a warning. The rest is unproven allegations that never saw a court of law or a public hearing and are now more than ten years old. Marsden has been a politocal columnist for several years now. This article should not be tailored to Geedubber's priorities.64.230.114.207 14:52, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How does living bio patrol work?</span></h2>
<p>I get asked this by the press a <i>lot</i>. So I thought I'd come here and ask how it actually works.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the actual process?</li>
<li>How are new living bios spotted?</li>
<li>Who watches edits in them, on what sort of schedule?</li>
</ol>
<p>And 4. the big one: is there anything that can be done to make the living bio patrolling volunteers' work easier and more efficient? What magical software features would you like? Is there anything that as-yet-unwritten bot software could do to assist?</p>
<p>I'd love to be able to answer "we have a volunteer patrol who look out for any rubbish going in living biographies. We're not perfect but I think we do pretty well" and be able to give more detail if they ask&#160;;-) - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 21:34, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I may have stepped on a mine here, as it looks like many well-intentioned editors trying to clean up Wikipedia have repeatedly run into self-appointed owners of the page (usually because they have "personally dealt with him") who end up attacking those quoting MoS guidelines and policies as "child minders" or as having "guideline fetishism".</p>
<p>Currently, "Arvin Sloane" is exhibiting some rather bizarre behavior. (the IP addresses listed also belong to this user, as he edits by IP and then changes his signature to say "Arvin Sloane") He has removed the WPBiography template repeatedly, saying it is "tasteless", "unsolicited" and "racist" and that it "personally offends" him and "in [his] opinion, Jack Vance." He has posted a "Notice to Vandals" warning those trying to add the template to the talk page from doing so. The user has not violated the 3RR, and I assume he will not, but has stated that he will revert it 3 times each 24 hours (I guess to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>). He has also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Global_warming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74394492" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Global_warming&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=74394492" rel="nofollow">posted personal attacks</a> in response to having his redirect deleted.

<dd>As for guideline fetishism, that was my take on it. I object, as would most normal people, to someone coming in and giving us orders to "fix" things, when this someone is as much editor as you, me and anybody else and is quite capable of "fixing" things themselves. To me, it was an arrogant suggestion and I pointed that out to the individual in question. A lot of you may be administrators or bureaucrats or whatever, but if you seriously tell me, a common or garden nobody contributor, that you can't source information or verify something as well as the next guy, then we'll all have a good laugh.

<dd>You would not believe the amount of discusion that has occurred first on the article <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">Human</a> and then on the BLP site concerning this image. What <i>is</i> a good image to represent <b>human</b>&#160;???? My smart-ass answer is that it was deleted when PublicGirlUK decided to withdraw her contibutions. The real answer is that what it is to be human is something every human finds out for themselves. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 11:18, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Believe it or not, I was thinking along the lines of George W. Bush. Arguably the world's best known living person and there are plenty of public domain images of him out there courtesy of US Govt. legislation.

<p>I am having to restore an external link, a satirical blogspot about Crown Princess Mary, twice daily. There was a section outlining controversy surrounding the princess, and a lot of that material supported by external links was removed. There was an arguable case for that. I can't see that removing a link to a satirical blog about the princess is anything other than censorship - it's clear from the naming of the link that it's satire, so punters can simply not click if they're not interested. What is the policy re external links, clearly labelled, as opposed to libellous material on the page itself? The editor constantly removing my link is not conversing with me about it, just serially removing it. This is very un-Wikipedia in approach, and there needs to be a consensus please!.

I would like to hear some opinions as to whether or not policy has been followed in this article. Carter was a singer-songwriter who died in 2002, but the issues relate to <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. In a conversation at <a href="../../../d/a/v/Talk%7EDave_Carter_b615.html" title="Talk:Dave Carter">Talk:Dave Carter</a> a new user revealed several facts about Carter not previously known to the public and still not available elsewhere, among these were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to his death, Carter had begun "to persue a gender change."</li>
<li>Information about legal ownership of Carter's songs at the time of his death--mentioning by name Carter's ex-wife and executor of his estate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The person making these claims, <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammer_e354.html" title="User:Grammer">User:Grammer</a>, revealed that she was in fact <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_Grammer_8a41.html" title="Tracy Grammer">Tracy Grammer</a>, Carter's partner both in his musical career and life. This was verified via e-mail by administrator, <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a>. Sandifer took the additional step of confering with Amgine (who I gather is a Wikimedia big wig) before making the following edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding the first claim above to <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Carter_bb77.html" title="Dave Carter">Dave Carter</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dave_Carter&amp;diff=75134630&amp;oldid=75130613" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dave_Carter&amp;diff=75134630&amp;oldid=75130613" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> and including the same into <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETransgender_and_transsexual_musicians_443f.html" title="Category:Transgender and transsexual musicians">Category:Transgender and transsexual musicians</a>.</li>
<li>Adding both claims to the article, <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Carter_and_Tracy_Grammer_797a.html" title="Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer">Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dave_Carter_and_Tracy_Grammer&amp;diff=75135098&amp;oldid=67784163" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dave_Carter_and_Tracy_Grammer&amp;diff=75135098&amp;oldid=67784163" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the issues that trouble me:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have some controversial claims being made without citations. Shall we cite the Dave Carter talk page?</li>
<li>We are stating as fact Grammer's claims that involve not only herself and the deceased Carter, but also non-public figures such as his ex-wife (and including the ex-wife's name).</li>
<li>OK, so and an admin tells me <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammer_e354.html" title="User:Grammer">Grammer</a> <u>really is</u> <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_Grammer_8a41.html" title="Tracy Grammer">Grammer</a>, I suppose I can buy it. I'm actually a fan and have been to several of her concerts, but should Wikipedia be the first place to publish this?</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to hear some additional opinions. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 22:40, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Amgine is a Foundation volunteer, hence my running the language past her - because this clearly was something that needed to be handled with care. That said, MrFizyx's points, in order.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> provides for the subject (Which this ultimately is, since Tracy Grammer is solidly involved in all of this) offering information on the talk page - it doesn't comment on how to do the citation, but I think all of the criteria on BLP are satisfied here. The only issue would be contentious, and I don't exactly think that's accurate here. The information is neither contentious nor controversial - there was no raging debate on whether Carter was transgender, nor on whether he had a romantic relationship with Tracy Grammer. The first was unknown previously, and the second a matter of speculation, but never of particular comment. The information is unusual, and I'll admit surprising, but it is not controversial - nobody has denied it.</li>
<li>I was quite impressed, actually, with how Grammer phrased the section - it was NPOV, discrete, and polite. It referred to "acrimony," but did not attempt to suggest that Grammer had a legal or ethical right to the songs, and brought in no dirty laundry. As for the ex-wife's name, she's mentioned as one of the people administering the Dave Carter memorial fund on a press release from their official website, and so it's not, to my mind, a massive deal - that said, I would not be averse to removing her name.</li>
<li>I'm willing to forward the e-mail to a Foundation member if this becomes an issue, but I would imagine that an administrator verifying that <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammer_e354.html" title="User:Grammer">User:Grammer</a> is not an imposter is sufficient.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>This seems a by-the-numbers case of how a figure can add information to biographies. And I can understand why Tracy Grammer would not issue a press release that Carter was transgender, or on the settling of his estate. It seems respectful to tell the truth as Carter's quoted "partner in all things" tells it. It also seems respectful not to turn the matter into a spectacle. Grammer provided the information in a way that satisfies our requirements of verifiability - she's a perfectly credible source, and her identity is verified - but also in a way that seems respectful given the subject matter. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 23:59, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I had hoped to solicit some third party opinions on this matter, but unfortunately those active on this board seem to be a bit overworked. I have had some involvement in editing and discussing the policy, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Let me tell you in my view what the problem is with what you (<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">User:Phil Sandifer</a>) are doing. In short, moving Grammer's statements from talk page to articles introduces <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">The policy on biographies of living persons</a>, was created to aid in the removal of unsupported and/or negative material. The policy makes it clear that when subjects get involved in editing their own articles that their statements whether they arrive on talk pages or in e-mail must also meet the criteria for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The edits you have made to these articles do not correct errors or misstatements, rather they introduce new research that you yourself have verified by e-mail. The only way that I or any other uninvolved reader may know that they are true is to <u>repeat your original research</u>. There is no liability for <u>not</u> including new information on topics not addressed in our articles. Although, your edits may well have made these articles more truthful, you have made them less verifiable--for better or worse verifiability is the factor that determines what goes in an article. Let us agree that <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracy_Grammer_8a41.html" title="Tracy Grammer">Tracy Grammer</a> is probably the world's greatest expert on the personal life of <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Carter_bb77.html" title="Dave Carter">Dave Carter</a>, but even experts may not use Wikipedia as a site for primary publication. We should thank her for logging in and sharing her story and let her know that we would like publish this in our articles if she decides to go public with the information elsewhere. If you still think my read on this is wrongheaded, I would suggest that the guideline <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> is a good read and lays this out quite clearly. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 22:06, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is silly - the BLP policy clearly allows the sort of addition engaged in here, specifically stating the talk page as a valid place to leave information. The information is verifiable - it was definitely claimed by the most reliable source on the talk page. I have not added any information that was given via e-mail - all I did was verify the source, as is proper. All of the information from the article depends on Tracy Grammer's published words. This is not original research - there is no "more appropriate" or reviewed venue she could post the information. If she'd stuck it on her webpage, we wouldn't be having this argument, and it would have had just as much editorial review. Given that <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrammer_e354.html" title="User:Grammer">User:Grammer</a> is Tracy Grammer, the only dispute here is a semantic one. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 22:21, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>BLP does not trump <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Yes, if it were on her web page we absolutely would not be having this argument. Currently, however, you yourself are a key link in the chain of verifiability. O.R. by an admin is still O.R.! You may take whatever angry tone you wish, it does not change this! In this day and age the words "verified via. e-mail" should inspire skepticism not confidence in any reasonable person. You may have an ongoing history of communication with Grammer that gives you some self-assurance or you may be very savvy in reading the ip addresses within e-mail headers. In any case your research is an unknown quantity to all other readers. If you did not examine <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> please do. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 22:54, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Verifications of this sort are wholly within the purview of what admins should be doing. If you're not going to accept them, then ultimately, I can't really do anything to address your concerns in this conversation, because you're not really dealing with Wikipedia in terms of how it works. I e-mailed Grammer through her website, and got a reply to the e-mail confirming her identity. There is no plausible way for that e-mail to be fabricated. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLPP_4142.html" title="WP:BLPP">WP:BLPP</a> - which is policy - provides clearly for subjecst who are confirmed to be themselves.

<p>Will this communication from Ms. Grammer be published independently, or has it already been published somewhere? Where can other editors go to see these messages? Can we interpret these messages for ourselves? Why does the above quote from <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> apply to every other Wikipedia article except this one? Is Wikipedia now a publisher of original content? Is the standard for inclusion in Wikipedia now truth instead of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Verifiability.2C_not_truth" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>?</p>
<p>If this is allowed in the article, we'll be starting a slide down a very slippery slope. We spend hours and hours (and pixels and more pixels) trying to convince newbies and even some established users that their own research – what they "personally know" about themselves, their relatives, or their bosses – is unacceptable as source material. If Ms. Grammer's messages can be used as source material, what is the difference between her messages and the original research we spend so much time discouraging? I guess I'm dense or something, 'cause I just don't get it. <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball</b></font><font color="red">Baby</font> 02:52, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This really isn't a BLP issue. There's a difference between the whims of a public figure, which we can ignore, and libel, which is covered under BLP. If a reliable source reports his last name, then there's no reason privacy issues come into play since it's already out there. If there is no source, it should be removed because it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:28, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a BLP issue. Personally identifiable information should not be automatically added to articles. Even if it is externally available. How important is his last name to the article? If it doesn't add anything to the article (i.e. he isn't known by his last name. Last name isn't widely available and he takes steps to keep it private) Wikipedia shoudn't find it necessary to add it simply because it can be found. It is policy to keep personal, private information off of pages. For example, if someone's phone number is in the phone book or their social security number is inadvertantly published, Wikipedia does not include it in their articles. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 20:05, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The New York Times covered his wedding, so I'd say public. The NYT is content to identify him as Toure, so I'm fine if our article does as well unless a source of similar weight appears identifying him by his full name. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 20:57, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think that's the line. The weight of the source in terms of credibility/reliability. NYT chose not to. The name is available obviously but there is some line drawn by by reputable publishers. It doesn't appear to be well drawn however so I am not sure how to tell other than by gradations of "public figure." In the spirit of BLP, I would always defer to less information. It can alsways be added later if determined to be relevant. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 09:18, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems we essentially agree, which is a pleasant change of pace, though I of course disagree with your attitude of deferance in all things. I still believe this is not a BLP issue and it would be more easily covered under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

Notice the edit bickering on September 14. I infrequently check my Wikipedia email account. I received the following email on my Wikipedia email account:</p>
<p>Date: Mon, 11 Sep 2006 21:15:28 GMT To: "Royalbroil" &lt;royal_broil@yahoo.com&gt; Subject: Wikipedia--Wayne Taylor From: "Libertine14" &lt;libertine14@gmail.com&gt; Add to Address Book Add Mobile Alert Dear Sir or Madam: I am an attorney at Moran &amp; Shams, P.A., located in Orlando, Florida. Please be advised that this firm represents Wayne Taylor whose biography appears on the Wikipedia website. Over the past few months several inaccurate and wholly libelous material has been posted under the biography of Wayne Taylor. For instance: - Wayne Taylor was never deported from South Africa, but, instead, became an American citizen voluntarily. - He was never expelled from Selborne College. He left Selborne Collegre at the end of Standard 9. - His racing team was not funded with apartheid money and his largest sponsor was not the South African Minister of Manpower. - His wife's name is Shelly, not Sheila, and she was never a lap dancer. His son is named Ricky Scott, not Ricardo Scotch. - He does not have any illegitimate children from his mother's maid in South Africa. In fact, most of the information contained in the biography was completely wrong. His birthday is July 15, 1956 not July 10, 1956. Due to this libelous and inaccurate material, we have taken the liberty of deleting the entry in its entirety, which has been replaced with minimal factual information. As a participant in the WikiProject IROC, you have a responsibility to make sure that all information posted on wikipedia.com is accurate. To that end, we would like to work with you in order to make sure that all information posted in Mr. Taylor's biography is true and will be e-mailing you an accurate biography shortly. We request that the material remain as it is right now with minimal factual information until we can forward to you an accurate biography. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me at kdurkin@moran-shams.com, or at (407) 841-4141, or P.O. Box 472, Orlando, FL 32802. Thank you. Sincerely, Keith C.

<dd>My initial observations: The sourcing seems pretty solid. I didn't take the time to read each one, so I am assuming that the sources actually support the statements made. The introduction does a very good job of pointing out that many of the claims didn't pan out. Being a bio, the controversy section should probably come after the military career section. She is notable, and that notability stems from the controversy, so the information should be presented in a neutral way, which it seems to be. Documenting what was reported about her is reasonable, as long as it is clear that the allegations never panned out. I think you have done a good job of herding the other editors toward neutrality and accuracy. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 13:12, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Wikipedia should <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> be an instrument of disseminating information which has heretofore been private. There is no good reason for us to violate his privacy on this matter - it quite simply adds nothing to the encyclopedic tale. We perhaps can mention that his name is a stage name, but that he chooses to keep his real name private. This is a shining example of the principle that just because we <b>can</b> do something, does not necessarily mean that we <b>should</b> do it.

<dd>I'm with Bdve on this. This is the same situation as the Tron guy. NM's real name is available to the general public on a reliable website(the USPTO). Not allowing his publicly available name to be included just because the webmistress of his site asked it to be removed would be censorship and set a bad precedent. The Tron case even established that real names can and should be included if they can be verified as real(which we can in this case). Also, what about all the Mexican and Japanese masked wrestlers? They rarely(if ever) let their real names be known, but we add them if they can be confirmed as real. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 02:19, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>My two cents: The patent office info is a primary source, and should not be used to support having the name in the article. (Wandering into original research?)

<dd>This is a niche field and sources in this type are hard to come by. What we have here is an interview in the field with a wrestler of the same name that owns the trademark in wrestling with the same trainer who applied for the trademark used for a wrestler of the name who used the same trainer while both are the same height and from England while the official trainers website only lists ring names thus explaining the absense.

<dd>Actully the primary source is what proves the name, I'm using the secondary as a supporter of the primary not the other way around. The individuals who took out the trademark are the same and by the USPTO's website glossary the person who took out the trademark is the user of the trademark, which is not original research as those conclusions are met by the USPTO's website own glossary. I don't need to say the person being interviewed is McGuinness, it can however be used to illustrate a picture of the person who took out the trademark itself which the trademark lists as the person using the McGuinness name.

<dd>Considering the article was before he was famous and in the article itself lists no gimmick at the time of the interview that question is impossible. Using logic it is impossible to see that this is the same person due to the same trainer, same birth, same height, same name on trademark, trademark is for professional wrestling, interviewee in question is a professional wrestler and just for emphasis the USPTO slip, as per the USPTO website glossary, was applied for by the person using the name. This is not original research, this is logic and using of sources, hwoever I still feel you will reject this on the grounds that it can never be proven to be a secondary source even though the primary source makes this impossible to be to the contrary, unless there are two (real name)'d professional wrestling running around from the same location from the same trainer.

Can any editor who is familiar with this policy and who wouldn't mind helping resolve this exceedingly troubling issue, have a look at the article?

<dd>The entire "policies" section reeks of original research. Summaries of other reviews in secondary sources are fine, but this looks like a review done by a wikipedia editor. I don't think the article would suffer without it, but I don't see any real libel going on either. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 20:10, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I happen to be familiar enough with the subject to know that his reputation as "kill em all" is very real, and that just about everything in the section is true. It's not even in serious dispute; he *is* known for such things, and he *has* received that nickname. If you really doubt it, plug "Tomino" and "kill em all" into Google and see how many hits you get.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, the article already lists "The Anime Encylopedia" as a source. When I go to Amazon and look up this book, and search inside it, I can immediately find the following:
<dl>
<dd>"The director... who had gained the nickname "Kill Em All Tomino" after Zambot 3 soon exerted his trademark angst and tragedy".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Frankly, the fact that I should even have to look this up shows that people are failing to assume good faith on the part of the article writer; the article has sources clearly indicated at the bottom. It's true that each sentence in the article isn't individually footnoted, but there is no Wikipedia rule about removing information that is not individually footnoted on a per-line basis.</dd>
<dd>The complaint, to me, sounds like a typical complaint from a fan who is enthusiastic about a subject, doesn't really understand Wikipedia policy, and doesn't want to see anything that resembles criticism in an article. It's a shame that this "dispute" even got this far. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 23:34, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that the section doesn't cite any sources at all, which makes it appear to be original research. My suggestion is to update the references with page numbers that refer to the subject, and add a couple of citations to the section. But as I said before, this doesn't seem to be a libel issue, just a sourcing one. But just so you understand the rules about living persons, if it WERE a libel issue, every claim WOULD have to be sourced, or be removed.<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 02:28, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

They are continuing the election polemics from the other side, in an extremely unbalanced and one-sided way. The motive for that, as the editor makes clear in his summaries and statements, is that he sees Rüütel as a "commie holdover" ("<i>this appalling remnant of a totalitarian regime</i>", edit summary for the main article: "<i>the old commie funcionary appearantly seeking life presidency</i>"), and he supports that with references to commentaries (from election times) from Estonian newspapers. I have tried to reason with him and to come up with a compromise, to present a balanced article, but to no avail. Rüütel is currently the Head of State and therefore subject to public criticism, but the edits by User:Constanz are clearly designed to personally malign and not to inform. Constanz also keeps removing the POV label and reverts, in a slightly vandalous way, updates of the article (such as changes referring to the fact that Rüütel lost the elections yesterday), and is dismissive and offensive against anyone who challenges his personal views. <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 07:08, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The user seems to misunderstand the application of BLP, I'm confused as to who is being libelled in their eyes, maybe the organization she used to work for? The government of Sudan? He has made some comments on the talk page, and he seems only to be concerned with the time parameters of her work with the slave-buying organization, and the reason for her human rights award. Perhaps a couple of very simple changes can placate this person, like "she worked for xyz from (date) to (date)", and leave it at that. Maybe a little further investigation on sources about her award is in order too.

<dd>Don't expect there to ever be harmony in a three-way drama fest between marginally notable people in the entertainment industry. You will only be disappointed. Contrary to popular opinion, there is no evidence that Fox News is any less factually reliable than any other news reporting agency, so it can be used to source claims with confidence. Just be sure the claims accurately reflect the source, and that you are not synthesizing the information for the reader. The short "personal life" section is unsourced, and reads POV to me. I removed a libellous statement from the talk page, but left the rest of what the editor contributed. Good luck with that situation. You'll need your hip waders. It's possible that with at least one of the ex-wives, you are dealing with a publicist, rather than the subject herself, since she seems to be a little more notable, and probably has better things to do with her time than vandalize Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 18:03, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're absolutely correct to be wary of the source, since it is Fox and is essentially a personal essay written by a person who knows the participants, and ideally we should seek another one.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sai Baba</span></h2>
<p>There was an arbitration this month concerning <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sai_baba.html" title="Sai baba">sai baba</a> article. It is concluded now. I was not involved in this arbitration, I made my frist edit to this article earlier today. The article mentions defenses to allegations, it mentions governments making statements concerning these allegations. I would like to include the allegaions themselves, also. I have found one article on BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> which mentions both sides of the controversy, and would like to use some material from this BBC article in the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sai_baba.html" title="Sai baba">sai baba</a> article.</p>
<p>One quote from the BBC article is: <i>But in the last four years, and with the growth of the internet, the tide of claims against Sai Baba has become a groundswell.</i>. Does anybody see any objection to the inclusion of this quote and link?

<dd>The above user insists on theorizing about what Barrett was "planning" on doing. We have no way to know what Barrett's intentions were/are. It is a sourced fact that Barrett came to notability when it was suspected he would be teaching conspiracy theories in his class. The university has since said he has not done so.

Second, in my opinion, it is extremely imprudent and dangerous to the Project for you to be basically taunting a subject and his attorneys, when they have already taken action against the Project. Discussion about how an article is written goes on on the discussion page, not in the article itself. I have left a note for Brad Patrick on his talk page to comment on what is going on. Third, I am not an admin, so I don't have the power to block anyone. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 12:29, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A couple of potentially defamatory postings and unsourced innuendoes concerning a living ex-Prime Minister of Australia on his article's talk page (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APaul_Keating&amp;diff=79252405&amp;oldid=78453686" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APaul_Keating&amp;diff=79252405&amp;oldid=78453686" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and at another talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJohn_Kerr&amp;diff=75703154&amp;oldid=71563999" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJohn_Kerr&amp;diff=75703154&amp;oldid=71563999" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<p>Editors keep removing this info, or the characterization "Extreme Right-Wing" These are the NAACP's words, and I think appropriate for inclusion. Note that they did not characterize Judge John Roberts as "Extreme Right Wing".

<dd>If those words are used in the report, and you cite the report, then I don't see any real problem. What I DO see as a problem is the link to the cite, which links to the google cache of the report. <del>Why not link directly to the report?.</del> Nevermind, I made a new citation directly to the report.

Everest">Mt. Everest</a>. However, because he was unable to provide documented proof (document, pictures, videos etc.), Filipinos do not believe him.

In spite of this all, the Philipine Mt. Everest expedition (more specifically, Dale Abenojar's claims) remains a very controversial topic in the Philippines.</li>

<p>An anonymous user going by the IP address <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:203.87.186.162" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:203.87.186.162" rel="nofollow">203.87.186.162</a> has een editing these four articles in this manner: Oracion, Garduce and Emata are "allegedly" the first three climbers, but Abenojar is "the first" to reach the summit. This is contrary to fact, as Dale Abenojar has not yet provided solid proof to contest the claims of Oracion, Garduce and Emata. He claims to possess pictures of his climb, but AFAIK he refuses to show these to the public. But user 203.87.186.162 edits these four articles constantly to push the point (that Abejonar was #1), despite a warning that I had left on his/her user Talk page. (I also noticed that most of this user's contributions were focused only on these four mountain climbers.) Recently, he/she reverted my reverts and also added some new information on the Dale Abenojar article which, not surprisingly, does not have citations. I have not (yet) reverted the Oracion, Emata and Garduce articles, but I have reverted the Abenojar article (again), and also added another warning on user 203.87.186.162's Talk page.</p>
