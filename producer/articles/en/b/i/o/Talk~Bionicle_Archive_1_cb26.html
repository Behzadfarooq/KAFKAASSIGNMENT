<p>OK, this has gone on long enough. There needs to be some sort of agreement over whether to include www.maskoflife.co.nr in the external links list or not.

<p>I looked at the MaskofLife site again and you're right, there's too little there to make it worth being listed in an encyclopedia. I'll look into what can be done to keep it from being put up there again, as the repeated edits (and occasional flaming) seem to be crossing the line into vandalism. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 20:38, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that mask of life's link should be kept on...I mean whats the big deal if you think it is just stealing news dont go on mask of life first! If it makes some people happy then whats the major (or minor for that matter!) problem? The site wont hurt anyone and the staff certainly wont! so just leave it alone...No one is gonna care...Keep it on.

<p>That website rocks! Definetly keep it on...Its not even fair if they take it off! Even if you think the site is not so great...Wouldnt it be good to give some practice to ameture website developers!

<p>What does it matter in the scope of etternity if the site link is just used for ad! So are all the other sites links!</p>
<p>Got a better idea that leaving it on! it is to much work!</p>
<p>This thing needs to stay off unless it gets bigger. It has 3 members and steals news of BZP and MoD. The admin has been SPAMing up this talk page so I say keep it off. I have been deleting it every time I see it. -Lihyahm</p>
<p>Look, I have been there many times, and the site is still small, but, look, what will it hurt if u just leave it alone!</p>
<p>OKAY!!! This HAS gone on long enough! I'M SICK OF IT!!! For Mata-Nui's sake just leave the link there! IT DOESN'T HURT!!! I haven't been spaming up the talk! THAt was someone else, HONEST.</p>
<p>the last thing I wanted was conflicts beetween our sites. I am extremely sorry for any derogatory comments made on this page by members of Mask of Life, - The Mask of Life Admin</p>
<p>24.115.72.134, stop adding Mask of Life to the links section. It still, after so many attempts to put it in before, is considered advertising. 64.9.15.158 15:32, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because it's consdered shameless advertising. We've explained it before. And that "OK, just leave it!" comment was faked. BoMEpsilon 14:40, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think the reason they put a fake one is cause they worked hard on their site and some shamless people on the net try to take it off...Not that i dont think putting a fake was stupid....but come on everyone makes mistakes! And I agree with the MAJORITY WON deal...it did...almost everyine wants it on! r:205.238.237.192|205.238.237.192]] 14:48, 11 March 2006 (UTC)a MAJOR fan of the site, bigger than the rest</p>
<p>Majority? The website only has two message board topics on it, and since most of these comments from the "majority" are unsigned, how can we even be sure "almost everyone" wants it? And faking a comment because you worked so hard on it doesn't make it right. BoMEpsilon 17:17, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actualy epsilon, we have new message boards, they arn't very big but, give the site time to grow, i have an idea how we can clear this all up...&#160;: Say, once our site has, oh, 25 members, we will be able to put it on the page! Again, to contact me my AOL screen name is Magnetic Orb, and we can sort ths out. We apreciate your time, and we just wish to provide people with bionicle news. The <a href="http://www.maskoflife.co.nr/" class="external text" title="http://www.maskoflife.co.nr/" rel="nofollow">Mask of Life</a> staff.</p>
<p>Most websites put on the external linking section were removed from there for having only 100 members. And the fact your personal attacks against me (off of this website) aren't really giving me the urge to negotiate with you on a personal basis. BoMEpsilon 18:03, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You know, the external links are not for advertising or for getting members, they are for providing information in bionicle. Your site does not do so. BZP does. tBoM does. If it was simply because of a "nice site", mine would be up there. And mine has over 150 members. But you see, my site doesn't really provide much that would be useful to Wikipedia readers, so it is not listed. Yours, even though it may be a lovely website, doesn't either. - Cee-estee (no account)</p>
<p>Our site is small 'cause no one bothers to sign up, but they do for other sites, fate is cruel</p>
<p>Maybe cause other sites are several of the following: 1: better 2: bigger 3: have better communities 4: older (this is a big one) 5: don't have people who go advertising everywhere 6: have useful information that is not listed on BZP and other sites already Need I go on? - Cee-estee</p>
<p>What do other saites don't have that we can put on, think about. and here. 2.it would be bigger if people signed up. 3.same as 2. 4.can't help that one. 5. We don't, at least I don't. and 6. what is there that other sites don't have, what am I Greg F. to you people!!! this is getting off subject;leave the link there, please-Mask of Life admin</p>
<p>It's a NEWS site, not an info site...so you can't blame us for being weak on the info,</p>
<p>Doesn't it strike you as odd that just after we put the first bionicle comic for download on our site, Bzpowers newest thing was refrence to comics? (Just a thought, I'm not accusing anyone of anything)</p>
<p>As for number 4, yes you can help that. You can wait. You have plenty of time, no? And number 5, yes you are. You're posting your site on wiki. That's what I'm talking about. - Cee</p>
<p>You're right, we can wait, but the wait will be half as long if we get people to our site and, I think you would still take off the link if our site was like BoM, or MoD, seriously-Admin of the MoLi</p>
<p>If your site was like them, then you would have more members. And you still haven't ackloleged the fact that my site, with 150 members and over 10,000 posts, isn't even listed here. - Cee</p>
<p>MoLi Admin, If your site is up there, then so should every Bionicle forum with 4 or more members. You don't have any exclusive news or any worthwhile things on your forums. This needs to stay off Wikipedia. -Lihyahm</p>
<p>Your site has 150 members? What is it? maybe I'll join</p>
<p>Look, we have already decided that once we have 100 members we can keep the link on the page! I think now everyone should just surrender! I mean, me and Cee Estee, BoMEpsilon and a few others have talked it over, and once we reach 100, we can just forget about the whole thing! Also. i think that once we put a downloadable comicspage on our site, BZPower did the same! Take a lession from that! BZPower looks to us for news! Just leave the site alone once it gets 100 active members!</p>

<p>OK.Quite a few of us have decided that once Mask of Life has 100 members it can stay on wikipedia. Once we have 100 members, the link will go back up, and there will be no further arguement. Now, I hope I can safely say, Disscussion Over.-Admin of the MoLi</p>

<dd>OK, Good News/Bad News time. The good news is, one of the admins looked at my report and blocked Dark Jedi. The bad news is, he's only been blocked for a day. He'll probably be back tomorrow and I'm guessing he'll be upset; so I figured I'd give everyone a heads-up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, it looks like we've just about reached an agreement, so if we can wrap up this discussion before he comes back it'll be loads easier on everyone.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What links should be listed?</span></h2>
<p>This site is nowhere near large enough or pertinent enough to be listed. Its only difference from the plethora of petty IF sites is the fact that the admin was able to afford actual IPB software. The only forums that should be listed are BZPower and Mask of Destiny (MNOnline is concievable, if only for the fact that Greg Farshety, author of the Bionicle comics, is now a member). I am removing tbomonline from the external links section, and I encourage anyone who spies it shamelessly advertised here again to follow my lead. --A rational thinker</p>
<dl>
<dd>Only difference? The website does have a <a href="http://tbomonline.com/reference/" class="external text" title="http://tbomonline.com/reference/" rel="nofollow">wiki</a>, which is fairly comprehensive, and what it doesn't have in size is made up for in functionality. And as for your Greg comment, the website has, before its merge, had a live chat with Greg Farshtey, which not many boards have had the chance to do. In fact, it plans to get a chat with Stuart Sayger too. <a href="http://tbomonline.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=1130&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=8904734" class="external autonumber" title="http://tbomonline.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=1130&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=8904734" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Also, in case you've forgotten, you may want to <a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">sign your posts</a> next time. –BoMEpsilon<sup><a href="../../../b/o/m/User_talk%7EBoMEpsilon_7ecc.html" title="User talk:BoMEpsilon">talk</a></sup> 00:07, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is the ability to accept "a rational thinker" as an appropriate title alien? At any rate, I still see no justification for tbomonline being advertised on wikipedia, <i>paticuarly</i> with the abscence of matanuionlinev3, which is certaintly more pertinent than tbomonline. It's entirely concievable that in the future, tbomonline could rise in status to be included in the group of relevant Bionicle fan-sites, but it's certaintly not there yet. As it stands, the only truly pertinent Bionicle fan sites are BZPower, Mask of Destiny (both officially recognized by TLG and have been linked to on bionicle.com), and BS01, which is the de facto center for Bionicle information and has a truly <i>comphrehensive</i> wiki. If you want my frank advice, cease with the ego trip and start thinking clearly. You may have a great little forum, but it's not on par with the "big two" <i>yet</i>. --A rational thinker</dd>

<dd>The nature of my capmpaign against having tbomonine in the external links section currently is because I <i>don't</i> want Wikipedia to be used for advertising--I don't know how on earth you could glean some sort of condoning of advertising on Wikipedia from my comments here, but I digress from that issue. Only pertinent, relevant web sites should be linked to in the external links section, and the only fan sites that fit that category currently are BZpower, Mask of Destiny, Bionicle Sector 01, and concievably MataNuiOnline (though the latter is questionable). If your intentions for adding tbomonline to this page's external links section aren't for shameless advertising, then what are they for? If you think tbomonline provides relevant content, please explain what it is, because I do not see it. --A rational thinker</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Dark Jedi, you were banned for 24 hours because of link spam. And "rational" thinker, I think you misunderstood why I suggested you read the external linking policy- it was the fact you keep removing something that is relevant. Of course, this was unclear, so I see why you would misunderstand my point. So far, though, you have provided subjective criticisms on why tBoM should be removed, you have attacked my ego, and you have completely disregarded the need for negotiation. If that is your thought process on this matter, I suggest you abstain from the discussion in the first place. I have already said why I thought tBoM should be kept on there, perhaps if you did not attack the person speaking to you now, you would see why I put tBoM in the external links section. –BoMEpsilon<sup><a href="../../../b/o/m/User_talk%7EBoMEpsilon_7ecc.html" title="User talk:BoMEpsilon">talk</a></sup> 21:42, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I fail to see where I'm disregarding negotiation; I have been presenting the reasons why I find tbomonline to be unworthy of note on Wikipedia, and why its seems fairly obvious that you've been adding your web site simply to promote it and boost your ego. You've lashed back, twisted my words, and acted in a condescending manner, as if I was a vulgar newb. I've replied asking for an explanation as to why you think tbomonline is pertinent, and you've said nothing on the matter. If you would actually read my "posts" here in full, you'd realize that I'm entirely open to intelligent presentation of the opposing viewpoint. If you can produce some evidence that tbomonline is a site relevant enough to be linked to in this article, then I will by all means <i>advocate</i> it being added to the external links section. As it stands, however, I see no difference between tbomonline and the myriad of memberless IF websites. If you want negotation and a resolution of this problem, please stop treating any opinion that is different from yours as an "attack" and start actually <i>listening</i> to what other people have to say. --A rational thinker</dd>

And excuse me for being honest, "cease with the ego trip and start thinking clearly" isn't really open in my opinion. Also, I'd prefer not to continue this discussion where everyone could see- could you please contact me over the AIM name BoMEpsilon?

<p>I wanted to add that I looked at this TBOM website, it may not be very big but it's a decent enough Bionicle website. For one thing it has 250 some registered members, while MoD itself is close to around 1000 members, compared to most IF forums which only have 15 to fifty members. I say it should be linked or something because it looks like a good enough site to me, and it's still growing. The news may not be as plentiful, but the forums seem to be steadily growing, plus someone had to pay for that software right? Why not give the site a chance and just mention it's not a big site, perfect for people who like smaller crowds of people. Or at least thats my opinion in the matter. In the meantime I hope you all will get over discussing whos talking down to who and just say the facts. Keep in mind I was direceted here by someone else and read over it the best I could, so this is my answer based on my research. -Imatron</p>

<p>ATENTION BoMEpsilon: In past talks (off this site) you told Mask of Life owners to stop advertising on wiki, you said it was and old site on which to advertise.

<p><b>This is in reply to various posts since my last</b>. <i>BoMEpsilon</i>: I will admit your behaviour after the fact has left me surprised. As I have said repeatedly, I'm entirely open to hearing possibilites aside from the ones that I deduced. Maybe I'm just not intelligent enough to understand, but if you weren't adding it for advertising, what compelled you to consider tbomonline worthy of "linkage" here? This seems to be the central issue to me, and it would be helpful if you'd explain it. <i>Imatron</i>: I would argue that the fact that a site is a "good" site doesn't necessarily make it worthy of note in an encyclopedia entry. As I have said, I'll be the first to admit that tbomonline seems like a nice little place, but I don't find it worthy of inclusion here. <i>InShaneee</i>: I agree that MNO is not necessarily worthy of reference here, although it is more worthy than tbomonline as I see it. <i>Dark Jedi</i>: I disagree entirely. If a web site is worthy of note on the subject at hand, then it should be linked to, whether official or not. BZPower has recieved financial aid from TLG, two employees of Lego are regular posters, and both it and Mask of Destiny have been linked to on the official Bionicle web site. Bionicle Sector 01 is also incredibly noteworthy; it contains nearly every shred of information on the subject of Bionicle that is available. <i>Toa of Sound</i>: I agree on the initial issue, however I feel compelled to admit that Epsilon hasn't added the link to his site since this debate began. Let's keep anger in check and, as both sides have said, resolve this issue. --A rational thinker</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is in reference to Dark Jedi: Piraka.com is not an official site. The info on that site is false to the storyline, all it is on there is blatant advertisement of the mood the Piraka have. They are not gangsters, they are just evil beings. If anything else, by your definition, it should be removed.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I would have allowed tBoM on this page, but with what you pointed out, I wouldn't anymore. But, now why do you allow that one site on there that's there? --<a href="http://www.biosector01.com" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com" rel="nofollow">Swert of BS01</a>, Staff Member, Graphics Manager</dd>

<p>Guys guys! Com'on! In the direction you're going we're going to end up with ALL the fansites, except maybe BZPower, off the external links list! And if all you can do is dispute about it it aint a half bad idea. Anyway, you're leading the links down a path of destruction.

<p>Mask of Life. MnonlineV3. tBoM. They all used to be on the links list. They are now gone, and there is only 3 links left on the fan sites section. When the Advertising on The Page subject was raised, site owners jumped to defend their sites; they knew that they really <i>were</i> just advertising. BZPower, definetly will stay on, but every other site, Greg a member or not, is going to be crushed by disscussions such as this.

<dd>I disagree, Torritorri. For starters, it's said "In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link." BZP is NOWHERE NEAR a Web Directory of Fansites. So, multiple links should be fine.</dd>

<p>I'm NOT saying all the links except BZP should be off. I'm saying quite the opposite. What is so wrong with having links there? Don't give me that 'nothing exclusive' or 'not big enough' thing.

<dd>There's noting wrong with having links to fan sites, but if they have nothing pertinent to offer, if they are not worthy of note, they should not be linked to here. BZPower is <i>the</i> biggest Bionicle center of information and discussion, the largest Lego fan-site on the entire internet, if I recall correctly. Mask of Destiny is also quite large, has a wealth of information, has been recognized and linked to by TLG (as has BZPower), recieves press kits (as does BZPower), and has Greg Farshety (author of the Bionicle comics and a major member of the Bionicle story team) as a member (as does BZPower). Bionicle Sector 01 probably contains more information on the Bionicle story than Bionicle.com, BZPower, and Mask of Destiny combined (READ: hyperbole&#160;;P), and is <i>definitely</i> a link that should be listed here. Jedizati, I may be simply ignorant, but instead of finding my argument to "not make sense," I'm failing in my endeavour to ascertain rationale in yours. If you could explain this apparent error in my judgement, I'd be much obliged. --A rational thinker</dd>

<p>I'm sorry Swert, but I forgot about the BS01 link. I would include it. However, is this really an "extreme case"?
