<p>User: Mikeeverest1 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Mikeeverest1" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Mikeeverest1" rel="nofollow">contribs</a>) has been making defamatory edits to Sylvia Nasar, no sourcing except for reference to a discussion in a forum and insists on inserting a quote from a book review by her which apparently (to him) reveals anti-Chinese bias. He refuses to discuss his edits and apparently does not like using talk pages or edit summaries. He has already been cautioned (and reverted) by Charles Matthews to explain his edits <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikeeverest1_330c.html" title="User talk:Mikeeverest1">User_talk:Mikeeverest1</a>.</p>
<p>I had previously run across this same editor (based on similarity of user names) as User:Mikeeverest and User:MikeEverest. In all these edits, he clearly has an agenda and bias for including certain kinds of material.</p>
<p>The other current article besides the Nasar one that he seems to like to edit is <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifold_Destiny_b820.html" title="Manifold Destiny">Manifold Destiny</a>, where he basically inserts the same content. In addition to BLP concerns, he likes to insert quotes that are arguably POV and represent only one side of a debate.</p>
<p>Based on his lack of response, I don't hold hope for any kind of fruitful discussion. I believe a clear message needs to be sent that this behavior is not to be tolerated. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 07:51, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are correct, but nevertheless he is Lebanese American and nevertheless he is considered as an Arab.

<dd>More to the point, this seems to be a continuing issue. Now that it's pretty certain that the article isn't deleted and there isn't consensus for a merge, it has moved to a discussion as to whether well-sourced information about his arrests, arguably a major reason for his notability beyond his heritage, belongs in the article. My personal opinion is that this isn't a BLP issue at all, but more eyes to clear this up will only help and not hurt the discussion. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>User:Badlydrawnjeff and I agree in every specific except for my view the arrest and birthdate material stay out as BLP vio, and Badlydrawnjeff's view it remains (if I've mischaracterized that view in any way, it's entirely unintentional). We agree as Wikipedians 100%. Badlydrawnjeff's behavior throughout this discussion has been exemplary, even though we disagree on the merits.

<dd>And, I think that the problem is one of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">undue weight</a>, because the marginally-notable-by-inheritance make good copy when the event is negative, while the majority of their life is apt to be hard, if not impossible, to verify. This is in marked contrast to the genuinely-notable, whose positive accomplishments (if any) are of some interest to reliable sources, and for whom a lack of positive copy creates a fair inference that there is not much positive to say. In cases such as this one, the lack of positive copy can create an unfair inference, hence I question whether articles such as this one can be made NPOV, which I believe to be a BLP issue of some generality. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 23:15, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not as yet a great deal, but when I just looked in, the articles had no negative content whatsoever, so I am not sure of your point. Are you arguing to add negative information or for deletion as fluff pieces? If you want to add an appropriate and measured reference, I suggest the Reader's Digest's formulation about Jenna: her partying antics provided endless fodder for gossip columnists in her college days. Short, avoids undue weight, but communicates the information. Perhaps a similar sentence in Al Gore III would do: a series of brushes with the law in his late teens and early twenties were well-publicized and caused his father substantial embarrassment. We would need a source for the embarrassment, but I do not doubt that one exists. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 23:36, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(response to Hit bull, win steak) My point exactly. If the arrests were mentioned briefly in the father's article, the undue weight would be reduced, because a reader would not expect a complete picture of the son's life, and there would be context. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 00:40, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Apparently, some radio show "outed" this Republican US Senator yesterday, and it is being inserted into his article that he is gay, based on left-wing blogs as sources. I don't have time to take care of this right now, but it needs immediate attention and monitoring. Blatant violation. Secondary sources need to be found before this should even be mentioned at all in the article. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 11:55, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well good luck, Gamaliel, because if you think wild allegations that give no supporting evidence from bloggers, (irregardless of the fact that the subject issued a denial in a reliable source), is appropriate to add to the article of a US Senator, then you are opening a huge can of worms that is going to have your normal watchlist items buzzing like a hive of africanized bees.

<dd>If the story is appropriate for the mainstream media, I don't see what interests are served by keeping it out of Wikipedia. I'm really tired of insinuations from people that by reporting information that professional journalists think is appropriate to cover that Wikipedia editors are somehow acting on some sort of agenda or against the interests of the encyclopedia. Having the full story properly sourced is in the best interests of the project: it makes the article complete and accurate and it provides a disinsentive for drive-by anons to add a half-assed version of the truth, or worse, an inaccurate one which includes him in inappropriate categories such as those you removed. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 20:01, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia is not a breaking news organization. The blogger has offered no evidence, and three days from now, the claims could be retracted or disproven. But the damage to the Senator will have already been done. That opens the door to any blogger making wild claims that happen to get picked up by a reporter fair game for insertion. But fuck it.

<p>If it's controversial, negative, trivial and in a Bio, delete it. This particular view, espoused by one person, not a crime but has only salacious attraction could be deleted on undue weight grounds. But regardless, tabloid items have no business in WP and should be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 21:24, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is this really the kind of crap we need in an encyclopedia or do we let WP become unwitting dupes for poltiical election strategies? Here's the current entry in this bio: "In October 2006, gay rights activist Mike Rogers alleged in his blog and on the syndicated radio program The Ed Schultz Show that Craig had engaged in consensual homosexual relationships. Rogers has produced no evidence to support his claim and refused to identify the source of his information. However, he has said, "I have enough information and corroboration of my sources to protect myself." Craig's spokesman said the allegations "have no basis in fact" and "The senator says the story is completely ridiculous."</p>
<p>Is this really what Wikipedia is striving to become? A collection of blog quotes from political opponents? --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 22:48, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree. How do we merge the "dust settle" policy with the removal requirements of BLP? There are editors actively trying to expand that section by adding rebuttals and denials and rebuttals of denials ad nauseum.

<p>Man, I can hear Crockspot's frustration at trying to uphold any sort of BLP standards on Wiki: he's been hard at it for a long time, doing a good and fair job, and IMO, it's a losing battle. I've concluded the policy has no teeth, and those of us who have put ourselves in the line of fire trying to uphold <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> might as well stop trying, and let the Foundation deal with whatever fallout occurs from neglecting what was supposed to be a strong policy. For what it's worth to whomever is still willing to work on BLPs, I support the position taken here by Crockspot, TBeatty, Plange, Aaron, and others. Wiki should be more than Google or a blog or a tabloid, but that is what it's becoming. Every breaking rumor doesn't belong in an encyclopedic bio. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 21:38, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is still seriously biased against him. The 2nd sentence says he "denies the predominant scientific views" and then the 3rd says "considered pseudoscience". The latter is just gratuitous name-calling. The 2nd sentence is enough to make the point.</p>
<p>The sentence about scientists questioning his objectivity and motivation is also an unnecessary attack. The quote about his religion speaks for itself. The sentence suggests that there is some scientific reason to question his religion and motivation. Let the reader decide.</p>
<p>Then Wells is criticized for his "low level of output". This is silly for a WP bio page. Just describe his accomplishments and let the reader decide whether they are impressive or not.</p>
<p>Finally, the article claims that Wells contradicted himself in his 2005 Kansas testimony. This looks like just another cheap shot. I am not even sure what the contradiction is supposed to be. I think it is that he said he looked at the evidence for evolution, but not for the age of the Earth. He is quoted as saying that "the earth is probably four-and-a-half billion or so years old". I don't see what's wrong with this quote. He is not a geologist, and there is no contradiction. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">Roger</a> 17:45, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We've been over this before. The earlier comments are not name-calling since something can (and often is) a dominant scientific view but is not pseudoscience; the sentence about scientists is again accurate so I don't see what the issue is. It doesn't seem to be any more of an attack than any other note of criticism. As to the final point- the relevant contradiction is his claim that he looked at the evidence for evolution which contradicts his claim in his book that he went into biology to "destroy Darwinism". <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:53, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JoshuaZ, your comments don't make any sense. The one about "dominant scientific view" appears to be missing a word or two. I agree that Wells denies some dominant scientific views. I don't agree that his views can be neutrally called pseudoscience. Wrong maybe, but not pseudoscience. The quote about destroying Darwinism is from an essay, not from his book, according to the article. But either way, the article says "Wells contradicted his earlier testimony", not that he contradicted some essay or book that he wrote years earlier. And what you say is a contradiction is not even a contradiction. If indeed his purpose was still to destroy Darwinism, then examining the evidence would seem like a good way to go about that. Wells might very well say, "I looked at the evidence for evolution so I could write books attacking Darwinism, in the hopes of eventually destroying it." (I don't know him; I am just guessing.) <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">Roger</a> 23:22, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, I meant something can have the dominant scientific view disagree with it and still not be pseudoscience. In so far as that, it being pseudoscience is relevant. As to calling it pseudoscience, it is and we have sources that say so. If you have an issue with that you should be arguing about it on the intelligent design page, not on a separate biography. As to it not possibly being a contradiction, looking into it more it clearly is a contradiction, because in his testimony he says that "I became convinced that the Darwinian theory is false because it conflicts with the evidence" which is a clear contradiction. Thanks for pointing out the poor phrasing. I've rephrased it to make it more clear. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 23:37, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please spell out the contradiction, as I don't see it. Suppose that Rev. Moon persuaded Wells that Darwinism is evil, for reasons that are unknown to me. At that time Wells may or may not have looked at the evidence for and against evolution. Again, I don't know and it is not obvious from the article. Later, Wells say that he looked at the evidence, and came to some conclusions about it. So what's the problem? Wells wrote 2 books on the subject, so obviously he looked at the evidence and drew his own conclusions. Of all the Wells' quotes to pick on, I think that you look really silly attacking this one. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">Roger</a> 01:15, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I hope you don't mind that I correct the name. It seems Brook not Brooke. Which last line? You don't think it might be interesting who sponsored the event?</p>
<p>The above Brook caught my attention in a O'Reilly Factor video on the net. I wasn't aware it is pretty old by now. As I wasn't aware that he is used in a campaign by the LaRouche Youth movement. But that does not make his statements less frightening. Personally I would support the originally included transcript: Said it said. And I watched it twice. My problem is that the only transcript on the net comes from LaRouchie circles. I'd appreciate a comment or a helping hand.

Subject has added prod to his own bio, complaining of his inability to deal with hostile edits. There was no BLP or WPBio template, so I quickly added WPBio living=yes to the talk page, and came here to report the matter. I'm not sure what the controversy is who (or who is right), and it may be a tempest in a teapot, but I thought it better to report it here, and let wiser and more experienced folks investigate, rather than simply letting the situation continue to devolve. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 05:54, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Correction: I misread the prod; it was apparently not filed by Mr. Richards, who may not actually be directly involved.

Apparently non-notable NZ aviator, currently prodded, was blanked. When a bot reverted the blanking, an anonymous complaint appeared on the talk page that the article "contains several flagrant factual inaccuracies, these coupled with its satirical tone risk damaging reputation." While I don't see anything in the article that would lead to such a complaint, I think the complaint, coupled with the non-notable nature of the subject, easily justifies a quick removal as an attack page. (I've checked Google, and there is a NZ aviator named "Dane Dickinson", and none of the links I saw would support a claim of notability.) <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 21:56, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Help needed at the <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Phillipe_Rushton_f9b1.html" title="J. Phillipe Rushton">J. Phillipe Rushton</a> aricle</span></h2>
<p>2 editors named Ramdrake and JereKrischel dominate this article and have removed all encyclopedic content from this article and have used selective quotes to try to portray a qualified and objective academic as an incompetent racist. This type of libel goes against wikipedia's rules for biographies on living persons. Also, people researching Rushton do so to learn about the theories for which he is best known, not to read a list of selectively chosen quotes trashing the man. I find this article very biased, one sided, boring, and libelous. Now that the article is semi-protected against new users like me, I encourage anyone concerned with the rules of living persons articles to revert back to my version of the article. 205.211.50.10 02:02, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>JereKrischel has also done this at the Arthur Jensen article and attempted to make radical, unilateral deletions and changes at the Mismeasure of Man article. The Jensen additions are potentially libelous. IMO JereKrischel seems to have a history of presenting one-sided viewpoints both in his deletions and additions to articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to point out that: 1)A biography article is not the right place to explain in-depth the theories of that person. 2)The criticism in the article is in fact representative of the opinion people have of this researcher in scientific circles, mostly anthroplogy and psychology (as the subject is "race and intelligence"). The quotes are not selective, they are indeed representative. I would also like to remind the user not to "encourage anyone... to revert back... the article". This is an encouragement to edit warring, and contrary to the guidelines of Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamdrake_04b4.html" title="User:Ramdrake">Ramdrake</a> 12:02, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree that help is needed. The Rushton article is very biased. A certain editor(s) invested a huge amount of time surfing the web to find every anti-Rushton quote they could find and put it in the article. I come to wikipedia to get a comprehensive overview of the views for which an academic is known, and not a series of quotes trashing the man. Most distubing is that certain editors have used very circumstancial evidence to imply that Rushton is a racist. <a href="../../../l/i/k/User%7ELiketoread_c5f4.html" title="User:Liketoread">Liketoread</a> 18:30, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't like his theories myself. However a biography is supposed to be about the person. Since the real interest here seems to be in the theories there should be an article on them and this one reduced greatly with a link directing them to the other.

<p><a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">User:FeloniousMonk</a> keeps adding these sentences to the <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phyllis_Schlafly_99d0.html" title="Phyllis Schlafly">Phyllis Schlafly</a> bio page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Early on, Schlafly was aquainted with the far right and male unreliability when the Depression threw her father into long-term unemployment and her mother, entering the labor market, was able to keep the family afloat, including maintaining Schlafly in an elite Catholic girls' school that stressed Christian anti-Communism (Ehrenreich 152-153).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sheltered by her husband Fred Schlafly's ample income and assisted by a part-time housekeeper, the woman who would insist that "she had no intention of following in her mother's footsteps and becoming -- even voluntarily -- a career woman" (Ehrenreich 153) ironically developed a new career as a one-woman propagandist for the far-right, consequently making it more difficult for any women to forge a career in the paid labor force (Ehrenreich 153).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have contested these sentences on the Talk page, and no one there is even defending the accuracy or appropriateness of the sentences. Instead, a couple of people have merely argued that I should not remove the sentences because of who I am, or because there is a citation to a source.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">User:KillerChihuahua</a> even placed a 24-hour block on me from even posting to the Talk page, because I complained that <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">User:FeloniousMonk</a> was repeatedly inserting the sentences without even commenting on the Talk page. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">Roger</a> 17:34, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, but it could be argued that citing a source is a defence of an insertion. Could you address the issue of why the source is inadequate? I think the issue of whether you should edit the page is largely a red herring. I do think you should avoid it, but the important question is whether or not the article currently says the right thing. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 19:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

He called another editor a "vandal" for reverting his whitewash of his mother's article, in addition to other incivilities. My block summary was <i>Time out to consider attitude, note placed on talk page</i> ane the note is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASchlafly&amp;diff=83187383&amp;oldid=81005592" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASchlafly&amp;diff=83187383&amp;oldid=81005592" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

So he did not block me to get me to read <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>; I had already read it and explained myself.

<dd>Yes, I know why <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">User:KillerChihuahua</a> blocked me.

<p>Accusations of vandalism, lies and bad faith isn't going to get us anywhere but a big flame war.

<dd>Matt, let me get your position straight. You know nothing about the subject matter, except that you have some personal issue with me and you don't want me editing the article. You think that FeloniousMonk's bias is so embarrassing that you have gone so far as to delete his only comment on the Talk page.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Phyllis_Schlafly&amp;curid=2134790&amp;diff=84114096&amp;oldid=84113163" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Phyllis_Schlafly&amp;curid=2134790&amp;diff=84114096&amp;oldid=84113163" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>] And yet you support his edits to the article. You think that Ehrenreich is biased because the attributed text calls Phyllis Schlafly a "propagandist" and uses the word "ironically".[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phyllis_Schlafly&amp;curid=322375&amp;diff=84113662&amp;oldid=84095895" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phyllis_Schlafly&amp;curid=322375&amp;diff=84113662&amp;oldid=84095895" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] And yet you continue to take the position that the rest of the disputed text should stand solely because (1) FeloniousMonk put it there; (2) it cites Ehrenreich and you usually favor leaving in any text that has a citation; and (3) you don't think that I should be allowed to edit it.</dd>

<dd>No, on the contrary, you have made numerous errors. Specifically, then: no, I don't have "some personal issue" with you. I think you, like anyone else, should avoid editing an article on your own mother because there exists a conflict of interest. No, I don't have an opinion about FeloniousMonk's bias, but I thought his comment was very unhelpful and not relevant to the matter at hand, so I removed it. No, I don't at present have any opinion about the merit of FeloniousMonk's edits to the article, other than agreeing with the NPOV issue pointed out on the talk page. Regarding (1), no, I don't think the identify of FeloniousMonk as the editor who put it there has much relevance; (2) no, I think it is poor practice to remove sourced statements without any explanation being given as to what the problem is; (3) no, as per Wikipedia guidelines, I think you should <i>avoid</i> editing the article, as there exists a conflict of interest as mentioned above. Instead, you should liberally make use of the talk page to point out problems. The fastest way to get such issues resolved is to state clearly and precisely what problems you see with statements and suggest ways they could be fixed. The slowest way is to remove sourced, negative statements about your own mother without explanation and simply assert their falsehood. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 17:59, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You you alternate between saying that I should "avoid" editing the article, and saying that I should not edit it at all. Which is it?</dd>

<dd>As far as I recall, I have said that you "should avoid editing" the article, and I have asked you to refrain from editing the article. I don't believe that's inconsistent. I don't so much "oppose" your edits, but rather I've tried to argue two points: 1) you should avoid editing an article in which you have a conflict of interest -- use the talk page instead; and 2) when removing sourced statements, you should be willing to provide some explanation of what problem you see with them (particularly when asked repeatedly by more than one admin). I'm not your enemy, Roger.

<p>Is there anyone here who thinks that Ehrenreich is a neutral and reliable source for the disputed sentences listed above? Is there anyone who thinks that the disputed sentences are accurate and appropriate for a biographical page? Is there anyone who is willing to defend those sentences on the Talk page? <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">Roger</a> 19:42, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having never heard of Schlafly or Ehrenreich before now, can you please tell me why <i>you</i> think that Ehrenreich is unreliable? That will help us sort this out, thanks! --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlange_d466.html" title="User:Plange">plange</a> 20:16, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if you know nothing about Schlafly or Ehrenreich, it should be apparent that the disputed sentences are not neutral, use loaded terminology, and present opinion as fact. For example, consider the description of Schlafly as a "propagandist for the far-right", followed by the bizarre claim that she made it "more difficult for any women to forge a career". Are you just a little curious about how someone you've never heard of somehow made it difficult for women to get jobs? Just imagine if the biography of Hillary Clinton said that she was a propagandist for the far-left who has made it more difficult for any woman to be a housewife. Would you think that it was a NPOV statement that just needed a good footnote? <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">Roger</a> 01:31, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>uh, being openly opposed to the Equal Rights Amendment is certainly not logically inconsistent with the statement, made it "more difficult for any women to forge a career." The comparison with Clinton is sophistry, in my opinion, and a more appropriate comparison would be saying that someone who was opposed to racially integrated schools made it more difficult for African-Americans to attend colleges. Moreover, Schlafly openly aligned herself with the far right/Barry Goldwater, etc., and I remember clearly that the New Yorker article by Kohlbert noted that Schlafly was not just a propagandist for the far-right, but an especially skilled and talented propagandist. Hence Ehrenreich's observation could have <i>at least</i> more than one citation. Last but not least, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Ehrenreich_228a.html" title="Barbara Ehrenreich">Barbara Ehrenreich</a> is quite a notable writer/reliable source--her book <i>Nickeled and Dimed</i> was on the New York Times bestseller list for quite a while. It is true that she openly professes the opposite political views of Schlafly, but you need a reliable source/sources which refute that Schlafly was a propagandist for the far-right and that opposing the ERA didn't make it harder for women to seek and gain employment. It is merely your opinion that Ehrenreich says this *because* she is biased or that her comments are biased because they are critical--she's too good of a writer/notable figure to be dismissed as a cited source because she "sounds biased" to the son of the subject, and what she says is logically consistent with what Schlafly said about herself/what other people say about Schlafly. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 02:45, 31 October 2006 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whether or not Ehrenreich is a good writer or a notable figure, there is no consensus that the ERA would have made it easier for women to forge careers. I think that about 20 states voted against ERA -- do you think that they were all trying to make it difficult for women to forge careers? Even if you think that, it is just an opinion that you will not find in any objective source.</dd>
<dd>Yes, Schlafly supported Goldwater, but that does not make her a "propagandist for the far-right". Not even the Goldwater WP page describes him as "far-right" or his supporters as being necessarily far-right. You may have the opinion that he is on the far-right, but that is only an opinion that a Goldwater detractor would have. A neutral biography could say that Schlafly supported Goldwater and opposed the ERA, and let the reader decide whether such views are good or bad. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">Roger</a> 03:20, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>..no one is making the assessment that views are "good" or "bad"--only whether how they are stated is controversial or not, per published, reliable secondary sources--not our opinions. Since Ehrenreich's statements are not controversial to anyone but you so far, they are not controversial--you need a source that states Ehrenreich's comments are controversial because they are contradicted by &lt;blank&gt;. On the contrary, it seems that Ehrenreich's comments are not only not controversial, but are consistent with the subject's self-affiliation/self-description--the opposite of controversial. (Shlafly affiliated with the far-right, and opposed women working outside the home...) I assure you that if this is truly controversial, <i>other people</i> will make the same argument you are making/there would be sources to cite. Ehrenreich is a published, reliable secondary source that could only be countered by another published, reliable secondary source--not the unpublished opinion her son. <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 03:57, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If what you say were true, then there is no need to consult any secondary source. No one has to take my word for it either. Just find a quote where Schlafly identifies herself as "far-right" or where she opposed women working outside the home. Many of her writings are freely available online, so just use Google. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">Roger</a> 06:18, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>...you are a new enough editor that you don't understand that if you object to a cited source, the onus is on you to supply a counter citation?

<p>Sorry, Roger, but you are clearly demonstrating a complete <i>lack</i> of basic understanding of WP policies and guidelines. You are: 1. carrying out the debate instead of reporting on it via a source 3. violating <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> by referring to other editors as "enemies," and failing to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> ("assume good faith") by accusing them of violating all the rules, etc. You are doing what we call "exhausting the community's patience"--a number of your fellow editors have asked you <i>over and over again</i> now to focus on the issue, not on personally arguing your opinions without sources and/or making ad hominem arguments against fellow editors. Wikipedia will welcome you with open arms, if you could please make an effort to do research, cite sources, and stop making personal attacks/arguing your opinions. If you read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, you would already know that "Wikipedia is not a battleground." <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 22:15, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"<i>I know the WP guidelines. I know how primary sources are to be preferred over secondary ones</i>". That is not a Wikipedia guideline at all; actually, the reverse is closer to the truth. Wikipedia is a tertiary source, and so secondary sources are our usual fare; primary sources can be used, but they need to be used with caution.

<dl>
<dd>Matt, you make a good point. A WP biographical article could reasonably be based on other published biographies, and those biographies would normally be considered secondary sources and good material for a WP biographical page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Phyllis Schlafly's life story has been told many times by people who had access to primary sources. There are two full-length biographies, as well as numerous articles in reputable newspapers and magazines. There is no serious dispute about the basic facts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But instead, we have a WP dispute over some bizarre name-calling that appears to be extracted from an adverse political book by Ehrenreich. Some of it is just weird, such as citing a "school that stressed Christian anti-Communism". There were no such schools. Other parts are obviously biased and antagonistic, such a "propagandist for the far-right".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I mention primary sources because Cindery's argument relied on what she claimed was the "subject's self-affiliation/self-description". There is really no need to debate or make any mistake about Phyllis Schlafly's self-affiliation and self-description because thousands of her writings, interviews, and quotes are freely available online. Cindery is mistaken.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If a someone wants a WP biographical page on Phyllis Schlafly to describe her views, then the proper way is to either quote her, or to quote some neutral reporter who has at least read what she has to say. It is not proper to just cherry-pick a couple of opinionated sentences from a political adversary who badmouths her, and then write it in WP as a fact. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">Roger</a> 04:26, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It would be great, Roger, if you could find sources which contradict Ehrenreich, and <i>cite them.</i> Then perhaps her comments could be moved to controversy section, with the alternate source(s). You're still arguing your opinions. Wikipedia cannot publish your opinions. Since no alternate citations have been provided, Ehrenreich's comments do not appear to be controversial to anyone but you (and seem consistent with what another cited source--Kohlbert-- says, and with the subject's own stated political views.) You need to <i>cite sources</i> is my argument. It appears to me that you may just object to Ehrenreich--you claim that she "hates" your mother on the article talkpage. It doen't seem to be that she hates your mother, but that she has the opposite political views. If you can make the case via <i>sources</i> that someone besides you disagrees with Ehrenreich and the <i>The New Yorker,</i> then as I said, maybe Ehrenreich could be moved to "controversy." But a cited source like Ehrenreich cannot be removed--NPOV is not the elimination of viewpoints. Let me say this, hopefully for the last time: please <i>do research, find sources, and cite sources to make your case.</i> <a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 06:05, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>What, then, is the point of you saying that "it seems that Ehrenreich's comments are not only not controversial, but are consistent with the subject's self-affiliation/self-description--the opposite of controversial"? Did you cite some self-description and claim it's consistent with Ehrenreich? (And if you did, does this claim of consistency involve enough interpretation to be original research?)</dd>
<dd>As for your comparison to someone who "made it more difficult for African-Americans to attend colleges", that absolutely does not belong if all you have to support it is that they opposed integrated schools. Wikipedia may not make the connection between opposing integration and making it harder for blacks to go to college, and Wikipedia may not make the connection between opposing the ERA and making it harder for women to work.</dd>
<dd>And if someone else makes one of those connections, we may not treat it as fact. Since it is sourced, you can include it, but since it's an opinion, not a fact, you can't treat it as a fact the same way that "Phyllis Schafly was born in 1924" is a fact. You would have to describe it as a criticism and say something like "Noted author Ehrenreich criticizes Schafly's actions in the belief that they made it difficult for women to work." <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 19:28, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not here to write this article. I was just trying to correct some malicious edits. What we have here is a couple of disputed opinion statements that are presented as facts. They are justified because Ehrenreich supposedly calls Phyllis Schlafly a "propagandist for the far-right" in an adverse political book, and Cindery remembers reading a magazine article where Kohlbert used some similar name-calling. Is this correct? If not, please clarify. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchlafly_87ac.html" title="User:Schlafly">Roger</a> 04:11, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. There are plenty of bios that mention the parents and their occupation, who by themselves are not notable. It helps set the context for this person's life. Where does the subject come from? What could have influenced him/her? For example, being the son of a coal miner would be important to know about a subject, while the coal miner father would not be notable. I do it as a general rule for any bio I create. Children of the subject, I treat differently. I only mention them if they're notable.

<dd>I quote from WP:BLP as I did to Amoruso in explaining my last revert, "Editors should remove any controversial material about living persons that is either unsourced, relies upon sources that do not meet standards specified in Wikipedia:Reliable sources, or is a conjectural interpretation of a source. In cases where the information is derogatory and poorly sourced or unsourced, this kind of edit is an exception to the three-revert rule. These principles apply to biographical material about living persons found anywhere in Wikipedia, including user and talk pages. <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.html" title="Stormfront">Stormfront</a> is not a reliable source per WP:RS, and the link Amoruso gave to an open thread on that site that posted Giladi's article. On the basis on that citation he proceeded to claim that Giladi was popular among neo-Nazis and changed the section heading where he included this information from "Relevance to the Arab-Israeli conflict" to "Use by anti-Zionists", thus equating anti-Zionism with neo-Nazism. Now, the heading is entitled simply "Controversy". Amoruso has of a few hours ago desisted from trying to include the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.html" title="Stormfront">Stormfront</a> link and info, and instead chosen to repeatedly attempt to include a sentence completely unrelated to Giladi himself from an article by Henry Makow that conveys Makow's controversial views on Hamas. This citation, material and inclusion at this point in the article is non-sequiter, irrelevant, defamatory (by associating Giladi tendentiously with neo-Nazis and then, unrelated conspiracy theories) and clearly an an attempt at POV pushing. Amoruso's approach to this article from the outset has consistently been to reject the plausibility of Giladi's claims and attempt to demonize and/or undermine his legitimacy through his POV edits. Note too, that he has repeatedly overwritten a perfectly valid and illustrative citation from Jews Against Zionism that was aimed to provide relevant information and evidence of Giladi's popularity among anti-Zionist Jews with his edits. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 00:06, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tiamut's description is faulty and does not accurately represent anything. "claim that Giladi was popular among neo-Nazis" is a false accusation by Tiamut. A featured article in the prominent web-site <b>means his ARTICLE is a regularly quoted, not him.</b> It has in fact nothing to do with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <b>Henry Makow discusses Giladi's article DIRECTLY like explained</b>. It again has nothing to do with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> - in fact, it's Tiamut who wants to make the page about the ISSUE and not the person , as the article really doesn't deal with the person at all but with his book/article. Finally, his last accusation trying to analyse my motives are a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>.

<dd>That Naeim Giladi's article was posted by a user at an open-thread on a neo-Nazi website certainly does not constitute a "featured article" nor has Amoruso provided evidence of his being "regularly quoted" at such sites. As I have pointed out in the past, the article posted at the open-thread did not garner even one comment of feedback. Further, using extremist websites to defame a person through guilt by association is deeply frowned upon in WP:BLP, a fact that Amoruso is failing to acknowledge. I made no personal attack on Amoruso and have faithfully described his actions as I see them which is not a violation of WP:AGF or WP:NPA. Finally, the quote from Makow, while in an article in which he mentions Giladi, is not related to Giladi's book, article or any of the arguments he has made; i.e. it is totally irrelevant.
