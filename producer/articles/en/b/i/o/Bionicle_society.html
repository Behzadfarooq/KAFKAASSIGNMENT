<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Biology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biology</span></h2>
<p>Nearly all lifeforms seen in Bionicle are biomechanical, with a few exceptions like <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krana.html" title="Krana">Krana</a> and <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraata.html" title="Kraata">Kraata</a> being completely organic, while <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html" title="Bohrok">Bohrok</a> are fully mechanical (while Bohrok seem to be grown, other machine beings are manmade and not considered lifeforms). Organic parts of creatures are very similar to real-world biological systems; for instance, Matoran are known to have lungs and muscles like humans do. The mechanical halves tend to include things like armor, hydraulic cylinders, gears, etc. built into their forms, and Matoran also have glowing "heartlights" on their chests; these mechanical parts are not electronic like computers in the real world, but are rather <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clockwork.html" title="Clockwork">clockwork</a> mechanisms with gears, pistons, etc.</p>
<p>Because of this, lifeforms have exceptionally long lifespans easily reaching tens of thousands of years. Matoran have also shown the ability to rebuild themselves if necessary; the ones living on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mata_Nui_%28Island%29_22b7.html" title="Mata Nui (Island)">Mata Nui</a> rebuilt themselves into stronger forms soon after the Bohrok attacks. And over the thousand years they spent in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html#Toa_Canisters" title="List of objects in Bionicle">Toa Canisters</a>, the <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Mata_4221.html" title="Toa Mata">Toa Mata</a>'s organic parts decayed, but immediately regrew as they reassembled their mechanical parts upon arriving on Mata Nui.</p>
<p>Matoran, at least, "eat" by absorbing energy directly from objects. On <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metru_Nui_f34e.html" title="Metru Nui">Metru Nui</a>, Matoran could go to a place in Ga-Metru to recharge once a year. In more primitive conditions, they have to "snack" more often on things like fruits, berries, and fish.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>There is absolutely no reproduction in the Bionicle universe. How new Matoran come into being is unknown, but they are "born" fully grown. But terms of family are not unheard of: <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa.html" title="Toa">Toa</a> refer to each other as "brothers" and "sisters", recognizing their common bond as comrades-in-arms; this often extends to former Toa like <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahaga.html" title="Rahaga">Rahaga</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makuta.html" title="Makuta">Makuta</a> also has a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Makuta_5c64.html" title="Brotherhood of Makuta">Brotherhood</a>, and has referred to its members as his "brothers"; he also uses this term when referring to <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mata_Nui_%28Great_Spirit%29_858e.html" title="Mata Nui (Great Spirit)">Mata Nui</a>, presumably referring to their once shared role of protecting the Matoran, and refers to the <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahkshi.html" title="Rahkshi">Rahkshi</a> as his sons . <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidorak.html" title="Sidorak">Sidorak</a> often proposed marriage to <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roodaka.html" title="Roodaka">Roodaka</a>, though in Bionicle "marriage" is merely a form of political alliance.</p>
<p>There has also been a little romance: <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Metru_9e96.html" title="Toa Metru">Toa Matau</a> occasionally flirted with <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Metru_9e96.html" title="Toa Metru">Toa Nokama</a>, and in the franchise's first year <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Hahli" title="List of Matoran">Hahli</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Macku" title="List of Matoran">Macku</a> had relationships with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Jaller" title="List of Matoran">Jaller</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Hewkii" title="List of Matoran">Hewkii</a>, respectively; however, since that time romance has been downplayed and even outright ignored, as the storyline is geared towards preteen boys; and as a consequence the relationships between Matoran have turned from romantic to close friendship.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Elemental Powers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Elemental Powers</span></h3>
<p>Several races in the Bionicle universe wield powers based on <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_elements.html" title="Classical elements">classical elements</a>. The basic range of powers over these elements include creating the element, controlling it in any form, absorbing it into the body, firing it in some kind of beam, and unleashing it in a massive explosion called a "Nova Blast".</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa.html" title="Toa">Toa</a> are the best-known wielders of elemental abilities; with their only real limit being that if they use this power excessively, they use up elemental energy and must wait for it to regenerate. If six Toa of different elements combine their power, they can create sealed prisons of solid <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protodermis.html" title="Protodermis">protodermis</a> that only be broken by a combination of the same six elements; no other elementally-powered beings have this ability. <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga</a>, which are depowered Toa, retain a minimal amount of elemental power that they once had.</li>
<li>The six <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html" title="Bohrok">Bohrok</a> breeds are each affiliated with one of the six basic elements (except for Lehvak, which have the power of Swamp instead of Air). Their power is limited to merely firing their element from their hand shields (or in the case of Pahrak and Nuhvok, firing a beam that affects their element). The Bohrok Queens, the <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html#The_Bahrag" title="Bohrok">Bahrag</a>, have greater control over these six elements.</li>
<li>Each of the six <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html#Bohrok-Kal" title="Bohrok">Bohrok-Kal</a> is powered with a secondary or non-Toa element, which they can use in an offensive mode or a defensive mode.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/k/Makuta.html" title="Makuta">Makuta</a> has control over several secondary and non-Toa elements, primarily that of Shadow. As his offspring, some breeds of <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraata.html" title="Kraata">Kraata</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahkshi.html" title="Rahkshi">Rahkshi</a> can wield these powers as well.</li>
<li>The beings known as <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piraka.html" title="Piraka">Piraka</a> each have a basic elemental power, but they can <i>only</i> access these powers by combining their element with that of another Piraka.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Basic Elements">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Basic Elements</span></h4>
<p>These six elements are the most common in the Bionicle universe; every major team of Toa seen so far is made up of one Toa of each of these elements:</p>
<p><b>Fire</b>: Fire-powered beings can control heat and flame; including creating fireballs, heating air to slow a fall, and even absorbing all the heat out of an area.</p>
<p><b>Water</b>: Those with the power of water can do things like create tidal waves and jets of water, and absorb moisture from the immediate area. It should be noted that there are two types of "water" in the Bionicle world: liquid <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protodermis.html" title="Protodermis">protodermis</a> and what is assumed to be normal H<sub>2</sub>O water; water-powered beings can control both equally.</p>
<p><b>Air</b>: The elemental power of air can create tornadoes and cyclones, manipulate wind currents for flying and gliding, and create a vacuum by absorbing all air in an area.</p>
<p><b>Stone</b>: Stone-powered beings can control sand and rock; including creating rock walls and sandstorms, shaping rock into different forms, and detecting stress points in stone walls. The power of stone cannot effect terrain and soil.</p>
<p><b>Earth</b>: Beings of the earth can cause earthquakes and raise walls of dirt and soil; these beings often use this power to excel at tunneling underground. The power of Earth does not affect sand and rock.</p>
<p><b>Ice</b>: Ice-powered beings are masters of the cold; being able to lower temperatures in the immediate area, create ice structures, and freeze enemies solid.</p>
<p><a name="Secondary_Elements" id="Secondary_Elements"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Secondary Elements">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Secondary Elements</span></h4>
<p>The following elements are elements besides the basic ones that are known to be controlled by Toa.</p>
<p><b>Gravity</b>: Those with the power of gravity can increase gravity to the point that people and objects become so heavy they cannot move, or decrease it to the point that they become lighter than air and float away.</p>
<p><b>Light</b>: The elemental power of light can create paralyzing beams of light, cover the user in a glowing aura, projecting deadly laser beams, creating objects or structures out of light, and absorb all the light in an area. Light is very powerful against its opposite element of Shadow; and since the universe's primary Shadow beings, the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Makuta_5c64.html" title="Brotherhood of Makuta">Makuta</a>, have turned evil, Light is considered inherently good. <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takanuva.html" title="Takanuva">Takanuva</a> is the world's first and only Toa of Light, though <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Mata_Nui_1478.html#Umbra" title="Order of Mata Nui">Umbra</a> is also known for his light-based powers.</p>
<p><b>Magnetism</b>: Magnetically-powered beings can increase or decrease the magnetic field in an area, or attract or repel metal objects.</p>
<p><b>Plants</b>: Those with control over plants can presumably do things like summon vines, thorned plants, flowers, trees or whatever other plant life would be useful. This element has no official name yet, but series writer <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Farshtey_e905.html" title="Greg Farshtey">Greg Farshtey</a> has unofficially dubbed it "The Green" in reference to <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swamp_Thing_e627.html" title="Swamp Thing">Swamp Thing</a>.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Plasma</b>: Beings with plasma power can turn objects into superheated plasma, fire beams of plasma, and absorb plasma into their bodies.</p>
<p><b>Sonics</b>: The elemental power of sonics can create and control sound waves, use sonic waves to disrupt a structure's integrity, and absorb all the sound in an area.</p>
<p><a name="Non-Toa_Elements" id="Non-Toa_Elements"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Non-Toa Elements">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Non-Toa Elements</span></h4>
<p>The following are unofficially considered elements, though there are no known Toa with these powers.</p>
<p><b>Acid/Swamp</b>: This is considered an element because it is wielded by the Bohrok breed Lehvak, where the other five Bohrok breeds control basic elements. Lehvak are officially designated as Bohrok of Swamp, and are able to spray a large amount of incredibly corrosive acid that is capable of eating through any substance.</p>
<p><b>Electricity</b>: Considered an element because the Bohrok-Kal Tahnok-Kal has this power; the <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Inika_188c.html" title="Toa Inika">Toa Inika</a> also have lightning as a secondary effect to their regular elemental powers. Electrically-powered beings can create and control lightning, shock the opponent with a burst of electricity, and absorb all the electricity in an area. The only reason this is not considered a Toa element is that we have not yet seen a Toa of Electricity.</p>
<p><b>Life</b>: Life is a powerful element that is too powerful to be wielded by a Toa; perhaps by any being. This power can evolve existing life and give life to inanimate objects;<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> and it can take life away as well. The only object known to contain the power of Life is the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanohi.html#Ignika" title="Kanohi">Kanohi Ignika</a>, though <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makuta.html#Takutanuva" title="Makuta">Takutanuva</a> has been known to do what the Ignika could not and return life to the dead.</p>
<p><b>Shadow</b>: Those with the power of Shadow can creating blasts and beams of shadow energy, creating objects or structures from shadows, spread shadow to hinder visibility, and absorb all the darkness in an area. Shadow is very weak against the element of Light. Only the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Makuta_5c64.html" title="Brotherhood of Makuta">Brotherhood of Makuta</a> members have this power; it will never be used by Toa because originally, there was no need for more Shadow beings beyond the Brotherhood and now, Shadow is considered evil and Toa are not evil.</p>
<p><b>Time</b>: An elemental ability that allows the wielder to control and manipulate time itself; like the power of Life, Time is far too powerful to truly be wielded by Toa or any being. Examples of elemental time abilities include speeding up or slowing down time in a certain area or around a target; but not the ability to <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_travel.html" title="Time travel">time travel</a>. The only object known to contain the power of Time is the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanohi.html#Vahi" title="Kanohi">Kanohi Vahi</a>; though <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Hunters_8396.html#Voporak" title="Dark Hunters">Voporak</a> is also known for having time-based powers.</p>
<p><b>Vacuum</b>: Wielded by the Bohrok-Kal Lehvak-Kal; who can suck all the air in an area and create a vacuum, and then send that sucked up air back at a target in a single powerful blast. In truth, Vacuum will never be recognized as an official Toa element because these things could be done by a skilled Toa of Air.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Merging" id="Merging"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Merging">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Merging</span></h3>
<p>A few races are able to merge into stronger beings, with the merged form not only combining the individual beings' strength and energies, but amplifying them. Merged forms made up of three beings are called "Kaita", while those of six beings are called "Nui". Races that have demonstrated merging powers fall into one of two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matoran and related races (Turaga and Toa). <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matoran.html#Matoran_Nui" title="Matoran">Matoran Nui</a> have been formed on two separate occasions, and the <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Mata_4221.html" title="Toa Mata">Toa Mata</a> have been known to form <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa.html#Toa_Kaita" title="Toa">Toa Kaita</a>. Interestingly, the two Toa Kaita seen have their own unique names and personalities, being called "Akamai, Toa Kaita of Valor" and "Wairuha, Toa Kaita of Wisdom".</li>
<li>Races where shells are controlled by separate intelligences: Bohrok (driven by <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krana.html" title="Krana">Krana</a>) and Rahkshi (driven by <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraata.html" title="Kraata">Kraata</a>). In these cases, the Kaita being's mind is not shared between the three intelligences (either Krana or Kraata), but rather one becomes dominant and the merged being takes the dominant mind's name as its own. Rahkshi Kaita also have an additional ability separate from the powers of their component Rahkshi.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Sports">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h2>
<p>In their free time, the Matoran enjoy taking part in several kinds of sports. Sports champions were awarded special copper-colored <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanohi.html" title="Kanohi">Kanohi</a> Masks as trophies, called <i>Copper Masks of Victory</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Mata Nui Sports">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mata Nui Sports</span></h3>
<p>On the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mata_Nui_%28Island%29_22b7.html" title="Mata Nui (Island)">island of Mata Nui</a>, the six villages were isolated from each other, and each developed its own sport of choice. Once the <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html#Bohrok-Kal" title="Bohrok">Bohrok-Kal</a> were defeated and the island was more united, kolhii became the sport of choice for the whole island.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ignalu Lava Surfing</b>: Ignalu lava surfing is the popular sport of Ta-Koro, where racers use lavaboards to travel across the lava. The Tren Krom Break is the site of numerous Ignalu competitions.</li>
<li><b>Ngalawa Boat Race</b>: The most popular sport of Ga-Koro; players use boats in Hura-Mufa River races. Contestants were organised into four teams - red, blue, green and yellow - and each team was assigned to a boat. The first team to reach the end of the river won. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Macku" title="List of Matoran">Macku</a> is one of Ga-Koro's best boaters and a Copper Mask winner.</li>
<li><b>Kewa Bird Riding</b>: This is the Le-Koro village sport. In the game, the players ride the small Kewa birds (now known as "<a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Gukko birds</a>"). Each player is equipped with a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html#Volo_Lutu_Launcher" title="List of objects in Bionicle">Volo Lutu launcher</a> and a supply of Madu fruit. The goal of the game is to launch Madu at other players, trying to knock them off their mounts. Once a player falls from his Kewa, he is out of the game. Thrown Madu can be avoided by using the Volo Lutu launcher to pull oneself out of the way. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Kongu" title="List of Matoran">Kongu</a> is the best player of this sport and a Copper Mask winner.</li>

The Ta-Koro kolhii field.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>During the time of the <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html" title="Bohrok">Bohrok</a> swarms, the game of koli (above) evolved into what is now called kolhii. The change was based on an incident that occurred during the Pahrak invasion of Ga-Koro, when <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Hewkii" title="List of Matoran">Hewkii</a> used a Ga-Matoran fishing staff to knock away a falling rock that threatened <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Macku" title="List of Matoran">Macku</a>. Since then, players have adopted the use of the Kolhii Stick (fishing staff) and the Koli rules have been changed to accommodate it, making a more <a href="../../../l/a/c/Lacrosse.html" title="Lacrosse">lacrosse</a>-like game. The new sport gained in popularity, and became the favored sport of all villages on the island.</p>
<p>Kolhii has become a staple of Matoran life, and a great occasion for celebration. Variants of the sport include an Onu-Koro version played on <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Ussal crabs</a> and an aerial version played by Le-Matoran flying on <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Gukko birds</a>. Many believe it to be a fitting representation of the three virtues of Unity, Duty, and Destiny; and the Principles derived from them (see under "Beliefs" below). It is particularly important to the Po-Matoran that have become undisputed champions season after season.</p>
<p><b>Rules</b><br />
Modern kolhii is played with up to six teams; teams can have any number of players but they all must be of equal size. All teams must agree on the number of goals needed to win, and all goals are considered good unless a player scores in his own team's goal. All players are allowed one kolhii stick, and one player per team may use a shield to defend their team's goal. Multiple balls can be in play at once, but there must be less balls than both the number of teams playing and the number of players per team. Striking other players is illegal, except for "shield and staff strikes". In case of <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Rahi</a> attack, the game is put on hold until it is dealt with. (The original sport of koli likely had similar rules, except that the game was not played with staffs and shields.)</p>
<p><b>Equipment</b><br />
The equipment used in the current game of kolhii are the staffs, shields and balls. The staffs are sticks with a hammer on one end and a net or scoop on the other. The shields are just that, and are often decorated with a symbol of the team/village. Players are allowed to use these and any part of their bodies, except their hands. Kolhii balls are made from lightweight airstone bound in steel, and are ejected from the middle of the field during the game.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Metru Nui Sports">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Metru Nui Sports</span></h3>
<p>In the city of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metru_Nui_f34e.html" title="Metru Nui">Metru Nui</a>, most sports were based around powered, frisbee-like <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanoka.html" title="Kanoka">Kanoka</a> disks.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Akilini</b>: The major sport of Metru Nui. Akilini was said to have been created by a Po-Matoran named <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Kodan" title="List of Matoran">Kodan</a>. However, over the years other Metru have insisted that the idea for the sport actually came from one of their Matoran. In the resulting confusion, no one is really certain anymore who deserves the honor. After Kodan disappeared and was presumed dead, a monument was erected to him in Po-Metru giving him credit for the idea. Later, it evolved into a sport where players launched Kanoka Disks through hoops. Akilini was played on small fields throughout Metru Nui and in the sporting arena at the Coliseum. The disks used by the winning team in a tournament would be sent to Ta-Metru to be turned into <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanohi.html" title="Kanohi">Kanohi</a> Masks. At its most basic, Akilini was played on a round field surrounded by posts upon which hoops were mounted. The field was not free of obstacles - in fact, the prevailing wisdom was: the more, the better. Matoran would surf on disks up and down structures, through chutes, and even through tunnels in the Archives, popping up only long enough to make a shot. "Street Akilini" became so popular, and such a menace to pedestrians, that the <a href="../../../v/a/h/Vahki.html" title="Vahki">Vahki</a> enforcers had to crack down on it. There are three tiers of Akilini competition. The lowest rung features play with power level 1-6 disks, the middle rung with level 7 disks, and the best players are allowed to compete with level 8 disks.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Rules</b></dd>
<dd>Akilini is played with up to four teams with two to six players apiece. Each team has at least one "launcher" who tries to launch disks through hoops and one "defender" who can only launch disks to deflect an opponent's shot; each team can have up to four launchers and two defenders. Teams get one point for every disk that passes through an opponent's hoop, and hitting the rim doesn't count; official tournaments are played to a score of 21. If launched disks are on the field, they can be retrieved only by the team that launched them; those off the field can be claimed by anyone. Players also ride on disks and must keep at least one foot on their disk at all times; these transport disks cannot be switched with launching disks. Players over a bio outside of the field are considered out of bounds, though they can go as far above or below the field as they want. Players cannot make physical contact with defenders and can only contact launchers after they make a shot; interfering with a launcher making a shot, called "roughing the launcher", costs the offending team a launching disk.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Disk Racing</b>: A popular street sport, disk racing involves Matoran riding their Kanoka in chutes, through canals, and in other dangerous spots. Although frowned on by the Vahki, disk racers only risk serious consequences if they distract workers from their jobs or sustain injury that might keep them from working their shift. This sport is particularly popular among Le-Matoran, who know the locations of all the best "chute tracks."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Kanoka Toss</b>: A highly dangerous sport, this is a favorite of Matoran in Ta-Metru and Onu-Metru. Two players compete against each other. One player hurls a Kanoka Disk with all of his might, while the other attempts to catch it. The trick is to catch the disk after it has expended so much momentum that doing so will not trigger its power. This requires split-second timing and a lot of courage - it's not unusual for Kanoka Toss players to wind up frozen, shrunken, or reconstituted into something even a <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahkshi.html" title="Rahkshi">Rahkshi</a> would be sickened by. Onu-Matoran take the game one step farther, going down to Archive sub-levels to play "Kanoka Toss - in the dark."</li>

<p><b>Measurements</b>: All sentient beings in the Bionicle universe use a special measuring system. There are three different units of length: the Bio, the Kio, and the Mio; comparable to the Earth units of Meters and Kilometers. A <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa.html" title="Toa">Toa</a> is 1.6 Bios (6 Feet) tall.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bio - The smallest measurement used in the Bionicle universe. A bio is approximately equal to 4.5 feet or 1.37 meters in Earth measurements.</li>
<li>Kio - A kio is the middle sized measurement in the Bionicle universe; equal to 1000 bio. Or, 4500 feet/0.85 miles, 1371 meters/1.37 kilometers in human measurements.</li>
<li>Mio - A mio is the largest measure of distance in the Bionicle universe that we know of. It is equal to 1000 kio. Or, in human terms, 850 miles or 1370 kilometers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For other units of measurement, such as lengths of time, Earth units such as hours and days are used. Sometimes Earth units of length are used in place of the Bionicle units above, so that the reader may understand easier.</p>
<p><b>Chutespeak and Treespeak</b>: Two names for slang used by Le-Matoran. "Chutespeak" was its name in Metru Nui and "Treespeak" was used on Mata Nui. Chutespeak/Treespeak terms are made by combining two or more words into one. One or two phrases, notably "fire-spitter" and "lava-bones", have worked their way into the vocabularies of others besides Le-Matoran. Although there are too many possible phrases to list, here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Three Virtues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Three Virtues</span></h4>
<p>Central to Matoran life are the Three Virtues, said to be given by Mata Nui. The virtues are <b>Unity</b>, that all Matoran should stand together; <b>Duty</b>, that Matoran should do their jobs diligently; and <b>Destiny</b>, that each Matoran has a purpose they must fulfill.</p>
<p>The Matoran of the island of Mata Nui have also developed an accompanying set of Principles, with each one derived from some combination of the Virtues. Each Principle also has an affiliated Enemy that opposes it, and a Skill that can be developed if the Principle is followed. Each of the island's six villages emphasizes one of the virtues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ta-Koro: The Principle of <b>Courage</b>, derived from Duty. It grants the skill of Strength, and its enemy is <b>Fear</b>.</li>
<li>Ga-Koro: The Principle of <b>Purity</b>, derived from Unity. It grants the skill of Speed, and its enemy is <b>Poison</b>.</li>
<li>Le-Koro: The Principle of <b>Faith</b>, formed from the combination of Unity and Duty. It grants the skill of Accuracy, and its enemy is <b>Fragmentation</b>.</li>
<li>Po-Koro: The Principle of <b>Creation</b>, formed from the combination of Unity and Destiny. It grants the skill of Strategy, and its enemy is <b>Disintegration</b>.</li>
<li>Onu-Koro: The Principle of <b>Prosperity</b>, formed from the combination of Duty and Destiny. It grants the skill of Stamina, and its enemy is <b>Hunger</b>.</li>
<li>Ko-Koro: The Principle of <b>Peace</b>, derived from Destiny. It grants the skill of Willpower, and its enemy is <b>Anger</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sport of kolhii is considered a great way of teaching the Principles, as the game is a test of all six Skills. Also, when <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makuta.html" title="Makuta">Makuta</a> sent <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahkshi.html" title="Rahkshi">Rahkshi</a> to claim the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanohi.html#Avohkii" title="Kanohi">Mask of Light</a>, he likely deliberately chose the kinds that embodied the Enemies, as a symbolic attack on the Principles.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Edit section: Holidays">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Holidays</span></h3>
<p>The Matoran calendar has no regular holidays; rather the local Turaga declares one whenever he or she feels it is appropriate. Often, an event is celebrated with a sporting competition, such as when the Turaga of Mata Nui declared a kolhii tournament to celebrate the peace that followed the Bohrok-Kal's defeat. The only other specifically known Matoran holiday is Naming Day.</p>
<p>On a Naming Day, Matoran who have done great deeds are honored by having their name changed (from what has been seen, the new name is spelled differently but pronounced the same as the old one). This new name is used when referring to past events as well as future ones, effectively <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retconning</a> the old name out of existence. On Metru Nui, Matoran got a day off of work for Naming Days and often exchanged gifts. <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahaga.html" title="Rahaga">Rahaga</a> Iruini has also mentioned Mata Nui coming through chutes to give presents to good Matoran on Naming Days (much like <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Claus_71fe.html" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a>), as an example of a naive belief.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> So far, only one Naming Day has been seen; when Jala, Huki, and Maku got the new names "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Jaller" title="List of Matoran">Jaller</a>", "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Hewkii" title="List of Matoran">Hewkii</a>", and "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Macku" title="List of Matoran">Macku</a>", respectively; for their bravery and deeds in fighting the Bohrok swarms. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Takua" title="List of Matoran">Takua</a> also changed his pet crab's name from "Puku" to "<a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html#Pewku" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Pewku</a>" on that day, and the fact that he was not honored alongside his friends may have influenced his decision to change his own name to <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa.html#Takanuva" title="Toa">Takanuva</a> upon becoming the Toa of Light (though "Takanuva" does not follow the patterns of the other new names: it is not a simple respelling of "Takua", and the old name is still used to refer to his old Matoran identity).</p>
