<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Biola_University_03ec.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Originally located in <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downtown_Los_Angeles_163a.html" title="Downtown Los Angeles">downtown Los Angeles</a> at the corner of Sixth St. and Hope St., the university moved to its present location in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>.</p>
<p>The University was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> as the <b>B</b>ible <b>I</b>nstitute <b>O</b>f <b>L</b>os <b>A</b>ngeles by <a href="../../../l/y/m/Lyman_Stewart_7d05.html" title="Lyman Stewart">Lyman Stewart</a>, co-owner of the Union Oil Company of California (currently known as <a href="../../../u/n/o/Unocal.html" title="Unocal">Unocal</a>), and T.C. Horton, a well known preacher and Christian writer.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, Lyman Stewart and his brother Milton, anonymously funded the publication of a twelve-volume series of articles called <i>The Fundamentals,</i> published between 1910 and 1915, and distributed free of charge to a wide range of Christian teachers and leaders, "Compliments of Two Christian Laymen." These volumes were intended as a restatement of conservative Christian theological teachings, primarily in response to the growing influence of modernist theology in the Church. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> these articles were republished in a revised, four volume set by the Institute. The term "<a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalism.html" title="Fundamentalism">fundamentalism</a>" is in part derived from these volumes, although it should be noted that the ethos and self-identification of the University is <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelicalism.html" title="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a>, not <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamentalist.html" title="Fundamentalist">fundamentalist</a>.</p>
<p>By 1912, the school had grown sufficiently in its outreach and constituency to call R.A. Torrey, a leader in the field of Christian education, as the first dean. Between 1912 and 1928, Biola was an established leader in conservative Christianity in North America, publishing The King's Business (a magazine similar to Christianity Today), operating one of the largest Christian radio stations in the U.S. (KTBI), and running the Biola Press, which sold and distributed Christian literature worldwide, including material for the Los Angeles based pentecostal preacher, Amy Semple McPherson. After Stewart's death and Torrey and Horton's retirements, William P. White, a well-known Christian leader and speaker, became Biola's first president in 1929. Charles E. Fuller, a graduate of Biola, became chairman of the board. Fuller later founded Fuller Theological Seminary.</p>
<p>Biola fell into hard times during the Great Depression and was forced to sell its publishing company and radio station. The 13-story downtown building that housed the school was also under threat of loss. It was during this time that Louis T. Talbot became Biola's second president in 1932. Talbot also served as the pastor of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_Open_Door_3f52.html" title="Church of the Open Door">Church of the Open Door</a>, which held services in the school's downtown building.</p>

<p>In 1935, Paul W. Rood became Biola's third president. He was instrumental in establishing the Torrey Memorial Bible Conference, which is one of the longest standing Bible conferences today. He resigned in 1938. During Rood's presidency, Talbot was instrumental in helping to save the school from financial ruin caused by the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Talbot entered a second term as Biola's president from 1938 to 1952. During this time, the Institute program became a four-year course, leading to degrees in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>, Christian education, and sacred music. The School of Missionary Medicine came into being in 1945, laying the foundation for Biola's current baccalaureate nursing program. In 1946, Talbot also established the Biola Institute Hour, a national radio program. It was later called the Biola Hour. The Institute was renamed <b>Biola College</b> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Samuel H. Sutherland, president from 1952 to 1970, Biola moved its campus to its current location La Mirada, Calif. in the summer of 1959. Sutherland and Russell Allder, Biola's business manager, were instrumental in purchasing and developing the new 75-acre campus, which was purchased from publishing magnate Andrew McNally, founder and president of Rand McNally Publishing Company. In those days, plans were still under way for the development of the soon-to-be city of La Mirada, which was mostly olive trees and rolling hills. La Mirada was incorporated as a city in 1960.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Dr. J. Richard Chase, president from 1970 to 1982, the College was renamed Biola University on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_1.html" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>.In 1977, the graduate programs of <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosemead.html" title="Rosemead">Rosemead</a> Graduate School of Professional Psychology were acquired by the College and relocated on the La Mirada campus. The undergraduate programs in psychology were merged with Rosemead's graduate programs in the fall of 1981, forming the present Rosemead School of Psychology. Clyde Cook became president of the University on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_8.html" title="October 8">October 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>.</p>
<p>The School of Intercultural Studies was instituted as part of the University in 1983. Talbot Theological Seminary became Talbot School of Theology in the fall of 1983 as a result of the merger between the appropriate undergraduate and graduate level programs.</p>
<p>In 1988 Biola acquired the adjacent McNally Campus adding an additional 25 acres to the main campus.</p>
<p>In 1993, the Board of Trustees approved the establishment of the School of Business, and the School of Continuing Studies in 1994, now called the School of Professional Studies.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, the University hosted the first national conference on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a>. Later, Intervarsity Press published <i>Mere Creation</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-8308-1515-5</a>) which was a collection of the papers presented at the conference. Subsequent Intelligent Design conferences were held at the University in 2002 and 2004.</p>

In the first decades of its publication, it was the leading journal for conservative Christianity and the early fundamentalist movement. In fact, <i>The Fundamentals</i> and <i>The King's Business</i> shared the same chief editor (<a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._A._Torrey_956d.html" title="R. A. Torrey">R. A. Torrey</a>) and were supported by the same "concerned laymen" (Lyman and Milton Stewart).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rosemead.edu/jpt" class="external text" title="http://www.rosemead.edu/jpt" rel="nofollow">Journal of Psychology and Theology</a> The purpose of the Journal of Psychology and Theology is to communicate recent scholarly thinking on the interrelationships of psychological and theological concepts, and to consider the application of these concepts to a variety of professional settings. The major intent of the editor is to place before the evangelical community articles that have bearing on the nature of humankind from a biblical perspective.</li>

The journal is indexed by The Philosopher's Index and Religious &amp; Theological Abstracts.</li>
