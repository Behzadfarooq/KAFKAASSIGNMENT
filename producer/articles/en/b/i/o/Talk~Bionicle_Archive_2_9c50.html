<p>Alright, let's try approaching this from a new perspective: I ask that everyone who wants an external link included on this page, including the ones that are already there, go to <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>, read the policies there, and post explaining what policies there justify why a specific site should be linked to. Any links that can't be shown to conform to policy will be deleted. Right now, the only site I see that I think should stay is the BS101Wiki, since it contains information that would be considered too specific or too speculative to be included on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 00:44, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Quote from the applicable part of <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>: "Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. (Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)" BIonicle is a topic with many, many fansites, and seeing as BZP is the major Bionicle fansite, I don't see why a link to it shouldn't be allowed. btw, InShaneee, the Wiki is a part of a much larger site called BS01 which has much more reference info. So I would take off the wiki link and just link to <a href="http://www.biosector01.com" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com" rel="nofollow">BS01</a> --<a href="../../../t/o/r/User%7ETorritorri_d37d.html" title="User:Torritorri">torritorri</a> 15:28, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>BZPower needs to stay. Greg often gives details in the forums, either explaining current things or giving info about the near future (like Irnakk's nature and powers).

<dd>I re-added BZPower.

<dd>You're misunderstanding that policy. That means that links must be provided for any 'iffy' information, so as it can be proved.

<dd>But BZPower is still the <i>original</i> source of the info, both for the BS01 wiki and for this wiki, and should be acknowledged as such.

Besides that, BZPower is the biggest fan community out there (I know you said BS01 has a higher something-or-other rating, but that's more a reference site than a community). I know we shouldn't include every fan site out there, but we should certainly include the best of the best, and BZPower qualifies.</dd>

<p>You still aren't talking about guidelines, just stating your opinion again (which is why I'm going to remove the link, again, for the time being).

<p>I've changed the BS01 link to the BS01 homepage, seeing as that is the page that hosts the Wiki, and has info that the Wiki doesn't.

<dl>
<dd>I do, and I've taken the liberty of changing it back. I understand that BS01 is the parent site of the wiki, but it's not at all unusual for wikipedia to only link to the most pertinent place of a site, and I strongly believe that the BS01 Wiki is that place. The parent site seems to have mostly fan content, while the wiki is more concerned with more official product/storyline matter. Hence, I think that's what should be linked to, if anything. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 04:50, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Why not have links to both? The wiki certainly has enough info to warrant its own link, while BS01 proper has copies of official online content, like webisodes and online versions of the comics. That ought to be worth a link, especially as a fair amount of that content isn't available on the official Bionicle site anymore. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 05:54, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because, as I've said before, this isn't just a matter of opinion. Wikipedia does have very specific rules governing what can and can't be linked to. One of the reasons for this is this very reason: fans always want 'their' site linked to. Even if it is 'official' material, if it's available on an 'official' site, all the better! The problem is, most of this stuff isn't what we consider encyclopedic, including fan-made material. If it meets the criteria in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, you could always consider making an individual page for it, but I still don't see how it fits the inclusion criteria. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 06:23, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>InShaneee, it's my understanding that none of the information in BS01 is fan-made; from the wiki to the "bios" to the image gallery, it's all official information, to my knowledge. However the Wiki certaintly is the most pertinent part of the site, so I can definitely see what you're saying. -<a href="../../../h/u/z/User%7EHuzzah%21_e3dc.html" title="User:Huzzah!">Huzzah!</a> 03:55, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You're absolutely correct, Huzzah!. The information on the main site is official. If I had a personal choice, I'd leave it on the main page (as it's where most of the BS01 Wiki info came from, amongst other places), but it would be easier to leave it on the Wiki link (that's up to date to the very letter). But, I must ask... who re-added the BZP link? --<a href="http://www.biosector01.com" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com" rel="nofollow"><font color="#08C2E3">Swert of BS01</font></a> <sup>Staff Member, Graphics Manager</sup></p>
<dl>
<dd>Alright, that settles it for me. The external linking policy allows for 'A' fan site to be linked to, and if it's got official content (that I take it can't actually be gotten from official sources anymore), that's more than enough for it to be included as a good source. I'm going to change that link to BS01's front page and remove the BZPower link. If anyone wants to dispute that, they can take it up here. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 16:43, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>InShaneee, I just noticed that a link called "Nuipedia" was just added to the External Links, and you didn't delete it, but only moved it to a different place on the list. Please explain why you feel this unknown fan wiki that people have barely heard of gets to stay on the list; but the largest, most popular fan community doesn't. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 23:51, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Drakhan, "Nuipedia" doesn't have any useful information that can't be found on BS01 or their wiki, has false information, and is planning to put fan creations and list them as official rahi. I'm deleting it. -Lihyahm (61.8.110.101 02:29, 28 March 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Now hang on just a moment. I know how this might look, but there's more to this situation than meets the eye. This isn't just some fansite. If you look at the link to Nuipedia, you'll see that it's hosted by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a>, one of Wikipedia's sister projects. This gives it a bit of some special status, simply because that means that the site's creation and continued existance is approved by the same people who run Wikipedia. As a matter of fact, Wikia was founded for the sole purpose of helping to suppliment Wikipedia by providing content that people might find useful, but might be considered unencyclopedic here. What I'm saying is that this link is a neccisary part of the page, as it is a part of the Wikipedia family. Sorry for any misunderstanding, and I hope some of the contributers to this page may take a look at Nuipedia and possibly add some content there. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 02:39, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you want a Bionicle-centric wiki, the BS01 one is <i>far</i> more complete. Even <i>this</i> wiki is more accurate than Nuipedia (Nuipedia classifies Makuta as a Great Spirit, for one thing). It doesn't matter much where sites came from, it matters far more what they <i>have</i>. The official sites have exclusive content. Between the main site and the wiki, BS01 is the most complete Bionicle resource anywhere. And BZPower provides up-to-date news and a thriving fan community.</dd>

<dd>InShaneee, you were earlier limiting fan sites to just one according to the strictest interpretation of Wikipedia policy (and I quote: "The external linking policy allows for 'A' fan site to be linked to..."). Even if Nuipedia is hosted by some sister project, the fact that you would reject a distinguished fan site but allow a vastly inferior site to stay, well, it frankly makes you look like a hypocrite. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 05:22, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We're not getting into this discussion, because the policy here is clear: Wikia sites do not qualify as fansites. They are a part of Wikipedia. Not only should the link be there, it MUST be there. A Wikia site is only created when Wikipedia believe that there is content that could be extended there that would not fit on Wikipedia. You're welcome to your opinion on the quality of the site, but do not remove the link again. For the last time, Wikipedia is not anarchy. We do have rules here, and Wikia has special dispensation. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 18:29, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I do care, Toa of Sound. It's a down-right shot to my pride to see an inferior wiki come up, and immediately my Wiki, which has lived for half a year already, be buried right underneath it. I have proof that my wiki should be the one linked.</p>

I'm not pointing out members here, I'm pointing out articles and page views. BS01 CLEARLY has more activity done and more progress done than Nuipedia. Granted, it's a new wiki, but totally unnecessary. Plus, that wiki allows ANYONE to edit... mine requires membership, and that is always free. Plus, mine has control over vandalism without outside help, and has generally more information and a good website to back it up. Granted, the server we're on is not the greatest, but we pay well for it, and they help us out (the server also plays host to BZPower). Either have the Nuipedia link removed, or at least point out the content on it is far inferior to the BS01 Wiki, which has had time to be built and has 100% accurate information.

<p>This discussion has gotten waaaaaaay to crazy for me. Jedizati, out.</p>
<p>I am a member of the BS01 wiki, and I would like to put some backround info on Nuipedia's founder, KFan II. He became a member of BS01 Wiki, and he made some not so good edits. For instance, he put that Krekka was a Toa, Roodaka and Sidorak were visorak, among other things. Of course, this did not go down well with other members, and they asked him to stop, but he got mad and left the wiki. He then went of and formed Nuipedia. The thing about Nuipedia is that it has wrong iformation, rules that involve Nidhiki and Krekka hunting you down, and most of the edits made by it's founder. I don't see why a wiki that is very unproffesional is judged higher than the BS01 wiki, which has a Counter Vandallism Unit, Articles for deletion page, Collaboration of the Week, and great members and Admins. I don't mind if Nuipedia is listed, but if is is, at least list BS01 Wiki, espesialy since you list it on the Matoran page. <b>Update</b>:Okay, I see that BS01 Wiki is listed in an indirect way under BS01, which is fine, but I now think that Nuipedia shoud be removed, especialy because it was added by it's founder probably just to advertise it.--<a href="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bionicleman" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php?title=User:Bionicleman" rel="nofollow">Bioncicleman of BS01</a></p>

<p>This disscusion seems slightly out of control and too argumentative. I would just like to say that as long as the fan sites is following the Wikipedia guidlines, follows common sense rules and manners that make it a suitable link (ie. not full of advertising, not obscene or rude, not incredibly hard to understand, ect), is not completely irrelevant and contains a significant ammount (yes I know it varies with viewpoint but what else am I supposed to say) of information, even if it is simmilar to another site or says the same things I think it should be allowed a place in the links section. The viewer should be the person who choses which site he/she visits, we should not dictate what sites the viewer should learn about (as long as they follow the things listed above). I have been a member of BZP for a while and I think it is incredible worthy of a place in the links section as is BS01, they contain a wealth of information, BZP also contain many excellent discussions, news articles, information of future bionicle products links/storyline. I'm sure their must be many other fan sites that also deserve a link in this wikipedia article, and many which would be a waste of a viewer's time (eg. one with little information on bionicle). But we should let the viewer decide which ones to see and the site admins/members/visiters decide wether to put up a link to a bionicle fan site. If we don't like a site or think it should not be there we don't have to use that link, though if it is sensible to remove the site and the majority of viewers agree or would agree that it should be removed (because it is offensive, is not relevant, has lots of advertising, ect.) then you should remove it, but not just because of your personal opinion of the site. Of course there will be some dissagreements, but I think through a sensible and rational discussion these can be settled. I am sorry about the length of my post but I just want to make my ideas clear, I hope many of you will agree with what I have said, thanks for your time. --Tortuga Turaga 15:02, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did not mean to sound as if I was going against the policy, in fact I was trying to support the guidlines. More to the point I can see nothing in the External Links Section that forbids or even strongly disaproves of putting up more links to fansites, it merely says "including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such". This does not say that you cannot include more than one major fansite link, if it means this it should say it clearly, it seems to be saying that if there is a major fansite it should have a link in the links section. I do agree with the view that there should not be lots of minor and relatively uninformative fansites cluttering up the links section but as I said I think, as do others, that BZP (as well as any other major (I stres major) fansites) should have (and does) a rite to be in the links section as it is a major, very usefull and informatiove relevant fansite and is thusly suitable to be in the links section along with anyother suitable fansites (eg. follows the Wikipedia guidlines and has enough relevant information and resources). It even has some relevant advantages (my previous post) over BS01 that make up for the fact that it's information is less in depth than BS01. To sum it up there is nothing in the policy that forbids or strongly discourages more than one major fansite link. --Tortuga Turaga 17:32, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but there is, and you quoted it yourself. "ONE MAJOR fansite"; I'm not sure how much more clear that can be. That was put into place to discourage the linking of fansites altogether except when strictly neccisary, and even then, only one. The fact is that it's pretty easy to determine what fansite is 'the biggest', while trying to decide what is 'big enough' leads to bickering on the scale of what preceeds these messages. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a repository of links</a>, this is very clear policy-wise. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 21:42, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm with Tortuga on this. I've already made most of my points, so I'm not going to bother repeating them, but I will say this: on nearly every Wikipedia article I've seen for a popular franchise - comic books, TV shows, video games, whatever - there are at <i>least</i> two or three fansites listed. It seems like you're the only one - even the only <i>admin</i> - to have a problem with this. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 02:42, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As I said before, if you would like to provide links to such pages, I would be glad to visit them and update their external links sections to conform to that policy.

<dd>Replying to InShaneee: Um, I did point out that the policy did not say anything infact explicitly forbid or even strongly discourage fansites, all I said (I really don't like repeating myself)it just says "including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such". This does not say that you cannot include more than one, it implies that if there is a major fansite it should have a link in the links section. If it is meant to discourage more than one fan site link it should say so clearly. Please listen carefully to what I have said, read the whole policy rather than just paying attention to the "one major fansite" part and try not to be so dismissive. I think Drakhan's point on there being more than one fansite link in other articles on popular franchise is very important and backs up our point strongly. Why should fansite links on the bionicle articles be so strongly discriminated against, much more than in other wikipedia articles? If other admins disagree with there being multiple fansite links then why are there plenty of articles with multiple fansite links and why doesn't policy confirm this? I'm sorry but I can see little ground for your argument (though I can understand some of your points), though I would be pleased to hear more points supportng you view. I have already given my reason for how it would be sensible to let other major and useful fansites (such as BZP) to be included in the links section so I won't go on about that any more, it is just this matter of the policy that I think needs clearing up. --Tortuga Turaga 20:42, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, I'll try again to clear it up now. By one, it means one, which is meant to imply ONE. I've discussed this with other admins, who agree that there's a lot of pages that have far too many links, thus many people seem to misunderstand, and that most of those links should be removed, as well. This isn't my view; this is policy. Argue it somewhere else if you want, nothing will come of doing it here. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 21:12, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay I agree with that and I do not want to carry on this argument. But could you re-phrase the policy to make it a bit clearer thus avoiding futher misunderstandings and encourage the other admins to make it fair by removing multiple fansite links? Or you could allow (only) one or two more major fansite links as it is not strictly forbidden by the policy and it would be unfair if the other articles still maintained their multiple links. I still, as I'm sure many others do, think that this is slightly unreasonable but it is the policy of the website so obviously we would have to follow it which I am fine with. --Tortuga Turaga 20:12, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In responce to point one: see my post from the 8th and 14th as they prove this point wrong (read carefully and pay attention to what I said), in your previous post you made a reasonable justification which I agreed with so I thought it was sorted out. Now you seem to go back to your first argument which I proved wrong by reading the WHOLE policy and which says (yet again I repeat myself)nothing that actually forbids or storngly discourages multiple fansite links, you seem to be only paying attention the "one link" part and not to the "is appropriate" and the fact it does not forbid them.</dd>
<dd>In responce to point two: sorry I don't know much about how the site works and is run partially because am not a member but thantks for the advice, I think I'll do that.</dd>
<dd>But to cut a long story short: I have said I agree as you gave a reasonable justification (that it is meant to imply that only one fansite link is allowed and other admins also support this) in your previous post so lets' stop this argument now as it won't get us and where as we have agreed about the core issue. Though to make it fair could you and the other admins get rid of other multiple fansite links? Thanks. --Tortuga Turaga 19:11, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Never have I seen so much arguing about external links. Like you say in your reply, the policy reads "including a link to one major fansite is appropriate." It means that just one is appropriate. If you have fifteen, then it is not appropriate and you have an example of what Wikipedia is not. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_mirror_or_a_repository_of_links.2C_images.2C_or_media_files" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files.</a> This is what the statement means. Multiple links is discouraged, strongly in fact. The one fan-site link is also mentioned there. I could understand maybe two, at the most, if and only if the content on those sites happened to be equally as good or the two sites were somehow directly related. As for the last part of your reply, do you have any idea just how many articles there are? What you ask is near impossible. If you see a page with a bunch of links, remove them and cite the policy in your edit summary. â€“ <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 21:41, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I agree with you, I understand what the policy intends to imply and thank you for saying that two at the most could be allowed. I thought two would be a sensible number of fansite link, seeing as there are plenty of others with multiple fansite links and you could get two different types/styles of fansite in. I apoligies about all this bickering but I took the "including a link to one major fansite is appropriate" to mean there should be a fansite link (seeing as "one... is appropriate" does not mean five can't also be appropriate) so I thought it would be okay to have multiple links. But I am not arguing about this triviality of the phrasing of the policy anymore as I understand now what it is supposed to mean. I really did not want to argue and I'm glad this is over. Sorry if I have annoyed any of the admins. The only issue left is wether to allow one more fansite (and only one more as that seems to be okay and I think everyone would agree with allowing only one more) link and if so which one, for this it might be an idea to start a new section, seeing as technicly it is not forbiden just discouraged (I understood that it was discouraged in the first place but I did not know it was strongly discouraged). So I guess the argument is not absoulutly over&#160;:( but it is probably near the end (pheww). I don't think I'll take that much of a part in it, but I would suggest if we do allow two fansite links (including BSO1) BZPower should be the other for the reasons I've previously mentioned. Ps. I apoligies for the length of my posts, I tend to be not good at condenseing what I have to say. -- Tortuga Turaga 19:10, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I meant that two are a rare instance and should only occur under special circumstances, like them being directly related. Does BZPower provide a unique resource beyond what BS01 does? If it has some kind of exlusive and helpful difference, adding it might be ok, but if it's just a figurative clone, then there'd be no point. â€“ <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 21:17, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Never mind. It's a forum. Wikipedia shouldn't be linking to forums. There are some cases where it might be necessary, like in an instance where a specific quote is used, at which point you would site the specific thread and/or post as a reference, not as an external link. â€“ <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 21:49, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As much as I hate to dredge up this discussion yet again; I just went to mark the articles on BZPower and Mask of Destiny for deletion, but found that BZPower already survived three attempts (so I'm not going to bother to make it four). If there's an article about the fan site that is able to survive like this, shouldn't the site get a link on the page of the site's subject? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 16:21, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't believe so. I mean, Bionicle links to everything official, and the website articles link to Bionicle. Personally, I think that's good. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 20:43, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Surviving a delete doesn't prove much, since it is technically a notable website for this particular topic. There's also ways of influencing the vote through outside sources. That Bionicle wiki page provides everything a fan site should be in a single link, so adding more links would be redundant. I've read something about a creator posting at one of those others, so that is a plus, but it'd be better for reference links. Should you want to use a specific quote, you reference the exact page the quote is on in an appropriately titled section. Just linking for the sake of it is unnecessary. â€“ <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 06:45, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, this has gone way bad! It is all wrong! I think we should just forget it, calm down, and just leave peacefully, before it gets more serious. Let InShaneee win, can't stop him, no point in fighting. <b>Dark Jedi retires from the Bionicle descussion, and it would be wise to follow.</b></p>
