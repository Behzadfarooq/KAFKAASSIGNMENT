	    <p><i><b>Bionicle Chronicles</b></i> is the first book series based in the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle.html" title="Bionicle">Bionicle</a> universe.

<p>For as long as any of the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matoran.html" title="Matoran">Matoran</a> could remember, the Master of Shadows, <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makuta.html" title="Makuta">Makuta</a> had made the island of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mata_Nui_%28Island%29_22b7.html" title="Mata Nui (Island)">Mata Nui</a> a place of darkness, enslaving the <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Rahi</a> wildlife and sending them to attack the villages. The wise <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga</a> had told tales of mighty heroes called <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa.html" title="Toa">Toa</a> who would come and free the island from Makuta's grip, and the Matoran were waiting for that day...</p>
<p>Eventually, the Makuta carried out his boldest attack yet and had the Rahi kidnap the Turaga. When a wandering Matoran, Takua, learned of the kidnappings, he took it upon himself to rescue the elders. In the process, he also recovered the six <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html" title="List of objects in Bionicle">Toa Stones</a> that were scattered about the island. When Takua was instructed by the rescued Turaga to place the Toa Stones on the Kini-Nui Temple's Suva shrine, the stones shot a beam of light that launched him to the edge of the island, and when he came to he saw a strange <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html" title="List of objects in Bionicle">canister</a> on the shore and a set of footprints in the sand leading away from it...</p>

<p>Six great heroes were summoned to the island of Mata Nui to awaken the Great Spirit, Mata Nui, who had been put to sleep by his evil brother <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makuta.html" title="Makuta">Makuta</a>. This would free its inhabitants, the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matoran.html" title="Matoran">Matoran</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Rahi</a> (wild beasts), from the Makuta's dark influence. <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Mata_4221.html" title="Toa Mata">These Toa</a> did not remember or know anything about their quest, except for vague memories. Therefore, they had to be taught of the legends by the Matoran and their wise leaders, the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga</a>. The Toa's first task was to collect the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanohi.html" title="Kanohi">Kanohi</a> Masks of Power to gain new powers with which to defeat Makuta. The quest was not easy--the Kanohi were hidden in places that were all but impossible to reach, and/or guarded by Rahi that Makuta had infected and enslaved to serve his evil will. After many perils, the Toa managed to successfully collect the Kanohi, and descend into Makuta's underground lair. There they met new dangers--the strange Manas crabs and the Shadow Toa--before meeting with Makuta himself. He appeared to them as a small matoran. Once the toa decided to fight him, he fused with the swirling mass of parts that were floating above them. After a long battle, the Toa emerged, victorious. Makuta was gone--or so the Toa thought...</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa.html" title="Toa">Toa</a> had barely reached the surface of the island of Mata Nui, where the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matoran.html" title="Matoran">Matoran</a> villagers were preparing a victory party to celebrate the Toa's (ostensible) defeat of <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makuta.html" title="Makuta">Makuta</a>, when they were thrust into a new adventure. One of the villagers from Tahu's village of Ta-Koro breathlessly ran up to them, then collapsed, muttering only one unknown word over and over:<br />
<i>"<a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html" title="Bohrok">BohrokBohrokBohrokBohrokBohrok</a>"</i><br />
Swarms of mechanical beings, the <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html" title="Bohrok">Bohrok</a> tore through Mata Nui in their quest to destroy everything on the island--trees, ice, lava, even mountains. The swarms did not hesitate to defend themselves against those who would deter them from their strange mission, even if it were the Toa. The Toa, with help from the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga</a>, slowly pieced together the mystery of the Bohrok: the connection with the repulsive creatures known as <a href="../../../k/r/a/Krana.html" title="Krana">Krana</a>, the fact that the Bohrok were mechanical and not really alive, and the way to stop the swarms. Now the Toa were in a race against time: to stop the Bohrok, the Toa had to collect the eight types of Krana in each color. This would unlock the entrance to the lair of the mysterious <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html" title="Bohrok">Bahrag</a>, the queens of the swarms. The Bahrag would have to be defeated in order to stop the mad advance of the Bohrok. This the Toa did; along the way, they discovered the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html" title="List of objects in Bionicle">Exo-Toa</a>, six powerful suits of armor that had been hidden underground for Mata Nui knows how long. After being forced to shed the suits, the Toa managed to defeat the Bahrag by forming a cage of solid <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protodermis.html" title="Protodermis">protodermis</a> around the twins, entrapping them and cutting them off from the Krana, which they controlled telepathically. But as they were trapped, one of the Bahrag uttered a warning:<br />

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_Chronicles_7528.html" title="Edit section: The Toa Nuva">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Toa Nuva</span></h4>
<p>After beating the <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html#The_Bahrag" title="Bohrok">Bahrag</a>, the fearsome queens of the <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html" title="Bohrok">Bohrok</a> swarms, the <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa.html" title="Toa">Toa</a> were submerged into a mysterious substance known as energized <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protodermis.html" title="Protodermis">protodermis</a>. They evolved into new, tougher Toa with increased powers, and they decided to call themselves the <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Nuva_16d6.html" title="Toa Nuva">Toa Nuva</a>.</p>
<p>But the new heroes were angered that the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga</a>, who obviously knew of the legends of the Bohrok invasion, did not tell them anything about the legends beforehand. This caused them to wonder if the Turaga knew more than they were letting on. Whether or not this was true would remain to be seen...</p>
<p>Also, the Toa Nuva were still as fiercely independent as ever. This caused them to split up, although Gali Nuva had an omen that something bad would happen when they did...</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_Chronicles_7528.html" title="Edit section: The Bohrok-Kal Strike">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Bohrok-Kal Strike</span></h3>

<dd><i>Sources: Bionicle Chronicles #3-4, Bionicle comic #10-12, online animations</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Not very surprisingly, Gali Nuva was proved right. A squad of six new, elite <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html" title="Bohrok">Bohrok</a>, known as <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html#Bohrok-Kal" title="Bohrok">Bohrok-Kal</a>, soon emerged with a bang. Their first task, accomplished quite easily, was to steal the <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Nuva_16d6.html" title="Toa Nuva">Toa Nuva</a>'s Nuva Symbols. They were necessary for the freeing of the Bohrok queens, the <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html#The_Bahrag" title="Bohrok">Bahrag</a>--and also had the nice side effect of making the Toa Nuva's elemental powers (along with their natural resistance to their elements) vanish. Now forced to depend on each other, and to collect the more powerful <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanohi.html" title="Kanohi">Kanohi</a> Nuva, more than ever, the Toa Nuva tried to match the Bohrok-Kal's strength with strength, failing miserably every time. Eventually, the Toa Nuva pieced together the Bohrok-Kal's goal as well: release the Bahrag twins, which would cause the Bohrok (which were now doing repair duty in the villages) to resume their task of destruction. The Toa Nuva followed the Bohrok-Kal back into the nests, where they witnessed the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html" title="List of objects in Bionicle">Exo-Toa</a>'s demise at the magnetic shields of Gahlok-Kal. Finally, acting on a desperate plan devised by Gali Nuva, the Toa Nuva used the Bohrok-Kal's own power against them, destroying the Kal. With their saved Nuva Symbols, their regained elemental powers, and their Kanohi Nuva, the Toa Nuva headed for the surface once again...</p>
<p>There are various short stories of the Toa Nuva's adventures during this time, including Tahu Nuva's swinging on vines, Turaga Nokama's betrayal of Gali Nuva, and the horrifying adventure with the frightful Rahi hybrid known as the Rahi Nui, which Turaga Vakama knew from the past.</p>

<p>Shortly after the defeat of the <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohrok.html#Bohrok-Kal" title="Bohrok">Bohrok-Kal</a>, the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga</a> decided it was time that the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matoran.html" title="Matoran">Matoran</a> learn the secret of how to rebuild their bodies into stronger forms. They also took advantage of the time of peace to declare an island-wide <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html#Kolhii" title="Bionicle society">Kolhii</a> tournament. <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html#Nokama" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga Nokama</a> makes a surprise choice and selects <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Hahli" title="List of Matoran">Hahli</a> to be part of the Ga-Koro team in the tournament; Hahli immediately begins traveling to different villages for training.</p>
<p>Just before the championship match, the Turaga hold a council about whether the <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Nuva_16d6.html" title="Toa Nuva">Toa Nuva</a> should be told about <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metru_Nui_f34e.html" title="Metru Nui">Metru Nui</a>. They tell tales of the Toa's struggles to claim the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanohi.html" title="Kanohi">Kanohi</a> Nuva masks to support their points either for or against; but after <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html#Vakama" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga Vakama</a> tells of their fight against the <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Rahi Nui</a>, which might have been easier if they had known about the beast beforehand, the Turaga agree that the Toa should be informed once the tournament ends.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Takua" title="List of Matoran">Takua</a> entered a forbidden lava cave in order to investigate a strange stone totem. After he accidentally drops the totem into the lava, the stone melts away to reveal a golden Kanohi Mask inside! <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Nuva_16d6.html" title="Toa Nuva">Toa Tahu</a>, after seeing the mask, tells Takua to bring the mask to the Turaga - <i>after</i> the Kolhii match.</p>
<p>Takua and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Jaller" title="List of Matoran">Jaller</a> barely make it to the stadium in time for the championship game between the Kolhii teams of Ta-Koro, Po-Koro, and Ga-Koro. It's a hard-fought match, but even though the Po-Matoran are known for their skill in the sport it's Hahli and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Macku" title="List of Matoran">Macku</a> who win for Ga-Koro. But kolhii is quickly forgotten as Takua drops the glowing mask right in the center of the stadium!</p>
<p>Afterwards, Nokama translates the inscriptions on the inside of the mask and announces that it is the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanohi.html#Avohkii" title="Kanohi">Avohkii</a> Mask of Light, destined to be worn by a Toa of Light in a time of darkness. Further, this Toa must be sought out by a Herald. Tahu suggests that Jaller is the Herald because the mask's light shone on him; Jaller wants Takua to own up to being the Herald - as he was the one to find the mask - but Takua instead supports Tahu's suggestion and the Turaga recognize Jaller as the Herald. Upset at Takua's dodging of responsibility, Jaller has the Turaga appoint Takua as his traveling companion.</p>
<p>The two set out from Ta-Koro the next day with their pet Ussal crab <a href="../../../p/e/w/Pewku.html" title="Pewku">Pewku</a>, counting on the mask to shine most brightly in the direction they are supposed to go. But <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makuta.html" title="Makuta">Makuta</a> fears the Toa of Light and sends out three of his <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahkshi.html" title="Rahkshi">Rahkshi</a> to claim the mask. The Rahkshi arrive at Ta-Koro and decimate the place; with <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahkshi.html" title="Rahkshi">Lerahk</a> poisoning Tahu in the process. The Ta-Matoran are able to escape with their lives, but Ta-Koro sinks into the lake of fire and is utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>The Rahkshi follow the trail of Jaller and Takua and catch up with them in the icy drifts of Ko-Wahi, where <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Nuva_16d6.html" title="Toa Nuva">Toa Kopaka</a> is able to freeze them solid in a lake. But Makuta would not stop so easily, and he releases three more Rahkshi; he also appears to Takua and warns that if the Mask of Light is not handed over, Jaller will die. Takua refuses, but is so shaken by the encounter that he chooses to abandon the search so that Jaller's life would be safe.</p>
<p>While Jaller keeps looking for the Toa of Light, Takua eventually ends up in Onu-Koro - but when Makuta's new team of Rahkshi shows up there, he realizes that they aren't hunting the mask, they're hunting the Herald - <i>him</i>. The Toa show up to fight the Rahkshi, but Kurahk uses his power (Described by the Makuta as, anger amongst themselves) to turn Toa Tahu against <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Nuva_16d6.html" title="Toa Nuva">Toa Gali</a>. Kopaka is able to contain Tahu and Takua escapes the Rahkshi, but Onu-Koro is heavily damaged in a cave-in.</p>
<p>Regretting his decision to abandon Jaller, Takua tracks him down and finally admits that he should have accepted the title of Herald from the start. He rejoins the search and the two get going, but when night falls, the three frozen Rahkshi are able to free themselves.</p>
<p>By morning, Lewa Nuva, Kopaka Nuva, and Gali Nuva have assembled to cure Tahu Nuva of his poisonous affliction. The Toa Nuva summon all of their healing energies; and Tahu Nuva is relieved of his madness, if still weakened. Kopaka Nuva departs without a word.</p>
<p>It is evening again when Takua, Jaller, and Pewku arrive at the Kini-Nui. Takua is reluctant to believe that so obvious a site is the hiding place of the Seventh Toa, and has stronger second thoughts when all six Rahkshi appear to take the Mask of Light once and for all. Fortunately, three Toa Nuva arrive on the scene followed by Kopaka Nuva and the rest of the Toa Nuva to defend the Matoran from their demise. For the first time, the Toa Nuva stand united against the Rahkshi and are successful; but not before Jaller dies at the hands of Turahk while trying to protect Takua. Distraught over his friend's death, Takua turns new thoughts over in his head and discovers the Seventh Toa — in himself. Takua dons the Mask of Light and undergoes a dramatic transformation into Takanuva, Toa of Light. With that, he finishes off Turahk and joins the Toa Nuva on their way back to meet Turaga Vakama.</p>
<p>It is decided that Takanuva shall ride a Kraata-powered vehicle constructed from the parts of the defeated Rahkshi, the Ussanui, to Makuta's underground lair alone. Takanuva descends into the tunnels beneath the Kini-Nui and arrives at the door of Mangaia. Upon entering, Hahli the Chronicler, having stowed away on board the Ussanui, is ordered to summon all of the Matoran of Mata Nui underground to witness the final confrontation between Toa and the Master of Shadows. It is not long before Makuta comes forth from the shadows of his lair and challenges Takanuva to a simple game of Kolhii. In this game, the object of the game was not to score a point, but to hit the other player. Takanuva successfully dodged every attack Makuta attempted. Meanwhile, Hahli convinced the Toa Nuva and the Turaga to go down to Makuta's lair and help Takanuva. When they arrived, Makuta destroyed the entrance, making it impossible to leave. This made Takanuva furious. As Makuta once again hurled the energy kolhii ball at Takanuva, Takanuva attempted his "new move", a special technique wherein he turned a somersault in mid-air, smashing Makuta into a wall.</p>
<p>Makuta, angered, rose from the floor, intending to kill Takanuva outright. As he issues his threats, he remarks that his duty is to the Mask of Shadows. Takanuva makes the utterly radical suggestion of seeing behind that mask. He pulls it off, revealing a light. They fall into a pool of protodermis, to later emerge as a single "Takutanuva". This being, having Makuta's power, Takanuva's purpose, and a mask combined of theirs, opens a gate and allows the Matoran &amp; Turaga to pass beneath it. As Hahli, bearing Jaller's mask, passes him, the Takutanuva stops her and re-creates Jaller. Weakened, he permits the gate to shut, crushing him.</p>
<p>The people enter a chamber, in which is marked the symbol of their three guiding virtues on the ground. Turaga Vakama, seeking to awaken Mata Nui, places Hahli on the Sign of Unity; Jaller on the Sign of Duty; and the Avohkii on the Sign of Destiny. Takanuva is revived, and the destiny of the Matoran is revealed.</p>
