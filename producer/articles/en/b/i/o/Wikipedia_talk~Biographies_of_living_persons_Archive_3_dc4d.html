<h2><span class="mw-headline">BLP alert</span></h2>
<p>How do we get some of the experts here to take a look at an article that a) some have wondered if it's even notable and b) has some potential violations of the BLP policy? The article is <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Schwarz_fc5e.html" title="Barbara Schwarz">Barbara Schwarz</a> and I only found out about it because someone alerted us to this problem over at <a href="../../../w/p/b/WP%7EWPBIO_80a5.html" title="WP:WPBIO">WP:WPBIO</a>... <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlange_d466.html" title="User:Plange">plange</a> 02:55, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>WHile the article itself is well sourced, I think the notability claim is fairly dubious. We don't have articles for every single Usenet personality, and three articles in the paper does not make an article. She never got heard by the Supreme Court, nor was she ever sanctioned with the vexatious litigant label, from my research. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 04:56, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was NOT really well sourced. The main source was and still is a questionable article by the Salt Lake City Tribune. The reliability of the SLCT article is debateable. Then next most used "well" source is USENET postings by Barbara Schwarz. Reliability has been a focus of the dispute. Yes, notability is in dispute and has been a main focus of discussion. At first the main claim to notability was poorly sourced claim of some kind of world or U.S. record of the most FOIA requests. Then the claim of notability was Barbara's past position as a church leader. I'm arguing that notability is regarding the violent <a href="../../../d/e/p/Deprogramming.html" title="Deprogramming">deprogramming</a> of Barbara Schwarz by <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyril_Vosper_e29f.html" title="Cyril Vosper">Cyril Vosper</a> and the involuntary psychiatric treatment/incarceration of Barbara Schwarz as a former church leader. Barbara Schwarz claims to have references (scanned court documents, etc), however she is blocked and therefore no way for her to provide them directly to Wikipedia. Apparently several people are in email contact with her and working on getting these scanned documents uploaded to Wikipedia. Also those docs are in German, so they're going to have to be translated first but I don't think that will be any big obstacle with things such as Google babelfish (a free translation tool). --<a href="../../../h/r/e/User%7EHResearcher_0608.html" title="User:HResearcher">HResearcher</a> 13:16, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Over at the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Talk%7EGeorge_W._Bush_758a.html" title="Talk:George W. Bush">Talk:George W. Bush</a> page, a bit of discussion evolved regarding how this policy seems to imply that any poorly sourced or unsourced negative material about a living person must be deleted on sight, but the same isn't true for poorly sourced or unsourced <i>positive</i> material. This implication leads to contradictions with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, so I'm thinking that we should put something into this article clarifying it. Perhaps another paragraph stating something along the lines of, "This policy is not an excuse to delete poorly sourced negative material about a living person while not similarly deleting poorly sourced positive material." ---<a href="../../../d/r/l/User%7EDrLeebot_fec7.html" title="User:DrLeebot">DrLeebot</a> 12:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a difference... This policy puts the emphasis on the "immediate removal" of negative material that is unsourced or poorly sourced, for obvious reasons. "Positive" material does not carry the harm (and the possible negative consequences) that results from a malicious edit. "Positive" material that is unsourced or poorly sourced, can be challenged and deleted as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 20:58, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, this policy is concerned about publishing inaccurate information. Almost every publishing house has editing standards and they are uniform, just like this one. Untrue negative information causes harm to the person it is written about. Therefore, there is uniform standards applied to living persons about negative information. It isn't about liabilty of the publisher, but damage to the person being profiled. Positive information should also be accurate but because their is no damage, there is no urgency. Think about it this way: If you know your roof leaks and it's raining, you do something immediately (because it's negative). If you know your roof leaks and it's sunny (i.e. positive), you do the most efficient and economical solution to fix the roof. In both casues you fix the roof. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 00:43, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is complete crap. <b>Positive, inaccurate information can cause direct, immediate damage</b> -- just not to the person listed. Positive, inaccurate information about, say, Scientology, leads people to get a mistakenly positive impression of it, leading readers into dangerous actions. The same is true of George W. Bush. This could be a very quick effect, much faster than any damage which Wikipedia could possibly do to Bush's reputation.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, positive comments should be given a chance, ie. debated and sufficient attempts made to find a good source before considering a removal. I believe it should be tagged with "needs a citation", and handled accordingly. Positive comments don't have the harmful "payload" attached and therefore can be "given a chance", so to speak, instead of just blindly deleting them on-the-spot. If anyone disagrees, feel free to say so. 70.101.145.181 06:32, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is it OK?</span></h2>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>A weird question, and possibly not completely related to this particular topic, but nevertheless prompted by it: You say that any sort of "unsourced" or "poorly sourced" "negative" (or ANY "speculative" unsourced articles regardless of topic (!)) articles about living people with no NPOV version must be deleted immediately by an administrator. The question is: what if I wrote such an article, it gets deleted (and protected), then I remake it under a slightly different title to defeat the protection, only this time citing reliable, verifiable sources, and it's from a neutral point of view (instead of just negative-only "bash 'em" comments)? What would you do? 70.101.145.181 08:44, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Protection is used much more rarely than deletion, only in cases where the article keeps being recreated as vandalism or with identical content as deleted. But if an appropriately sourced article can be written about the subject, it should be written, and I'd support a petition to move it to the appropriate title. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 14:11, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the narrow point, Striver is certainly correct. "Conspiracy theorist" is without question a pejorative term. Unless the characterization is essentially a universal consensus, it doesn't belong in the lead (and there are enough of the "9/11 conspiracy" folks that no such consensus against them exists... as nutty as I find them personally). The correct way to handle such a thing is to find an actual reputable citation of some other person calling the bio'd figure a "conspiracy theorist", and generally defer that until after the lead. So, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jane Jones is professor of such-and-such, and a prominent advocate of the position that John F. Kennedy was assasinated by extraterrestrials. <i>[...after lead...]</i> According to Sally Simmons, "Jones' book is rampant conspiracy theory" (Simmons, 1989).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should not be WP editorial position to characterize anyone in such a pejorative term (no matter how accurate), but presenting outside characterization is OK. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 15:40, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Occasionally such "X says Y is a conspiracy theorist" can be problematic. Consider <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_9070.html" title="Alex Jones">Alex Jones</a>. A large number of people describe him as a conspiracy theorist<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22alex+jones%22+%22conspiracy+theorist%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22alex+jones%22+%22conspiracy+theorist%22" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (not all google hits are unique, vast majority are not reliable sources, many matching pages say "Alex Jones is NOT a conspiracy theorist, etc). If you pick one or two reliable sources from those the article ends up reading "there are two people on this planet who think Jones is a conspiray theorist". That somewhat obscures the real state of affairs... If you pick a few dozen quotes in the hopes that the reader gets the picture the article becomes unwieldy. Add the inevitable battle of counter-quotes saying the person is <i>not</i> a conspiracy theorist. Some conspiracy theorists really are known primarily because of their professional conspiracy theorizing. <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 11:39, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_E._Jones_96d2.html" title="Steven E. Jones">Steven E. Jones</a> is a good working example of this.

<dd>I do not wish to get involved directly in that particular article, but I find the phrase "9/11 conspiracy theorist" in the lead jarring. It is plenty to say, in the next clause, that he is "co-chair of Scholars for 9/11 Truth". Moreover, the second paragraph of the lead starts with "Jones is also investigating the hypothesis that the World Trade Center Twin Towers and WTC 7 were brought down by pre-positioned cutter charges"... which looks fine.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now sure, you and I might agree that that group and that hypothesis amount to "conspiracy theory". But it would be much better to let readers make that judgement themselves rather than force-feed that interpretation. The first use of the phrase <i>is</i> accompanied by a footnote, but I feel that explicit reference to the footnote source <i>after the lead</i> would be a better approach. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 16:49, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Will Beback is simply mistaken about the above claim, at least in a US context. Lobbyist generally have to legally register as such, and such registration is about as objective as one can get (it either happened or it didn't). Someone who "lobbies" without registering as a lobbyist should not be called a lobbyist in the lead; but it might be fine to later say that they were "described as a lobbyist by So-and-so". In any case, this guideline <i>absolutely does not</i> call on editors to make correct legal judgements about what is libel (here Will Beback is probably wrong too, but I'm not a lawyer, nor especially Stephen Jones' lawyer): it calls on removal of <i>derogatory</i> or <i>negative</i> information (under certain circumstances, i.e. not well cited). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 02:26, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, it's pretty clear that Will Beback has an agenda. This agenda is to clutter up articles on living persons with negative, derogatory material and negative labels such as "conspiracy theorist", "anti-immigrant", "cult leader", "pseudoscientist", "pedophile", etc. His Wikipedia philosophy is that every article on any living person should have a "criticism of *" section in it. It is long overdue that Wikipedia is finally adopting some firm policies against using biographies of living persons for libelous purposes. Will, repeat after me. Biographies of living persons should contain <b>no negative or derogatory content whatsoever</b>. None, nada, zilch, zero, zip. No "criticism of" section, no derogatory labels, no derogatory categories, and no left-wing or right-wing partisan political advocacy websites as critical sources (*including* the SPLC). If you don't like it, find some other place to push your POV. 70.108.123.98 02:42, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So, now that it is established that "conspiracy theorist" is pekorative, per Justforasecond, then it should be clear that wikipedia will not endorse the pejorative term per <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a>: <i>"The responsibility for justifying controversial claims in Wikipedia, of <b>all</b> kinds, but especially for living people's bios, <b>rests firmly on the shoulders of the person making the claim</b>."</i>.</p>
<p>With that establieshed, we can conclude that we can only say "x says y is a conspiracy theorist". Next question is wether that should be in the lead, ie if having "x says y is a conspiracy theorist", and is unecesary when it can be expresed in a more neutral way, without citing anyone, per "y belives that".</p>
<p>Next, regarding <a href="../../../c/o/n/Category%7EConspiracy_theorists_8426.html" title="Category:Conspiracy theorists">Category:Conspiracy theorists</a>.

<dd><i>Y called X "an asshole"</i> is fine when it's one notable critic. <i>Critics including V, W and X consider Y an asshole</i> is fine if it's wiodespread. And at that point the analogy breaks down because there is no objective way of showing that someone is an asshole. Whereas with conspiracy theorists, the fact that they are prominent exponents of a clearly identified conspiracy theory is verifiable from reliable sources. So in the case of Jones, the balance of informed opinion is that he is a conspiracy theorist, something whic is backed by his repeating a conspiracy theory (pretty much in those words) in an interview where he tries to show he is not one. His theory is pretty much the classic conspiracy theory: he rejects the widely-held prosaic explanation, he introduces unproven hypotheses, he accounts for the lack of evidence in support of his theory by postulating conspiracy. This is one of the less contentious ones. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:44, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Implication/discredit</span></h3>
<p>From rereading all this, the problem I'm having more and more with this now is the implication that immediately labeling them as a "conspiracy theorist" is the negative connotation of this, and the tone that it "discredits" any credibility the subject might have. For the people that have worked under these articles, you KNOW that before yesterday I never once removed this lable from an article, but after thinking more and more about this information, and this policy, it began to strike as not appropriate to carry this in the lead, as a statement of Fact from us. Saying in a later passage--but not the lead--that "such and such" considers Mr. XYZ a conspiracy theorist would be acceptable, but for us to make the statement is too much. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERootology_22b0.html" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>) 22:44, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes. If the balance of informed opinion is that Bush is dumber than a brick we can certainly say so, provided we can source it properly.

Right from edit 1 of this article, his involvement with WTC conspiracy theories has been in the lead. Rightly so - it is pretty much the only thing for which he is widely known. Just about every reliable authority says that the 9/11 conspiracy theories are fantastical, so to describe them as conspiracy theories is to accurately reflect the balance of informed opinion as verified from reliable sources.

<dd>Looking at that particular article, it seems to me from the cited sources and casual investigation that the balance of informed opinion is that he is a conspiracy theorist. He does not seem to dispute this. Where has he disputed this widely-applied label? It's hard to find any discussion of the man which doesn't mention conspiracy theories, so I'm sure he's spoken out. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 00:30, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is clear that the people in the 9/11 Truth Movement reject being called that. And it is a blatant violation of wikipedia'a principles, this very one, to label them what they have rejected.

<dd>No, it is not a "blatant violation" of anythig to apply a label which reflects the balance of informed opinion, even if they reject it themselves. I am sure that <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Mugabe_10bb.html" title="Robert Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a> does not regard himself as a vicious, corrupt dictator, but the balance of informed opinion is that he is just that. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Icke_4a63.html" title="David Icke">David Icke</a> probably thinks he is a model of sanity (as well as a deity) but the balance of informed opinion is that he is as mad as a badger. And the members of "scholars for 9/11 truth" undoubtedly see themselves as torch-bearers for The Truth<sup>TM</sup>, just like every other proponent of every other conspiracy theory, but the balance of informed opinion is solidly against them. The quote you provide does not really contradict the view, either - it is mainly a rejection of being called crazy and unpatriotic - he explicitly uses the phrase conspiracy theory, applying it to the Government - in other words, he <i>expounds a conspiracy theory right there in that interview</i>, which makes him a conspiracy theorist. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:12, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To build on what Pjacobi wrote, if someone is notable for something then we should include it in the bio. If we determine that Alex Jones, for example, is notable for being a conspiracy theorist, then we have to include that information in his bio, if he is to have a bio here. Of course it needs to be presented neutrally, and if someone has a better term for those in the field ("conspiracists"?) then we should use it. But we should not avoid using a characterization simply because the subject eschews that label.

<dd>Im all for including that some people argue Jones views to be conspiracy theories, that is both verified and notable. But it is another thing all together for wikipedia to endorse such a claim as Fact, specialy when the claim is vigorusly rejected by a large number of people. Are you arguing that wikipedia present something that is rejected by over 80% of the people Pakistan and the CNN poll as Fact? Even if so, it is still another thing to claim that somebody is a "conspiracy theorist/pseudo scientist". I still await for a mainstream sourse of Jones being presented as a "conspiracy theoris". Man, isn't the whole point of this policy that we should not label people with pejorative labels? Presenting his views can be easly done withouth giving him a pejorative label, it is enough to say he belives "x", let the reader make their own mind and also present that "x argues Jones views to be conpiracy theories and also lables jones as a Conspiracey theorist [source]". Nothing is gained by stating "Jones IS a CT" that could not be stated in a more profesional and neutral way. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 10:38, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

One of the arguements from there: <i>"I am going to refer to this guideline from Wikipedia:Categories: "Categories appear without annotations, so be careful of NPOV when creating or filling categories. Unless it is self-evident and uncontroversial that something belongs in a category, it should not be put into a category." On the pseudoscience article, there are frequent debates about what is and is not pseudoscience and how the term should be defined. No doubt that the title of "pseudoscientist" will also be contested, but the categorization system does not explain why someone was listed in a category. Since far too many inclusions of individuals in this category would be controversial, I think that it is best if the category is deleted per the Wikipedia guideline."</i>. The same is true for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">Conspiracy theory</a>, it makes clear that the use of the term is very controversial, both in aplication, definition and labeling people with it. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 10:53, 23 August 2006 (UTC).

<dd>It has been difficult to obtain properly released photos of many biographied persons. Certainly it is better to forgo the picture than to use one that is copyvio. But I would be in favor of adding a neutral comment to the effect that "pictures are nice, where possible". However, that might not really be specific to <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, but just a general point in "Perfect article" guidelines.

<dd>Jimbo wanted it to be a policy. You can research all you want but that's the bottom line. I'm not aware that he had any direct connection to the content of the policy, though. I began it based on the comment of a very angry subject of an article, Slimvirgin created most of the early content, and any number of others have since made it even better (although it could use a bit of a trimming). <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 01:38, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Listing the subject as a source</span></h2>
<p>As a "notable" individual myself, I often find myself meeting other notable individuals in various venues -- in a green room while we're waiting for an interview, in a a "speaker's lounge" at a convention, bumping into other authors at a major booksigning event, etc. When I chat with them, the subject of Wikipedia often comes up, since it's one of my favorite hobbies. Sometimes the people that I talk to complain about an inaccuracy in their bio, in which case I of course volunteer to fix/remove it (especially if it's unsourced negative info). I also routinely volunteer to expand simple biographical details to improve the article, such as high school attended, parents' occupations, place of birth, etc. In those cases, should I list the subject in the "Sources" section, such as, "Some information provided by subject, and transcribed by &lt;name&gt;"? Or, in those cases where the subject is himself or herself web-savvy enough to change their own bio (and yes, I make sure to tell them about <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>), should they list <i>themselves</i> in the "Sources" section? Has there been any discussion about the best way to handle these cases? --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 17:04, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you talk to the subject, the information isn't <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by the rest of us. That's not a valid source for Wikipedia. I know we make some exceptions for non-controversial self-edits, but adding another person into the chain is a very bad idea. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 17:10, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>When the subject has a web site of their own, I have at times encouraged them to write the fact they want to add to their biography to a public page there. That makes it verifiable. (For an example, see <a href="../../../h/u/m/Talk%7EHumphry_Knipe_1eb0.html" title="Talk:Humphry Knipe">Talk:Humphry_Knipe</a>.) On the other hand, <i>removing</i> incorrect and uncited information is much easier. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 18:07, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The key is verifyability. Unverified claims can be deleted by anyone. Verified (adequately sourced) NPOV claims should not be deleted without a very good reason. The subject may lie to remove data they don't want there. We don't take their word on something unless their word is more believable than the source used in the article. Actresses often fudge their birthdate. If an actress awears she is younger than the New York Times says she is, we should <i>not</i> take her word for it. Good judgement is important. Other people can be brought in to weigh their judgements. Extreme content can be removed while decisions are pondered. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 01:49, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> guideline states that biography subjects "<i>should feel free to correct mistaken or out-of-date facts about yourself, such as marital status, current employer, place of birth, and so on.</i>" My recommendation is, if they do that, we should <i>also</i> ask them to add themselves to the "Sources" section of an article, or perhaps figure out some way of marking the information as "self-supplied." --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 16:35, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Information supplied by the subject may be added to the article if: ... It does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject; "</p>
<p>Now since any mention of any other person, spouse, parents, children, employers, friends, etc are "claims about third parties", then by this rule, they may not be included on the subject's page, through using material or communications provided by the subject themselves.</p>

<p>The article on <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a>, for example, is full of well-sourced negative comments, interview snippets, etc. that aren't individually relevant to her notability, though she IS notable for her outspokenness. Sometimes these individually non-notable items become so numerous that special sections are created for specific categories. Usually they are appended to factual encyclopedic material, as if to show what a bad person she is. (See "Radio" <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html#Radio" title="Ann Coulter">HERE</a>.)</p>
<p>It seems to me that mentioning such a person's outspoken nature, and possibly providing an example or two in connection with that mention, should be enough for any encyclopedia. As it is, some (IMHO malicious) editors gleefully include negative after negative after negative, all of them with sources. (The unsourced ones are quickly weeded out, thank Jimbo.) I'm not sure that including such stuff contributes to encyclopedic excellence. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 13:21, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Coulter's style IS abrasive, but IMHO WE needn't and shouldn't be abrasive in covering her. (This applies to others, too. I'm advocating a policy of DISCOURAGING things that aren't clearly relevant to the BLP person's notability.) It's fine to say he/she's abrasive. It's fine to give a few illustrative examples. It's NOT fine (IMHO, and I hope also in a policy), to populate her article with example after example of her abrasiveness, ESPECIALLY when readers might think we are doing it to show she's a bad person.</dd>

<dd>What you remember? Evidence? I have asked an AMA advocate to look into my problems with the Gannon article, and while he is still in the initial investigative stage, he has already stated that he can find no solid evidence in all the sources listed of Gannon actually being a prostitute. What you "remember" happens to be unverifiable, and your comments illustrate the heart of this problem. You just violated BLP by posting unsourced negative info about illegalities committed, when there is zero evidence that any illegalities were committed. Should I remove your comments? But it is irrelevant to my question, which is, <b>is it necessary to cite sources for negative info on a living person wherever it appears, or is it sufficient to rely on the reader to follow a wikilink back to another article to find those sources.</b> An additional problem is, if sources in the main article are found not to support the claim, is there a mechanism for fanning out and removing all the negative info that points back to these sources? I guess the remover of the sources should check "what links here", and do the legwork themself. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 15:12, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I may agree with the specific case, the problem is that there's no bright line for deciding such things. In absense of such, I suggest letting the world wide web and various credit reporting agencies and skip tracing firms and clipping services and tabloids and political dirt-finding services be the repository of such stuff, while we let Wikipedia go back to its main job of becoming the world's best encyclopedia, repository of information on physics and history and culture and geography and whatever, WITHOUT becoming the central Big Brother repository on available "neutral" biographical information per se on everybody living who ever did anything of note, which is to say, just about everybody. We can live without that part of Wikipedia. Time enough for bio when you're dead. And few people care about biographical info which happens to show up in other contexts and stujects, contextually. We can allow bios of living people who want to be bio'd, and pull the plug on the rest NOW and sidestep that entire nightmare. The price is a tiny gap in knowledge, which in any case is merely the penumbra of a gap which is necessary anyway, due to libel law. The payoff for making this part of Wikipedia sacrosanct is a HUGE payoff in public relations--- a really monstrous one, because the bad bio thing and the bad info problem are the two main things most people know about Wikipedia. And yes, changing this would make a moral statement; it would be a clear attempt to take and maintain the high ground. Shocking, eh?

<dd>I am becoming more and more old-fashioned in my conviction that NPOV, NOR; and Verifiability can manage virtually any editorial question. So I sympathize with David Gerard. Nevertheless, in this particular matter the way I see it is, if we are going to have a policy at all, it has to focus on those matters particualr to the topic that are not explicitly covered by the core policies. I think there are three, each of which follow from the way a page about a living person is more vulnerable to abuse thatn other pages (or, vulnerable to a different kind of abuse: (1) the legal stakes are higher, in that we can be sued for libel (2) ethical stakes are higher, as we are talking about persons so it is virtually impossible for someone out there not to take it personally - this is why I think the word "sensitivity" and even more discussion of what this means is actually very important, and (3) we want to make sure these do not turn into vanity pages. I think NPOV, NOR and verifiability go far to protecting us against concern (3) and even (1) although given the stakes they need to be reenforced. But they do not address concern (2) and if this policy is to mean anything, it has to be clear on point (2). <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 15:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that "sensitivity" is an innovation for this guideline that appears to mandate leaning to <i>sympathetic</i> point of view rather than <i>neutral</i> point of view. That is, it's an attempt to subvert NPOV in the wording of the guideline (/policy). This is problematic.

<dd>I think at least some of the 'sensitivity' part will be resolved if we ensure that we require extra solid verifiable/reliable sources for the case of living persons and negative material. In addition, the best sources for WP are <i>secondary</i> sources, so if we stick to a combination of secondary highly reliable sources we would almost always be OK in the 'do no harm' category. My guess is that insisting on solid secondary sources for negative or personal material would take care of most BLP issues. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 16:03, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Jossi and the others. We need to make an effort to present verifiable information from reliable sources in the least harmful way. There are ways that BLP articles can met NPOV, NOR, and V and not be acceptable because they are likely to harm the subject and Wikipedia. Mostly it has to do with the way that Wikipedia articles are developed over time. For example we know that most new articles are incomplete and need more information to improve them. For most topics this is <b>not a big deal</b>. For articles about living people this can be harmful. If the bulk of the information is negative or only encompasses part of a person life, then it can give an skewed view of the person. IMO, experienced Wikipedia editors need to be sensitive to this and see to it that article are quickly made as complete and well rounded as possible and presented in a neutral way on the page because it minimizes harm to the subject and diminishes the possibility of future conflicts and disruption related to the article. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 16:38, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(outdent) I agree that above all, we should be sure that WP itself does not harm the living subject. I think that if all we do is summarize verifiable and reliable secondary sources then the added effect of the publication in WP would be small. Ideally WP itself should have a very low profile - simply collecting and presenting publicly available and reliable information from secondary sources. And certainly the presentation has to remain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> at all times. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 16:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The point of this page is not to create a tiered system of NPOV. NPOV is uncompromisable. It is absolutely integral to what Wikipedia is. This isn't a redefinition of NPOV. It is a guideline for how NPOV is to be applied in the circumstances where it is most important that it be applied. We can't bury our heads in the sand and pretend our actions on Wikipedia don't have consequences. They do, and the consequences are far greater when applied to a living person than to, for example, <a href="../../../n/i/d/Nidorino.html" title="Nidorino">Nidorino</a>.</dd>
<dd>This isn't to say that NPOV should be ignored on articles that aren't about living people. The crucial thing is that we are <i>prioritising</i>, focussing our efforts on the most important articles. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Korn_f7db.html" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a></sup> 18:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are inherent problems in this whole policy which simply are not being addressed. It's not enough to simply hold up secondary sources to take the blame for negative material, for instance. Secondary sources may not be totally reliable, and are hard to check. Even in cases where they are reliable, all such a policy does is leave the judgment in the tradeoff between "the public's right to know" vs. "the individual's right to privacy," up to somebody else (namely the editors and lawyers of the secondary source). Moreover, the "somebody else" is bound to be riding a slippery and ill-defined slope, because secondary sources use a legal standard (which varies from country to country) in which the "notability" of persons is used as some kind of index as to how much publication of harmful private information can be gotten away with.
<p>There is an explicit moral problem in posting information about a person on Wikipedia which they do not want to be posted there (for whatever reason). This is not treating others as you would want to be treated, or as you'd like your family or loved ones to be treated-- in such cases Wikipedia is THEREFORE acting in a way which is explicitly aggressive and aggravating. Give up the golden rule and that's what you get, so you'd better have a overwhelming social reason for it, like survival or security. I fail to see such a principle operating here.</p>
<p>Finally, let me point out that entry of Wikipedia information involves impact. It does involve a loss of privacy because Wikipedia entries are more easily available to search engines that most (almost all) secondary sources. Putting something on Wikipedia DOES make it more public, almost no matter how public it was, before the fact. Even if it was on the Five O'Clock News, the Five O'Clock News is an hour and Wikipedia is (no doubt, in some form or another) forever. At the end of this process, without guidance from the Bio subject, we thus have Wikipedia used as an amplifier for what may have been a questionable moral tradeoff decision (between notability and privacy) to begin with.</p>
<p>All of which is not helped in the least by the fact that the very creation of a Wiki bio on a person increases their "notability" and "public presence" far more than a full page article in their local paper ever can or will. Something these discussions have been reluctant to admit as a "given." Mostly I see Wikipedia treated as though it wasn't Major Media itself, but merely an unimportant mirror or piece of glass, with no effect on that which it is exposing or reflecting. Wrong. Wikipedia gives to anonymous persons the kind of power previously available only to editors of major newspapers.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, this whole process is bound to stink when applied to biography of living persons, without saving input and editorial management from the people who will otherwise be the targets of victims of it. Which, so far, we simply do not have. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 19:07, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">On sensitivity</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> said "<i>Sensitivity is not part of the original intent of the policy</i>". That is in fact the exact opposite of the truth. When I created the first edit of the proposal that became the guideline that became the policy, its <i>entire</i> content was to be sentitive on articles about living people with the context of that being a very (and still) angry object of a bio that objected to what he perceived as an invasion of his privacy as a nonnoteable (legally speaking according to Florida privacy laws he said) private person and he did not want to be converted into a public person with fewer legal rights concerning his privacy. The meaning of "sensitivity" is <i>not</i> omit negative information but instead involves enhanced awareness such as the enhanced awareness you have in the more sensitive parts of your body. The use of the word "sensitivity" is a dircet quote from the man asking for a little as he was a living person. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 23:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One of the problems will be that admins need to be all on the same page about what is proper sourcing for BLPs. I am in a dispute with an admin over just this issue. I don't believe the sources support the negative claims in a particular article, and an admin disagrees with me, and keeps reinserting the offending statements. An AMA advocate is looking at the issue for me, and is tending to agree that my interpretation is correct. I already thought the BLP rules were clear, but apparently they are not clear enough for this particular admin. Perhaps a tutorial program for the admins that will be watching this board? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 16:07, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I actually wrote that section. You should have seen the previous version if you think mine was bad, I rewrote it out of sheer necessity. But I actually agree with you 100%. Unfortunately there is a large group of people that don't agree with us that if a DOB is verifiable by a reliable source then it should go on a Wikipedia page. There are people that think the exact DOB only belongs in an article if it is relevant to the subject's notability. The archives have some discussions on this that you probably want to look at. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 09:05, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Exactly what is newsworthy or notable about the date of birth of (say) a child of a politician, even if it is verifiable? Wikipedia isn't supposed to be a collection of facts; it's supposed to contain <i>useful</i> information. Similarly, if the article notes that someone was born in 1955 (say), what difference does it make if he/she was born on March 12th as opposed to September 16th, or whatever?</dd>
<dd>The other problem is that if the cited source removes the dates (or vanishes - see <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link_rot.html" title="Link rot">Link rot</a> - then wikipedia could easily end up being the <i>only</i> place the date can be found, and certainly the only place it can be easily found. No, wikipedia probably can't be sued successfully on this.

<dl>
<dd>Again, what VALUE is there in adding an exact birthdate? And as for a hardcopy source, that addresses the link rot issue, but it doesn't address the issue of ease of finding a birthday - wikipedia is a lot more likely to be used for identity theft than the Dictionary of National Biography. (And hardcopy sources, while meeting verifiability standards, aren't easy for other editors to check.)</dd>
<dd>In short, why exactly do we want to do this, and what exactly is the harm of omitting birthmonth and birthday?? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 14:04, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The "identity theft" issue is a red herring. The complete birth dates for all persons born in Kentucky, California, and Texas are online for anyone to view with a subscription to www.ancestry.com for about $75 or thereabouts. Millions of birthdates. In addition the California ones give the mother's maiden name. We live in a world, which is already, for better or worse, past this issue of birthdates.

<dd>Not just identity. Invasion of privacy. Example: you personally don't use your name here, but you've nevertheless left enough clues on the web that it took me 60 seconds to find out that your neighbor across the street is Ms. Castro, and you paid $160,000 for your house, which gives me some idea of how well you were doing in consulting when you moved to the West Coast 8 years ago, and so on and so on. I can have a satellite photo of your back yard, if I like. And it would be snap for you to find out personal things about me (since I DO use my real name). This is all "public" knowledge (and I'm sure you can guess where it is, in your case), but "public" is a fuzzy concept. Which section of the public are we talking about? People with computer skills? People with IQ's above 100? Above 125? What? Wikipedia is the great leveler, where what is publicly obvious to the most talented skiptracer in theory also becomes available instantly to the village idiot or credit agency or stalker. If we don't fix the policy, we're all going to regret it. Here's our chance.
<p>I hear Jimbo's daughter has been a victim of privacy invasion. And Jimbo has been caught repeatedly buffing his own Bio, and merely confesses and says he's sorry.

<dd>Well if you want to write an article aboue me, since you know so much you should do it! And then what I paid for my house (whether the above is correct or not) might be relevant. Otherwise your point is vague. You can find something out about your neighbor and so.... we shouldn't post birthdays of celebrities? And in my particular case, I am a web personality (in small type) and so it's not hard to find out things about me. I spend 10 hours a day on the internet, it's my business. So again what's your point? We're not talking about finding out things about "people" just about people-who-have-wiki-artices. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 18:34, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, but such information helps locate people in databases. For example, people with a common name like yours (which I notice you don't use here-- why not?) are much more easily searchable with an exact birthdate. And a birthdate serves as ersatz ID for places where the SSN isn't used, as for example in many pharmacy transactions.
<p>It's just part of a key to things about a person's history which may be "public" but only in the very narrow sense that they may exist in some public form, like an old CV posted on the web, or somebody's opinions on a TALK page, and the personal info from somebody's yearbooks from libraries someplace. Add to this long forgotten newstuff, public records of various types (difficult but not impossible to get if you have money and time), and a fairly thorough biography can be created on anybody, as you well know from being a geneologist. A bio just waiting to bite you from wikipedia the moment you do anything "notable" (whatever that is). And one which can be used for malicious purposes if you have the bad luck to run afoul of a malicious person. All this is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Let me add another problem, which is that the idea that WP:NOR protects somebody from putting all this stuff together. It doesn't. All original article writing represents new synthesis of information, just from the act of choosing sources and which sentence to put ahead of another. If it wasn't original synthesis, it would be plagiarism, so you pick. It's one or the other. I don't want to see it done on Wikipedia for living people who object to it. ONCE AGAIN, let me strongly remind everybody that PUBLIC isn't a binary thing, so that all information is either PUBLIC or NOT PUBLIC. A great deal of information is "public" only by virtue of being hidden in plain sight in some obscure place, awaiting a good deal of time, work, money, sweat, and some intelligence to dig it out and associate it with other information. We don't need Wikipedia, at the end of a 2 second Google Search to be the end result and repository of that process. So I urge you to do what you can to stop it. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 18:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I could not have put it better myself. Basically the point is that, indeed, if you really want to gather information about somebody, you can often do so (look up records in city halls or courthouses, do "freedom of information" requests, do many Google searches, etc.); it tends to take time and resources, and this is why people seldom do it unless they have real grudges and resources to spare.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, on the other hand, is a high traffic site highly ranked in Google. This means that people who otherwise may have to sleuth quite a bit before doing bad things would just have to do a 2-second Google search.</p>
<p>Now, it is a fact that banks and other businesses often consider that if you know someone's date of birth, mother's maiden name, name of children, then you probably are that person. Perhaps this is stupid, but that's how things are.</p>
<p>We should therefore not store information that has little encyclopedic value but high potential for trouble. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 21:38, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me put it more bluntly: we are aware that certain groups are probably data mining Wikipedia for personal information. We don't necessarily know why: they may be debt collection agencies, they might be national government security agencies, or police, or - maybe, just possibly - they are Identity Theft groups. Do not have this information in Wikipedia BLPs. - Amgine 22:53, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have to disagree, and agree with the current poster. Birth dates of kids and wives are irrelevant because the article is supposed to be about the individual in question. Basically, if the birth date is of a person that's notable enough to be mentioned on Morning Edition, in a birthdates section of a newspaper, or in a magazine biography, it's notable. Some people have notable birthdates that are part of their personality... a crooner born on Valentine's Day, for instance. That counts.

<dd>Kids' birthdays are not relevant, I agree. But if people are notable enough to have a Wikipedia article, they are notable to have their birthdates there too.

<p>Okay, I'm copying and pasting what I said on the tak page for Kari Wahlgren, a voice actress who recently requested that her birthday information be taken down. The month and day were taken down, but that doesn't really address HER problem with her birth year being put up--her age. She's what I think is considered a "non-notable public figure." Yes, to some people she is notable, but she's no Angelina Jolie or Barbara Walters--she's not a household name, nor is her age something she (and many other non-notable actors) want known! In the case of actors and actresses trying to make a name, career, or even living for themselves, having their age revealed can be limiting their careers. Producers and directors may claim to practice blind casting, but lets face it, as soon as they know someones actual age, they start restricting themselves. A lot of actors would prefer their ages not be revealed because of the reprecussions, and I'm sure Kari is just one of those. Sure, people should be able to know the "Encyclopedic facts" but is it REALLY that important? If you're a fan of someone, shouldn't your ultimate goal as his or her fan be their success as an actor or actress--or their ability to put food on the table? If that's not reasonable, I don't know what is. My thought is that in cases like this, if the subject requests their age being removed, it should be for their protection, the protection of their career, that we oblige. It might sate someones curiosity, and yes, to the technologically inclined who know where to find the information or are willing to pay for the information, you can find it, but is it really worth sacrificing potential career roles/moves to make a handful of people happy that they know? Besides, some fansites who may respect the subjects wishes may have their birth day (month and day) posted but not the year, and the combination of that information and the year being available defeats the whole purpose of "year but not month and day" that's listed as policy in Ms. Wahlgren's Talk page.Just a Fan 21:41, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, please remember that we are writing an encyclopedia, not a fan site. We can have no interest in the future success as an actor or actress. We merely document the success he/she has already achieved. (To be more precise, we synopsize the documentation of others about his/her success.)</dd>
<dd>If the person is not notable, then we generally should not have an article at all. (Your description as a "non-notable public figure" makes me wonder if that should be the case here.) If the person <i>is</i> found to be notable, his/her birthyear is an appropriate fact to include in the biography. Birthyear helps us to understand the context in which they lived and the probable influences on their lives. Month and day are removed because it's not really encyclopedic information that advances the understanding of the subject of the biography.</dd>
<dd>The fact that the person has chosen to release month and day on a different site such as a fan-site and thereby risks some outsider making a correlation and compromising their own person information is, to be blunt, their problem. The fact that some employers are alleged to practice age-discrimination is also not our problem. We would not remove an image just because it exposed the subject's skin color.</dd>
<dd>If a semi-public person wishes to have his/her biography removed from the encyclopedia all together, we should oblige. But if we have an article, it should be a complete article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 13:08, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How, pray, does a subject <i>get</i> their biography removed if they want it so (and permanantly)? If an actor doesnt want their personal lives splashed all over your encyclopedia for anyone with an internet connection to edit? Just a Fan 13:51, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The subject has several options. The first would be to simply nominate the biography for <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">regular deletion</a>. In the nomination, be sure to lay out the reasons why you think the subject is not notable enough to be included. If you identify yourself as the subject and request deletion of the biography (either as the nominator or as a participant), the community tends to give that weight during the AFD discussion. We're not going to delete articles on truly public figures like GW Bush but it can tip the scales for semi-public figures.</dd>
<dd>Alternatively, you could also <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContact_us_Article_problem_Factual_error_%28from_subject%29_eb9d.html" title="Wikipedia:Contact us/Article problem/Factual error (from subject)">contact Wikipedia by email</a>. That triggers a confidential investigative process that can resolve most complaints. In a worst-case situation, you can contact the foundation's designated agent (see <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html#Legal_concerns" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">here</a>).</dd>

<p>At the head of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">new anti-Semitism</a> article is an image ... Nowhere in the article is there text saying who's claiming that the image is anti-Semitic (only linked references to fairly respectable blogs connected to news sources).

<dd>The image caption does not say it is anti-Semitic, but that it contains anti-Semitic motifs (as well as others). The image caption also does not include the artist's name.

<dd>Referring to my edits of 15:41, 30 August 2006: <b>1)</b> The <i>"...shouldn't have included..."</i> was a response to the anti-Coulter rant. This isn't about Coulter, but about a malicious technique. To make things clearer, my original post included a link to an actual example of the malicious technique. The fact that the example related to Coulter drew forth a rant unrelated to my point. I was both amused by the rant, and sorry that I had prompted it. <b>2)</b> As I made the 15:41 edit, I realized that thoughtful editors had already fixed most of the problems in the Coulter example, so my original link now pointed to a cleaned-up version. So I added a second link in my original edit. One link now leads to the version with the problem, and the other leads to the current, cleaned up version. <b>3)</b> Hope this helps. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 04:31, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Family members</span></h2>
<p>Some biographical entries contain documentation on family members (first names, religious affiliation, etc.), even though these members are not public personalities. I suggest these should be systematically dropped. Family members of public personalities who are not themselves public personalities have a right to privacy; besides, such content is not encyclopedic, and may create real problems to those involved (such as facilitating harassment). Just because, say, your brother is a controversial politician, you should not have to endure the harassment of those who dislike the guy. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 14:59, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Note that our policy can be summarized as "publish information in proportion to what people have willfully done to get information published". An actor who poses for gossip photographers, by this mere action, puts himself in the limelight. A random person who just happens to have a famous relative is entitled to privacy.</dd>

<p>For instance: some article about some personality who had a bad divorce mentioned that personality's children by name, and the first name being uncommon, anybody interacting with that person may get details about her family by a simple Google research.

<dd>Minor real-life example of how this stuff can affect people's lives: My son-in-law Jim Donovan was a member of the minorly famous band <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusted_Root_11d5.html" title="Rusted Root">Rusted Root</a>. His daughter Tupelo has an unusual first name. The band had a wierdo stalker or two, but there are lots of Donovans around, so it was hard for them to find Jim and his family. Tupelo is another matter, since the name sticks out. No stalker ever caused problems after seeking out "Tupelo," but Jim and all around him had to be constantly on guard about it. (Being a baby at the time, Tupelo didn't have much of a presence in the information world.) It's easy to extrapolate the situation to somebody who's REALLY famous, or whose Tupelo is an attractive teenager. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 16:29, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We all know that "case by case" sounds good and reasonable in most cases and at a first thought here as well but it is not in this case out of simple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The english language Wikipedia is huge. We all have limited time. Please let us use "case by case" on matters that are more important than children of celebrities that also have a right living a normal youth.</li>
<li>The OTRS has a huge backlog of emails concerning privacy matters (a large number of them valid concerns).</li>
</ul>
<p>So do not decide on a case by case basis if certain privacy related information of minor important people needs to be <i>deleted</i> but decide on a case by case basis if you <i>add</i> it. In general the "family" section of a famous person whose family is not famous should contain the facts that he/she is married/divorced/whatever and has/hasn't one/two/three/whatever-number doughter/son but not the names and other highly indentifying information. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnomane_e259.html" title="User:Arnomane">Arnomane</a> 21:51, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I use the newspaper rule. If it was published in a legitimate newspaper, it counts. Politicians often like to parade their kids and wife in public, and name them in profiles; if that is the case, then they are named. For less-notable artists and musicians, it's a case by case basis. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 08:01, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I personally draw the line between those who openly parade their kids or invite journalists to their wedding, on the one hand, and those who don't. The former don't deserve privacy, the latter do. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 17:55, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well there's the problem what is a legitimate newspaper? Let's take the yellow press. They usually make a bussiness out of bringing the most private details to the surface (and they have a quite active legal "defense department" because of this). So I think a better approach would be mentioning the names and other details of non-famous children in case the parents did parade their family as you said (be it in a newspaper or at their campaing web site or whatever that is authorized by them).</dd>
<dd>Ok now there is the question how to apply it effective in Wikipedia? There's a simple solution: Required reference of such an authorized source in the relevant article (this perfectly fits to our reliability efforts, and is supported by sofware thanks to reference tag). If such a reference is missing these articles should be grouped somehow (try to avoid yet another template, a hand crafted list is just enough&#160;;) so that people can work with them efficiently (finding sources and in cse not removing the information).</dd>
<dd>However I want to make one thing clear. I don't want to suggest that we remove important personal information of famous persons, just because they or their family feels so. For example <a href="../../../b/o/r/Boris_Floricic_b3d0.html" title="Boris Floricic">Boris Floricic</a> was just famous enough in Germany and that's why de.wikipedia risked its first trial in that case and did win. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnomane_e259.html" title="User:Arnomane">Arnomane</a> 11:58, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is quite a significant difference. Porn stars, and other like people in the Witness Protection program, change their names in order to protect their families from being scandalized or targeted for recrimination. That is not the case with say an academic, or a sports figure or a politician. If an author's exact birthdate is in a widely available source like "Gale's Authors Online" there is no reason why we should not post that birthdate with a citation. If that person then has a phone directory listing, they are already publishing, to the world, where they live.

<dd>Well, my hope is that this noticeboard can help alleviate whatever flaws the actual policy has. It's why we attempted mediation (and it took 6 weeks to get rolling, which is why it was unsuccessful), and why I'm taking it here - a review is certainly in order, and would certainly answer a lot of questions about its application in this example. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:50, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">How to Count Real Citation Numbers</span></h2>
<p>On bios of scientists, some editors count number of citations toward assessing "Notability". Using citations on (say} Google scholar as a count is subject to gross artefacts.</p>
<p>E.g., unless both papers are actually posted as a journal article on the net (<i>Science</i> only does this back too about 1996), most cross-cites do not get picked up. A better count is derived by using "related articles" on <a href="http://pubmed.gov" class="external free" title="http://pubmed.gov" rel="nofollow">http://pubmed.gov</a> as a proxy or using citation index. E.g. Pubmed <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Display&amp;itool=abstractplus&amp;dopt=pubmed_pubmed&amp;from_uid=4359339" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Display&amp;itool=abstractplus&amp;dopt=pubmed_pubmed&amp;from_uid=4359339" rel="nofollow">cites</a> 96 articles related to a 1974 paper in <i>Science</i>, showing the first molecular electronic device. But, only a handful show up on a "Google Scholar" search.</p>
<p>An illustrative counter-example is the journal <i>Stroke</i>, where, unlike <i>Science</i>, full text articles back to the 1970's have been posted. With such articles, the number of citations showing on-line reasonably corresponds to "related articles" on Pubmed.gov.</p>
<p>E.g., for this <a href="http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/5/445" class="external text" title="http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/5/445" rel="nofollow">this 1970's paper in <i>Stroke</i></a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=link:http%3A%2F%2Fstroke.ahajournals.org%2Fcgi%2Fcontent%2Fabstract%2F9%2F5%2F445" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=link:http%3A%2F%2Fstroke.ahajournals.org%2Fcgi%2Fcontent%2Fabstract%2F9%2F5%2F445" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar lists 100 citing articles.</a> while <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Display&amp;itool=abstractplus&amp;dopt=pubmed_pubmed&amp;from_uid=705824" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Display&amp;itool=abstractplus&amp;dopt=pubmed_pubmed&amp;from_uid=705824" rel="nofollow">Pubmed lists 89 associated articles</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Threshold of reliability</span></h2>
<p>At <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_famous_prostitutes_and_courtesans_2938.html#Alleged_male_prostitutes" title="Talk:List of famous prostitutes and courtesans">Talk:List of famous prostitutes and courtesans#Alleged male prostitutes</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">User:Crockspot</a> and I are having a disagreement about the threshold of reliability required by WP:BLP. If I understand him correctly, he is saying that<br />
1. Regardless of the caliber of a source, there must be multiple independent sources.<br />
2. Those sources must not have any axe to grind.<br />
And perhaps he is claiming something even more restrictive than that, which I'm not quite picking up.</p>
<p>I find the second requirement a bit troubling, because it is hard to say who does and does not have an axe to grind. In this case, the two sources I provided, which were rejected as inadequate, were:</p>
<ol>
<li>An opinion piece, published in <i>The Guardian</i> in the UK, which states as fact that the individual in question was a prostitute. As most of you know, the UK has pretty much the world's toughest libel laws, so that if the individual had any intention of challenging this, then that was the ideal venue to do so</li>
<li>A piece (originally from <i>The Nation</i>, but reprinted on CBS's website) that says that the individual "apparently was seeking customers as a gay, military-oriented prostitute."</li>
</ol>
<p>Since then another editor has found two articles from the <i>Washington Post</i> asserting, respectively, that the individual's "naked pictures have appeared on a number of gay escort sites" and that he "was offering his escort services for $200 an hour, or $1,200 a weekend".</p>
<p>So, if these don't add up to enough, I'm a bit bewildered. Is Crockspot correctly interpreting this rule? If so, I believe we have an enormous amount of material about living people that does not meet this level of citation, probably the bulk of it. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 00:31, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Perhaps the first one could be softened a little by removing that the user might be blocked, but retaining the link to the blocking policy to make clear that it's a serious warning. Lou, anyone may use these, not just admins, but it's important not to use them provocatively.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleting negative material</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure if this has been asked here before, so here I go: Unsourced negative material about a living person should be removed on sight. I don't have a problem with that. What I've seen since this became a policy tho was that admins not only removed negative material, but also <i>deleted</i> the correspondent edits, citing this policy. Am I missing a good reason why deleting negative material is better than just removing it? The only thing I can think of are people wanting negative material about them deleted, even from the history, but this was not the case in the situations I've witnessed. I don't really like the direction this is going. We should only delete edits when there is a really good reason to, not just because they contain something negative about someone. So, why is deleting better than removing? --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 00:35, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Conti, the reasoning is that, if it's possibly defamatory, we don't want it on any previous page versions, so it's deleted entirely. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:57, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, we remove stuff from the history when we actually know that people are hurt by words, right? 90% of the people probably won't even find stuff when it's in the edit history. --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 23:23, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Biographies of Living Persons <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> requires a higher wikipedia standard since the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy_919c.html" title="John Seigenthaler Sr. Wikipedia biography controversy">Siegenthaler Controversy</a> in December 2005.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Photos of Political Figures</span></h2>
<p>I've read through the various articles and am still unsure what rules apply to photos of political figures, especially those who don't have government photos of them. I'm more than willing to e-mail them for permission to use a photo or requesting a photo, but want to be sure I'll be doing everything right. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim4christ17_a2d0.html" title="User:Tim4christ17">Tim4christ17</a> 17:55, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Also note that the planned usage for these images would be for the subject's Wikipedia entry, as well as relevant Wikipedia articles and lists of politicians, campaigns, potential campaigns, and (possibly) political parties. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim4christ17_a2d0.html" title="User:Tim4christ17">Tim4christ17</a> 17:55, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The main thing is to make sure they explicitly release the image(s) as GFDL or PD. It's not really good enough for a subject to say "I authorize this photo for use on Wikipedia", since that would prohibit syndication of content.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do wonder about exact verification procedures myself though. I recently obtained a photo of a biography subject who happens to be a Wikipedian. For that, I felt like the least ambiguous thing was to get him to upload the image himself, and just tell me the name. That way, the "self-made GFDL" option can be chosen. If I had simply gotten an email saying "Here it is, it's GFDL", I felt less comfortable about exactly what I should state on the image page when uploading the image.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, I worked with a different biography subject to obtain some textual content recently also. In that case, I used (though also modified significantly) the text he provided; to document the origin (which happened to also be available at a URL), I quoted on the article talk page the relevant portion of our email exchange where the bio subject wrote "I authorize use of the text at &lt;URL&gt; under GFDL". That went to copyright review, and was OK'd. But I felt fuzzier on the exact procedure. And I'd feel even less certain about an image about which I had a similar discussion. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 18:19, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A Little Study Guide</span></h2>
<p>I do some work for one of the Washington Post companies. They required me to take a short interactive course on avoiding behavior that could lead to sexual harrassment claims. There was some online study material that included a number of examples, and a quiz before and after to measure how much I knew and had learned. Now that I've taken the course, the Post and I are both a bit better off.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that we might benefit from such a little course about BLP policies. It wouldn't have to be interactive, and if it included a quiz, editors could score it themselves.</p>
<p>Such a thing could be helpful to good faith editors who want to be sure their BLP work is in keeping with policy. Editors who seem not to follow policy could gently be advised to take the course. Nobody would need to know who took the course, did the quiz, or even looked at any of it.</p>
<p>If there's interest in the idea, I'd be happy to come up with a draft. Look <a href="../../../a/n/n/Talk%7EAnn_Coulter_1918.html#Biographies_of_Living_People" title="Talk:Ann Coulter">HERE</a> for a simple example. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 20:18, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
