<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionic_Bunny_49b5.html" title="Edit section: Bionic Bunny in the Arthur world">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bionic Bunny in the <i>Arthur</i> world</span></h2>
<p>In both the <i>Arthur</i> books and cartoon series, Bionic Bunny is the favorite superhero of most of the characters, especially <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Read_9892.html" title="Arthur Read">Arthur Read</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/s/Buster_Baxter_12c9.html" title="Buster Baxter">Buster Baxter</a>. In addition to being portrayed as a (live-action within the Arthur context) <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_series.html" title="Television series">television series</a>, he has also been the star of a movie series and a popular comic book. Bionic Bunny is also heavily merchandised in Arthur's world, with his poster hanging prominently in Arthur's room, as well as countless other references. Some viewers believe that Arthur wears Bionic Bunny slippers, but this is actually half of a larger joke: Arthur, the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aardvark.html" title="Aardvark">aardvark</a>, wears bunny slippers, while Buster, the bunny, wears aardvark slippers. Other notable Bionic Bunny merchandise includes Arthur's walkie-talkie system. Arthur is also revealed to wear Bionic Bunny underwear in the episode <i>Arthur Goes to Camp</i> (this piece of information was also one of the many quotes programmed into an <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actimates.html" title="Actimates">Actimates</a> D.W.). Arthur also dresses up as Bionic Bunny for <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionic_Bunny_49b5.html" title="Edit section: Bionic Bunny's role in the plot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bionic Bunny's role in the plot</span></h3>
<p>Generally, Bionic Bunny serves as an all-purpose commercial entertainment for the Arthur kids, filling much the same role as <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radioactive_Man_%28The_Simpsons_character%29_f80d.html" title="Radioactive Man (The Simpsons character)">Radioactive Man</a> on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>. Sometimes, however, Bionic Bunny is more central to the action, serving as inspiration for the kids or helping them out of tough situations. In an example from a very early episode, Arthur's Eyes, Arthur is embarrassed by his new glasses, until he notes that Wilbur Rabbit, the actor portraying Bionic Bunny, wears glasses too. The story stresses the idolisation of superheroes among young children, taken to the point that anything associated with these role models, even indirectly, can't be all bad.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionic_Bunny_49b5.html" title="Edit section: Dark Bunny">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dark Bunny</span></h3>
<p>In later episodes, Bionic Bunny's show had been spun off into a second series, <b>Dark Bunny</b>. Dark Bunny is a darker, scarier, and gloomier portrayal of the Bionic Bunny universe, and is comparable to Bionic Bunny in the same way that <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> is to Superman. In particular, Dark Bunny is in reference to the post-<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Miller_%28comics%29_863f.html" title="Frank Miller (comics)">Frank Miller</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Dark_Knight_Returns_5b08.html" title="Batman: The Dark Knight Returns">Dark Knight Returns</a></i> version of Batman, and most of all to the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Batman%7E_The_Animated_Series_3563.html" title="Batman: The Animated Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a></i> cartoon of the 1990s. The first episode mentioning <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Bunny_87c7.html" title="Dark Bunny">Dark Bunny</a> says he is Bionic Bunny's cousin, but a later episode reveals them to be brothers. Arthur and his friends are at first fascinated with this more mature spin-off (except for D.W., who considers it scary), but soon become bored with it and watch the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Care_Bears_d522.html" title="Care Bears">Care Bears</a>-inspired "<a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_Ducks_6846.html" title="Love Ducks">Love Ducks</a>" show instead.</p>

<p><b>Conejitos Mechanicos</b> is the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> version of Bionic Bunny, and is roughly a literal translation as well. Seen in the episode "Arthur and Los Vecinos", Arthur's Hispanic teenage new neighbor has a stack of Conejitos Mechanicos comic books in Spanish, which he gives to Arthur because he's outgrowing them and losing interest in the character. Arthur gladly accepts, but proceeds to pester his new friend by asking him to translate nearly every word. This is a realistic simulacrum of the real-world comic book industry, where heroes often have different names in non-English markets (<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>, for example, is <i>El Hombre Araña</i> in Spanish) and the stories are either translated or completely different.</p>

<p>Bionic Bunny also features as a character in the controversial "<a href="../../../p/o/s/Postcards_from_Buster_636e.html" title="Postcards from Buster">Postcards from Buster</a>" series. One notable example is an episode entitled <i>Buster's League of Champions</i> and set in <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Beach_7a56.html" title="Virginia Beach">Virginia Beach</a> in which Buster, disappointed after seeing a bad Bionic Bunny movie, writes a letter to the producers with suggestions for a sequel, which are acted out by various children Buster meets.</p>

<p><i>The Bionic Bunny Show</i> (first <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-316-11120-1</a>) was a children's book by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Brown_edd5.html" title="Marc Brown">Marc Brown</a> and, Laurene (Laurie) Krasny Brown. It was published in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> by Little, Brown &amp; Co, 12 years before the Arthur television cartoon first aired. Although fictional and drawn as a cartoon, the book attempts to show small children the concept of a television show from behind the scenes, introducing the concept of an actor, showing the steps involved in preparing and shooting an episode, and so forth. The main point of the book was to show children that while television shows may be entertaining, they aren't "real", and that television heroes are really just ordinary people. The book was featured in an episode of <i><a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_Rainbow_89cf.html" title="Reading Rainbow">Reading Rainbow</a></i> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. In addition to reading the book, host <a href="../../../l/e/v/LeVar_Burton_fc9e.html" title="LeVar Burton">LeVar Burton</a> also expanded on the book's themes with a behind-the-scenes look at his other series, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_3745.html" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i>. After the <i>Reading Rainbow</i> episode aired, a second edition was printed (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-316-10992-4</a>) which was even more popular than the first. The <i>Reading Rainbow</i> episode was also released on video, including as a set with the book. Later, the book was reissued yet again (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-8085-3762-8</a>) in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>.</p>

<p>Creator Marc Brown has revealed in interviews how the idea for Bionic Bunny came about. He and his wife Laurie were discussing aspects of superheroes while driving to an antique show in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>, specifically how young children consider superheroes to be "real". Laurie was speaking from some experience, having studied superhero fiction at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>. They agreed to collaborate on a book about superheroes. Thus, Bionic Bunny was not created to be part of the <i>Arthur</i> world, but instead became part of it later. According to the interview, the Browns were pulled over for speeding during their conversation that night.</p>

<p>Bionic Bunny and Dark Bunny face off against a number of villains, many of which are parodies of known comic-book supervillains.</p>

<p>Although Marc Brown has traditionally avoided heavily marketing his characters to avoid overexposure, there has been some Bionic Bunny merchandise, such as a ten-inch stuffed doll (a similar Mary Moo Cow doll was also made). Bionic Bunny makes cameo appearances in many other Arthur items as well: for example, a talking Arthur doll from <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> which wears a Bionic Bunny wristwatch, which plays games when pressed.</p>

<p>A feature-length <i>Arthur</i>-related movie has been in development for several years, and for a time official sources indicated that the movie would center around Bionic Bunny, and possibly even be called The Bionic Bunny Movie. As of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, it was revealed that the first Arthur feature would be a CGI movie called <i>Arthur's Missing Pal</i>, to be released in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> by <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lion%27s_Gate_Entertainment_8061.html" title="Lion's Gate Entertainment">Lion's Gate Entertainment</a>.</p>
