<p>I keep seeing info about the Toa Hagah (meaning Pouks, Bomonga, Gaaki, and Kualus; we already know about Norik and Iruini) being added to a number of pages, particularly their mask and spinner powers. Now, I've never seen this info in any official source, but then again I haven't gotten the Bionicle Encyclopedia yet. I think this stuff is made up, but can anyone confirm whether it is or not?</p>

<p>Well Jeez your self. Go to some of these websites: www.bzpower.com&#160;; www.bionicle.com&#160;; www.biosector01.com OR if you wanted to use common sense, then you'd go to etither Yahoo or Google and search Bionicle in images. See how easy that was</p>

<dd>Well, this is for people new to Bionicle. Beginners don't need to know, say, what job a minor Matoran had on Mata Nui; and such details would probably overwhelm them. If they wanted to know more, then they could go to BS01 or its wiki and begin looking in-depth. BZPower and Mask of Destiny provide communities where fans can talk with each other; the closest Wikipedia has to that is the talk pages. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 17:16, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This argument could not possibly be more wrong, and, as much as I hate to say it, I have to agree with Toa of Sound, this is an argument for linkspam. Wikipedia is meant to be comprehensive, NOT a 'beginner's guide', and I really don't know where you got that idea from. No, wikipedia does not offer a community for specific subjects, nor does it need to, intrinsicly or through links. As a matter of fact, linking to a site for the sole purpose of providing access to a message board is strongly discouraged, and often disallowed outright. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 05:14, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's not the point, the point is, the links are just rederects to obtain members! Even though greg is a member there dosn't mean anything! It is link spam, and I don't get why you guys think you can put your links on the page and no one else can! Putting your links on the page when we don't.--68.238.37.141 15:01, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Everything is categorized now, though there are a few things I wasn't quite sure on.

<p>I really like that you moved stuff around to make the use of capitals consistent, but... I'm sorry, I can't get behind the recategorization. For one, most of the subcategories have something like three entries apiece and I think that's just too small to warrant its own division (much less the "spirits" category with only the <i>one</i> entry for Mata Nui). Second, some of the categories have too much overlap; for instance, <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa.html" title="Toa">Toa</a> could fall under "groups", "species", or even "characters". I'd rather just get rid of the subcategories altogether except for possibly "movies" and "books", maybe combined as a "media" category with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Bionicle%7E_The_Game_ecfb.html" title="Bionicle: The Game">Bionicle: The Game</a>.</p>
<p>I also liked the template the way it was, giving links to generic category pages that would then link to more specific articles. This isn't that bad, but it could be shorter, at the very least (I think it could be made to be more horizontally-oriented than vertical; look at the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legend_of_Zelda_2f46.html" title="Legend of Zelda">Legend of Zelda</a> template for an example). I do prefer grouping things like this in the template rather than in subcategories. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 03:44, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Mata Nui can be a character, I'll give you that. However, those categories (minus spirits) should remain. Stuffing everything in the main category looks terrible. To an outside observer, you can't tell a character from a species or a group sometimes. I can honestly tell you I couldn't make heads or tales of that beforehand. You may need to recat a few of my changes, but the bulk of them need to stay.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This I can agree with, and I'll look into scavenging that template later. For now, I just want everything organized into clear and defined areas that can be easily modified. Style can be discussed once the content is fixed. - <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 03:52, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>No offense, but I moved your replies to my post together so they'd be a bit easier to read. I also requested that the character list and group list be merged, as the organization between the two are extremely similar; but I don't want you to feel like you have to be the one to do it, in fact, I'll probably take care of this one in a day or two.</p>
<p>I also just wanted to say that I'm really impressed with everything you've done so far in just one night. I've done some mass edits to the Bionicle articles before, but if I ever set my mind to do a task this big it would take me weeks to get through everything.

<dd>I adjusted the template to a sideways format. As for groups and characters, I suggest keeping those separate. The names of this series are really quite vague. To an outside observer, Toa might seem like a person. Keeping them separate keeps their meaning clear and there are more than enough on either side to warrant a category for both. In general, if you have one really big list, you can and probably should categorize its elements. Now groups and species is something you need to sort out. I'd be willing to bet I put at least one in the wrong category. - <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 05:46, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The following Bionicle articles just got marked with merge requests but I don't agree with all of them; I wanted to discuss them here instead of just rudely deleting the requests: <a href="../../../k/r/e/Krekka.html" title="Krekka">Krekka</a> into <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Hunters_8396.html" title="Dark Hunters">Dark Hunters</a>, <a href="../../../l/h/i/Lhikan.html" title="Lhikan">Lhikan</a> into <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa.html" title="Toa">Toa</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidorak.html" title="Sidorak">Sidorak</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karzahni.html" title="Karzahni">Karzahni</a> (plant) into <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Makuta_5c64.html" title="Brotherhood of Makuta">Brotherhood of Makuta</a>, and <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visorak.html" title="Visorak">Visorak</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keetongu.html" title="Keetongu">Keetongu</a> into <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Rahi (Bionicle)</a>.</p>
<p>I think Visorak and Karzahni should be left where they are. The Visorak were the focus of the 2005 storyline and are well-known enough to have their own article. The information on the Karzahni plant should be left where it is because if there's going to be an article on Karzahni, the tyrant; then it would be most logical to put info of two things with the same name in the same article. Regarding Lhikan, and Sidorak; their articles are big enough that I'm not convinced any of them should be merged; but if Sidorak <i>is</i> merged it should be into Visorak instead of the Brotherhood, as he was the Visorak's King. Krekka's and Keetongu's merges, on the other hand, I have no problem with; in fact, all the relevant info on Krekka is already on the Dark Hunters page, so all that's needed is a redirect.</p>
<p>Anyway, those are my thoughts. What's everyone else's opinions on this? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 22:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I thinking to merged Protodermis and Antidermis and former one biology article, and the colectibles merged to one page, or not? and former tecnology article to Bohrok, "Fohrok", Vahki, Boxor and Exo-Toa.

<dl>
<dd>I don't think any of those articles should be merged. Protodermis is well-known enough to have its own article, and for antidermis, describing one specific virus doesn't really fit with the Biology section we already have in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_society.html" title="Bionicle society">Bionicle society</a>. Merging the "collectibles" all into one article would just be too big; the Kanohi article is large enough as it is, just think of how long it would be with Krana <i>and</i> Kraata <i>and</i> Kanoka etc. As for technology, the Bohrok and Vahki are major enough characters to get their own articles, and the rest can be described in the Vehicles and Machines section of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html" title="List of objects in Bionicle">List of objects in Bionicle</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 21:15, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, leave them alone; they're well-known enough to get their own article, at least for now (I feel the same goes for Sidorak; I'll go and revert that). Please, no more merges for a while. By the way, given how your grasp of English is kind of shaky, I don't think you should be correcting anyone's grammar like you tried to do in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_Adventures_ccd6.html" title="Bionicle Adventures">Bionicle Adventures</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_Chronicles_7528.html" title="Bionicle Chronicles">Bionicle Chronicles</a>. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 22:05, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, I'm sorry, but whatever you're using to check grammar isn't always correct; I think it's main problem is not being able to tell the difference between singular terms and plural terms (especially because Bionicle often uses the same word for both). And on the merges, I understand that you don't want articles to small and useless; and I don't want them that way either. But the point of putting up merge requests is to alert people of what you're going to do so they have time to react if they don't like it; putting up a request only ten minutes before the merge (as you did just now with <a href="../../../l/h/i/Lhikan.html" title="Lhikan">Lhikan</a>) doesn't help anyone.</dd>

<dd>The "three virtues" image is about as close as you can get to a Bionicle logo, if you don't count the title graphic.

<dd>The only other alternative is to use the current year's featured Kanohi mask, or a collectible, or even something similar. The only other alternative is perhaps the text, as you mentioned, which is rarely changed for the series (2004 and 2005 featured a "Metru Nui"-like image below the BIONICLE text. Apart from that, it's basically left to generic Kanohi masks. The best choice for Bionicle in general, however, would be the Infected Hau that Mask of Destiny uses, or perhaps the Mask of Light, as my Wiki uses, or any other 'important' Kanohi mask. --<a href="http://www.biosector01.com" class="external text" title="http://www.biosector01.com" rel="nofollow"><font color="#08C2E3">Swert of BS01</font></a></dd>

<p>Couple things. First, who edited in the bit about the recent lawsuit? We need citing of that. Supposedly a father of a little girl sued because she was scared by an ad? Sounds highly unlikely... Although people do odd things, certainly, heh--but something like that definately needs cited. Also, some of the wording of that paragraph wasn't very neutral; I've edited to hopefully fit <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> better; please comment if you disagree. Also, this whole article has a bit of overkill on the controversies, and the AAR RPG; there is much more relevant information about Bionicle that should get equal weight than those things. For now, I've combined the two controversies sections into one and moved them to the end. Seems a more neutral arrangement to me, and that seems to be the convention on most other articles with controversy sections that I have seen. Again, comment if you disagree... And finally, the "recall" claim about Pridak; the only site I've seen with members being uncomfortable with that (myself included to a degree) was on BZP, and nowhere was there anything about a 'recall' so that needs sourcing as well, please. --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonesiii_867a.html" title="User:Bonesiii">Bonesiii</a> 23:00, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I remember the lawsuit being mentioned on BZP a few months ago, but I agree that it's not really notable. The Free the Band promotion could also stand to be demoted ... maybe combine it with "Controversies" to make some kind of "Media and Marketing" section? Or just delete it outright sooner or later; in a few years, I don't think anybody's going to care. As for Pridak, maybe there should be a little blurb about how some fans are worried with increasing levels of violence in the franchise; in the debate about Pridak's "blood" some people mentioned that there was some concern the previous year about the Piraka using what looked like firearms. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDrakhan_7fe2.html" title="User:Drakhan">Drakhan</a> 23:40, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Ironically I just found it... <a href="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=236757" class="external text" title="http://www.bzpower.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=236757" rel="nofollow">at BZP</a>, heh. No idea how I never saw this article, but we do link to a source that seems on the up-and-up. However, it was <i>not</i> a lawsuit. It was only a complaint. I'm assuming this means it's even less notable... --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonesiii_867a.html" title="User:Bonesiii">Bonesiii</a> 04:27, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Seems like a few editors feel like having an edit war over the "Inika" and "Pridak" controversies. The above discussion decided that those could not be included, since the sources either were not reliable, or the subject was not notable. That is, the Pridak one did not have any sources at all (and as far as I know, it's not even true, except that some BZPers did take issues with it, but that's hardly noteworthy in an encyclopedia). The only source I could find for the supposed Inika lawsuit is mentioned above, and it says that it was <i>not</i> a lawsuit; just a complaint to LEGO. Hardly noteworthy, and hardly a "controversy." Now, actual noteworthy, citable sources for controversies can go in the article, but those things were not either. Again, please discuss this here, rather than waging an edit war over it. That's what talk pages are for, guys... --<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonesiii_867a.html" title="User:Bonesiii">Bonesiii</a> 20:30, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
