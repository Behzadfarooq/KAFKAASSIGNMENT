<p><b>Bioplastics</b> are a form of <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic.html" title="Plastic">plastics</a> derived from plant sources such as <a href="../../../h/e/m/Hemp.html" title="Hemp">hemp</a> oil, <a href="../../../s/o/y/Soy_bean.html" title="Soy bean">soy bean</a> oil and <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corn_starch.html" title="Corn starch">corn starch</a> rather than traditional plastics which are derived from <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum.html" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>. This is regarded as a more <a href="../../../s/u/s/Sustainability.html" title="Sustainability">sustainable activity</a>, as it relies less on <a href="../../../f/o/s/Fossil_fuel.html" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a> imports and produces less <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenhouse_gas.html" title="Greenhouse gas">greenhouse emissions</a>. However, manufacturing of bioplastic materials is not benign. Energy, which is most often derived from fossil fuels, is used to power farm machinery, to irrigate growing crops, to produce fertilisers and pesticides, to transport crops and crop products to processing plants, to extract the processible biomaterials, and to produce the bioplastic.</p>
<p>Italian bioplastic manufacturer <a href="http://www.materbi.com" class="external text" title="http://www.materbi.com" rel="nofollow">Novamont</a> states in its own <a href="http://www.materbi.com/ing/html/PDF/EPD_PE_180202.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.materbi.com/ing/html/PDF/EPD_PE_180202.pdf" rel="nofollow">environmental audit</a> that producing one kilogram of its starch-based product uses 500g of petroleum and consumes almost 80% of the energy required to produce a traditional polyethylene polymer. <a href="http://www.natureworksllc.com/media/Files/LCA/ghg%20release_north%20america_10%2005%2005_final.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.natureworksllc.com/media/Files/LCA/ghg%20release_north%20america_10%2005%2005_final.pdf" rel="nofollow">Environmental data</a> from <a href="http://www.natureworksllc.com" class="external text" title="http://www.natureworksllc.com" rel="nofollow">NatureWorks</a>, the only commercial manufacturer of PLA (polylacticacid) bioplastic, says that making its plastic material delivers a fossil fuel saving of between 25 and 68 per cent compared with polyethylene, in part due to its use of [renewable energy] in its manufacturing plant.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.athenasmi.ca/projects/docs/Plastic_Products_LCA_Technical_Rpt.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.athenasmi.ca/projects/docs/Plastic_Products_LCA_Technical_Rpt.pdf" rel="nofollow">detailed study</a> examining the process of manufacturing a number of common packaging items in several traditional plastics and polylacticacid carried out by US-group <a href="http://www.fal.com" class="external text" title="http://www.fal.com" rel="nofollow">Franklin Associates</a> and published by the <a href="http://www.athenasmi.ca" class="external text" title="http://www.athenasmi.ca" rel="nofollow">Athena Institute</a> shows the bioplastic to be less environmentally damaging for some products, but more environmentally damaging for others. The authors' key finding is that the use of bioplastics cannot be assumed to be environmentally beneficial, but has to be determined through case by case analysis.</p>
<p>Terminology in the bioplastics sector is quite confusing. Most in the industry use the term bioplastic to mean a plastics produced from a biological - and hence renewable and potentially sustainable - source. Cellulose film, for instance, is one of the oldest plastics. It is, and has always has been, made from wood cellulose and is fully biodegradable in its natural form. The wood it is made from is sourced from commercially managed forestry. <a href="http://www.innoviafilms.com" class="external text" title="http://www.innoviafilms.com" rel="nofollow">Innovia</a> is one of the major producers of cellulose film - some of which it markets as biodegradable.</p>
<p>Many bioplastics are <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biodegradable.html" title="Biodegradable">biodegradable</a>, meaning they can be degraded by microbes under suitable conditions. Some bioplastics will biodegrade in the relatively cool conditions of a home compost heap. Many more will only degrade in the hotter and more tightly controlled conditions of commercial composting units.</p>
<p>While many bioplastics are biodegradable, some are not - referred to as durable. And to make the situation even more complex, some petrochemical-based plastics are biodegradable. The <a href="http://www2.basf.de/basf2/html/plastics/englisch/pages/biokstoff/ecoflex.htm" class="external text" title="http://www2.basf.de/basf2/html/plastics/englisch/pages/biokstoff/ecoflex.htm" rel="nofollow">Ecoflex</a> range of biodegradable plastics manufactured by <a href="http://www.basf.com" class="external text" title="http://www.basf.com" rel="nofollow">BASF</a> of Germany is an example of this type. This material is used as an additive to improve the performance of many commercial bioplastics.</p>
<p>There is an internationally agreed standard that defines how quickly and to what extent a biodegradable plastic must be degraded under certain conditions - EN13432. This is published by the international standards organisation <a href="http://www.iso.org" class="external text" title="http://www.iso.org" rel="nofollow">ISO</a> and is recognised in many countries, including all of Europe, Japan and the US.</p>
<p>The term biodegradable plastic is often also used by producers of specially modified petrochemical-based plastics which appear to biodegrade. A little explanation is needed here. Traditional plastics such as <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyethylene.html" title="Polyethylene">polyethylene</a> in their natural form are degraded by ultra-violet light and oxygen. To stop this process, and to make the plastics usable, manufacturers add stabilisation chemicals. By adding a controlled amount of degradation initiator to the plastic it is possible to achieve a controlled disintegration process driven by the ultra-violet light in sunlight or by atmoshpheric oxygen. The North American company <a href="http://www.epi-global.com" class="external text" title="http://www.epi-global.com" rel="nofollow">EPI</a> is a leading player in this type of additive technology.</p>
<p>This degradation process is highly effective. However, this type of plastic is best referred to as "degradable plastic" or "oxy-degradable plastic" because the process is not initiated by microbial action. Some degradable plastics manufacturers argue that, once a certain level of degradation of the plastic has been achieved, the degraded residue will be attacked by microbes. Hwever, this route has yet to be proven and, in any case, these degradable materials will not meet the requirements of the EN13432 standard.</p>
<p>With the exception of cellulose, most bioplastic technology is relatively new and is currently not as cost competitive with petroleum-based plastics. And because many bioplastics are reliant on fossil fuel derived energy for their manufacturing, even with today's <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities/energyprices.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities/energyprices.html" rel="nofollow">rising oil prices</a> that gap is not closing very fast.</p>
<p>Many bioplastics also lack the performance and ease of processing of traditional materials. Polylactic acid plastic is being used by a handful of small companies for water bottles. But shelf life is limited because the plastic is permeable to water - the bottles lose their contents and slowly deform. However, bioplastics are seeing some use in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, where they account for 60% of the biodegradable materials market. The most common end use market is for packaging materials. <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles.</p>
<p>Because of the fragmentation in the market it is difficult to estimate the total market size for bioplastics, but estimates by <a href="http://www.sriconsulting.com" class="external text" title="http://www.sriconsulting.com" rel="nofollow">SRI Consulting</a> put global consumption in 2006 at around 85,000 tonnes. In contrast, global consumption of all flexible packaging is estimated at around 12.3 million tonnes (see <a href="http://www.plasticsnews.com/subscriber/fyi.html?id=1132774806" class="external text" title="http://www.plasticsnews.com/subscriber/fyi.html?id=1132774806" rel="nofollow">Plastics News</a>).</p>
<p>While production of most bioplastics results in reduced carbon dioxide emissions compared to traditional alternatives, there are some concerns that the creation of a global bio-based economy could contribute to an accelerated rate of <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deforestation.html" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a> if not managed effectively. There are also concerns over the impact on water supply and soil erosion.</p>
<p>There are also concerns that bioplastics will damage existing recycling projects. Packaging such as HDPE milk bottles and PET water and soft drinks bottles is easily identified and hence setting up a recycling infrastructure has been quite successful in many part fo the world. Polylactic acid and PET do not mix- as bottles made from polylactic acid cannot be distinguished from PET bottles by the consumer there is a risk that recycled PET could be rendered unusable. This could be overcome by ensuring distintive bottle types or by investing in suitable sorting technology. However, the first route is unreliable and the second costly.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/e/n/Genetic_modification.html" title="Genetic modification">Genetic modification</a> (GM) is also a challenge for the bioplastics industry. None of the currently available bioplastics - which can be considered first generation products - require the use of GM crops. However, European consumers are hostile to any products that are linked to the GM industry. Polylactic acid bioplastic is currently only manufactured in the US, where it is no longer possible to guarantee a GM-free feedstock supply. As a result, UK retailers such as <a href="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Sainsbury's</a> will not use bioplastic from this source.</p>
<p>There is also growing concern that the route from corn to bioplastics is not the most efficeint. Looking further ahead, some of the second generation bioplastics manufacturing technologies under development employ the "plant factory" model, using GM plants to maximise yield. Products from these technologies are not likely to be accepted in Europe, in particular, without a change in consumer perception of GM technology.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioplastic.html" title="Edit section: Market situation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Market situation</span></h2>
<p>These days plastics are predominantly made from <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crude_oil.html" title="Crude oil">crude oil</a>. However, the increasing hunger for energy worldwide and also political instability in the large oil exporting countries have led to a dramatic increase in the price of oil in recent years. A consistently low oil price, as was seen throughout the 90s, is not very likely in the future. In this context, <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renewable_resources.html" title="Renewable resources">renewable resources</a> are becoming a more viable and promising alternative for the plastics industry. However, as energy is used in the growing, harvesting and conversion of agricultural crops to bioplastics immunity to rising oil prices is sometimes overestimated.</p>
<p>COPA (Committee of Agricultural Organisation in the European Union) and COGEGA (General Committee for the Agricultural Cooperation in the European Union) have made an assessment of the potential of bioplastics in different sectors of the European economy:</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioplastic.html" title="Edit section: Certification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Certification</span></h2>
<p>Adding the prefix "bio-", misrepresenting a plastic compound as biodegradable, or confusing product labeling has become commonplace lately. Several certification schemes have therefore been set up based on the EN 13 432 industrial norm and the French NF U52001 norm, products made out any raw plastic material pretending to be biodegradable, are tested as to their true and biodegradability and compostability. Consumer products and packaging which passed the tests prescribed in the testing protocol laid down in these norms, may carry a special label. So far <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starch.html" title="Starch">starch</a> based plastics, PLA based plastics and certain <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliphatic.html" title="Aliphatic">aliphatic</a>-<a href="../../../a/r/o/Aromatic.html" title="Aromatic">aromatic</a> co-<a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyester.html" title="Polyester">polyester</a> compounds such as <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succinates.html" title="Succinates">succinates</a> and adipates, have obtained these certificates. Additivated plastics sold as fotodegradable, oxobiodegradable have not yet received these certificates and will probably not be eligible as the additives generally contain <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metals.html" title="Heavy metals">heavy metals</a> such as <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobalt.html" title="Cobalt">cobalt</a> and cannot show a biodegradation whereby over 90% of the plastic mass is converted into <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biomass.html" title="Biomass">biomass</a> and subsequently into <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbondioxide.html" title="Carbondioxide">carbondioxide</a> and water. Due to their photo- or oxo <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_decomposition.html" title="Chemical decomposition">degradation</a>, these additivated plastics are not suitable for recycling and can only be properly disposed of by incineration or <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landfill.html" title="Landfill">landfill</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioplastic.html" title="Edit section: Packaging">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Packaging</span></h3>
<p>Because of their biological biodegradability, the use of bioplastics is especially popular in the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packaging.html" title="Packaging">packaging</a> sector. The use of bioplastics for shopping bags is already very common. After their initial use they can be reused as bags for <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organic_waste.html" title="Organic waste">organic waste</a> and then be <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compost.html" title="Compost">composted</a>. Trays and containers for fruit, vegetables, eggs and meat, bottles for soft drinks and dairy products and blister foils for fruit and vegetables are also already widely manufactured from bioplastics.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioplastic.html" title="Edit section: Catering Products">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Catering Products</span></h3>
<p>Catering products belong to the group of perishable plastics. Disposable crockery and cutlery, as well as pots and bowls, pack foils for hamburgers and straws are being dumped after a single use, together with food-leftovers, forming huge amounts of waste, particularly at big events. The use of bioplastics offers significant advantages not only in an ecological sense but also in an economical sense.</p>

<p>Constituting about 50 per cent of the bioplastics market, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermoplastic.html" title="Thermoplastic">thermoplastic</a> starch currently represents the most important and widely used bioplastic. Pure starch possesses the characteristic of being able to absorb <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humidity.html" title="Humidity">humidity</a> and is thus being used for the production of drug capsules in the pharmaceutical sector. Flexibiliser and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasticiser.html" title="Plasticiser">plasticiser</a> such as <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorbitol.html" title="Sorbitol">sorbitol</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/y/Glycerine.html" title="Glycerine">glycerine</a> are added so that starch can also be processed thermo-plastically. By varying the amounts of these additives, the characteristic of the material can be tailored to specific needs (also called "thermo-plastical starch").</p>

Some estimate that this could result in a price reduction to fewer than 5 Euros per kilogram. However, that is still four times the market price of polyethylene at February 2007. The <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South American</a> <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar.html" title="Sugar">sugar</a> industry, for example, has decided to expand PHB production to an industrial scale.
