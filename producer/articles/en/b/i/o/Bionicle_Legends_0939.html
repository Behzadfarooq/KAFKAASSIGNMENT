<p>Over 100,000 years ago, two <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_and_groups_in_Bionicle_da35.html#Great_Beings" title="Characters and groups in Bionicle">Great Beings</a>, having traveled across the world, arrive in the area in the center of a continent, near an active volcano. Using their powers and tools, they construct a long underground staircase and a large chamber at the end, placing traps inside as they do so. Finally, they place the object of their journey on the chamber's pedestal: the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanohi.html#Ignika" title="Kanohi">Mask of Life</a>, with both fearful of its power and its curse.

<p>Six <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Hunters_8396.html" title="Dark Hunters">Dark Hunters</a>, sick of their servitude to the Shadowed One, abandon the Dark Hunters and take the name "Piraka". They go to <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mata_Nui_%28Island%29_22b7.html#Other_Locations" title="Mata Nui (Island)">Mangaia</a>, investigating rumors of <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makuta.html" title="Makuta">Makuta</a>'s death, where they find his empty armor. While trying to rob his pseudo-corpse of its armor, <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piraka.html" title="Piraka">Reidak</a> is attacked by Makuta's Mask of Shadows, which he throws into the Silver Sea surrounding Metru Nui. In raiding the lair, <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piraka.html" title="Piraka">Hakann</a> finds a Spear of Fusion and accidentally fires it at <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piraka.html" title="Piraka">Vezok</a>, who splits into two. The second being takes the name <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piraka.html#Vezon" title="Piraka">Vezon</a> and claims the spear before the entire group suddenly gets the same thought in their heads: a Mask of Life exists, on what is now the island of <a href="../../../v/o/y/Voya_Nui_0909.html" title="Voya Nui">Voya Nui</a>, and it has to be found. Unfortunately, the group gets attacked by <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Mana Ko</a> guardians; while Vezon slips away unnoticed, the rest escape to the island of <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mata_Nui_%28Island%29_22b7.html" title="Mata Nui (Island)">Mata Nui</a> and discover a set of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html#Toa_Canisters" title="List of objects in Bionicle">Toa canisters</a>. They decide not only to use the canisters to get to Voya Nui, but to pretend to be Toa once they get there.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, as the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matoran.html" title="Matoran">Matoran</a> of <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metru_Nui_f34e.html" title="Metru Nui">Metru Nui</a> were repairing their devastated city, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html#Dume" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga Dume</a> consulted with the <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Nuva_16d6.html" title="Toa Nuva">Toa Nuva</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takanuva.html" title="Takanuva">Toa Takanuva</a> that <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mata_Nui_%28Great_Spirit%29_858e.html" title="Mata Nui (Great Spirit)">Mata Nui</a> isn't just sleeping, he is dying; and the only way to save him is to use the Mask of Life. The Toa Nuva set out for Voya Nui, though Takanuva stays behind to guard Metru Nui.</p>
<p>The Piraka arrive on Voya Nui and things go according to plan, as the local Matoran accept their claims to be Toa - most of them, anyway. Six doubt their claims and begin to spy on the "Toa". The Piraka eventually begin collecting <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html#Antidermis" title="List of objects in Bionicle">antidermis</a> and using it in <a href="../../../z/a/m/Zamor.html" title="Zamor">Zamor</a> Sphere weapons, enslaving all the Matoran except for the six suspicious ones, who begin to openly rebel.</p>
<p>When the Toa Nuva arrive, they are surprised by the Piraka and quickly defeated, though they are able to escape before their execution. They meet and team up with the Matoran rebels; though it takes some work to convince them that, unlike the Piraka, they really <i>are</i> Toa.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two powerful titans enter the conflict. <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Mata_Nui_1478.html#Axonn" title="Order of Mata Nui">Axonn</a>, angered by the Piraka's presence, begins beating them up whenever he finds them. His former friend and partner <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Mata_Nui_1478.html#Brutaka" title="Order of Mata Nui">Brutaka</a>, however, strikes a deal with the Piraka's leader <a href="../../../p/i/r/Piraka.html" title="Piraka">Zaktan</a> to get their Zamor Spheres and intends to claim the Mask of Life for himself. At the same time, the Piraka begin looking for Vezon, who they suspect is also on the island.</p>
<p>Back on Metru Nui, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Matoran_e516.html#Jaller" title="List of Matoran">Jaller</a> realizes that the Toa Nuva have disappeared. Realizing this means trouble, he questions the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga</a> but becomes upset when they insist on keeping it a secret as they have kept so many other things secret in the past. <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html#Nokama" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga Nokama</a> privately agrees with him, and later goes to explain the situation. Jaller decides to assemble a small squad of Matoran to go and try to help the Toa Nuva in any way they can.</p>
<p>Jaller's team includes Toa Takanuva at first, though he is forced to turn back when they reach a gate that no light (or Toa of Light) is allowed to pass through. The group eventually finds itself in the realm of the dreaded ruler <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karzahni.html" title="Karzahni">Karzahni</a>, who has them change their masks and experience horrific futures in order to abandon their old identities and break their spirits. Before too long, however, they find a set of Toa canisters and are able to escape.</p>
<p>On Voya Nui, the Toa and rebel Matoran break into the Piraka's stronghold, only to be defeated in one strike by Brutaka. While Brutaka takes the Toa Nuva captive and the Matoran are interrogated by the Piraka, the canisters carrying Jaller's team wash up on the island's shore. Lightning from the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html#Red_Star" title="List of objects in Bionicle">Red Star</a> strikes the canisters, and the beings that emerge from them are not six Matoran, but six new <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Inika_188c.html" title="Toa Inika">Toa Inika</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matoran.html" title="Matoran">Matoran</a> escape from their interrogation, thanks in part to Brutaka, who transports a threatening <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Doom Viper</a> away out of force of habit. While Vezok tracks them down, the others worry about Zaktan's powerful new ally and decide to do something about it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Toa Inika start to figure out their next move; noting especially odd things about their transformation like glowing faces and living masks. They end up triggering their mask powers, causing chaos as <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Inika_188c.html" title="Toa Inika">Nuparu</a> flies uncontrollably, <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Inika_188c.html" title="Toa Inika">Kongu</a> can't keep from hearing others' thoughts, <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Inika_188c.html" title="Toa Inika">Matoro</a>'s spirit is separated from his body, and <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Inika_188c.html" title="Toa Inika">Hahli</a> seems to be talking to thin air. As they regain control, Matoro reports that he saw the Matoran, and the Toa agree that they need to meet them and figure out what's going on on this island.</p>
<p>After a scuffle with Vezok, the Toa meet the Matoran rebels and compare notes on what they know. Armed with Zamor Launchers built by <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matoran.html#Voya_Nui_Matoran" title="Matoran">Velika</a>, they split up into three groups: <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Inika_188c.html" title="Toa Inika">Jaller</a> and Hahli go to free enslaved Matoran, <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toa_Inika_188c.html" title="Toa Inika">Hewkii</a> and Matoro go visit Axonn, and Kongu and Nuparu sneak into the Piraka stronghold to search for the Toa Nuva. While Jaller and Hahli's mission has no problems; Hewkii and Matoro find Axonn badly injured by Brutaka, telling them to stop his former partner even if it means killing him. Worse, Kongu and Nuparu are discovered and faced with all six Piraka and Brutaka.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the other Toa arrive just as the battle starts and Hewkii is able to bury Brutaka under a pile of rock, taking him out of the fight temporarily. While the Matoran search the stronghold for the Toa Nuva, The Toa Inika begin taking the Piraka out one by one. But the tides turn when Brutaka begins to dig himself out: Hakann enacts the plan to steal Brutaka's power for himself, Avak, Reidak, and Thok - but he intended to take it all for himself, and only quick action by Thok allowed him to take a share of Brutaka's power as well. The two quickly use their new strength to turn on the others, with Hakann knocking them all out with one superpowered mental blast.</p>
<p>When everyone comes to, they realize that Hakann and Thok had forced the weakened Brutaka to reveal the location of the Mask of Life. Axonn arrives and begins to go after the two Piraka, but Jaller tells him to swallow his pride and let others help, to which Axonn agrees. Realizing that the best way to stop the two is to return Brutaka's power to him and that the Piraka are the only ones who know how to do that, the two groups form an uneasy alliance. While the Piraka work on the Zamor Sphere that will depower Hakann and Thok, Axonn warns Jaller of the mask's guardians (Vezon and Fenrakk) and hands him a glowing Zamor for "protection". At the same time, the Matoran are continuing their search, and they find records of Voya Nui's history - it was long thought that many were lost when some of the land sank underwater, but these records say that they may still be alive!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hakann and Thok have begun to turn on each other. The resulting destruction makes them easy to track, and the Toa Inika and other Piraka quickly arrive on the scene (Axonn chose to stay behind). Though most of the Piraka are taken out of the fight early, Hakann and Thok are soon put at a disadvantage by the Inika. The two call a truce and launch a combined attack, but at the same moment Hewkii hits them with the specially-prepared Zamor. As a result, both sides fall unconscious from their enemies' assault; leaving only Zaktan standing.</p>
<p>Back at the stronghold, Brutaka wakes up to find Axonn watching over him. While Axonn expresses hope that Brutaka will return to protecting the Mask of Life instead of trying to claim it, Brutaka scoffs him; and the former friends both prepare for deadly combat.</p>
<p>When the Toa Inika awaken, they find the Piraka gone, headed down a staircase that leads to the Mask of Life. Agreeing that they can't wait for reinforcements, they quickly follow. Zaktan briefly reminisces on the past, remembering all the events that led the Piraka to this point (see <i>Legacy of Evil</i> below). However, the Piraka's progress is impeded when Hakann is attacked and his armor begins to melt, and a large figure is heard coming up from below.</p>
<p><a name="Fight_for_Victory" id="Fight_for_Victory"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_Legends_0939.html" title="Edit section: Fight for Victory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fight for Victory</span></h2>
<p>The Piraka come to a fork in the tunnel, with the path to the left blocked to them. Upon descending, they come under attack from the legendary Irnakk, who subjects them to their fears through the power of his Zamor spheres. During the fight, Zaktan is drawn into Irnakk's mind, and realizes that Irnakk will disappear if he ceases to be afraid of him. Zaktan does so, declaring that he uses fear as a weapon just like Irnakk, and the giant vanishes.</p>
<p>Having witnessed through Matoro's mask power the battle between the Piraka and Irnakk, the Toa Inika come upon the same fork. Mysteriously, the left passage is unblocked instead of the right, and it appears to have been so for a long time. Elsewhere, Garan and the other members of the Matoran resistance search for the missing Toa Nuva, knowing that the Toa Inika may need their help. The Toa Inika, traveling down the left tunnel, encounter an illusion of Toa Lhikan, who warns them to turn back before it is too late, they refuse to turn down a vital quest. Before the Toa Inika can learn more, he disappears saying that he wouldn't either "But look what happened to me."</p>
<p>Back at the Piraka stronghold, Axonn and Brutaka continue their confrontation. The contest appears about even, since Brutaka has height and reach over Axonn but Axonn is stronger. Attempting to steal Brutaka's sword, Axonn is reminded that he gave it to Brutaka, and subjected to a painful electrical shock. Seeking victory, Brutaka uses his Kanohi Olmak to open a dimensional portal behind Axonn, which will not close until something passes through it, even if Brutaka is knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>Back at the volcano, the Toa Inika find themselves fighting illusions of Makuta, a Rahkshi Turahk, a Bohrok, a Bohrok-Kal, a Nui-Rama, and a Muaka. They triumph far too easily, and the seemingly dead beings turn into the Toa Nuva. The Toa Inika are disheartened, thinking the illusions to be real and wondering what they might do next with their awesome power. However, Jaller convinces the group that they have to press on despite their fears, and they agree. Moreover, the illusory Toa Nuva disappear, and Kongu realizes that they were illusions, having heard none of their thoughts with his Kanohi Suletu.</p>
<p>The Piraka continue their journey, contending with entrapping cylinders, a chamber filling with water, and jets of fire. They eventually escape, and set up an ambush for the Toa Inika, unaware that their bodies are beginning to show signs of change after being exposed to the water. Outside, the Matoran come upon the Toa Nuva, badly weakened by a device which drains their elemental powers and enslaved by Antidermis. Utilizing their own Zamor launchers, the Matoran free the Toa Nuva and help them get to the Piraka stronghold, informing them of the existence of the Toa Inika.</p>
<p>Coming into a large chamber, the Toa Inika are greeted by the recorded voice of one of the Great Beings from the prologue. Proclaiming that the room they are in is the Chamber of Death, he informs them that in order for them to pass, one of them must die. Matoro volunteers, claiming that he is of the least use to the team since he is merely an interpreter and not a warrior, athlete, Chronicler, or inventor like the others. Matoro is destroyed by a beam of energy, but then his body is reconstituted. Going onward, the group is attacked by Protodax, only for the Rahi to be driven off by Umbra. Engaging the Toa Inika in battle, Umbra proves too powerful for them to defeat directly. Relying on Matoro, the Toa Inika use ice mirrors to reflect Umbra in light form until he is finally subdued.</p>
<p>Going forward, the Toa Inika find themselves locked in battle with the Piraka atop a bridge. The elemental energies of the Inika cause the structure to collapse, and the Piraka finally proceed to the Chamber of Life. Once there, they encounter none other than their long lost member Vezon. They discover that he has the Mask of Life, and he offers to give it to them if they kill Vezok. Despite the willingness of the Piraka to do so, Zaktan discerns that Vezon couldn't give them the Ignika even if he wanted to. Vezon then deploys the Spear of Fusion to merge Vezok and Reidak, creating a monstrous giant who obeys his commands by attacking the other Piraka.</p>
<p>The Toa Inika, having survived their fall from the bridge, agree that their only hope of victory over the Piraka is to fight with everything they can unleash. Back in the Piraka stronghold, Axonn struggles to avoid both Brutaka's attacks and the ever-growing dimensional vortex. He warns Brutaka that his actions will bring Botar, whose name instills fear even in the sword-wielding giant. Driven to rage by his comrade's corruption, Axonn attacks with unbelievable force, shrugging off Brutaka's attacks as if they hadn't even hit him. In desperation, Brutaka looks to the vat of Antidermis, but Axonn destroys it before he can get to it. As it shatters, Axonn hears a voice besides Brutaka's crying out, deeper and more guttural. Bereft of his axe, Axonn manages to strike down Brutaka with a blast of power from his hands, and sanity returns to Brutaka's eyes just before he is knocked unconscious. Botar then appears and takes custody of Brutaka, and warns Axonn that any attempts to interfere with him will be met with Brutaka's punishment. Axonn vows to free his friend, and as all three Order of Mata Nui members leave, the vortex Brutaka opens is revealed to be a portal to the Zone of Shadow as Krahka and Tahtorak emerge from it.</p>
<p>Back inside the Chamber of Life, the Toa Inika arrive and confront Vezon. His powers, combined with those of Fenrakk, prove too much for them to contend with directly. The Inika then use their powers to force the two backwards into the lava, and Jaller prepares to go after them despite the knowledge that he will likely die. Before he gets the chance, Vezon emerges on the back of Fenrakk, now transformed into Kardas. As they struggle, Jaller realizes that the Ignika must be sentient, and has Kongu read its thoughts. Kongu discovers that the Mask of Life sensed their approach, and because of Matoro's attitude towards others selects him to be its new guardian. Beaming these thoughts into Vezon's mind, Kongu provokes the Piraka into a rage. Jaller then deploys Axonn's special Zamor sphere, freezing Vezon and Kardas in time and space and allowing Matoro to remove the Ignika.</p>
<p>At the Piraka stronghold, the Toa Nuva recover their masks and learn from the resistance just who the Toa Inika are, setting out to meet with their friends. On their feet again, the Piraka attack the Toa Inika, but the Mask of Life escapes them both, flying upwards through the catacombs. The Toa pursue, while the Piraka have a dispute involving the Spear of Fusion. Vezok wants Vezon to be fused with him once again, but the other Piraka destroy the spear, making it impossible. The pursuit of the Ignika continues, and it ends up traveling into the depths of Voya Nui bay. Attempting to retrieve it, Hahli is overwhelmed by immense pressure. Before the other Inika can do anything, a mysterious Matoran emerges from underwater and brings Hahli back to shore. After gasping out a cryptic plea for help and mentioning a city beneath the waters of the bay, the Matoran collapses in death.</p>
<p>The Toa Inika meet up with Axonn and the Toa Nuva, Botar having disappeared with Brutaka after talking with Tahu Nuva. Seeing that they have no chance against 12 Toa and Axonn, the Piraka decide to go into hiding, and plan to wait until the right moment to strike back. After a discussion, it is agreed that the Toa Inika will continue the quest for the Mask of Life while the Toa Nuva depart, as it would seem that the Toa Nuva are destined to awaken Mata Nui, but the Toa Inika must save his life first. Tahu Nuva promises that the Toa Nuva will be waiting for the Inika when they return, and once the Inika are out of hearing range, Axonn confronts him and Tahu admits to having lied. He mentions a cryptic mission that the Toa Nuva now have that the Inika cannot be a part of, and expresses his hopes that the new Toa will survive.</p>
<p>After a discussion as to the Voya Nui Matoran, Axonn volunteers to watch over them so that the Toa Nuva won't have to take them to Metru Nui and so the Toa Inika will be free to pursue the Ignika. Axonn then opens a tunnel in the Matoran village leading down to the undersea realm, and watches the Toa Inika depart after a warning about the dangers they may face.</p>

<p>When Reysa, an Onu-Matoran is mysteriously killed near <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahri_Nui_0019.html" title="Mahri Nui">Mahri Nui's</a> Fields of Air, Defilak, the Le-Matoran Mahri Nui Council Leader orders a search to the Black Water to find out what's there. Kyrehx, a Ga-Matoran sentry spots and finds a Kanohi mask, (unknowingly, the Kanohi Ignika, the Great Mask of Life). When she goes to show it to the council, she is attacked by animated air weeds by the Fields of Air near the Hydruka Pens; she is saved by Dekar, a Po-Matoran hunter. Kyrehx gives him the mask and both of them go their separate ways, not knowing that a squid of the Barraki Kalmah has spotted them with the mask.</p>
<p>Defilak, his friend Sarda, a Ta-Matoran, Gar, an Onu-Matoran, and Idris, a Ga-Matoran, travel in Defilak's submarine down to the Black Water. They are then attacked from all sides from an organized swarm of Takea Sharks, led by a being named Pridak. After the sub is destroyed, Pridak interogates them, then takes Defilak, his 'meal' to tell him a tale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kyrehx and most of the other Matoran of Mahri Nui spot thousands of Venom Eels heading towards the city and begin to attack. But before Kyrehx can launch the attack, she is taken by Carapar to Takadox. Takadox hypnotises the Ga-Matoran and forces her to tell him where the Ignika is. When Takadox hears that Kyrehx doesn't have the mask, he tells Carapar to go and tell Ehlek to stop commanding his Venom Eels to destroy the city, in case the mask is still inside the city. Dekar then finds out that the Kanohi mask he possesses is the Kanohi Ignika, Mask of Life, and realizes that it will keep healing any nearby attackers, he then decides he is going to destroy it.</p>
<p>Pridak tells Defilak about the League of Six Kingdoms, his and his fellow <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barraki.html" title="Barraki">Barraki's</a> once known armies. Kalmah and Mantax then find out that Dekar has the Ignika and begin to chase him whilst he attempts to destroy it in a nearby cave which causes the Ignika to create a guardian, a 300 foot-long Venom Eel. Carapar manages to force Ehlek to stop launching attacks on Mahri Nui in case the mask is still there. The two then meet <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Mata_Nui_1478.html#Brutaka" title="Order of Mata Nui">Brutaka</a>, a fallen <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Mata_Nui_1478.html" title="Order of Mata Nui">Order of Mata Nui</a> member who then commands that they take him to the Ignika or perish. Kalmah, Mantax and Pridak begin to fight the 300 foot-long Venom Eel which has destroyed part of Mahri Nui's upward pointing stone cord, and the Barraki are repeatedly being defeated but they are not going down.</p>
<p>Then, Brutaka, Ehlek and Carapar arrive. Ehlek and Carapar are hoping that Brutaka will rid them of their leader but Pridak suspects this and Brutaka does not. Brutaka then sees Dekar with the Mask of Life and goes over, claiming that he is an Order of Mata Nui member and Dekar needs to give the mask to him. Dekar refuses, saying 'If you were meant to have the mask, you would have found it first, wouldn't you?,' Pridak, finally annoyed, commands Kalmah's giant squid to drag Brutaka off to the Black Water. As Pridak corners Dekar and takes the Ignika, it sets off a bright light, which begins to envelop the whole ocean.</p>

<p><i>These events take place roughly 7,000 years before the events of Bionicle Legends.</i></p>
<p>Vezok and Hakann raid a Toa fortress for a treasure rumored to be inside (or, more accurately, Vezok raids it while Hakann is left to fight off the guards). Vezok finds that the treasure is a tablet called the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_objects_in_Bionicle_380b.html#Makoki_Stones" title="List of objects in Bionicle">Makoki stone</a>, and that the tablet is covered with hidden writing concerning the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brotherhood_of_Makuta_5c64.html" title="Brotherhood of Makuta">Brotherhood of Makuta</a>. Vezok takes the stone, but the two thieves are caught and forcibly recruited into the Dark Hunters (joining the other four future Piraka), who take the Makoki stone for themselves.</p>
<p><i>These events take place roughly 5,000 years before the events of Bionicle Legends.</i></p>
<p>Zaktan leads the others (minus Avak) in a plot to overthrow the Shadowed One, but they are caught. When the Shadowed One tries to execute Zaktan with his disintegration vision, Zaktan surprises everyone (including himself) by surviving as a mass of protodites.</p>
<p><i>These events take place roughly 4,000 years before the events of Bionicle Legends.</i></p>
<p>Reidak, Vezok, and Avak free the <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahi_%28Bionicle%29_a17f.html" title="Rahi (Bionicle)">Kanohi Dragon</a> from its icy prison, letting it loose on Metru Nui. They then go to <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turaga_%28Bionicle%29_83fd.html#Dume" title="Turaga (Bionicle)">Turaga Dume</a> offering the Hunter's "protection". Dume refuses, but just as Vezok tries to kill him; <a href="../../../l/h/i/Lhikan.html" title="Lhikan">Toa Lhikan</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/d/Nidhiki.html" title="Nidhiki">Toa Nidhiki</a>, and the rest of their team intervene. The Hunters leave to try again later, while the Toa fight off the Kanohi Dragon. The Toa finally defeat the dragon after a month, and have it deported to <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roodaka.html" title="Roodaka">Roodaka</a>'s homeland, Xia.</p>
<p><i>These events take place roughly 3,000 years before the events of Bionicle Legends; concurrent with <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle_Adventures_ccd6.html#Birth_of_a_Dark_Hunter" title="Bionicle Adventures">Birth of a Dark Hunter</a>.</i></p>
<p>In the war between the Toa and the Dark Hunters, Hakann watches Nidhiki betray the Toa and he catches Lhikan overhearing the betrayal. In an attempt to ensure his own freedom, Hakann offers a deal: Lhikan could have the Makoki stone back if he allows the defeated Hunters to go free. Knowing that his fellow Toa gave their lives to protect the stone, he agrees - with the condition that the Hunters take Nidhiki with them. Six months later, the Shadowed One has the stone stolen back, split into six, and auctioned off to the Brotherhood of Makuta; he also has Roodaka mutate Nidhiki into an insectoid being, dooming him to a lifetime with the Hunters.</p>
<p><i>These events take place roughly 250 years before the events of Bionicle Legends.</i></p>
<p>Zaktan, Thok, and Reidak are protecting a base in the war against the Brotherhood. After Roodaka tips them off that the base used to belong to the Brotherhood, Zaktan investigates and discovers an entire record of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Cataclysm_e857.html" title="Great Cataclysm">Great Cataclysm</a>. After getting over the shock of the depth and evil of the Brotherhood's plans, Zaktan vows to make himself become part of them.</p>
<p><i>These events take places roughly 1 month before the events of Bionicle Legends.</i></p>
<p>The Piraka had escaped the Dark Hunters and learning about the rumors about Takanuva, the Toa of Light defeating Makuta, they decide to raid his lair. Hakann found a wicked-looking spear and accidentally aimed it at Vezok. Suddenly, the spear fire an energy burst, splitting Vezok into himself and a mysterious being. When Thok saw the words "<i>Spear of Fusion</i>" grafted on the weapon, he called the being <b>Vezon</b>, the Matoran word for double, who took up that name. Vezok roared and fought Vezon for the spear. Zaktan came in between them when they suddenly learned about the Mask of Life. Then, a Mana Ko attacked the Piraka, forcing them to escape to the island above, Mata Nui. There, they found six Toa canisters on the mountainside. Strangely, Vezon was gone. Using the canisters, the Piraka made their journey to Voya Nui.</p>
