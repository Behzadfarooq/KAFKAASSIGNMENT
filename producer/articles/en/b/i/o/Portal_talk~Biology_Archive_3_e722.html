<h2><span class="mw-headline">WikiProject Arthropods?</span></h2>
<p>Hello all, I was a wondering why there wasn't a WikiProject about insects or even Arthopods, considering there is one for Gastropods and Cephalopods (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Gastropods_0d68.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gastropods">WikiProject Gastropods</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cephalopods_682d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cephalopods">WikiProject Cephalopods</a>). Is it just because no one has created it yet, or is it because there is no need for one? I would be willing to help someone start such a WikiProject, or do it myself if necessary. Just thought I'd ask around for a bit of info first. Thanks, --<a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronChris_8a98.html" title="User:IronChris">IronChris</a> 21:24, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../c/t/e/Ctenophore.html" title="Ctenophore">Ctenophore</a> is a featured article on <a href="../../../../de/r/i/p/Rippenquallen.html" class="extiw" title="de:Rippenquallen">deWiki</a> and I did a translation of it fairly recently. It needs some outside attention to check I haven't confused my cilia with my cnidaria, and maybe further down the line to convert the references to in-line form (which would of course require someone with access to the literature) and give my Germanic prose an overhaul. I put an {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpert_3e75.html" title="Template:Expert">expert</a>}} tag on it and posted it on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Marine_life_8b0f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Marine life">Wikipedia:WikiProject Marine life</a>, but as the <a href="../../../p/a/g/Category%7EPages_needing_expert_attention_d36f.html" title="Category:Pages needing expert attention">expert category</a> contains hundreds of pages and the Marine life Wikiproject doesn't seem exactly overpopulated (the 'collaboration of the week' has been there for a month), I'm bringing it here in case someone either feels like taking a look at it or knows where someone else will.</p>

<p>The featured articles haven't been updated for a while, and I doubt this is due to lack of suitable material in Wikipedia. I think it would be great to resume adding new articles to the list. A lot of (probably most) biology articles are too specialised or technical to ever reach Wikipedia FA status. This portal is a good place to display well written comprehensive articles on biology that don't fit the general FA criteria. I couldn't find how articles have nominated here in the past... I believe we need some sembalance of a formal nomination procedure as well. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Znamenskiy_94fc.html" title="User:Peter Znamenskiy">Peter Z.</a><sup><a href="../../../p/e/t/User_talk%7EPeter_Znamenskiy_a39f.html" title="User talk:Peter Znamenskiy">Talk</a></sup> 00:36, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If it's not even being updated regularly the solution certainly isn't more overbearing bureaucracy. If (hypothetically) this portal becomes so popular that there is lots of arguing over which article should be displayed, <i>then</i> we can try out a formal process. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><span style="color:#ff66ff;cursor:w-resize;"><b>Cyde↔Weys</b></span></a> 19:47, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>- How about something like this? <s>This version looks like crap</s>, (new version now) but you get the general idea. Its more of an icon than a picture, but I can't think of anything more generic. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 13:48, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree that the <i>related portals</i> section should be restricted to one column. Something as general as the portal links should be right at the bottom and be 100% of the width. My rationale is as follows. 1) The columns should be reserved for biology portal specific content. 2) linking to every biology related portal requires extra width to accomodate the number of links.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a>, i don't really understand your objections? Which pictures get messed up? What ugly white space? This could well be a browser specific issue since i did not see anything dramatically wrong. As the page is currently coded, the amount of white space will change depending on the content in each column. Consequently, at a later date, the white space problem will reappear regardless of whether the <i>related portals section</i> spans the entire width of the page or is restricted to a single column? Anyway, the white space issues can easily be solved by rearranging content in the column or recoding the page to be more robust to the variability of each sections size. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 04:13, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you look at this diff, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal:Biology/Related_portals&amp;oldid=64058144" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal:Biology/Related_portals&amp;oldid=64058144" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> you can see that changing the size made the pictures switch to be not above their labels and another user came along and had to fix them. For instance, the chemistry picture was above the Agropedia link. While whitespace will exist, there is no point having a large chunk of it between data. after data is fine. I know it will change, but there was nothing wrong with the original layout. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 04:20, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, so I pasted things in incorrectly, I should have checked that more thoroughly and I apologise for being sloppy. Nevertheless, that edit is not specific to the portal layout.

<dd>If you look at the edit summary i think it was pretty obvious i was not trying to ram something through. However, since there seems to be very little discussion here I thought such a change would at least lay something on the table. White space seemed to be an issue and that was 'one option' available to solve the problem. Fine you don't like it. What are the other options? By the way, if the changes to the portal are a work in progress you should have that mentioned somewhere. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_D._77aa.html" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_D._d1e6.html" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 21:22, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Much appreciated.

<dd>Is there a requirement for featured portals to change the content on a weekly basis? What is the norm? If that is true it might be a good idea to have future content lined up so that anyone can come in and update without having to search for suitable material. Ont he other hand i quite like the fact we can add information articles that may be relevant to on going events. I put the stem cell article up since there was a lot of debate on stem cells in the press leading up to Bush's decision of not allowing federal funding for stem cells.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Decision needed: stick with FA or cast net wider?</span></h2>
<p>We need to decide whether we're going to allow articles as selected articles that don't have FA status. I think this could make things more interesting and give some added value to the portal over the front page. In the past, we have stuck to this, but for images, we decided some time ago that we would use featured pictures, and we have also recently exclusively had FAs as selected articles.

<dd>I'd say go with the diversity angle. i don't know how nmany biologicaslly related FA there are but I don't see any sense in restricting it to FA articles. i have seen some pretty good article in wikipedia that are not FA or even good articles. I'm not sure we even need to restrict ourselves to featured pictures. I expect I am on the extreme end of the spectrum here.

<dd>I agree, on the article front putting up non-featured articles but good articles might also help them get more edits and improve them in the end. As for pictures there are still a lot of good pictures which aren't featured, so i think just choosing some of the better articles and pictures, ignoring featured status (to an extant), would be best<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_huh_ba50.html" title="User:Chris huh">Chris huh</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_huh_1477.html" title="User talk:Chris huh">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chris_huh_91e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chris huh">contribs</a>) 23:24, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</small>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Simple Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Some science articles are starting to produce introductory versions of themselves to make them more accessible to the average encyclopedia reader. You can see what has been done so far at <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_relativity.html" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> and <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, all of which now have special introduction articles. These are intermediate between the very simple articles on <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_Wikipedia_2fc2.html" title="Simple Wikipedia">Simple Wikipedia</a> and the regular encyclopedia articles. They serve a valuable function in producing something that is useful for getting someone up to speed so that they can then tackle the real article. Those who want even simpler explanations can drop down to Simple Wikipedia. What do you think?--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 23:00, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Simple Wikipedia is about using simple English, rather than explicitly making things more understandable, although usually, this arises as a by-product. I'd personally like to see that articles on the simple Wikipedia improved to a higher level. It would be a great exercise in writing and understanding.&#160;:) <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a>&#160;<small>•</small>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 23:21, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also work in <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_Wikipedia_2fc2.html" title="Simple Wikipedia">Simple Wikipedia</a> as well and would like to see them vastly improved. I have worked on 100-200 articles on Simple Wikipedia as well as regular and introductory articles here. I think that the introductory articles can be intermediate between the Simple articles and the full articles. So that we address all levels: roughly at the level of elementary school students (Simple articles), the general public (introductory articles) and advanced articles (regular articles). This of course is only reasonable for very technical subjects, like <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity.html" title="General relativity">general relativity</a> or <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 23:26, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you did a good job in the introductory evolution article. <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> is a bit of an unmanageable monster without real focus. I wonder how the introductory articles will fare in the long term. Some people will feel that they are forks of a sort and should not exist. I think they have a place, as long as we can make sure that the logic is fully explained, i.e. no loopholes left for creationists et al. Evolution is a tough topic to write about, not least because so many people are watching that article, and expect various different things from it! <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a>&#160;<small>•</small>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 23:30, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure what will happen eventually. However this has been addressed repeatedly over the last few years. There are now 7 articles that use the seeintro tag and you can see the list at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Category%7EArticles_with_separate_introductions_088c.html" title="Category:Articles with separate introductions">this page</a>. The decision has always been made to keep the introductory articles. If you look around you can see many of the discussions that are archived (I can point you to some if you are interested) I do not think all articles should have them. But speaking as someone who has put huge effort into the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_Wikipedia_2fc2.html" title="Simple Wikipedia">Simple Wikipedia</a> articles, to write something using only 850 words in English and make it reasonably accurate is very challenging. I think it is very worthwhile, but one definitely needs something between Simple Wikipedia and regular Wikipedia articles for very technical subjects. I want someone who has minimal background and might not have much competence in English to be able to read an article on Simple Wikipedia, then be able to read an introductory article and then a regular article, and climb all the way from a grade 3 level of understanding to a postdoctoral level. All of these need good introductions and good references and clear writing.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 23:40, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately, I don't this that kind of ascent really works. In order to fully understand <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>, you have to have read not the simple version, but rather, some basic background in population genetics - hence the recent discussion about the term, "allele frequencies". <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a>&#160;(<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a>&#160;<small>•</small>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 23:57, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. As it now stands, the Simple version of most articles is very sad. In desperate need of improvement. However, I believe if one has a good solid Simple article with good references, this could help the reader be able to read an Introductory article, especially if the person read and digested the references. If the person in turn was able to absorb the introductory article and its references, I would hope that they would have a much better chance to understand the regular article, at least if the links and references are used. This of course would not be trivial. And probably no one would ever do it. However, its value is that a reader who heard something on the radio, or a parent who has to answer a question from their child, or someone who wants more than a dictionary definition, can get a bit more content, at the right level, to help them. And the regular <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> article alone is written for someone with at least a bachelor's degree already in biology, or at least college-level training. But almost none of the intended readers of Wikipedia will have that. And so...--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 00:30, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
