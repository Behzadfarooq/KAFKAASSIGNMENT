<p>I applaud the work and insight that went into this section. However, mention must be made of the basis for genetic factors being considered as plausible. You allude to, but do not make explicit, the notion that environmental factors act as triggers for the genetic factors. There are existing diseases outside of Psychiatry that can be used as examples. That is while you and I might agree that psychiatry is copping out, balance must be brought to bear to show that this idea is not terribly far-fetched. Diseases ranging from asthma to multiple sclerosis can be used.</p>
<p>There is another genetic concept that is more obfuscatory still: the idea that a disease can be "multifactorially genetic". That is, several genetic factors can contribute in some combination, with or without an environmental trigger. --<a href="../../../p/k/i/User%7EPking123_75ed.html" title="User:Pking123">Paul King</a> 00:56 EDT, 06 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. I was the person that contributed most of this section. At the time there quite a lot of opposition to further "justification" of the genetic theories.

<p>I'm not seeing the genesis of this controversy (the basic background demonstrating that there is an actual noteworthy controversy -- or even, indeed, what "biopsychiatry" <b>actually is</b>). A quick skim reveals LOTS of "Critics say" weasel-wording, a definite red flag in my book. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:45, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don’t understand. Only in the “General criticisms” section do the words “critics say” appear, i.e., only once in the whole article. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 00:52, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes. I object.</dd>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">WP:MoS</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a> explain how articles should be arranged to provide context, this article does not follow these style guides and completely lacks an appropriate lead paragraph summarising the article.</li>
<li>The citation request for "<i>In the psychiatric profession, people labeled with a DSM disorder are usually treated with psychiatric drugs (and sometimes, electroshock)."</i> was deleted without one being provided. I would have thought there was evidence for a integrated approach to treatment, so one would expect the sentense to read "drugs along with x, y and z". Otherwise we risk misleading by omission. I would be interested to see the justification for a claim that people are "usually" treated with drugs alone.</li>
<li>I do not see how this citation <a href="http://www.jsmf.org/badneuro/archive.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jsmf.org/badneuro/archive.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is proof that "<i>graphical studies are [widely] shown in magazine articles as proof of a <a href="../../../e/t/i/Etiology.html" title="Etiology">biological cause</a> of mental disorders</i>". It instead appears to be a link to an arbitrary list of articles someone at James S. McDonnell Foundation considers to be "bad journalism" (actually reading some of these seems to suggest to me that their justification for inclusion is biased by simply not understanding some of the science. Their criticism of this one in particular <a href="http://www.jsmf.org/badneuro/archive.htm#bn30" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jsmf.org/badneuro/archive.htm#bn30" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> is unfounded to anyone that understands how neurons are wired from the sensory organs to the <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amygdala.html" title="Amygdala">amygdala</a>). I would like to see at least one article, and preferably more, that specifically claims an MRI or PET proves a mental disorder has a biological cause. Some grant administrator's ignorance does not cut it as a verifiable source.</li>
<li>The citation for the very wideranging statement: "<i>Medical students are taught that biological psychiatry has become more scientific recently; has many effective drugs, has demonstrated the genetic foundation of schizophrenia and is moving ever forward into more specific psychopharmacology</i>" is a book by a notable critic. He doesn't appear to be an expert on current medical teaching and thus it doesn't seem like a verifiable source for such statements. I would argue that this statement be preceded by "Breggin claims..." or else some independent expert source should be provided that backs up those claims. A brief survey of the medical students i interact with disgreed with the first and third of those assertions about their education (the first being essentially meaningless, the third being clearly untrue, in their opinion).</li>
<li>I also have concerns that this article strays into promoting the controversy rather than describing it. But that is a common concern i have with such articles.</li>
</ul>

<dd>This sentence should be changed, deleted, or a reference provided: <i>"Most biopsychiatrists believe that the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain is the major biological regulator of mental health."</i> Actually I think most researchers understand the primary neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine), are only indirectly related to mood and emotion. E.g, neurotransmitter changes happen within minutes after taking an antidepressant, yet the therapeutic effect doesn't happen for weeks. Obviously a lot more is involved than a "balance" of neurotransmitters. This is widely known. You may be confusing pharmaceutical "cartoon" TV ads with what professionals actually believe. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoema_807b.html" title="User:Joema">Joema</a> 00:42, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, there is still no summary introduction per style guidlines. We need one or two introductory paragraphs summarising what the entire article is about.

<dd>"The <b>biopsychiatry controversy</b> is an ongoing dispute over the scientific basis of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_psychiatry.html" title="Biological psychiatry">biological psychiatry</a> theory and practice. The debate is focused on criticism of mainstream psychiatric thinking, proposed by a vocal minority of scientists, activists and psychiatrists. Critics contend the field is flawed in a number of ways. They argue the lack of biomarkers is evidence for a somatic, biological cause for mental illness. Instead a trauma model of metal disease is proposed. Critics also suggest biological psychiatry qualifies as a psuedo-science etc"</dd>

<dd>Secondly, changing "<i>Medical students are taught</i>" to "<i>For popular imagination molded by the media</i>" doesnt get around the fact this is unsubstatiated, speculative stuff put forward by critics. Where is the evidence that, in the "popular imagination" biopsych "has demonstrated the genetic foundation of schizophrenia"? Exactly which "media" has molded thought to believe "psychiatry has become more scientific recently"? This must be attributed ("Critics such as Ross have suggested...") or else specific sources be provided. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 07:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. I made two further minor changes. With that my concerns have been addressed, so i removed the context tag. It seems the OR has been dealt with two. Perhaps you could give notice to the person who added it that you tend to remove it.

<p>I have no obvious objections, though it bothers me that the first sentence of the "History" section treats what Michel Foucault says as if it were incontrovertible fact. Other than that, let others hash out the POV and "undue weight" questions. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:32, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your comments, Calton. I changed the phrasing of that sentence. Actually I don’t like Foucault: I abhor obscure prose with all my heart and most philosophers as well. The undue weight and pov forking was discussed at length in the lengthy RFAR process (see e.g. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Cesar_Tort_and_Ombudsman_vs_others_Proposed_decision_bf5b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Cesar Tort and Ombudsman vs others/Proposed decision">Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Cesar Tort and Ombudsman vs others/Proposed decision</a>) and an agreement was reached.</dd>

<p>I haven't been following the development of this article. I just thought I'd throw an idea out there. There are those who are quite anti-psychiatry and yet do not dispute that there's a rough biological basis for phenotypes classified as psychiatric disorders. They may see psychiatric disorders as disabilities or neurodiversity that should not be medicalized. They see the immaturity of children, for example, as being a fact of biology, but the meaning given to said immaturity a fact of culture - i.e. disorder as a cultural construct.

<p>Re Anarchist's comment in Edit summary: <i>“avoid equating autism with bad parenting”</i>. Presently autism, as a subject, is a total mess. But I’d be very happy to hear your comments.</p>

<dd>Sorry, I haven't yet. I'm always suspicious of claims that any disorder is caused by "bad parenting"; after all there are a lot more "bad parents" than mentally children. A friend of mine has twins, only one of which is autistic, which makes me doubt the "bad parenting" theory. I suspect that most "mental illneses" result from a combination of numerous factors, and that any simplistic explanation or theory just leads to simplistic treatment. - <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnarchist42_03d4.html" title="User:Anarchist42">Anarchist42</a> 22:01, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know about schizophrenia, but discordance of autism in monozygotic twins seems to be about 8%. It can be up to 40% if you narrow the criteria. There is no evidence of psychogenic factors playing a role - none - even though stress has been proposed. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 16:20, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Breggin_fcfa.html" title="Peter Breggin">Peter Breggin</a>’s <i>Toxic Psychiatry</i>, the psychogenic theory of autism was abandoned for political pressure from parents organizations; not for scientific reasons. Clinician Frances Tustin has devoted her life to the theory. She wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“One must note that autism is one of a number of children’s neurological disorders of psychogenic nature, i.e., caused by abusive and traumatic treatment of infants [...]. There is persistent denial by American society of the causes of damage to millions of children who are thus traumatized and brain damaged as a consequence of cruel treatment by parents who are otherwise too busy to love and care for their babies”</i> (International Journal of Psycho-Analysis, Vol 72 (4), 1991, pp. 585-91).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I can understand why parents see this theory as offensive and it’s not my intention to offend anyone. However, for my own experience I know that my mother committed heinous psychological crimes with my sisters; but she has zero insight about her childrearing methods. I’m pretty sure something similar happens in the mind of many other dissociative parents: no insight at all...</p>
<p>By the way, Tustin has written books, and there is a book about her work <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415092639/ref=sr_11" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415092639/ref=sr_11" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 17:54, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is offensive, but scientifically that's irrelevant. The fact is that no study has attempted to determine if there's any merit to any psychogenic theory of autism. Peter Breggin is not an authority on autism by any means, and I would suggest his knowledge of autism approaches a negligible amount. Brain damage, such as that resulting from abuse, is not known to result in autism. That type of brain damage would be very unlikely to explain some of the cognitive features of autism (which we're starting to learn of recently), neuroanatomical features found, such as neuron density differences and grey and white matter volume differences; head circumference, and so on. Therefore, I'd discount any psychogenic or abuse-related theory without any autism-specific evidence to the contrary. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 20:04, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is some evidence. Do you know Daniel Goleman’s <i>Vital Lies, Simple Truths</i>? Goleman is the author of the bestseller about emotional intelligence. I don’t have a copy in English but since Spanish is our native language I can quote from the translation, <i>La Psicología del Autoengaño</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>“El nombre de la beba era Jenny [...]. La madre de Jenny era una mujer muy animada y extravertida que, en el primer encuentro, impresionó a Stern como una persona ‘invasiva, controladora y sobreestimuladora’. Cuando Stern inició la observación de Jenny y su madre, ambas habían desarrollado la siguiente rutina: cada vez que las miradas se encontraban, la madre, con excesiva vehemencia, comenzaba a hacerle muecas divertidas a su beba y a hablarle de una manera atropellada. Todo eso era demasiado para Jenny, que optaba por apartar la vista [...]. Stern dice que observar esa invasión pasivamente y sabiendo que no debiera intervenir era ‘casi físicamente doloroso; me generaba sentimientos de impotente indignación; se me cerraba el estómago o me empezaba a doler la cabeza’ [...]. A Stern le resultaba inconcebible que la madre de Jenny no se diera cuenta de lo agresiva que era su actitud [...]. Fue entonces cuando Stern comenzó a alarmarse. Su alarma se debía a que sabía que la evitación del contacto visual y de cualquier tipo de interacción cara a cara, durante la primera infancia, suele ser uno de los síntomas precoces de autismo infantil”</i> (pages 173ff).</dd>

<dd>Where to start? First of all, one case report is not "evidence" in the sense I'm coveying, any more than a parent reporting that a child has "regressed" after vaccination is evidence that <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thimerosal.html" title="Thimerosal">thimerosal</a> causes autism. Second, all this report suggests is that the mother conditioned the daughter to have an aversion to eye contact, which happens to be a symptom of autism.

<p>This is a good question but to answer it properly is extremely complex. All has to do with the development of empathy from our simian ancestors throughout prehistory and history. According to some <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychohistory.html" title="Psychohistory">psychohistorians</a>, the Nordic European countries are in a more advanced level of childrearing than Americans. This means that, generally speaking, many Americans are emotionally blinder about the psychological perils in socializing their children than Swedish parents. However, this does not mean that Nordic people are fully empathetic toward their children; only that, for example, they give much less Ritalin to them than Americans do. A truly empathetic person, e.g., Stern in Goleman’s case, can see the colors of emotions that some abusive mothers simply can’t because the way they themselves were treated and emotionally handicapped during their own childhood. Though tentative, Goleman’s case gives the picture of what <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychohistory.html" title="Psychohistory">psychohistorians</a> call different psychoclasses. In a nutshell: to understand autism one must understand psychoclasses first. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 22:49, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In a number of Wikipedia articles on controversial topics (not just psych topics) it appeared to me that saboteurs used the tactic of introducing subtle digressions to disrupt the coherence of the text. It is also possible for advocates to do the same, inadvertently, by flooding the text with too much supporting material and a deluge of embedded links. I doubt that a typical reader follows more than a handful of links, internal or external.</p>
<p>Secondly, Michel Foucault is a philosopher. His book <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madness_and_Civilization_c9a4.html" title="Madness and Civilization">Madness and Civilization</a> is listed in <a href="../../../s/o/c/Category%7ESociology_books_42b6.html" title="Category:Sociology books">Category:Sociology books</a>. Not many biopsych supporters would be impressed. If it was my article I would only mention him, and his book, on <i>one</i> line in the <i>See also</i> section. It might be better to find another source, e.g. <a href="http://www.madinamerica.com/SOURCES.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.madinamerica.com/SOURCES.HTM" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes: I’m perfectly aware that Foucault is better for the Antipsych article. However, since sources are so demanding here, the brief historical paragraph needed a reliable source. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 18:00, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thirdly, I would remove the whole <i>Biopsychiatry as a pseudo-science</i> section. All of those criticisms could equally be applied to trauma theories, rightly or wrongly. As far as I can tell, no part of psychiatry is based on falsifiable predictions that have been demonstrated to be true in all replication studies. There would be no controversy otherwise. Of course, that's particularly true for hypothetical Schizophrenia genes (see <a href="http://www.psychminded.co.uk/news/news2002/0402/Another%20blank%20.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.psychminded.co.uk/news/news2002/0402/Another%20blank%20.htm" rel="nofollow">Another blank on schizophrenia gene</a>). Only one such study has been successfully replicated (see <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decode_Genetics_07b9.html" title="Decode Genetics">Decode Genetics</a>), and then only once.</p>
<ul>
<li>Falsifiability criticism can <b>not</b> be applied to trauma theories for the reasons Colin Ross explains in his book <i>The Trauma Model</i>. In a nutshell, people on trauma therapy, e.g. in the European <a href="../../../s/o/t/Soteria.html" title="Soteria">Soteria</a> houses, fare much better than patients on neuroleptics. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 18:00, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Szasz is already mentioned twice in References. I’ve read about ten of his books. Only one in all of Szasz’s books deals specifically with biopsych: <i>Pharmacracy</i>. The other books (critique of mental illness as a concept; laws and human rights; psychiatric newspeak, etc) are more suitable for the Antipsychiatry article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Curiously, <i>The Myth of Mental Illness</i>, considered by many his most important book, is IMHO a pretty bad book. Just as Foucault’s <i>Madness and Civilization</i> Szasz’s prose is opaque. Fortunately people like Breggin and Whitaker have written clearer, less pedantic and much more didactic books. Of course, after <i>The Myth of Mental Illness</i> Szasz changed his style and wrote little gems such as <i>Anti-Freud</i> and others. —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 21:37, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because of the ArbCom case the biopsych article is under close scrutiny from admins. It will have to meet a higher standard than would have been the case otherwise. To write criticisms first and leave supporting citations for later is asking for trouble. A <i>who-said-what-and-where</i> approach, with every statement derived from a reliable source, may be the only way forward under the circumstances. I have no wish to become involved in editing the text directly because the bar has been raised too high. My own feeling is that it might actually be more effective to keep the narrative text to a minimum and let the <i>References - See also - External links</i> sections speak for themselves. Nevertheless, I would be pleased to see the article develop into one of Wikipedia's better examples of how to handle a thorny subject.</p>
<p>I just read Rockpocket's suggestion for a brief summary. Basically, it's good, but there are a few points that would be better phrased another way.</p>
<ol>
<li>The phrase "vocal minority" has pejorative connotations. I think it would be better to rephrase it as "who are at present in the minority".</li>
<li>"Instead a trauma model of me(n)tal disease is proposed." This is misleading. There have been a trauma models of mental illness within mainstream psychiatry for more than 100 years. It is only in past few decades that these have been brushed aside by mainstream orthodoxy.</li>
<li>"They argue the lack of biomarkers is evidence for..." Actually, the lack of biomarkers is a <i>flaw</i> in the evidence.</li>
</ol>
<p>My suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The biopsychiatry controversy is an ongoing dispute over the scientific basis of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological_psychiatry.html" title="Biological psychiatry">biological psychiatry</a> theory and practice. The debate is focused on criticism of mainstream psychiatric thinking, proposed by a vocal lobby of psychiatrists and scientists who are at present in the minority. Activist organizations support their views. Critics contend the field is flawed in a number of ways. They argue that the lack of biomarkers is a flaw in the evidence for a somatic, biological cause for mental illness. Instead they draw attention to trauma models of mental illness within the psychiatric literature which have been brushed aside as research efforts switched to the biological model."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I would be careful not to use the word "pseudoscience" too often. When I was at university I shared a student house with medical students. I'm familiar with the outlook most of them hold. Medicine is one of the most long-drawn-out and gruelling courses of study at university level. They tend to resent the implication that any part of what they were taught was misguided. -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookish_a5ec.html" title="User:Bookish">Bookish</a> 14:59, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I firmly believe the quality of links matters more than the quantity, but I'm one the people Jakob Nielsen is talking about when he says "Users Hate PDF". I didn't click on any of the PDF links, so I haven't read them.

The following paragraph doesn't read smoothly. For instance, one phrase duplicates dominant/dominated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>According to institutes devoted to criticize biopsychiatry such as the International Center for the Study of Psychiatry and Psychology, presently the dominant force in the field is dominated by reductionist ideology that defines somatic variables as factors in the causes of mental disorders. Research in biopsychiatry is therefore confined within the same lines of medical illnesses. In (the) words of another critic, Alvin Pam (1995), “Given this stilted, unidimensional, and mechanistic world-view, research in psychiatry has been geared toward discovering which aberrant genetic or neurophysiological factors underlie and cause social deviance”. According to Pam, the “blame the body” dynamics in the field, that typically offers medication for mental distress and disorders, shifts the focus from disturbed behavior in the family to putative biochemical imbalances.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suggested alternative:</p>
<blockquote>

From <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookish_a5ec.html" title="User:Bookish">Bookish</a> 23:21, 19 June 2006 (UTC). More touchups:</p>
<p><b>(1)</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In words of who is probably the foremost critic of his own profession, psychiatrist Thomas Szasz:</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A missing word, but better to make it shorter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In the words of psychiatrist and veteran critic of his own profession, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Szasz_eb3d.html" title="Thomas Szasz">Thomas Szasz</a>:</i></p>

<p>All psychiatrists know about Szasz and his opinions.</p>
<p><b>(2)</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>On the other hand, neurology scientists such as Elliot Valenstein claim...</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name for "neurology scientists" is "neuroscientists". Neurology is a medical specialty (non-psychiatric). It is safer to write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>On the other hand, Elliot Valenstein, a psychologist and neuroscientist, claims...</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't use the phrase "<b>such as</b>" ( 9 times in the text). Skeptics will say "And who are the others?"</p>
<p><b>(3)</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Theodore Lidz, Jay Joseph (2006)</i></p>

<p>That's the date for his second book. The date for <i>The Gene Illusion</i> should be:</p>

<p>The whole paragraph seems confusing and contradictory to me. The entire paragraph needs to be worded very carefully. A few small changes won't be enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Therefore while twin studies and other research suggests that personality is heritable to some extent,...</i></p>

<p>Hello Cesar. I really don't wish to get involved in this effort you are initiating here on your subpages. But could i ask that, when you are finishing moving the sections of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-psychiatry.html" title="Anti-psychiatry">anti-psychiatry</a> to your new article and are happy with the results, you consider reworking the anti-psychiatry article so that it is more cohesive in describing the development of the activist movement (with the scholarly criticisms themselves now in the the new article). If you don't wish to do this, could you let me know when you are happy with the content and i can make sure the two articles are suitably different in content? This, i think, is the best way to avoid a future merge. Thanks. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 22:50, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Cesar. I just wanted to congratulate you on your work in the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biopsychiatry_controversy.html" title="Biopsychiatry controversy">biopsychiatry controversy</a> article. It is fairly obvious that i was against splitting the two, but my argument was based on content, not principle. However, i'm happy to note that i do think you have managed to make it sufficiently different from anti-psychiatry to warrant its own existance and i think is - as much as these POV-forkish type articles can be - a good encyclopedia article. Thank you, also, for addressing my concerns so promptly and graciously. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 01:49, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wonder why Rockpocket restored "twin studies <i>and other</i> research"? The whole point of recent touchups was to improve the quality of the article. And that includes removing allusions to unspecified research (Rockpocket didn't provide any references). It reminded me of an article at ScienceNews.org: <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20050709/fob1.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20050709/fob1.asp" rel="nofollow">Same Difference</a>. Which also reminded me of a paper in <i>Cognitive Therapy and Research</i> (Vol.1:2, 1977): <a href="http://confirmatory-bias.behaviouralfinance.net/Publication%20Prejudices%20An%20Experimental%20Study%20of%20Confirmatory%20Bias%20in%20the%20Peer%20Review%20System.htm" class="external text" title="http://confirmatory-bias.behaviouralfinance.net/Publication%20Prejudices%20An%20Experimental%20Study%20of%20Confirmatory%20Bias%20in%20the%20Peer%20Review%20System.htm" rel="nofollow">An Experimental Study of Confirmatory Bias in the Peer Review System</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookish_a5ec.html" title="User:Bookish">Bookish</a> 21:17, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I put it back because it is misleading to imply that twin studies is the only such evidence for genetic associations with mental disorders, especially as their credibility is disputed in the next sentence. If you or CT would like citations, then by all means use the {{fact}} template and i can provide them. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 05:21, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What you say about disputed "credibility" is not true. That's an error of scientific logic on your part. It is an axiom of Popper's principle of "falsifiability" that any hypothesis could be disproved. It remains true that twin studies are the staple of this kind of research, as they have been for more than a century. Still, by quibbling over it you've revealed your POV. Much needed work on improving the quality of the article could be stalled by this kind of interference. -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookish_a5ec.html" title="User:Bookish">Bookish</a> 16:40, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My POV in this is faily obvious. However, it doesn't matter what my POV is when i have provided verifibale sources for the content i replaced. I don't disagree that twin studies is the staple of this kind of research, especially historically. However, as genomic technology gets cheaper, genome scanning becomes more and more viable. Which is why association studies are beginning to be replicated and progress is being made. Therefore it is misleading to give the impression that these suggestive studies rely on evidence from twin studies exclusively. It simply is not true (as those sources demonstrate).</dd>
<dd>Quite how the quality of the article can be stalled "by this kind of interference" is unclear to me, perhaps you can elaborate? Cesar simply deleting something, without justification, to give an misleading simplified impression of a complex field is hardly an improvement, and replacing the content and providing verifiable sources is hardly "interference". Moreover, it appears to me that you have yet to actually contribute content to the article directly. Criticism of other's attempts to improve is easy but ultimately unconstructive, contributing an alternative yourself is much more helpful. As i said before, if you can make that section better, by all means lets see what you have. <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a></b> 17:50, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's obvious from the content of this page that I have contributed a large amount of constructive material for Cesar to make use of in an article that is essentially his creation. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! Without an explanation, your three PubMed abstracts are not really adequate to demonstrate that other approaches have an equivalent scientific pedigree to twin studies. I assume that was what your were trying to imply. Would you like to spell out exactly what systematic methodolical approach the three studies are recent examples of? It's up to you to spell out the alternatives, if they are clear to you. -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookish_a5ec.html" title="User:Bookish">Bookish</a> 18:16, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who is saying "other approaches have an equivalent scientific pedigree to twin studies"? You said that, not I, and neither does the article. Therefore i am not obliged to justify their merits, nor am interested in spelling out the alternatives, as i (personally) do not think the section reqires such detail. Its simply important (in my opinion) to illustrate that twin studies are not the exclusive tool which scientists have used to find these suggestive associations. They may be the best, they may be the most common, but they are not exclusive. That is clear from the sources i provided.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let me explain to you what happened. Without justification, Cesar deleted the bold text from this section:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The reasons offered for the relative lack of genetic understanding is because the links between genes and mental states defined as abnormal appear highly complex, involve extensive environmental influences and can be mediated in numerous different ways, for example by personality, temperament or life events. Therefore while <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twin_studies.html" title="Twin studies">twin studies</a> <b>and other research</b> suggests that personality is heritable to some extent, the genetic basis for particular personality or temperament traits, and their links to mental health problems, is currently unclear</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I replaced it because it is a more accurate, and informative, reflection of reality with it in. You questioned why. So I provided references. One of these references <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15918338&amp;query_hl=6&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15918338&amp;query_hl=6&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> says the following (my bold):</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Twin studies show that co-morbidity within anxiety disorders and between anxiety disorders and depression is explained by a shared genetic vulnerability for both disorders. <b>Some family studies support this conclusion</b>, but others suggest that co-morbidity is due to one disorder being an epiphenomenon of the other.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, please tell me why the above reference, specifically the words in bold, is not an appropriate source for the assertion that i reverted? That is all i did and that is all i am interested in discussing. Should you feel you can further improve this section by rewording, then please do so. But please do not continue to infer greater meaning behind this very simple and justifiable edit. A little good faith would not go amiss.

<p>With all due respect, rockpocket, and pace Godwin’s law, trying to understand schizophrenia and its causes from a strictly genetic perspective is something morally aberrant and an unimaginable idiotic enterprise that will always fail: it’s like trying to understand Judaism by analyzing the genes from Jews! —<a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesar_Tort_7f2d.html" title="User:Cesar Tort">Cesar Tort</a> 15:16, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Um, about the point of the article. The paragraph that reads:</p>
<p>"Modern biopsychiatric practice strives to create and use explicit <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diagnosis.html" title="Diagnosis">diagnostic criteria</a> for mental illness, the <i><a href="../../../d/i/a/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders_5c59.html" title="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders">DSM</a></i>. This method of practice is often called neo-Kraepelinian after Emil Kraepelin, and later Eugene Bleuler, who advocated such an approach"</p>
<p>is lovely in its own way... but biopsychiatric researchers (in my experience) seem to think that the DSM is almost completely useless, on the fundamental grounds that <b>the DSM is not biological. The DSM is a behavioral book.</b> The DSM is what you give to clinicians, not researchers, and it's therefore filled with things that amount to "seems sad all the time" instead of "lower than average concentration of dopamine in the intraneural conjunctions of the upper cerebellum under live sedated dissection of mouse model." "Seems sad all the time" is not a biological statement. "Lower than average concentration of dopamine" <i>is</i> a biological statement.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, I don't think we can accurately -- or simultaneously -- say that (a) biopsychiatry is all about neurochemistry and (b) the DSM, which contains almost nothing about anything even remotely physical, is a biopsychiatric book. A plain old <i>psychiatric</i> book, I freely grant you; and it is certainly used by people with biopsychiatric beliefs -- but the DSM, itself, is a behavioral book, not a biological one.</p>
<p>Is someone else willing to clean this up? I haven't got the time.66.124.70.108 00:18, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
