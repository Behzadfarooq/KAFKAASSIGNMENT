<p>I wore my scarf down to my nose as mum had told me to and still I had this hint that showed my real identity so I added more powder making me look like a monster just as ugly as I wanted to be. Next I added spots onto my face and made it look like I was the ugliest person on the planet. This was exactly what I wanted. To find out who could be a real friend and not just like me for the way I looked needed big covering and a great disguise and that was exactly what the point was.</p>
<p>At my old school, I had loads of friends but most of them liked me for what I looked not who I really was. I had been really famous no</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>matter where I went and that was mainly because I was a super model known around</p>
<pre>
the world. Everywhere I went I had to sign autographs and this was definitely great but it was a different issue that during lessons no one concentrated and all just looked at me. One day at school the teacher asked if I would like to teach the class “they might probably listen then” she had said looking grim and so I came up with the idea of going to school In disguise but that also meant changing school an that is exactly what I did.
</pre>
<p>I looked at the time. It was time to leave and see what shall happen. Who is a real friend and who is not I shall soon discover. No autographs for me today. I am still young as a super mode. Time to go to school.</p>
<p>Every one looked at me as if they knew who I was as I walked through the school gate but this wasn’t good. This was bad. First day of school and I am already classified as a looser. Bad luck for me.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
I had a bad time first lesson and no one wanted to sit next to me apart from this sad looking girl who smiled at me and just walked along. Next lesson I looked at my timetable P.E. Take off that scarf now the P.E teacher commanded but I didn’t anything I would do but not taking off the scarf. The teacher complained and complained but I wouldn’t listen and at last the teacher gave up leaving me with a detention.</p>
<p>Phew school had just finished and I was tired then I remembered the detention and it was when I started walking back I remembered I had a commercial so I didn’t go for the detention. Just ran away which gave me more detentions that I also missed.</p>
<p><br />
This carried on for months but I never gave up and then one day we were told it was going to be vacation in a week and we seniors were allowed non-uniform to school so I decided I</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
was going to reveal my true identity. My only friend Lora who had smiled at me on first day of school was really getting into this. “What are you wearing she asked again but I still ignored her.” She was soon going to find out.</p>
<p>In the morning I got up and knew exactly what I wanted to do in school- show my real identity. I wore exactly what I wore in my last commercial then I washed my face and made sure I looked exactly how I was in the last commercial. I then transferred my school notes to my stylish home bag. I looked like I had just finished a commercial and the clothes I wore were to come out the following week. I went downstairs and my mum looked at me a bit worriedly but I smiled.</p>
<p>When I got to school Amy, the class fashion queen was wearing the type of outfit I wore in one of my commercials which was still famous. She usually called me names and laughed at me but this time when she saw me she gasped “what is a super model doing in our school! Can I be the first to get your autograph?” I</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
looked past her and saw a whole crowd of students around me. Not only did I do commercials but I also acted some movies and I was gathered with people wanting my autograph but Lora stood apart staring at the gate so I called her and asked what she was doing and she replied “I am waiting for my good friend” and everyone just laughed “the school’s ugly weirdo” Amy said and then I pulled out a picture of me in disguise and everyone was surprised and said how did I know the weirdo.</p>
<p>I took out all my disguise tools that I had in my bag and put them on while everyone looked amazed. Then I wiped off the disguise.</p>
<pre>
Lora looked like she was about to faint. “Tell me it wasn’t a super model in disguise” Amy gasped and I smiled “the only way a model can know who are her friends is by going through hell herself, but at least I rested from autographs for a while which I deserved.”  
</pre>
<p>I nodded towards Lora “a friend in need is a friend indeed. Let’s go.” All the boys looked amazed and asked why I</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
came to school and I replied, “I really am not older than you” “I am the friend of a super model!” Lora kept dancing. Amy begged and begged and at last I gave her my autograph and signed loads of others. The teachers discovered themselves and were surprised and I stayed to finish the following week. I didn’t really need my GCSE’s as I had an occupation but I passed with A’s and A*s. It was a really fun experience.</p>
<p>Right now I am sitting down with my two best friends from school two years ago. Amy and Lora.</p>
<p>“You really had the face behind the veil” Amy smiled. She could be really nice if you knew her and she had also changed.</p>
<p>I like that phrase. THE FACE BEHIND THE VEIL. Got a commercial right now. “Bye girls.” Lora smiled again.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/m/User%7EBimbufeyi_87d0.html" title="Edit section: Twin Terror by Hauwa Onifade">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Twin Terror by Hauwa Onifade</b></span></h2>
<p>Having a twin is the greatest thing on earth I always thought. Playing together, sharing stuff and always having a partner. But my story changed when…</p>
<p>It was February the thirteen, a day to our birthday. We were on half term holidays and Jess and I were messing around. Jess hit me on the back and I laughed. We were going to be 13 and we wee having a great party. We had invited all our friends and we were so happy. “What do you think we are going to get for our birthday Tess” jess asked me. “I don’t know but I have a feeling it would have nothing to do with what we got last year” I said. Last year we had gotten these little dresses that came in twin packs, bikes and a few other things. They were quite all right but they were kinda babyish (apart from the bike duh). We walked on to Liz’s house. Liz was our friend and we were going to arrange some last Minuets stuff with her. She and Lisa her cousin were coming to our house for a sleepover. We had known Liz and Lisa since we were six year olds. We had a little chatter and then I and Jess walked on home.</p>
<p>When we were going home, Jess said to me “I would have the greatest present of all tomorrow,” I laughed. Jess always tried to get on my nerves at times but I knew she was joking “come on” I said. I pushed her and she fell into the road. Just then, she where there was an oncoming car.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“RUN!” I shouted but she didn’t seem to hear.</p>
<pre>
I opened my eyes and there was Jessica in the road flat on her back with blood all over her face. I was horrified. What had just happened? My identical twin sister was in the middle of the road. I put my head on her chest, my heart missed 10 beats in 2 seconds. She wasn’t breathing. Jess was dead.
</pre>
<p>A lady quickly called the ambulance and then asked for our parents number which I gave to her. “What happened” mum asked me when we got home after the ambulance people had broke the news to mum and dad. I told her everything muffling my way through nearly all the words. I couldn’t still believe that my only sibling was dead. Yesterday, we had absolutely forgot that we had invited my friends (and Jess’s) to the 13th cancelled birthday. Liz and Lisa knocked on the door all dressed up and when mum answered the door, they found me crying in the living room. Mum told them there was no party anymore and they asked why and mum briefly explained to them what had happened but they still refused to leave. ‘How could you kill your sister’ I had myself in my head and I immediately burst into tears again. This was a birthday disaster.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
On Monday, at school, things went from bad to worse. I had to sit with the dumbest boy in the world. I couldn’t really get along with my schoolwork and I had to go home because I couldn’t do anything.</p>
<p>I got all my own presents and that of jess and it was pretty boring doing stuff on my own. I couldn’t believe what was happening to me. It was from twin joy to twin terror.</p>
<p>Things went fast since then. I go to school, I get told off then I cry and I get to go to the head and have chart but I still always remembered how I had killed jess. It was a very terrible thing and I did it. I was a murderer and I deserved to go to court.</p>
<p>Then one Friday a month after the accident I got home and there was a surprise waiting for me. There was a cake on the table and there behind the table was Jacqueline Wilson. She smiled at me and then said sweetly “happy birthday” I was overwhelmed with happiness then I thought ‘if only jess was there’. Mum must have saw the faint look on my face because the next thing she said was “we brought her because we felt sorry about jess”. A smile formed on my face as I mouthed a thank you.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Jacqueline Wilson discussed with me about jess and by the end of the day, I believed I hadn’t killed jess.</p>
<p>Hopefully, on Monday I would act better at school. I didn’t kill jess but I would always remember her forever. Wherever she is, she shall always have my love as a sister. Twin terror Clock thirteen On valentine day Just remember Anything can happen Any time Any day Any Minuet Any hour Don’t get too happy Twin happiness</p>
