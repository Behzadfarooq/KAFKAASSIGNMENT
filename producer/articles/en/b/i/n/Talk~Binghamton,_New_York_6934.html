<p>Binghamton is also known as bingy. Its easier to spell and sounds more funky.</p>
<p><i>Italic text</i>I lived in Binghamton for 21 yrs. and never once heard anyone call it "bingy", must be in recent years. Bingo is my preferred nickname for home.</p>

<p>To native "binghamtonians", "Bingo" is a common way to refer to the city. It's slang, and probably a new thing (I highly doubt anyone over 65 years old would know what it means)... Actually my 90 year old grandfather has a great picture of the Binghamton BINGO'S baseball team popular around 1900. He says that is where the name started. He however says that Parlor City was the more popular nickname. But, to the younger generation of people Bingo is a common term...especially used in emails...for obvious reasons. But anyone who refers to bingo as "binghampton" deserves a stiff kick in the groin. Anyone from the area would know that comes from the misspelling on the pine lounge tee shirt. (most likely a joke done on purpose to mock anyone who would call it such a thing....this city is light years from long island)</p>
<p>Ok - Bingo was typically the name given (in my experience) by hockey players, playing our way through the teams located there. A Bing-a-ling was the name given to locals by students of Binghamton University.</p>
<p>Wrong! Binghamton University Stuents call locals "townies" not "Bing-a-lings"</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've been involved with BU students for 15 years (in high school, as an undergrad, and now as a grad student), and I've never heard "bing-a-ling" before. As you say, it's definitely "townies." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.24.95.18_de40.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.24.95.18">24.24.95.18</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.24.95.18.html" title="User talk:24.24.95.18">talk</a>) 02:52, 13 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>While working at Dick's Clothing and Sporting Goods as a teenager, when we were out of something we would often call one of the other Dick's stores (in Syracues, Rochester, etc.) to see if they had what the customer wanted. To address our Dick's counterparts from the other stores we would say that we were calling from the "Bingo" Dicks. They, in turn, would say: "Let me check with the Bingo store..."</p>

<p>The article mentions the population stat for the greater area, and right after that mentions the "triple cities" but never really says whether these are the same thing or not. Is the greater Binghamton area just the triple cities? I know many people who would argue that Vestal, Endwell, Port Dickinson (upper front street's commercial strip especially) and even kirkwood sometimes. So the article as is, is a tad ambiguous, it should at least define more clearly what that population figure is for. --Thelastemperor 07:46, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to the census bureau the Binghamton MSA comprises Broome and Tioga counties in NY. Until the 1980 census it also included Susquehanna county, PA but that has since been dropped. From a regional perspective, the "greater binghamton" region is more accurately all of Broome, southern Cortland, eastern Tioga, southwestern Delaware, southern Chenango and northern Susquehanna and Tioga county, PA. Western tioga NY (Waverly\Sayre west) identifies with Elmira\Corning, northern Tioga with Ithaca, and northern Cortland with Syracuse. --<a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcamin_5c42.html" title="User:Dcamin">Dcamin</a></p>
<p>The Greater Binghamton moniker was a recomedation of "The BCPlan" in 2002. The plan was for Broome County.

<p>IBM, if I am not mistaken, has its "Birthplace" in a village to the west of Binghamton that goes by the name of Endicott. if you look at the wikipedia article on <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_cbf4.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> it states that "[IBM] originated as the Computing Tabulating Recording (CTR) Corporation, which was incorporated on June 15, 1911 in Endicott, New York a few miles west of Binghamton." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.204.208.183 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.204.208.183_bd54.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.204.208.183">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>This gets tricky. CTR is IBM, the company just changed its name to IBM in 1924, but it's roots were traced to the several companies that were merged to form CTR. Among them was Bundy Manufacturing, which was based in Binghamton (offices on Commercial Alley if I'm not mistaken), this company was a key part of International Time Recording Company, a Binghamton-based company (and selling agency of multiple vendors time recording equipment) that outgrew it's Binghamton home and built a new plant in Endicott in 1906 (a building still in use at the plant.) According to IBM's archives on their website, this facility became IBM Plant No. 1. --Dcamin</p>
<p>Besides, who really cares anyway? The only way to know if someone is really from Binghamton is to ask them which side of town they lived on because everyone in the area (Endicott, Endwell, Johnson City, Vestal, Kirkwood, Conklin, etc, etc, etc....) claims to be from Binghamton.</p>

<p>The latest edit adding 3 streets in downtown Binghamton as shopping areas could be viewed as an opinion. Either the exact blocks of those long streets should be identifed or the traditional boundaries of downtown should be listed: Chenango River on the west; Susquehanna River on the south; Lewis St. on the north; and Tompkins St/Brandywine on the east. I'll double check this before making the change.</p>
<p>Not sure why Boscov's gets mentioned other than it's the biggest retailer downtown. If I was one of the other retailers, I'd not be happy. How about Metro Center? Although not filled with retailers, it's a major presence.</p>
<p>I think the whole section needs to be rewritten. The title of the section is ambiguous. Should be Shopping or Retail or Economy. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheesebox_7b4a.html" title="User:Cheesebox">Cheesebox</a> 05:55, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
