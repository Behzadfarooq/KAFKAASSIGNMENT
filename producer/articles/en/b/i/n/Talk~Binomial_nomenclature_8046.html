<p>I can see you really like the idea that a scientist might make a pun in naming a species (although probably very rare). It is an idea that has merit for inclusion. However, you should use proper English and place it in a sentence where it makes sense. Also, since putting this in a paragraph is for the purpose of tweaking the interest of the reader, it seems that an example would help. Here is how you had it (and then put it back):</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The names used are usually derived from Latin. Although Latin derivation is not universal (names sometimes come from Ancient Greek, sometimes from local languages, often from the name of the person who first discovered the species <u>and is sometimes playful, such as a pun</u>, the names are always treated grammatically as if they were Latin words)."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that the verb is wrong and the sentence is about how some words are not from latin, but are latinized from ancient Greek, local languages, or a person's name. Making a pun does not fit in with that point. You could add it as a new sentence with an example - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 17:22, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added a second paragraph where the idea of a pun fits in better. If you have an example, that would help - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 18:08, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>(asked it first at talk:Naming conventions (fauna), but moved it)</p>
<p>Hi, I always wondered how plural forms of scientific names are written: <i>Velociraptor</i>s or Velociraptors. I always thought <i>Velociraptors</i> being patently wrong (since it's an English plural). Right? Or is the plural simply "sixteen <i>Velociraptor</i>", just like you say: "This sample contains eleven <i>Krithe rutoti</i>". <a href="../../../p/h/l/User%7EPhlebas_ed72.html" title="User:Phlebas">Phlebas</a> 17:59, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Technically, Latin words take Latin plurals (datum / data), however, few people, including scientists, ever learn Latin anymore. Consequently, there is considerable variation in how plurals are formed. Velociraptor used as a common name, would likely best be pluralized as velociraptors rather than (and I confess, I do not speak Latin) <i>Velociraptorae</i>, although the latter might be recognized as a plural by most. I would not think <i>Velociraptors</i> would be correct for anything, as the meaning would be several species (not individuals) within the genus and an English plural of a Latin wordâ€”simply a misspelling. Your solution works in the absence of knowledge of Latin and is probably now followed by most scientists. I think (someone help me out here) that the genus would take the plural in proper latin, but that seems not to be done (i.e., no change at the species level). - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 04:44, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But what is a common name? I'm taking an example from the <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurassic_Park_III_9841.html" title="Jurassic Park III">Jurassic Park III</a> page. Spinosaur surely is, but then I'd say <i>Spinosaurus</i> isn't anymore. The problem is then, with <i>Velociraptor</i> you can't see if it's common or scientific. In <i>Velociraptor'</i>s case, I'd go for italics al the time.<a href="../../../p/h/l/User%7EPhlebas_ed72.html" title="User:Phlebas">Phlebas</a> 17:25, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To italicize an English plural is just bad style, since italicization is reserved for foreign/Latin words and emphasis. In writing, it'd really odd if we go half-half (<i>Velociraptor</i>s), but it wouldn't sound strang in speech. I believe the convention is like: "There are eleven <b>individuals/specimens of</b> <i>Velociraptor fallax</i>." --<a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMenchi_e72d.html" title="User:Menchi">Menchi</a> 05:57, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What if the number is unknown? 'Billy and Eric are attacked by <i>Pteranodon</i>s.' Keeping it singular really sounds awkward and incorrect. So the convention doesn't really hold out...<a href="../../../p/h/l/User%7EPhlebas_ed72.html" title="User:Phlebas">Phlebas</a> 17:25, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>Menchi is correct in assuming <i>Velociraptors</i> is an English word, italicised. I was meaning it was incorrect because it was a Latin word made into an English plural. Either way: not done. Although Menchi suggests a good way around the problem, it would be correct to say: "Billy and Eric were attacked by <i>Panthera leo</i>"; that does not sound at all awkward to meâ€”it states the species they were attacked by, leaving the number of individual attackers unstated (=one or more). Using the scientific name instead of a common name (lion or lions) suggests that the whole point of the sentence is the identification of the attacking species, and not anything about numbers or other details of the attack. The sentence "Billy and Eric are attacked by <i>Panthera</i>s" would be interepreted as an attack by more than one species of <i>Panthera</i> since it is the genus that is awkwardly pluralized. This sentence would not be awkward or ambiguous to me: "Billy and Eric watched as several large <i>Panthera leo</i> approached their camp" - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 17:43, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you. That cleared some things up. And it shows the necessity of using the (anglicised) common names instead of scientific ones (else you are referring to the <i>genus</i>). That is something I have trouble with. I was on an italicising spree the last days. What is your opinion on italicising every occurence of a singular name (i.e. is every scientific name part of the English dictionary)? <a href="../../../p/h/l/User%7EPhlebas_ed72.html" title="User:Phlebas">Phlebas</a> 19:25, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No necessity, just differences in form. You may feel that "Billy and Eric watched as several large <i>Panthera leo</i> approached their camp" is awkward, but it really is not; it looks perfectly normal to me because I use species names in writing on a daily basis. You expect English to be worded a certain way; putting in latinized terms changes that. Also, you need to be clear about the difference between a genus name and a species name (both would be italicised, however). You are refering to the genus only if you use just the genus name, as in many of your examples above. I avoided that by using a species name (<i>Panthera leo</i>, for example). Not sure what your question is about "part of the English dictionary"&#160;? Scientific names are latinized for the very reasons that 1) no country can claim Latin as its own and 2) therefore it is essentially an international language and all countries use the latin scientific name; anglicizing is not a consideration. - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 04:57, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&gt;You may feel that 'Billy and Eric watched as several large <i>Panthera leo</i> approached their camp' is awkward...</dd>
<dd>I really don't feel that's awkward . Neither does 'Billy and Eric were attacked by <i>Panthera leo'</i>. What does feel awkward is 'Billy and Eric are attacked by <i>Smilodon</i>.'
<dl>
<dd>Again, becauase you are just using a genus name, the sentence really does not make sense. To be attacked by "<i>Smilodon</i>" is to be atacked by what?...all the species of <i>Similodon</i>? <i>Smilodon</i> is not an entity in the sense of a single animal, it is just a genus name; essentially a catagory.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It isn't clearly stated whether there is one or more than one. In this case I want to refer to a specific species in the <i>Smilodon</i> genus (ie. not specified which species it is (bad science-fiction)). And in this book they are attacked by several smilodons. That's what I mean with necessity, since <i>Smilodon</i>s refers to (as you say) more than one member of the genus, so smilodons should best be used.
<dl>
<dd>Stated that way is somewhat like saying "He was run over by objects of transportation" when what was intended was a car or train or something. Do not use <i>Smilidon</i>, but use smilidon instead.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>&gt;Velociraptor used as a common name, would likely best be pluralized as velociraptors...This is what I meant with 'part of the English dictionary' - <a href="../../../p/h/l/User%7EPhlebas_ed72.html" title="User:Phlebas">Phlebas</a> 23:04, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'd agree. If you use a common name, you can us an English plural - <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 04:22, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
