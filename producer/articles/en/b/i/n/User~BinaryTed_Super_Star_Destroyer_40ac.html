<p>The 2,200 meter long <i>Allegiance</i>-type Star Destroyer is a dedicated fleet destroyer with heavy armor and no hangar bay, similar to the <i>Tector</i>-class. Unlike the <i>Tector</i>, the <i>Allegiance</i> has a large ventral bulb, implying a massive reactor and very powerful weapons and shields. The proper class name of this class is not known; <i>Allegiance</i> is the only named representative of the class. In the <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Empire_4ca3.html" title="Dark Empire">Dark Empire</a></i> comics, ships of this class were seen at several major battles and were also the primary escorts of the Imperial flagship <i>Eclipse</i>. <i>Allegiance</i> was referred to as a "Super Star Destroyer", so it may be considered a light cruiser rather than a destroyer.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinaryTed_Super_Star_Destroyer_40ac.html" title="Edit section: Executor-class Star Dreadnought">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Executor</i>-class Star Dreadnought</span></h3>
<p><i>Also known as the</i> Super<i>-class Star Destroyer,</i> Executor<i>-class Star Destroyer, and</i> Executor<i>-class Super Star Destroyer.</i></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executor_%28Star_Wars%29_9ef0.html" title="Executor (Star Wars)">Executor</a> is an often-debated ship among Star Wars fans. Official materials and fan speculation have placed the length at 8, 12, 12.8, 13, 17.6, and 19 kilometers — the last being the most recent figure officially published, seen in the Star Wars Databank as well as <i>Inside the Worlds of the Star Wars Trilogy,</i> and the figure best supported by appearing 11–12 times as long as the <i>Imperial</i>-class in the films.</p>
<p>The ITW places over 5,000 turbolasers and ion cannons and numerous lesser weapons on the <i>Executor</i>. Older sources give it 250 heavy turbolaser batteries, 250 turbolaser batteries, 250 concussion missile tubes, 250 ion cannons, and 40 tractor beam projectors, and either 144, 216, or "thousands" of fighters.</p>
<p>Two prefabricated garrison bases are also stored on board for rapid deployment of ground forces. Her shields are said to be able to dissipate power output equal to a medium-sized star; in one comic, the shields are shown to protect the <i>Executor</i> in a collision with three <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyers exiting hyperspace.</p>
<p>As was discovered by the Rebels at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Battle of Endor</a>, the immense warship did have a weakness. By disabling the shield generators atop the command bridge, the bridge became vulnerable. This was accidentally exploited by <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvel_Crynyd_5a03.html" title="Arvel Crynyd">Arvel Crynyd</a> whose A-wing impacted the <i>Executor</i>s bridge, sending the ship plummeting into the Death Star.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinaryTed_Super_Star_Destroyer_40ac.html" title="Edit section: Past depictions of the Super in the Expanded Universe">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Past depictions of the <i>Super</i> in the Expanded Universe</span></h4>
<p>Initially, Super Star Destroyers were described in official literature as eight miles or kilometers long, and having perhaps five times the firepower and twice the fighter capacity of an <i>Imperial</i>-class. This has changed over time, largely in response to fans pointing out publicly that the <i>Executor</i> is clearly more than 5–8 times the length of the <i>Imperial</i> Star Destroyers seen in the movie.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some official sources indirectly implied that Super Star Destroyers were longer than 8 kilometers before the revisions of official statistics began. For example, in the 1997 novel <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bacta_War_%28novel%29_6f3b.html" title="The Bacta War (novel)">The Bacta War</a></i>, the captain of the <i>Executor</i>'s sister ship <i><a href="../../../l/u/s/Lusankya.html" title="Lusankya">Lusankya</a></i> referred to a rogue <i>Imperial</i> Star Destroyer as "a ship a tenth of our size". The 1997 computer game <i><a href="../../../x/-/w/X-Wing_vs._TIE_Fighter_231a.html" title="X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter">X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter: Balance of Power</a></i> also, while depicting the Super Star Destroyer <i>Vengeance</i> as 8 kilometers in length within the game, displayed the ship in its cover art as being well over 10 times the length of its accompanying Star Destroyers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the smaller Super Star Destroyer holds an allure within Star Wars fandom, partly due to the wide proliferation of the class. The poor combat performance of many Super Star Destroyers in official literature is often held as proof that the ship could not possibly be eleven times the length of an <i>Imperial</i>-class. Some suggest that these smaller Super Star Destroyers described are a different class from the <i>Executor</i>, allowing them to be 8–13 km long regardless of the length of the <i>Executor</i>.</p>
<p>The most recent <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Expanded Universe</a> materials call the <i>Executor</i>-class a Star Dreadnaught. This shift, and the status of the older "Super Star Destroyer" term is hotly disputed among fans. <i>Inside the Worlds of the Star Wars Trilogy</i> explains that the "Super Star Destroyer" designation is colloquial, while the "Star Dreadnought" designation is the formal term. Incorrectly, this designation is often spelled "Star Dreadnaught"; it is printed as "Star Dreadnought" and the <i>Dreadnaught</i>-class heavy cruiser is an entirely separate class of ship.</p>
<p>For some who find the "<i>Super</i>-class" particularly distasteful as a name, derivatives like "<i>Superior</i>" or "<i>Superb</i>" were often used — both of the latter are strictly <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">fanon</a>. Vessels for which this rationalization is particularly common are mentioned below.</p>

<ul>
<li><i><b>Aggressor</b></i> — Admiral Roek's flagship was stationed in the Inner Rim region prior to the Battle of Endor. Later, it was recalled to <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corellia.html" title="Corellia">Corellia</a> to protect the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corellian_Engineering_Corporation_7b0a.html" title="Corellian Engineering Corporation">Corellian Engineering Corporation</a> shipyards. It is believed to have been destroyed during a fratricidal battle between warlord Imperial factions, when it collided with a <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torpedo_sphere.html" title="Torpedo sphere">torpedo sphere</a> at the Battle Of Tralus. Grand Admiral Pitta used a torpedo sphere to defend the planet Tralus from Grand Admiral Grunger's entire fleet of 30 Star Destroyers, 60 Strike Cruises and 100 <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carrack-Class_Light_Cruiser_a4fc.html" title="Carrack-Class Light Cruiser">Carrack Cruisers</a>, until Grunger rammed the <i>Aggressor</i> into Pitta's sphere killing them both.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Executor</b></i> — The <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_ship.html" title="Lead ship">lead ship</a> of its class and the only such vessel featured in the movies. This ship was the first ship of its type, built at the Fondor Shipyards. <i><a href="../../../e/x/e/Executor_%28Star_Wars%29_9ef0.html" title="Executor (Star Wars)">Executor</a></i> was involved in the siege of <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hoth.html" title="Hoth">Hoth</a> in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Empire_Strikes_Back_1636.html" title="The Empire Strikes Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a></i>, and the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Battle of Endor</a> in <i><a href="../../../r/e/t/Return_of_the_Jedi_3be9.html" title="Return of the Jedi">Return of the Jedi</a></i>. The ship was destroyed by the <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel_Alliance_%28Star_Wars%29_49df.html" title="Rebel Alliance (Star Wars)">Rebel Alliance</a> during the Battle of Endor, colliding with the second <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> after its bridge was destroyed by <a href="../../../a/r/v/Arvel_Crynyd_5a03.html" title="Arvel Crynyd">Arvel Crynyd</a>'s crashing <a href="../../../a/-/w/A-wing.html" title="A-wing">A-wing</a> fighter, along with many of the Imperial Navy's finest officers. There is some irony in this, as the <i>Executor</i> was designed by Lira Wessex, and the A-Wing that caused its loss was designed by Walex Blissex, her father.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Guardian</b></i> — This ship was stationed in the Core regions and was the flagship of Fleet Admiral Gaen Drommel, who (like many high-ranking Imperial officers) turned to warlordism after the death of Emperor <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a>. Three years after the Battle of Endor, the ship was severely damaged in battle with the nascent New Republic. She was captured by the New Republic some ten years later, apparently in poor condition and was eventually repaired. <i>Guardian</i> saw operational service in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, and became a Galactic Alliance command-ship/mobile base.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Intimidator</b></i> — Originally assigned to Black Sword Command together with two other anonymous "Super Star Destroyers", <i>Intimidator</i> was rechristened <i>Pride of Yevetha</i> and pressed into service for the Duskhan League after the Yevethan revolt at the <i>Black Fifteen</i> shipyards over N'zoth. It was later reacquired by subjugated human crewmen during a revolt. <i>Intimidator</i> eventually came to rest as a heavily-damaged derelict somewhere in the galactic core.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Iron Fist</b></i> — This ship was the flagship of <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warlord_Zsinj_5bc0.html" title="Warlord Zsinj">Warlord Zsinj</a>'s fleet. It was the symbol of the warlord's power, and he used it to terrorize worlds into submission. <i>Iron Fist</i> was reported destroyed at Selaggis, but was later found intact and still in Zsinj's service at his primary shipyard over the planet <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28C-D%29_1590.html#Dathomir" title="List of Star Wars planets (C-D)">Dathomir</a>. <i>Iron Fist</i> was soon destroyed during a battle over Dathomir between his fleet and the <a href="../../../h/a/p/Hapes_Consortium_c39c.html" title="Hapes Consortium">Hapan Navy</a>, when the <i><a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Falcon_baaa.html" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i> fired two concussion missiles into the bridge. Originally named HIMS <i>Brawl</i>, and renamed by Zsinj after his first command, a <i>Victory</i>-class Star Destroyer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Knight Hammer</b></i> — Seeing the inefficiencies of the Emperor's heirs, Admiral Daala murdered most of the warlords who had risen to power after the fall of the Empire. Consolidating command over the remaining Imperial military, Daala took command of the <i>Night Hammer</i>, which had been built in secret by one of the murdered warlords, Supreme General Delvardus, and renamed it to <i>Knight Hammer</i> in preparation for the attack on <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a>'s <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> academy on <a href="../../../y/a/v/Yavin_4.html" title="Yavin 4">Yavin 4</a>. Different than most Star Destroyers, the Knight Hammer was entirely black. It also had stealth technology, emitting no outward light and reducing its sensor cross section. During the attack on the Jedi academy, the <i>Knight Hammer</i> fell victim to sabotage by ex-Jedi Knight <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_New_Jedi_Order_characters_87dd.html#Callista" title="List of New Jedi Order characters">Callista</a> when she was able to sabotage the engines by pointing all <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_bomber_2255.html" title="TIE bomber">TIE bombers</a> at the rear hangar bay (at the bulkhead by the engines). They fired their missiles, breaking through the bulkhead and heavily damaging the engines; the vessel was subsequently destroyed when it was pulled into Yavin's gravity well, but not before Admiral Daala evacuated the crew.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Lusankya</b></i> — This was the sister-ship of the <i>Executor</i>. Both ships were built at the same time at separate facilities, both under the name of <i>Executor</i>. When they were completed, one went on to become the ship seen in the movies, the other was renamed <i><a href="../../../l/u/s/Lusankya.html" title="Lusankya">Lusankya</a></i> and somehow ended up buried under the surface of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coruscant.html" title="Coruscant">Coruscant</a>, capital of the Empire. The method Emperor <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> used to hide the Lusankya's existence is unknown, but fans have speculated he must have either used the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force_%28Star_Wars%29_fc7e.html" title="Force (Star Wars)">Force</a> to erase the memories of the ship's builders, or ordered the deaths of millions and an extraordinary cover-up. <i>Lusankya</i> was given to <a href="../../../y/s/a/Ysanne_Isard_a129.html" title="Ysanne Isard">Ysanne Isard</a>, who used it to flee <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coruscant.html" title="Coruscant">Coruscant</a> after it was conquered by the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Republic_%28Star_Wars%29_803b.html" title="New Republic (Star Wars)">New Republic</a> using repulsors installed on the ship to leave the atmosphere. The ship was eventually captured by <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedge_Antilles_6f70.html" title="Wedge Antilles">Wedge Antilles</a> over <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_%28T-V%29_b9a6.html#Thyferra" title="List of Star Wars planets (T-V)">Thyferra</a>, and became a vessel in the New Republic's fleet. Under orders of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Rebel_characters_in_Star_Wars_3d08.html#Mothma.2C_Mon" title="Minor Rebel characters in Star Wars">Mon Mothma</a>, <i>Lusankya</i> was decommissioned, but was reactivated some years before the <a href="../../../y/u/u/Yuuzhan_Vong_68ce.html" title="Yuuzhan Vong">Yuuzhan Vong</a> invasion. She was finally destroyed around 25 years after the Battle of Endor, when it was sent on a suicide mission to ram a Yuuzhan Vong <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koros-strohna.html" title="Koros-strohna">Worldship</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Razor's Kiss</b></i> — Although it was built for the Empire by <a href="../../../k/u/a/Kuat_Drive_Yards_fcee.html" title="Kuat Drive Yards">Kuat Drive Yards</a>, this ship was never commissioned in service to the Empire. When it was nearly completed, a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commando.html" title="Commando">commando</a> force sent by Warlord Zsinj took control of it, and began fighting their way out of the shipyards. When the ships stationed there moved to intercept it, Warlord Zsinj brought in his fleet, led by another <i>Executor</i>-class ship named <i>Iron Fist</i>, to protect it until they jumped out of the system. Unfortunately for Zsinj, one member of his commando forces was a spy dispatched by the New Republic's Wraith Squadron, who destroyed the shield generators and planted a program in the ship's computers that told the New Republic's fleet the location it escaped to. <i>Razor's Kiss</i> was destroyed by the New Republic before ever seeing a real battle. Its remains were recovered and became the <i>Second Death</i>, which Warlord Zsinj used to fool the New Republic into thinking the <i>Iron Fist</i> was destroyed at Selaggis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Reaper</b></i> — Originally the flagship of <a href="../../../m/o/f/Moff.html" title="Moff">Grand Moff</a> Governor Ardus Kaine, it was eventually acquired by <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilad_Pellaeon_f275.html" title="Gilad Pellaeon">Admiral Pelleaon</a> after consolidating Kaine's former holdings (the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentastar_Alignment_a3c1.html" title="Pentastar Alignment">Pentastar Alignment</a>) into the Imperial Remnant. <i>Reaper</i> was destroyed in combat with the New Republic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Terror</b></i> — The flagship of Admiral Sarn as part of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martio_Batch_eb3b.html" title="Martio Batch">Grand Admiral Martio Batch</a>'s Project Phantom at Immdar Alpha involving the mass-use of stygian crystal cloaking devices on V38 assault fighters. Rebel agents managed to use a single fighter to damage key components of HIMS <i>Terror</i>. The ship was destroyed, along with the Immdar Alpha facility and the majority of Project PHANTOM.</li>

<li><b>Two Anonymous Black Sword "Super Star Destroyers"</b> — In addition to the captured HIMS <i>Intimidator</i>, there were two additional Super Star Destroyers indicated to be of the same class deployed within Black Sword Command, but not ensconced at the shipyard of Black Fifteen that was seized by Yevethan partisans. It is possible that one or both of these ships was retained/obtained by the Imperial Remnant sometime after the Armistice, and could possibly be the unknown-name "Super Star Destroyer" present at Bastion in "Destiny's Way" (speculation on this craft is discussed below), however, their eventual fate is unknown and undocumented.</li>

The most striking feature of the ship is its slender frame, which was narrower than standard Star Destroyers, almost sword-like in comparison to the usual dagger-shape, with two wings sticking out the sides near the engines. The ship class which the <i>Vengeance</i> belongs to is unknown. It has been referred to as a Super Star Destroyer variant. However, such a description is of little use, as the term "Super Star Destroyer" has been applied to many different classes of warship larger than the standard <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer, and the <i>Vengeance</i> bears few similarities to the <i>Executor</i>-class.</p>
<p>Jerec interrogated one of the two people who knew about the location of the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley_of_the_Jedi_637d.html" title="Valley of the Jedi">Valley of the Jedi</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_Jedi_knights_34a7.html#Rahn.2C_Qu" title="List of minor Star Wars Jedi knights">Qu Rahn</a> on-board the <i>Vengeance</i>.

Accompanying the ship was a large transport and a small task force of <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyers. <i>Vengeance</i> may be a one-of-a-kind flagship, although this is never directly stated. It is quite possible that <i>Vengeance</i> was one of three Super Star Destroyers from Black Sword Command, since the other two were never accounted for, and neither was <i>Vengeance</i>. After transporting Jerec, command of the <i>Vengeance</i> was taken by the Reborn <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Emperor</a>'s chief Intelligence agent, <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cronal.html" title="Cronal">Blackhole</a>, as a token of Jerec's loyalty.

<p>Interestingly, the <i>Vengeance'</i>s slim form contrasts greatly with its wide array of engines; this, along with the decreased surface area would allow for considerably fewer guns than on ships like the <i><a href="../../../e/x/e/Executor.html" title="Executor">Executor</a></i> or Admiral Mils Giel's flagship</p>

</dl>
<p>The 17.5-kilometer-long <i>Eclipse</i>-class Star Destroyer was larger than the <i>Sovereign</i>-class ships and much more massive than the longer <i>Executor</i>-class Star Destroyer. The first of this class, the <i>Eclipse</i>, became the reborn <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Emperor's</a> flagship. It was supposedly one of the most heavily armed ships in the history of the Star Wars galaxy. It carried thousands of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_ship-mounted_weapons_7588.html" title="List of Star Wars ship-mounted weapons">turbolaser</a> and heavy turbolaser cannons. It also had powerful shields and heavy jet-black armor, making it difficult to destroy in space combat and allowing it to even ram enemy ships without taking serious damage. The multiple <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity_well.html" title="Gravity well">gravity-well projectors</a> were used to prevent enemies from escaping into hyperspace, forcing them to either surrender or fight a hopeless battle against the Eclipse. The most important feature was a superlaser cannon located on the bow of the <i>Eclipse</i>. Although it was not as powerful as the superlaser on the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a>, it was of advanced design (hence the smaller size and faster recharge) and was capable of cracking a planet's crust and vaporizing enemy capital ships.</p>
<p>According to the West End Games <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role_Playing_Game_b77d.html" title="Role Playing Game">RPG</a> statistics, <i>Eclipse</i> carried 600 <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Interceptor_365b.html" title="TIE Interceptor">TIE Interceptors</a> and 96 <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Bomber_b02a.html" title="TIE Bomber">TIE Bombers</a>, divided into 58 <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squadron.html" title="Squadron">squadrons</a>; for ground assault, it carried 150,000 <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Stormtrooper_6e44.html" title="Imperial Stormtrooper">Imperial Stormtroopers</a>, 100 <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-AT_3fef.html" title="AT-AT">AT-ATs</a>, 10 gravity-well projectors, and five prefabricated bases. The <i>Eclipse</i> was said to be crewed by over 700,000 personnel. West End Games RPG statistics state that <i>Eclipse</i> was 17.5 km long; this contradicts the description given in <i>Dark Empire</i>, where the length is explicitly stated to be 10 miles (16 km). However, the author of the <i>Dark Empire Sourcebook</i> suggests that an additional mile was added to Palpatine's personal flagship, and is indicative of customization and personalization for Palpatine, and not the standard class. It also may be the result of the spasmatic construction apparent in the first example of this class.</p>
<p>The power of the <i>Eclipse</i>-class' superlaser as described is self-contradictory. It has been described as 2/3rds the power of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a>'s prime weapon. Visual <a href="http://66.39.46.41/Empire/Tech/Beam/Alderaan.html" class="external text" title="http://66.39.46.41/Empire/Tech/Beam/Alderaan.html" rel="nofollow">analysis</a> of Alderaan's destruction in ANH suggested the Death Star superlaser inserted at least a million times more energy than the <a href="http://66.39.46.41/Empire/Tech/Beam/DeathStar.html" class="external text" title="http://66.39.46.41/Empire/Tech/Beam/DeathStar.html" rel="nofollow">minimum</a> for permanently breaking up a planet. Therefore a weapon with "2/3rds the power" would be more than sufficient to irrevocably shatter a planet, yet it was also stated that the <i>Eclipse's</i> superlaser was not powerful enough to destroy a planet. There is some speculation as to whether the 2/3rds number refers to the magnitude of the energy release as opposed to the total value; this would put the main weapon below the threshold necessary to destroy a planet. Another possibility, as the Death Star's superlaser consisted of eight (or, in the Death Star II, nine) individual beams which combined into a single larger beam after firing, is that the <i>Eclipse</i>-class' superlaser had 2/3rds the power of <i>one</i> of the Death Star superlaser's component beams.</p>
<p>The <i>Eclipse</i> was destroyed along with the reborn Emperor <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> when <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> and his sister <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Leia_d504.html" title="Princess Leia">Princess Leia</a> managed to disrupt the Emperor's control of a titanic Force Storm, a massive conflagration of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Side_e591.html" title="Dark Side">Dark Side</a> energy that he had summoned in order to wipe out the massed <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Republic_%28Star_Wars%29_803b.html" title="New Republic (Star Wars)">New Republic</a> fleet. Afterwards, a second <i>Eclipse</i>-class ship was built, dubbed the <i>Eclipse II</i>. Above the planet <a href="../../../b/y/s/Byss.html" title="Byss">Byss</a>, <a href="../../../r/2/-/R2-D2_552c.html" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a> took control of the <i>Eclipse II's</i> computers and then sent it on a collision course with the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galaxy_Gun_3b59.html" title="Galaxy Gun">Galaxy Gun</a> superweapon. A testament to the integrity of its hull, the <i>Eclipse II</i> plowed right through the weapon. The Galaxy Gun's misfired projectile was pulled by Byss' gravity, obliterating the new Imperial throne world and taking the Emperor's command ship with it.</p>
<p>Based on the misconceptions regarding the length of the <i>Executor</i>-class Star Destroyer, it seems the <i>Eclipse</i> was initially intended by the writers to be about twice the length of the <i>Executor</i>. A <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">retcon</a> to reestablish this in the wake of the retconning of the length of the <i>Executor</i> to 19 kilometers from 8 kilometers may or may not be forthcoming. The shorter length remains visually consistent with the <i>Allegiance</i>-type vessels seen escorting <i>Eclipse</i> in the comic.</p>

<dd><i>Also known as the</i> Sovereign<i>-class Star Destroyer and</i> Sovereign<i>-class Super Star Destroyer</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The 15-kilometer-long <i>Sovereign</i>-class dreadnoughts are surpassed in size only by the <i>Eclipse</i>-class and <i>Executor</i>-class Star Dreadnought, though only two <i>Eclipse</i>- class SSD's were ever built, each to a substantially different design plan. The <i>Sovereign</i> is essentially a scaled-down version of the slightly larger <i>Eclipse</i>. It has fewer weapons, a slower hyperdrive, and carries a smaller complement of starfighters and crew. Designed to instill fear, the <i>Sovereign</i>-class ships were equipped with an axial superlaser designed to devastate a world. According to the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_End_Games_6225.html" title="West End Games">West End Games</a> RPG stats, the <i>Sovereign</i>-class boasted 500 heavy turbolaser cannons, 500 turbolaser batteries, 75 ion cannons, 100 tractor beam projectors, 5 <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity_well.html" title="Gravity well">gravity well projectors</a>, and carried 605,745 crew.</p>
<p>Only four <i>Sovereign</i>-class Star Dreadnoughts were laid down before Byss was destroyed: <i>Sovereign</i>, <i>Autarch</i>, <i>Heresiarch</i>, and <i>Despot</i>. None were fully completed and launched. Some sources suggest all were captured or destroyed by the New Republic within a year, but <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire%27s_End_94a2.html" title="Empire's End">Empire's End</a> appears to imply that they were destroyed when the Galaxy Gun projectile destroyed Byss, which their shipyards orbited.</p>
<p>Based on the misconceptions regarding the length of the <i>Executor</i>-class Star Dreadnought, it seems <i>Sovereign</i>-class ships were initially intended by the writers to be far larger than Darth Vader's infamous flagship.</p>
