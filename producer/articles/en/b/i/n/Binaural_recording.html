<p>Another Example of Binaural effect can be found in the Recordings made by Dallas Simpson which are used in the background of the Song "In Dulci Jubilo" Performed by "Swimming" on the Christmas charity record "It's not like Christmas". It's interesting how the background appears separate from the music (recorded by more conventional means) when listened to on earphones.</p>

<p>With a simple recording method, two microphones are placed seven inches (18cm) apart facing away from each other. This method will not create a real binaural recording. The distance and placement roughly approximates the position of an average human's <a href="../../../e/a/r/Ear_canal.html" title="Ear canal">ear canals</a>, but that is not all that is needed. More elaborate techniques exist in pre-packaged forms. A typical binaural recording unit has two <a href="../../../h/i/g/High-fidelity.html" title="High-fidelity">high-fidelity</a> microphones mounted in a <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dummy.html" title="Dummy">dummy</a> head, inset in ear-shaped <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molding_%28process%29.html" title="Molding (process)">molds</a> to fully capture all of the <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_frequency.html" title="Audio frequency">audio frequency</a> adjustments (known as <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head-related_transfer_function.html" title="Head-related transfer function">head-related transfer functions</a> (HRTFs) in the <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychoacoustics.html" title="Psychoacoustics">psychoacoustic research</a> community) that happen naturally as sound wraps around the human head and is "shaped" by the form of the outer and inner <a href="../../../e/a/r/Ear.html" title="Ear">ear</a>. The <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Neumann_GmbH_fe7e.html" title="Georg Neumann GmbH">Neumann</a> KU-81, and KU-100 are the most commonly used binaural packages. The <a href="http://gras.dk" class="external text" title="http://gras.dk" rel="nofollow">KEMAR</a> system is another alternative. The more expensive Aachen Head Acoustics unit does automatic equalization and processing to create a more enveloping experience. Other alternatives are the B&amp;K<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and the 01dB-Metravib<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> acoustic heads. The last one following exactly the IEC959 standard. A simplified version of this, called a <a href="../../../j/e/c/Jecklin_Disk_fdda.html" title="Jecklin Disk">Jecklin Disk</a>, used a 30 cm (11.81") acoustically-absorptive disk between the mics, as a compromise. Now the new Disk is 35 cm in diameter and has a spacing of the microphones of 36 cm. See Jecklin's paper at:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Jecklin's German from his script: "Zwei Kugelmikrofone sind mit einem gegenseitigen Abstand von 36 cm angeordnet und durch eine mit Schaumstoff belegte Scheibe von 35 cm Durchmesser akustisch getrennt." That means: Two omnidirectional microphones have a distance from one to another of 36 cm and a separation between them of a foam plated disk with a diameter of 35 cm.</p>
<p>Binaural "in-ear" microphones can be linked to a portable Digital Audio Tape (DAT) or MiniDisc recorder, bypassing the need for a dummy head by using the recordist's own head.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binaural_recording.html" title="Edit section: Playback">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Playback</span></h2>
<p>Once recorded, the binaural effect can be reproduced only using headphones. It does not work with <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monaural.html" title="Monaural">mono</a> playback; nor does it work while using loudspeaker units, as the acoustics of this arrangement distort the channel separation via natural crossfeed (an approximation can be obtained if the listening environment is carefully designed by employing expensive crossfeed cancellation equipment.)</p>
<p>The result is a listening experience that spatially transcends normally recorded stereo, since it accurately reproduces the effect of hearing a sound in person, given the 360° nature of how human ears pick up nuance in the sound waves. Binaural recordings can very convincingly reproduce location of sound behind, ahead, above, or wherever else the sound actually came from during recording.</p>
<p>Any set of headphones that provide good right and left channel isolation are sufficient to hear the immersive effects of the recording, and anyone who has even a cheap set of headphones can enjoy the recordings. As with any playback, higher quality headphones will do a better job of creating the illusion. Several high-end head set manufacturers have created some units specifically for the playback of binaural. <a href="../../../e/t/y/Etymotic_Research_0816.html" title="Etymotic Research">Etymotic Research</a>'s ER-4B canal phone actually sits inside the ear, much like a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearing_aid.html" title="Hearing aid">hearing aid</a>. The B model is tuned and equalized to enhance binaural playback. In addition, a number of headphone amplifier companies have created hardware that takes advantage of these special recordings. However, these in-ear-canal phones tend to suffer from poor externalization i.e. inside-head localization. It is also found that even normal headphones suffer from poor externalization, especially if the headphone completely blocks the ear from outside. A better design for externalization found in experiments is the open-ear one, where the drivers are sitting in front of the pinneae with the ear canal connected to the air. The hypothesis is that when the ear canal is completely blocked, the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiation_impedance.html" title="Radiation impedance">radiation impedance</a> seen from the eardrum to the outside has been altered, which negatively affects externalization.</p>
<p>There are some complications with the playback of binaural recordings through normal headphones. The sound that is picked up by a microphone placed in or at the entrance of the ear channel has a frequency spectrum that is very different from the one that would be picked up by a free-standing microphone. The diffuse-field head-transfer function, that is, the frequency response at the ear drum averaged for sounds coming from all possible directions, is quite grotesque, with peaks and dips of 10 <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decibel.html" title="Decibel">dB</a>. Frequencies around 5 kHz in particular are strongly attenuated as compared to side-presentation. If headphones were designed to have a flat response, then they would sound much too 'bright' when used to listen to stereo recordings and for this reason, most headphones are designed to have a notch around 5kHz. This can only ever approximate to a particular listener's ears, meaning that there can be no such thing as a 'flat' pair of headphones - they have to match the listener's ears, unlike speakers which aim to produce a flat free field response. For binaural listening though, the headphones need to have a flat response to the ear-canal entrance (not the eardrum) since it is at the ear-canal entrance that the recording microphones are placed. While it is in theory possible to equalise any headphones for a flat response at the entrance, a better approach is to use headphones designed without the notch in the first place.</p>
<p>The fact that most headphones are actually designed to have a notch in the 5kHz region is not widely understood, and this may have led to errors in the assessment of binaural recordings, since flat headphones are not normally available, and 'high quality' headphones incorporate the notch just like any others, though perhaps with a better approximation to that needed by the average ear. Male and female ears are of course different in size, and the outer ear gets bigger with increasing age, raising the possibility that most headphones are only really suited to young men. If headphones were designed to be flat, with a choice of equalisations available in headphone amplifiers, then headphone listening could be a more controlled experience, whether in binaural or stereo mode.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binaural_recording.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The history of binaural recording goes back to <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>. The first binaural unit was an array of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon.html" title="Carbon">carbon</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a> microphones installed along the front edge of the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palais_Garnier_bf04.html" title="Palais Garnier">Opera Garnier</a>. The signal was sent to subscribers through the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telephone.html" title="Telephone">telephone</a> system, and required that they wear a special head set, which had a tiny speaker for each ear.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novelty.html" title="Novelty">novelty</a> wore off, and there wasn't significant interest in the <a href="../../../t/e/c/Technology.html" title="Technology">technology</a> until around forty years later when a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_station.html" title="Radio station">radio station</a> began to broadcast binaural shows. Stereo radio had not yet been implemented, so the station actually broadcast the left channel on one <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency.html" title="Frequency">frequency</a> and the right channel on a second. Listeners would then have to own two radios, and plug the right and left ear pieces of their head sets into each radio. Naturally, the expense of owning two radios was, at the time, too much for a broad audience, and again binaural faded into obscurity.</p>
<p>Binaural stayed in the background due to the expensive, specialized equipment required for quality recordings, and the requirement of headphones for proper reproduction. Particularly in pre-<a href="../../../w/a/l/Walkman.html" title="Walkman">Walkman</a> days, most consumers considered headphones an inconvenience, and were only interested in recordings that could be listened to on a home stereo system or in <a href="../../../a/u/t/Automobile.html" title="Automobile">automobiles</a>. Lastly, the types of things that can be recorded do not have a typically high <a href="../../../m/a/r/Market_value.html" title="Market value">market value</a>. Recordings that are done in <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studio.html" title="Studio">studios</a> would have little to benefit from using a binaural set up, beyond natural crossfeed, as the spatial quality of the studio would not be very dynamic and interesting. Recordings that are of interest are live <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orchestral.html" title="Orchestral">orchestral</a> performances, and ambient "environmental" recordings of city sounds, nature, and other such subject matters.</p>
<p>The modern era has seen a resurgence of interest in binaural, specifically within the <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audiophile.html" title="Audiophile">audiophile</a> community, partially due to the widespread availability of headphones, and cheaper methods of recording. A small <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grassroots.html" title="Grassroots">grassroots</a> movement of people building their own recording sets and swapping them on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> has joined the very small collection of <a href="../../../c/d/_/CD_4170.html" title="CD">CDs</a> that one can find available for purchase. In February 2007, the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee_Symphony_Orchestra_9f7c.html" title="Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra">Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra</a> began to offer downloads of in-concert binaural recordings through its website.</p>
