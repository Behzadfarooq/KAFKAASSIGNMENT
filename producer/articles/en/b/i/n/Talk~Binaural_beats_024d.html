<hr />
<p>I'd like to encourage people to try out binaural beats, check out SBaGen for starters since it's free and just as good if not better than BWGen. Maybe more people will become interested and contribute, and use the binaural beats as well. I am hoping this will generate more interest, the potential is vast for this phenomenon.</p>
<p>I agree, it has a lot of potential. I'm currently photoreading about binaural beats while image streaming about lucid dreams and, wow!, it's a uniquely intense experience; after I finish this article and my book on neuro-linguistic programming, I am definitely adding binaural beats to my self-hypnosis tape.</p>

<dd>Hi, Army1987. You criticised the experiment that I referred to because, you said, it used inaudible beats. I'd like to correct you: only the first part of the experiment used inaudible beats. Later on, the experimenters tried using an audible binaural beat. They found no effect on EEG in either case. I admit that one study does not prove the case either way, but I think you were wrong to be so dismissive about it. Until someone does a better study, it's the only hard evidence we have. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHeron_606a.html" title="User:Heron">Heron</a> 20:14, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>Assuming I'm playing two sinewaves that are binaurally beating as normal, but I want to mix it with pink noise (or other sounds), does it matter whether or not the frequency of the noise is also offset in each speaker? If not, must the noise be mono or can it be stereo? - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 3 July 2005 21:02 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A pink noise has no specific frequency, it covers the whole frequency spectrum. I don't know wheter two indipendently generated pink noises in the two speakers are ok (I wouldn't even know how to try). If you use the same pink noise in both speakers you're sure the only difference between the two tracks is that of the sinewaves. Bwgen (www.bwgen.com) has the option of using two noises which are the inverse of each other, this gives the impression that the noise is generated inside the head. They say that can be unpleasant, and they don't say what its effects are.--<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 21:04, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To hear the sounds below 20Hz do we need special kind of headphones?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, any old pair of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereo.html" title="Stereo">stereo</a> headphones will do. They don't even need a good low-frequency response, since the low frequencies come from your head, not from the headphones.

<dd>If you mean beating rates below 20Hz, Heron is right. If you mean carrier frequencies below 20 Hz (as some commercial advocates of bin. beats propose, even if I think they're uneffective), you should use large headphones covering the whole ears with a good bass response, since earbuds have a very poor bass response (that's why many portable CD players have a bass-boost function; with earbuds you can hardly hear 30Hz sounds). I know that some commercial advocates of bin. beats sell special headphones designed to play sounds down to 4 Hz, but IMO you can't hear any sine wave below 15 Hz no matter how loud it is, so they're no use. --<a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmy1987_6a4c.html" title="User:Army1987">Army1987</a> 20:40, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Until now, the vast majority of brainwave entrainment has been through uncomfortable headphones or expensive goggles ...

In addition, many headphones sets are uncomfortable and can decrease the enjoyment a person derives from using brainwave entrainment products."</p>
<p>basically say you can achieve the same effect with mono speakers in the background while sleeping. uhm, im a little reluctant to believe that since...well i know nothing of this "new technology, not only do you not need to use headphones, but you don't even need stereo speakers."</p>

<dd>Any periodic repeating stimulus is believed to be able entrain brainwaves, even metronome clicks, if listened to enough long. (Well, in the case of metronome, the frequency would be &lt; 4 Hz, so unless you're used to meditating it won't be very effective because too much lower than your currend dominant frequency...) Maybe they wouldn't have the same effect as binaural beats because the latter are processed in another part of the brain.

OTOH, it seems bizarre to loudly advertise as non-neutral, i.e., "controversial", an article describing a 167 year old scientific observation that has never seriously been challenged. Binaural Beats are a laboratory repeatable and testable effect. The question is what the implications of Gerald Oster's 1973 discovery -- being able to "entrain your brain" -- might be, and it is in <i>that</i> area that there is controvery. Basically, within that branch of the subject is a religous "crusade of words" between scientific fundamentalists and new age loonies, with a secondary "snake-oil" profiteering angle added in. I'm certain there is a sane middle ground -- just as I am sure there are implications to being able to entrain brainwave activity -- but to find it, you do need to explain the controversy, not just label the entire subject "controversial." --150.216.181.54 13:08, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article stated that binaural beats seem to come from inside your head, and that's how you can tell them from a monaural sound. Actually, the reverse is true, because monaural sound lacks stereo spatialization clues, such as stereo time delays or frequency shift caused by the doppler effect. Because the binaural sound is stereo, it exhibits subjective stereo spread, causing the sound to be more enveloping. It doesn't appear to come from the center of your head at all. Rather, different source frequencies will exhibit different spatialization charactaristics as your brain attempts to decode the stereo spatialization clues and locate the source of the audio in 3D. <a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDilvie_59bd.html" title="User:Dilvie">Dilvie</a> 13:37, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
