<p>"Due to the way binoculars are made, the resulting ratio is the diameter of the final image on the oculars. For example, a 10x50 binocular produces a 5 mm image. For maximum efficiency, this image should match the diametor of the eye's pupil, which in dark environments grows to about 7mm. This ratio is also a measure of the brightness of the image. Thus, 10x50 and 8x40 binoculars have the same brightness, although the latter has a smaller image."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>♥</p>
<p>I find this somewhat confusing; if "a 10x50 binocular produces a 5 mm image" because 50/10 = 5, wouldn't an 8x40 binocular produce a 5 mm image because 40/8 = 5? The article says that the latter would be smaller. Could someone who knows something about binoculars clear this up for me?--[[User:HamYoyo|<a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamYoyo_060c.html" title="User:HamYoyo">HamYoyo</a>|<a href="../../../h/a/m/User_talk%7EHamYoyo_53a7.html" title="User talk:HamYoyo"><small>TALK</small></a>]] 20:48, Jul 2, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It was simply wrong. I fixed it. Jeff Albro</p>
<p>In a sense the 10x50 pair has the smaller image, since it's more magnified (narrower in field). In another sense it's the other way around - with less magnification, objects in the 8x40 pair will appear smaller (and this is probably what the original phrasing meant). Another difference is that the 8x40 pair gathers less light overall (35% less), which is precisely why the exit brightness is the same despite the wider-field, less magnified image. - <a href="../../../t/o/h/User%7EToh_d97d.html" title="User:Toh">toh</a> 04:13, 2005 Mar 4 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have added an external link to my page about choosing binoculars for astronomy, **www.nightskyinfo.com/binoculars. I think it provides useful information and is more comprehensive than most articles on the net. I think the external link to "Doctor Binoculars" **binoculars.com/help/pick_binoculars_learn.php should be removed, as it contains very little information and lots of advertisements. However, I let this decision to more experienced contributors. Later edit: i have removed the "Doctor Binoculars" link. (AstroMalasorte)</p>
<p>I've removed most of the extenal links, since they were little more than advertising. I've restored <i>one</i> link to opticsplanet.com, since at least that page has some semi-decent content. Feel free to change or revert, if you disagree. --<a href="../../../d/r/b/User%7EDrBob_cf29.html" title="User:DrBob">Bob Mellish</a> 18:14, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I removed the Opticsplanet link since if you check the contributor’s history you will see their sole purpose in life was to add Opticsplanet links (linkspam) to as many articles as they could on 30 different occasions. They have been continually spaming other articles under different IP's names. So spammer is as spammer does. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalfblue_1364.html" title="User:Halfblue">Halfblue</a> 01:44, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I really don't know how to edit, and don't want to touch the article myself, but there's at least one instance of "Porro" prism being changed to "Porno" which obviously doesn't look much like an accident, anyone mind fixing this so I don't have to break anything? Robinivich 17:02, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree about the comments regarding Dr. Binoculars from the Binoculars.com website. This was the only animated tutorial out there. It conveys numerous concepts in a visual manner that no other site does. I have added it back because I find it unique.</p>
<p>I have added an external link to my bird watching binoculars page, birdwatching-bliss.com/bird-watching-binoculars.html. It has very detailed information about birding binoculars and I have received comments from visitors thanking me for the info. I cover topics such as Magnification Eye Relief/Eye Cups, Objective Lens Diameter, Field of View (FOV), Exit Pupil, Lens Coatings, Prism Design Weight, Close Focus, Waterproofing, Ease of Focusing and Rubber Armorine.<br /></p>
<p>As i partly disagree with the removal of the external links in the manufacturer section by <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a>, i added internal links to the wikipages of the various manufacturers. The real bicky 09:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Am I the only one who thinks the title should be changed to "Binocular"? Even though there are two sets of lenses, the instrument itself is a binocular. "Binoculars" is actually plural. It's certainly acceptable in common usage to add the "s" to the end, so maybe this is okay here, but it occurs to me that an encyclopedia article should try to be as correct as possible. It's really not an issue for me, but I'm curious to see what everyone else thinks about it. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 16:24, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> - Binoculars is definately the correct title. Although it may seem plural, <i>binoculars</i> is a <a href="../../../n/o/u/Noun.html" title="Noun">noun</a> whereas <i>binocular</i> is an <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjective.html" title="Adjective">adjective</a>&#160;:-&gt; <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 12:00, 9 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not correct. "Binocular" is both an adjective and a noun. See <a href="http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/binocular" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/binocular" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=binocular" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=binocular" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Also, I don't know about other brands, but Bushnell never uses the word "binoculars" in their manuals. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 12:06, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Apologies but you appear to be correct - I've been mislead by common usage and [<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/binoculars" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/binoculars" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary</a>] [<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/binocular" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/binocular" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]. My <i>Webster Encyclopedic Dictionary</i> confirms that (in the US) binocular was correct (in 1952). Current Australian usage seems to be uniformly <i>binoculars</i>. Web searching seems to show that <i>binocular glasses</i> is a term in common usage - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 12:50, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, this whole article needs a carful revision. Too many repetitions and too focused on astronomical use, thus the obsession with large binos. Too many military images. I corrected some minor mistakes. ViM sept 4th, 2006</p>

<dd>I was just cleaning up some of the asto sections. It looks to me like all the astro stuff could be conglomerated under one heading "Astronomical use" or some such. It is a little spread out and confused right now. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalfblue_1364.html" title="User:Halfblue">Halfblue</a> 01:57, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be a distinct bias to astronomical use. I bet most binoculars are sold for use at sea - every ship and most boats have a pair or three. Most of those seem to be 7x50. The best are nitrogen filled, and equipped with a built-in compass and a scale for judging distances. I added one sentence about sea use of 7x50.</p>
<p>(Side note - this is what I have learned in Europe (Denmark and Finland) - do sailors elsewhere use other kinds???)</p>
<p>I have heard that the Finnish ice breakers don't use 7x50, but only 5x magnification, because of the vibrations of a heavy engine. On the other hand, there seems to be historical evidence of using monocular telescopes on sailing ships with magnifications of over 30x. Even without engine vibration, those must have been hard to use. (This may be too much detail for this article, I don't know - one of my first contributions to wikipedia...)</p>

<dd>I have seen binoculars specifically made for use at sea. They were of the 5x or 6x you noted above. The other attribute they had was very large prism sets combined with eyepieces designed to give generous eye relief. They were built that way to make them usable on a ship that is pitching and rolling and ships with high vibrations like you listed. That optical combination meant that you could see through them even when they were pitching and vibrating in relationship to your eye without the image Vignetting or going dark. Information like that may be usful in this article. Maybe this article needs to be devided up with futhar headings "Astronamical Use", "Naval use" ect 69.72.93.165 21:07, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section <b>"Choosing binoculars"</b> seems to be giving <b>advice</b> on <i>Choosing binoculars</i> which is in contradiction to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, specifically the concept "<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia articles should not include instructions or <b>advice</b> (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s.

There is a lot of "application" info floating in that section and in others that could be moved to a new heading <b>"Applications"</b>. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFountains_of_Bryn_Mawr_14c9.html" title="User:Fountains of Bryn Mawr">Fountains of Bryn Mawr</a> 20:03, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I cleaned up the article by rearranging the content and removing a lot of repetition.

<p>Perhaps someone with more knowledge about this topic can improve the parameters section? It's a bit sparse in terms of explanations.
