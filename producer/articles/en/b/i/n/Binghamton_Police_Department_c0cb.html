'Relief One' hours are 10:45pm to 6:45am, 'Relief Two' hours are 6:45am to 2:45pm, and 'Relief Three' hours are 2:45pm to 10:45pm. Each shift consists of 1 Captain, 1 Lieutenant, 3 Sergeants, several patrol officers, and 1 K-9 unit.</p>
<p>There are eight specifically designated zones the patrol officers cover. Those zones primarily consist of the west side, south side, east and north side, and downtown. The department still continues to utilize foot patrols.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Patrol Division handled over 77,000 calls for assistance.</p>
<p>The department's Detective Division is responsible for investigating all crimes that occur within the city. All units of the Detective Division are under the leadership of the Detective Captain. The Detective Division includes five subdivisions, Investigators (9 Investigators and 4 Supervisors), Identification Unit (4 specially trained Crime Scene Investigators), Juvenile Division (2 Investigators), Special Investigation Unit (7 Investigators and 2 Supervisors), and the Warrant Unit (1 Patrol Officer and 1 Supervisor).</p>
<p>In an effort to become more efficient in enforcing drug laws the Binghamton Police SIU joined forces with the Broome County Sheriff’s Special Investigations Unit in 2004 forming the <i>Special Investigation Task Force.</i></p>

<p>The department has an outstanding reputation of tough, well-trained, diligent police officers. In recent years, numerous police officers from other agencies have transferred into the Binghamton Police, some citing the department’s exemplary reputation as a reason for seeking transfer. Since 2000, the department has consistently hired at least 3 new recruit police officers each year, but has been known to hire many more in a single recruit class. Selection for new hirees is highly competitive and only the most qualified candidates become hired. Once hired, the recruit officer is put on strict probationary status for 1 full year. The recruit is then trained for 7 months at the Zone 6 Broome County paramilitary police academy located at the Broome County Sheriff's Office, where each officer becomes certified in firearms, first response, emergency vehicle operation, <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_force_continuum.html" title="Use of force continuum">use of force continuum</a>, defensive tactics, and other critical skills.</p>

<p>The Binghamton Police main headquarters is located on the first floor of the City Hall building. The department also has a substation located on the northside of the city, however, it is rarely utilized. At city hall, across the hall from the front entrance into the station itself, are offices of Police Administration, which includes Chief of Police, Assistant Chiefs, and a Captain in charge of Internal Affairs, as well as other civilian employees. Inside the station itself, is the main desk area where the desk lieutenant maintains constant supervision of the shift and the whereabouts and knowledge of the activities of all its officers. Police officers do paper work in the main desk area of the station.</p>
<p>The station houses dozens of barred holding cells capable of holding numerous prisoners. Holding cells for women are separate from that of the men separated by a hallway. The Detective Bureau, Traffic Office, Crime Prevention Unit, and Identification Unit are also located inside the station.</p>
<p>In the depths of the city hall building, only members of the Binghamton Police have access to several secure rooms and areas that are located in the basement of the building. There is a separate armory and firearm range, and a room for the S.W.A.T. team. There is also a large gym and locker room areas for men and women.</p>
