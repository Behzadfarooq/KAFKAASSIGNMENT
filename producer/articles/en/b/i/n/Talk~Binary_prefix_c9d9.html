<p>User:81.63.111.215 added the phrase "as well as nobi- and dogbi-", presumably based on the assumption that there are legitimate decimal-based prefixes nona- for 10<sup>27</sup> and dogga- for 10<sup>30</sup>. They are <i>not</i> <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_prefix_bab4.html" title="SI prefix">SI prefixes</a>, or at least NIST knoweth not of them. I'm perfectly prepared to be convinced of their existence, but I want to see <i>some</i> evidence that <i>some</i> recognized standards organization is promulgating them.

<dd>Well, ignoring the fact that some of those rates <b>are</b> powers of 2, what you'll actually find is that all of those rates are multiples of 8, as in 8 bits per byte/octet.</dd>
<dd>So the BYTE rates would be 4 KB/s, 5 KB/s, 6 KB/s, 7 KB/s, 8 KB/s, 12 KB/s, 14 KB/s, 20 KB/s, 24 KB/s, 28 KB/s, 32 KB/s, and 40 KB/s. You can see a more-rational progression in those MP3 encoding rates, right?</dd>

<dd>I think we've simply forgotten (over many years) that the "bit" is the base measurement of storage on a computer, not the "byte." A "byte" is a collection of bits, and a bit is not a division of bytes. Encoding rates for MP3s are expressed properly (128kb is 128,000 bits). This entire discussion is idiocy, to be perfectly frank, and the usage of "-bi" prefixes is only 'widespread' in that it is laughed out of facilities world-wide.</dd>
<dd>The improper use of "byte" as a base unit is akin to using the kilometer as a base unit of distance, then referring to "kilokilometers," "megakilometers," and "gigakilometers." The fact that "bits" are most often grouped into octets (or powers-of-two) is irrelevant, since this is not always so (witness 7-bit character encoding). Confusing the issue even more is the fact that hexadecimal is just behind binary in computing base-usage. (This began as a response to the MP3 rate listing, but if someone feels that it would be better relocated to another part of the discussion page, be my guest. I'm not even sure myself, at this point.) 68.166.26.220 09:42, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>"Drive manufacturers, including Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, market their drive capacities in terms of decimal capacity. In decimal 1 kilobyte (KB) is equal to 1,000 bytes, 1 megabyte (MB) is equal to 1,000,000 bytes, and 1 gigabyte (GB) is equal to 1,000,000,000 bytes. Operating systems and some software programs (fdisk, partitioning utilities, system BIOS, etc…) all view the drive capacity in terms of a binary capacity. In binary, 1KB is equal to 1,024 bytes, 1MB is equal to 1,048,576 bytes, and 1GB is equal to 1,073,741,824 bytes." <a href="http://www.hitachigst.com/hddt/knowtree.nsf/0/5d71892d940d874c86256fcb00774458?OpenDocument" class="external text" title="http://www.hitachigst.com/hddt/knowtree.nsf/0/5d71892d940d874c86256fcb00774458?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">Why does my hard drive report a lower capacity than what is on the drive’s label? (Hitachi)</a></li>
<li>"Note that the Maximum Capacity shows only 3099 MB instead of 3240 MB. This is because some system BIOSs recognize a Megabyte as 1,048,576 bytes (binary). Drive manufacturers recognize a Megabyte as 1,000,000 bytes (decimal)." <a href="http://www.hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/85256AB8006A31E587256A7D006ED4DB/$file/dtta_diweb.PDF#page=19" class="external text" title="http://www.hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/85256AB8006A31E587256A7D006ED4DB/$file/dtta_diweb.PDF#page=19" rel="nofollow">Hitachi</a></li>
<li>"This has to do with the way nearly every harddrive manufacturer in existance calculates hard drive size. They all define 1 gigabyte = 1,000,000,000 bytes instead of the 1 gigabyte = 1,073,741,824 bytes which it *really* is ...

<li>"Hard drive manufacturers define 1 gigabyte as exactly 1,000,000,000 bytes. By their definition, a 45BG hard drive is exactly 45,000,000,000 bytes.

<li>Wow, what an eccentric usage of the words <i>real</i> and <i>actually</i>. Anyway, it's not that simple. According to <a href="#Hard_disk_sizes" title="">#Hard disk sizes</a> above, Hitachi and Maxtor seem to use the hybrid 1 GB = 1000*1000*1024 B, and Quantum (out of business now) used 1 GB = 1024*1024*1024 B.</li>

<dd>“When a stream of data is stored, it's more logical to indicate how many thousands, millions, or billions of bytes have been stored versus how many multiples of 1024, 1,048,576, or 1,073,741,824 bytes have been.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>According to whom? The basic unit on all modern systems is 512 bytes (see <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_block_addressing.html" title="Logical block addressing">LBA</a>). It's more logical to indicate how many <i>blocks</i> (units of 512 bytes) have been stored.

<dd>I think you mean the <i>common</i> unit <i>of storage</i> in all modern <i>hard drives</i> is 512 bytes. Because CDROM and DVD drives have larger blocks and some tape drives have block sizes that can be set by the user to 32K, 64K, 128K, or even more. All that makes it even less logical to indicate how many <i>blocks</i> have been stored. But that's only assuming we're talking about the actual stored or streamed data, not the capacity. IMO, capacity is best expressed in decimal units and stored data is best expressed in binary units. Maybe the wording should make the distinction between capacity and the total size of the stored data. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 21:14, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This serves merely as a reflection of my own ignorance (and, judging by the wording of the last sentence, arrogance). I was evaluating the situation from the limited perspective of hard disk drives. However, I will postulate that it is still more logical to use units of 1024 rather than 1000 because blocks (however they are defined) are multiples of 512. (32K = 32,768 bytes = 512 × 64, for example.). I will similarly disagree with the assertion that stored data and capacity should be represented with different units, as that would be akin to representing the total distance of a journey and the distance already travelled, for example, with different units (i.e., not derived from the same basic definition—miles and kilometers, for example). And finally, punch cards are no longer in use and so should have little bearing on this argument.—<a href="../../../k/b/o/User%7EKbolino_eb99.html" title="User:Kbolino">Kbolino</a> 07:47, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with you that we <i>should</i> represent capacity and stored data size with the same standard, with one caveat: if Microsoft will agree to start reporting drive statistics in decimal terms. As long as the operating system reports drive stats in binary terms, we are stuck with the confusing standards. It's not logical to represent a file that is exactly 1,000,000 bytes in size as 976KB or .95MB, but that is in fact what we have and it's too late to go back. It's unfortunate that consumers trust Microsoft more than the hard drive manufacturers. But unless the hard drive guys rate drive size based on the worst-case-scenario (longest file name permitted by most liberal OS with a drive filled only with files smaller than the largest cluster size option), the consumer will ALWAYS get less storage than the capacity rating. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 22:57, 10 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Some facts to perhaps put an historical perspective on this:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The first disk drive the IBM 350 (1950's) had 5,000,000 100 6 bit characters organized in 100 character sectors. This predates the SI system.</li>
<li>In the 1960's virtually all disk drives used IBM's variable block length format (called, Count Key Data or "CKD"). Any block size could be specified up to the maximum track length. Blocks ("records" in IBM's terminology) of 88, 96, 880 and 960 were often used for obvious reasons. The drive capacity was usually stated in full track record blocking, for example, the 100 Megabye 3330 disk pack only achieved that capacity with a full track block size of 13,030 bytes.</li>
<li>CKD continued into the 1990's and perhaps into this day. In the 70's and 1980's most drives were offered with unformatted tracks (the unformatted capacity) with the particular block size and formatted capacity a function of the controller design. For example, the ST412 of IBM PC/XT fame had an unformatted capacity of 12.75 MB (not MiB) and with the Xebec controller and 512 byte sectors it formatted down to 10.0 MB (not MiB). Other controllers supported other block sizes resulting in other formatted capacities.</li>
<li>The advent of intelligent interfaces (SCSI and IDE) in the early 1990's took the block size decision into the drive and virtually all chose 512 bytes, for no reason other than that was what IBM had chosen when they picked the Xebec controller for the PC/XT.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So, until relative recently, it was very logical to measure in decimal numbers with decimal prefixes because God gave us 10 fingers and that's the system we learned and used until some bad GUI's took the system reported binary number and mispresented it in the mixed decimal number/binary prefix mess we are in. IMO, this history shows that there is no reason, other than sloppy programming, for the current misuse of SI prefixes and therfore there is no reason to use 512 byte blocks as a measure. As it turns out, this is a particularly bad size for current HDD technology and the industry will likely move to a larger size in the near future. While it is likely to be a binary size, this imminent change will futher make measuring in 512 blocks quite arbitrary.--Tom94022 04:34, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you think the sole reason for using a power of two sector size is that its what IBM happened to use then your knowlage of low level programming is severely lacking. power of two block sizes make sense all over computing because they allow use of efficiant bitwise operations rather than expensive modulo and integer division operations. Also standard paging based virtual memory systems would suffer very badly under a non power of two disk block size.</dd>
<dd>If and when drives move to a larger sector size (which i doubt will happen any time soon) i STRONGLY suspect it will again be a power of two. <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 18:59, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Supporting <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash's</a> point, it's worth noting that the sectors on a CD-ROM drive <b>are</b> larger and are still a power of 2: 2048 bytes. It's pretty clear that as long as computers operate on binary principles, all "multiples" of storage units in the system are likely to remain powers of two for reasons of economical processing of these addresses. I do note, though, that some historical disk/drum systems didn't implement sectors at all; you just had a collection of tracks and could read any contiguous set of storage units (words) (or even bits?) from a given track.</dd>

Since at least Windows 3 (probably Windows 1) Microsoft has consistently and without prominent explanation used the SI system of prefixes in a manner that is incorrect in accordance with the published industry standard for kilo, etc. On the other hand, most of the HDD industry has consistently used the SI system as specified since it was standardized in the early 1960's. Microsoft has the perfect right to define its own system of units but because they are virtually identical to the industry standard I submit Microsoft is obligated to prominently display it's deviant definition, say by putting information lines, e.g.<br />

<dd>in appropriate displays. Microsoft's failure to prominently display such information has caused real customer confusion such as when things don't fit or HDD's are not reported at their specified size.

Tom94022 - Please note that the "point" I was referring to was the question about the "Windows' File Properties window"; in other words, in the Windows operating system (as well as other operating systems, like Mac OS), the values have always been consistently expressed. Likewise, virtually all code written from the "early 1960's" has used the industry standard values; which came first, the software or the Hard Drive manufacturers? ;-) To answer your question, though, the HDD manufacturers have faqs because they are the ones who are confusing people (note that the HDD makers get sued for misrepresenting the values, not the software companies) :-)</dd>

But I agree with you that all present day OS's and their forefathers have consistently expressed file sizes using the inaccurate and technically incorrect definition of kilo, mega, giga, etc. But because of that, it is they who are the source of the confusion. Prior to spinning disks, there were streaming tapes, and even paper punch cards. Such storage media had capacities expressed with decimal prefixes, and the expression of those capacities could predate the software reporting of the capacity.</dd>
<dd>You also said, "<i>the HDD manufacturers have faqs because they are the ones who are confusing people (note that the HDD makers get sued for misrepresenting the values, not the software companies)</i>". That is a logical fallacy. Wheel barrel manufacturer "get sued" when some moron hurts someone because he strapped his wheel barrel to his truck and uses it as a trailer. Plastic bag manufacturers "get sued" when someone's child suffocates in their plastic bag. Ford "gets sued" when someone gets hurt or killed because an uninsured drunk driver runs a red light at 90 MPH and T-bones some innocent family in their Ford Escape. Using law suits to decide on whom to blame the binary prefix confusion is worse than those examples, and not just because they ARE frivolous and no one got harmed in ANY way. Try find a lawyer willing to sue Microsoft (which would be truly entertaining) because its OS misrepresents the true capacity of a new hard drive, not to mention the amount of drive space it pirates and doesn't report for things other than the storage of the actual data. If the industries reversed their respective definitions of Kilo and Giga, do you think anyone would sue the OS guys for making it seem as if a 10MB file only used 9MB of disk space? --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 17:10, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>U say "<i>all present day OS's and their forefathers have consistently expressed file sizes using the inaccurate and technically incorrect definition of kilo, mega, giga, etc.</i>" FWIW, I'm pretty sure DOS DIR never used prefixes at all and they were also not in the original FDISK's. Likewise I am pretty sure that many if not all UNIX variants have switches on commands which allow you to get capacity in decimal or binary strings, but I also think these are without prefixes. Furthermore, at the OS level I believe all you get is a string of digits (binary in most cases, decimal if switched), so it is when the OS reported capacity is converted to a GUI representation that the confusion occurs. To me it feels like sloppy programming - sort of like the meters to feet problem that caused a Mars probe to crash Tom94022 17:34, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I concede that the MS DOS FDISK and DIR commands probably never used prefixes, but I don't think that is a sufficient test to disqualify my statement (on which I would not have bet money). In the Windows lineage, other commands have reported sizes and capacities like the CHKDSK command. I only have bootable floppies going back to a DOS 3.x, and I have no interest in climbing through boxes of crap to verify it. Since the need to report KB diminishes as you go back in time, I'll change my earlier posit slightly to say that WHEN they used prefixes, all present day OS's and their forefathers used the inaccurate and technically incorrect definition for those prefixes. I qualify my definition of "OS" to include all the standard OS utilities like CHKDSK, SMARTDRV, SCANDISK, du, df, CATALOG, and the GUI that the OS publisher created for that OS, which obviously opens a large gray area, especially for the various Unixii. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 17:17, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some of the later FDISK's did include an information line (1M = 1,048, 576 bytes) but I think you will have to concede many CHKDSK's and SCANDISK's did not use binary prefixes. For intellectual curiosity, awhile ago, i went thru various DOS's (MS &amp; PC) on this very subject and I think I found most DOS command line utilities displayed decimal bytes without commas, or prefixes. It was painful, so I don't want to repeat the experience, but I did pull out my trusty MS-DOS Encyclopedia, (c) 1988 by Microsoft, and indeed the CHKDSK command reports in decimal digits without commas or prefixes; this corresponds to MS/PC DOS 3.3. I also ran my SCANDISK in Win2k and got a decimal digits without comma's presentation. Note that both Int 13H(hex) function 08H, BIOS "Get Current Drive Parameters" and Int 21H function 1CH System "Get Drive Data", return disk capacity as the product of several binary strings so some programmer had to convert binary strings into decimal numbers in order generate the CHKDSK and other displays in at the DOS level. Why they then chose to divide by binary numbers rather than just shift the decimal point is beyond me :-)Tom94022 20:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ahah. Maybe the blame goes a little deeper. Who were the BIOS writers who created the Int 13H/08H call and why did they output binary strings? Who decided on 512 byte cylinders and why? It was probably simpler and less computationally expensive to use 512 or 1024 and binary in general instead of 500 or 1000 because of the nature of binary processors. And maybe the conversion to Ki (bit or byte) took place at an earlier point in the execution sequence before the conversion to decimal. And no one was ever interested in correcting those first mistakes for fear of causing some serious cascade of subsequent required changes. "Why fix it if it ain't broken?" was probably spoken as proportionally often back then as it is today. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 21:03, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is likely that the decisions were made by Xebec controller firmware engineers and Microsoft BIOS / Device Driver firmware engineers, all under contract to and direction of IBM for the PC/XT (I seen to recall that IBM PC/XT BIOS was written by Microsoft not IBM). I suspect most of this programming was done in assembly languages, so that Hex notation made sense. Sectors sized in binary increments of bytes also makes sense for the same reason, 512 byte sector size, was probably in someone's estimation the Goldilocks number, not too big (1024) because of truncation of small files, not too small (256) because of sector overhead, just right :-). BUT, at the DOS level, for the most part Microsoft went thru the process of calculating disk size by doing a series of hex computations AND then translating the result into decimal units - thats what u see in CHKDSK, DIR, etc. No prefixes, no problems (other than the lack of comma's made reading hard). However with the advent of the Windows GUI, someone decided to take the same calculation of drive capacity, move the binary point (shift operation) and then convert to decimal for display using decimal prefixes to account for the shift. This is mathematically improper and the source of the confusion. The whole idea of SI was to eliminate conversion factors that are required when u have non-integrated systems of units but thats what these guys created when they did this. The only possible reason is that shifting is faster (and easier) than dividing, but we are talking about a fairly high level programming by the time we get to Windows GUI's - IMHO, there is simply no reason, other than sloppy programming, why they couldn't have converted the drive capacity calculated in Hex to decimal and then divided by the SI proper values to move the decimal point. I suspect they were oblivious to the problem they were creating, simply thinking that no one would care about the difference between 1,000,000 and 1,048,576 - it's only 4% Tom94022 20:36, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Libertas - The HDD manufacturers have consistently and properly used the SI Prefixes since they were defined in the 1960's well before Microsoft and Apple even existed. Furthermore, as near as I can tell the originally dominant software company, IBM, correctly used SI Prefixes in describing it's DASD (IBM term for what we now call HDD). Ditto for Digital HDD's (they may have fallen from grace with some early floppy products). Finally, Apple bought its disk drives from disk drive companies using SI prefixes in their specifications and contracts (still do :-). I bet Microsoft does the same in its game line. Therefore, I suggest:

<p>Let's talk about the consumer confusion section. I like the recent edit by Tom94022, but it still illustrates a recurring problem, though not a serious one, which is that editors are inserting their personal assumptions and speculations about <i>why</i> the binary prefixes were used or <i>why</i> they are still used.</p>
<p>I've been involved in the computer industry only since 1991, so I don't know what or even if hard drive companies, software companies, or memory companies had motives to their use of the SI prefixes. Since my involvement in the industry in a variety of roles including programming and quality assurance, I know with a little authority, that memory companies and Flash drive have no motivation to classifying their devices with the SI prefix whether the actual capacity is 2^30 or 10^9 bytes. It's that way because "it's always been done that way". If we produce a program that reports the size of a file, the remaining capacity of a drive, or the amount of installed physical system memory, it's always the SI prefix using the binary calculation. Over the years, I've attended numerous seminars, trade shows, and industry executive meetings, and from what I've gathered, the philosophy is pretty common. No one in the various computer product industries is working seriously to implement kibi, mebi, gibi prefixes because it would probably <i>add</i> to the consumer confusion and otherwise produce no significant benefit.</p>
<p>That's all anecdotal and speculative and I make no offer of proof. I fear the same is true for the following statements: a) "<i>the discrepancy could easily pass for manufacturing overhead</i>", b) "<i>manufacturers rapidly developed the capability to make much larger memory, and the discrepancy became increasingly difficult to ignore</i>", c) "<i>The confusion appears to relate to the advent of graphical user interfaces where there was not sufficient space to provide sufficient digits fully state capacity.</i>", d) "<i>some computer programmers were unaware that disk drive manufacturers used the SI notation when specifying and/or advertising capacity</i>"</p>
<ul>
<li>a. seems to imply a motivation. I've never heard of any evidence to support a motivation.</li>
<li>b. implies that manufacturers created the new prefixes to address a problem that was not theirs, and still have never used.</li>
<li>c. "appears" implies original research, but I don't think it was screen realestate that drove the use of prefixes. Think of the retail packaging for the 3.5" my next to last PC had, "3.5-inch 1,474,560 byte floppy disk". The last hard drive I bought would have needed a larger box just to fit the drive size in bytes. It's also just human-nature to use a shortening calculation and prefix to express really large numbers, so I think it's inaccurate and unfair to blame the confusion on the space limitations that may exist in some GUI's.</li>
<li>d. based on my own experience, this doesn't matter and needs some evidence since the programmers might just have likely felt that a megabyte <i>should</i> be 1024^2 and not 1000^2, regardless of what is being measured.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a lot of speculation in this section (but exclusively there), that could easily be misused. Instead of editing and waiting for the revert or new speculation, I think we should discuss it here first. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 22:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While it is true that since 1991 "it's always been done that way," it wasn't done that way in the 1960's or probably even the 1970's so there was a transition in the 80's and to the extent we can identify it we should. With regard to your comments on the sentances:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>a, &amp; b. - we agree, that led me to try to better edit this section.</li>
<li>c. We are talking about <b>consumer confusion</b> in this section. It is impossible to prove a negative but can anyone cite any significant such confusion with DOS, IBM MVS, DEC TOPS, UNIX or any other command line (pre-GUI) OS? Isn't it the GUI reported value differing from the manufacturers advertised value that leads to the consumer confusion? Perhaps we can word smith this sentence better, but the confusion does come out of this difference. BTW, I first became aware of the confusion in the late 80's at SyQuest when we started getting consumer complaints from Macintosh users that the 88 MB SyQuest cartridge was only 85 or so MB (as reported by Apple). The problem then appeared in the Windows world, as I recall with Windows 3.11 (it may have always been in Windows but until 3.11 the market was small).</li>

<dd>"<i>to the extent we can identify it we should</i>", therein lies the rub. You've certainly demonstrated a superior knowledge of the history, but without a reliable source to cite, it violates the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> guideline. The original sources of the confusion need proper citation? Even if you are one of the programmers of Windows 1.0 and you were involved in the meetings where the decision was made to called a megabyte 1024^2, it must be verifiable. Because, to take a counter position on phrase "c", one could speculate that the fact that the increase in consumer complaints about the discrepancy between rated MB capacity and GUI reported MB capacity is coincidental. GUI's are largely responsible for the increase in sales of computers and around the same time, drive sizes were reaching capacities that made the discrepancy more obvious. If PC's hadn't become so popular or drive sizes had remained relatively small, the amount of confusion would be less newsworthy. And let's not ignore the increase in frivolous litigation that drew even more attention to the discrepancy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's very likely that prior to the proliferation of GUI's, there was some program, a utility probably, that ran on DOS or Unix or some other non-GUI'd OS that presented the used space or free space of a disk or tape using the SI prefix and a binary calculation. Those programmers became the foundation for development at other companies that created early multitasking UI's, first text-based, then eventually graphical UI's. If you know different, WP considers it original research without verifiable reliable sources and without verifiable reliable sources, we have to be careful about what we say. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 17:31, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The various operating systems speak for themselves and in that sense what I am stating is a compilation which is not a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> guideline. I can speak from direct experience with IBM MVS and IBM DOS, MSDOS, PCDOS, all flavors of Microsoft Windows, some UNIX and some Macintosh. I have less experience with CPM and several Digital OS's. While your speculative "program, a utility probably, that ran on DOS or Unix or some other non-GUI'd OS" may exist it was likely obscure enough to not cause any consumer confusion. In fact since we are talking about "consumer confusion" aren't we really just talking about the transition from MS/PC DOS to Windows (and perhaps Apple DOS to Macintosh OS), since most if not all of the other OS's are arguably not consumer products. I agree with you that why Microsoft and Apple chose M = 2^20 for storage is not relevant, but the fact that Microsoft did so in changing from command line to GUI and thereby displayed a number different from that provided by the storage manufacturer is the source of the confusion to 95% of the consumers.Tom94022 20:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I think phrase c and what you said above ("<i>since we are talking about "consumer confusion" aren't we really just talking about the transition from MS/PC DOS to Windows</i>") implies some causal connection, that calls for a citation. I think if Windows or any other GUI had never gained traction, drive sizes would have probably driven a change to abbreviated byte counts. It's still primarily Microsoft and Apple's fault for the extent of the confusion, but I think it's not the transition to GUIs that is the cause. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 03:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Personally, to refresh my recollection, I spent a few hours several months ago actually booting up various MS/PC DOS's from 2.11 thru 5, Win 3.11 and Win 95. Can we agree that the source of confusion is the OS's presentation to consumers of storage capacity with prexfix's that absent explanation appear to be SI prefixes? Then doesn't the earliest of such presentations mark the beginning of confusion? The various MS/PCDOS utilities relating to storage, DIR, SCANDISK, CHKDISK, FDISK basically did not use prefix's. Apple DOS did not handle HDD's. Macintosh used K from the beginning and Windows used K and M at least as early as Windows 3.11.

I think this confusion is more relative to the binary prefix and not specifically to megabyte. Someone, somewhere, was probably confused why their 360KB 5.25" floppy could not store a 355KB file, or something similar.

<p>"However, with amounts of computer memory these prefixes were often abused to denote the nearby powers of two..."</p>
<p>The word "abused" in that statement appears biased. It would seem that saying "However, with amounts of computer memory, an alternate usage of these prefixes arose denoting the nearby powers of two..." (or something along that lines) would be a lot more neutral.</p>

<p>We should really find as much as we can about the origins of the terminology. I contacted John Reed a while ago — one of the people who worked on the Intel 1103, the first 1k <a href="../../../d/r/a/DRAM_ebae.html" title="DRAM">DRAM</a> — and he said:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>Of course, "Kilo" originated in the metric system, which dates back long before there were RAMs. Before the RAM itself, "kilo" was used for example, to describe a 1,000 ohm resistor: it was a "1K" or I Kilohm resistor. "K" took a sort of special meaning in the binary-based digital world of the RAMs, as it came to represent 1,024 (2^10) instead of 1,000. So the 1K 1103 had 1,024 bits, or a kilobit. Extending that to bytes? Who knows when, but it's not rocket science to see how it would have been a natural followon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I updated the history section to try to capture this idea, though it's going to be hard to find real references for any of this, since it really didn't matter enough to note at the time. It's actually a correct approximation for the small numbers of kilobits available in the first chips, but it became a casual usage and then an incorrect usage as memory sizes increased over time. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 00:50, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I undid Omegatron's edit because I think it is somewhat incorrect. Most of the pre 360 computers that I've looked at did not have binary multiple word width or depth, some even weren't binary :-). Binary width and depth certainly existed with System/360 but the IBM product literature I've seen didn't use k. Gene Amdahl did use it with a k=1024 qualification in his seminal article. I'm not sure there is any particular reason for core planes to be binary since they don't have any particular pin limitation that sort of drives IC's. Tom94022 04:55, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It's a numeral system limitation more than a pin limitation. In any case, Omegatron's edit addressed early memory planes, not early computers, and he seems to have reasonable evidence to support his edit. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Britt_4d56.html" title="User:Matt Britt">mattb</a> <code>@ 2007-03-18T05:01Z</code></dd>

<dd>I see no evidence, just an unsupported opinion - do you think a Williams tube had a binary addressing scheme? How about a mercury delay line or a drum, all of which were memory systems in early computers. The statement "...memory sizes, which are <b>always</b> powers of two." absence substantiation is POV which has no place herein.</dd>
<dd>BTW, Dr. Wang's seminal core patent, 2,708,722 (1955) makes no mention whatsoever about binary addressing.</dd>
<dd>And quoting from the IBM305 General Information Manual, 1960, about a very successful system first shipped circa 1954:
<dl>
<dd>The main memory was drum storage, its capacity is stated as:
<dl>
<dd>"Each drum track has a capacity of 100 character positions. Positions are numbered from 00 to 99, sequentially around the drum."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This was the first system with a hard disk drive, its capacity is stated as:
<dl>
<dd>"The capacity of the basic file, 5,000,000 characters, may be recapped as follows:
<dl>
<dd>50 disks X 100 tracks per disk = 5,000 tracks</dd>
<dd>5,000 tracks X 10 records per track = 50,000 records</dd>
<dd>50,000 records X 100 characters per record = 5,000,000 characters</dd>
<dd>...The first file and/or the attached file can be of 5,000,000 or 10,000,000 character capacity to provide the system with a total of 5, 10, 15, or 20 <b>million</b> character storage capacity."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>BTW, the drive characters were 6 bit :-) There isn't a single binary number in either memory or storage! I'm going to wait for comment, but Omegatron's edit is clearly wrong in light of the above and needs to be fixed. Tom94022 21:01, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're confusing memory with hard storage. Hard drives have consistently been measured in decimal units since they were first invented. Memory is always made in powers of two because of addressing, though. The weird binary usage of SI prefixes came about because of memory sizes. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 21:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm confusing nothing - you are misstating history. As one example, please see the RAMAC computer system above, it's memory WAS NOT sized in binary units, the manuals can be found at the RAMAC restoration project website<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup>. The fact that it's main storage happened to be a drum is an historical fact. There were many such drum machines and other machines using other technologies, none of which were inherently binary. I seem to recall even some BCD machines, in which everything was power of 10. Some of them might even have used core memoryTom94022 21:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I put a {fact} on the 360/30 core memory addition since this appears to me to be a current (2007) description and not how this memory plane was described in 1964 or whenever it was sold by IBM. Shouldn't we be careful to assure that all our quotes are time period appropriate? On a broader subject, isn't the issue really when did the OS's start using prefixes in a Binary Sense? Most of what we have below is evidence that there is no reason to use prefixes in a binary sense since these examples of main storage were not binary in nature.Tom94022 16:01, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Early drum and disk storage devices only held relatively small amounts of data, and were specified by the number of characters or words they could hold instead of bits or bytes. Sometimes this was a binary-based number, depending on what the computer was intended to do. See <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_IBM_disk_storage_b7e7.html" title="Early IBM disk storage">Early IBM disk storage</a>.

<p>I'm not sure but I think all of the patent sources u are using are only completely full text back to about 1975 and somewhat spotty there after (this applies to USPTO and Delphion). This does raise a question of in inadvertent bias in this survey. I do have access to a full text IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin which is full text back to 1958. FWIW, a quick check shows very little usage of kilobyte, kbyte, 64k, 128k, 256k or 1M until the late 1960's. When i have some time I think i will do some histograms as perhaps a way to illustrate the adoption.Tom94022 03:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
