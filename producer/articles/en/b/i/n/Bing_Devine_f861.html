	    <p><b>Vaughan Pallmore "Bing" Devine</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> - <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_27.html" title="January 27">January 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>) was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> front office executive for the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Mets_19ff.html" title="New York Mets">New York Mets</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>. In the prime of his career, as a <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_manager_%28baseball%29.html" title="General manager (baseball)">general manager</a> - the executive who is responsible for all baseball operations - Devine was a major architect of four <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a> champions and three <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> champions in the six years between 1964 and 1969.</p>
<p>Specifically, Devine served as general manager of the Cardinals from November 1957 through August 1964, and was directly responsible for putting the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_World_Series_d9e0.html" title="1964 World Series">1964 world champion Cardinals</a> on the field (even though he had been fired with six weeks remaining in the season, one of the most bizarre events in baseball annals). Many of the players Devine acquired led the Cardinals to the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967_World_Series_d9b7.html" title="1967 World Series">1967 world title</a> and the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_World_Series_461d.html" title="1968 World Series">1968 NL championship</a>, the latter occurring on Devine's watch during his second tour (1968-78) as St. Louis general manager. In between those terms, from 1965-67, Devine was assistant to the president, and then president (and <i>de facto</i> general manager), of the Mets, where he helped put together the organization that would turn the franchise from baseball's laughingstocks to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969_World_Series_f35f.html" title="1969 World Series">1969 world champions</a> as the "Miracle Mets." During the 1980s, he also served as president of the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Cardinals_c8e5.html" title="Arizona Cardinals">St. Louis football Cardinals</a> of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a>.</p>
<p>Devine was born in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>, and attended the city's University City High School and <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_University_f91e.html" title="Washington University">Washington University</a> before joining the Cardinals in the late 1930s. As pioneers of the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farm_system.html" title="Farm system">farm system</a> concept, the Cardinals had as many as 40 affiliated or owned teams in their <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_league_baseball.html" title="Minor league baseball">minor league</a> system before <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. With time out for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">U.S. Navy</a> service during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Devine rose rapidly through the ranks as a business manager of Cardinal farm teams, finally becoming the general manager of the AAA <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochester_Red_Wings_0f82.html" title="Rochester Red Wings">Rochester Red Wings</a> of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_League_5797.html" title="International League">International League</a> in 1949. After six seasons at the helm of the Redbirds' top farm team, he joined the St. Louis front office in the autumn of 1954. The Cardinals, recently purchased by brewery magnate <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gussie_Busch_d7c9.html" title="Gussie Busch">August "Gussie" Busch</a>, were in rebuilding mode under trade-happy general manager "Frantic" <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Lane_d866.html" title="Frank Lane">Frank Lane</a>. The team finished second in the NL in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957_in_baseball.html" title="1957 in baseball">1957</a>, but Lane had worn out his welcome; he moved on to run the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> and was replaced in St. Louis by the steady hand of Devine.</p>
<p>Devine began to add talent and depth to the St. Louis roster - including <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> players. In the first five years of his reign, he traded for or promoted players such as <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Gibson_cd41.html" title="Bob Gibson">Bob Gibson</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28baseball%29_c61e.html" title="Bill White (baseball)">Bill White</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Flood_c175.html" title="Curt Flood">Curt Flood</a>, and <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julian_Javier_421f.html" title="Julian Javier">Julian Javier</a>. But the Cardinals were mired in the middle of the pack of a very powerful National League. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963_in_baseball.html" title="1963 in baseball">1963</a> - a season also marked by the final campaign of the Cardinals' longtime superstar, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Musial_59e8.html" title="Stan Musial">Stan Musial</a> - the Redbirds surged into contention, sparked by the acquisition of <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortstop.html" title="Shortstop">shortstop</a> <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Groat_467b.html" title="Dick Groat">Dick Groat</a> from the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Pirates_22c6.html" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, 18-win seasons from <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcher.html" title="Pitcher">pitchers</a> Gibson and <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernie_Broglio_bb73.html" title="Ernie Broglio">Ernie Broglio</a>, the comeback of lefthanded starter <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Simmons_bf6e.html" title="Curt Simmons">Curt Simmons</a> (who had been signed off the scrap heap by Devine), and the strong rookie campaign of <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catcher.html" title="Catcher">catcher</a> <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_McCarver_072d.html" title="Tim McCarver">Tim McCarver</a>, promoted from AAA. The Cardinals challenged the eventual world champion <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> into mid-September before finishing second, the club's highest showing since '57.</p>
<p>However, when the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_in_baseball.html" title="1964 in baseball">1964</a> season began, the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> took a stranglehold on first place. The Cardinals were trying a variety of young players in Musial's old left-field position, and none were taking hold. At the trading deadline - June 15, 1964 - Devine sprung. The second-division <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> had a 25-year-old <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outfielder.html" title="Outfielder">outfielder</a> with great speed, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Brock_e26f.html" title="Lou Brock">Lou Brock</a>, who was not living up to his projected potential. Devine offered the Cubs his 18-game winner from the previous year, Broglio, plus outfielder Doug Clemens and pitcher <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Shantz_5a91.html" title="Bobby Shantz">Bobby Shantz</a> for Brock and two marginal pitchers. The Cubs agreed, and one of the most significant (and one-sided) trades in baseball history was made. Brock would hit .348 for the remainder of the season, and would lead the Cardinals to their three pennants and two world titles over the next five years. He would play the rest of his career with St. Louis (retiring in 1979), <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">steal</a> 938 bases (breaking <a href="../../../t/y/_/Ty_Cobb_62bb.html" title="Ty Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>'s record), currently second all-time (to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rickey_Henderson_b963.html" title="Rickey Henderson">Rickey Henderson</a>), and become a member of the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_4e80.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<p>Ironically, Brock's impact on the Cardinals was not felt immediately. The team continued to trail the Phillies by a large margin and it looked to all as though the club's pennant drought would extend to 18 years. Owner Busch was bitterly disappointed, and decided in the middle of August to clean out his front office. On the advice of his special assistant, legendary <a href="../../../b/r/a/Branch_Rickey_9adb.html" title="Branch Rickey">Branch Rickey</a>, Busch fired Devine and business manager Art Routzong, and accepted the resignation of assistant general manager <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Stanky_8134.html" title="Eddie Stanky">Eddie Stanky</a>. Manager <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Keane_fd93.html" title="Johnny Keane">Johnny Keane</a> was to be fired at the end of the season, to be replaced (it was rumored) by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Durocher_6d08.html" title="Leo Durocher">Leo Durocher</a>. Meanwhile, Devine's old job went to Rickey protege <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Howsam_e0f0.html" title="Bob Howsam">Bob Howsam</a>. But as events unfolded, Busch had acted in haste. The Cardinals began to win, while the Phillies suffered an epic September collapse, losing a 6½-game lead with a dozen games to play, sparking a wild, four-team, 11th hour scramble for the pennant. On the final day of the season, after sweeping the Phillies to take first place, the Cardinals prevailed, clinching the NL championship for the first time since 1946 by beating the lowly Mets after losing the first two games of the series. Led by Gibson, the undisputed ace of the staff since Broglio's trade, and McCarver, the Cardinals then defeated the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> in a seven-game World Series.</p>
<p>Devine's departure was a cause-celebre in St. Louis, but the damage had been done. Although he landed on his feet as the successor to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Weiss_%28baseball%29_4af3.html" title="George Weiss (baseball)">George Weiss</a>, president of the Mets, Devine was forced to leave his hometown and the only team he had ever worked for at the pinnacle of his career. But, while Devine never moved his family to New York, he tackled his new job with gusto. On his watch, the Mets began to strengthen their farm system, signing and developing young pitching talent: <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Seaver_57ac.html" title="Tom Seaver">Tom Seaver</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Koosman_1b45.html" title="Jerry Koosman">Jerry Koosman</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/l/Nolan_Ryan_8b27.html" title="Nolan Ryan">Nolan Ryan</a>, and others. Meanwhile, Howsam left the Cardinals in January 1967 to become general manager of the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> and Musial was named his successor.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967_in_baseball.html" title="1967 in baseball">1967</a>, the Cardinals won 101 games and ran away with the National League race, winning the pennant by 10½ games and beating the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> in a seven-game World Series. The core of the team was Devine's, but Howsam had contributed significantly to the roster with his 1966 acquisitions of NL <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award_8b7f.html" title="MLB Most Valuable Player Award">MVP</a> <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_baseman.html" title="First baseman">first baseman</a> <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando_Cepeda_cdca.html" title="Orlando Cepeda">Orlando Cepeda</a> and right fielder <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Maris_9af0.html" title="Roger Maris">Roger Maris</a>. At the other extreme, the Mets - most of their young pitching talent still ripening in the minors - lost 101 games and finished dead last. Baseball people took note of Devine's accomplishments in New York, however, and when Musial, a world champion general manager in his maiden season, decided he did not want to continue in the role, owner Busch reached out to Devine, secured his release from the Mets, and brought him back to St. Louis as executive vice president and general manager.</p>
<p>In 1968, led by Gibson's all-time record 1.12 <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_run_average.html" title="Earned run average">earned run average</a>, the Cardinals repeated as NL champions and held a three games to one lead in the World Series against the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>, but lost the final three contests to be denied back-to-back world titles. Devine was faced with retooling an aging roster. While Brock and Gibson would remain from the glory years, the Cardinals traded Flood, Cepeda, and McCarver during <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969_in_baseball.html" title="1969 in baseball">1969</a> in their bid to get back to the top; in the Cepeda trade, Devine acquired <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Torre_91cc.html" title="Joe Torre">Joe Torre</a>, would win the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971_in_baseball.html" title="1971 in baseball">1971</a> NL <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batting average</a> championship. But the Cardinals suffered long-term damage when Devine was ordered by Busch to trade star lefthanded pitcher <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Carlton_0f54.html" title="Steve Carlton">Steve Carlton</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_in_baseball.html" title="1972 in baseball">1972</a> after a contract dispute. Carlton, just entering his prime, was sent to the Phillies for pitcher <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Wise_fa64.html" title="Rick Wise">Rick Wise</a>, an uneven swap that would turn the last-place Phillies into contenders in the late 1970s. Meanwhile, the Cardinals became NL East also-rans.</p>
<p>In 1978, Devine once again was replaced as Cardinals' general manager (this time by John Claiborne) and again he departed the organization, working for the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Nationals_035f.html" title="Washington Nationals">Montreal Expos</a> as a player development official and the Phillies as a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scout_%28sports%29.html" title="Scout (sports)">scout</a>. From 1981-86, he was club president of the St. Louis football Cardinals (now the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Cardinals_c8e5.html" title="Arizona Cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>) of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a>. But eventually he returned to baseball and the baseball Cardinals, where he served as a special scout and advisor to the current general manager, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Jocketty_8366.html" title="Walt Jocketty">Walt Jocketty</a>.</p>
<p>Devine died in St. Louis at the age of 90 <a href="http://sportsline.com/mlb/story/9957968" class="external autonumber" title="http://sportsline.com/mlb/story/9957968" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
