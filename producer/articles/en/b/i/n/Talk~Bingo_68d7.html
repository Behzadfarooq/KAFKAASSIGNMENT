<dd>The proposal is to keep the dab page but move it to <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bingo.html" title="Bingo">Bingo</a> which is now a redirect.

<li><b>Oppose</b> Bingo is most commonly known as the lottery game.

<li><b>Support</b>. Unless I'm misunderstanding this I see no reason "Bingo" should redirect to "Bingo (disambiguation)", so just delete/redirect the disambiguation page to "Bingo". <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 21:11, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> I support the first proposal laid out below.

<li><b>Oppose</b> — Bingo, although American specific, is played with specific rules and — although similar in concept — is a <i>different</i> game than other chance games using numbers elsewhere in the world. A brief mention of those differences (with links) can easily be incorporated into the articles for Bingo and the other number-based chance game articles (e.g., <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housie.html" title="Housie">Housie</a>).

<li><i>Bingo is most commonly known as the lottery game.</i>
<ul>
<li>That's a regional perspective. That's why the dab page should be at <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bingo.html" title="Bingo">Bingo</a> and not an article. The dab makes this all clear and does not flavor anything with a regional perspective. Having the redirect there would be better then replacing with any kind of an article that is not a dab. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 20:54, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Simple. Bingo is a game played with balls that are used to call out numbers that you mark on a card. Get 5 in a row and you win. Until I looked at the dab article I did not know there were other uses. So, my perspective is regional (US) and yours is also for another region. That's why the dab should be located at <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bingo.html" title="Bingo">Bingo</a>. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 21:07, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>So we seem to agree that the game is the most common use for the term Bingo. Is there an English-speaking region where Bingo predominantly means something else? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:19, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't see much to discuss about the proposal. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">User:Trialsanderrors</a> all that is being suggested is to put the content on the Bingo URL instead of the Bing (disambiguation) URL which it redirects to now. Tweaking the content of said page is a different discussion, but Bingo is a common term that should be on the correct URL where it would be looked for. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 21:14, 26 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand that. I oppose it because <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bingo.html" title="Bingo">Bingo</a> should be an entry that highlights the commonalities of the regional variants of the game. It should contain a dab header to Bingo {disambiguation), which should be left as it is. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:19, 26 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If there are multiple variation articles, then the link should be a dab page so that the user can select the correct article and not find an article that is not the one being looked for. I see no reason why an article like Bingo variations could not exist to explain the differences between the various forms of the ball game or the lottery game. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 21:30, 26 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No it shouldn't. If the variances are minor (as they are) it is not readily apparent to a reader which entry leads to which variant of the game, and a simple dab page can't provide those details. It's also redundant to re-tell the core of the rules on each separate regional page. Hence the need for a central summary article which is best located at <a href="../../../b/i/n/Bingo.html" title="Bingo">Bingo</a>. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:37, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Sounds like the proposal from <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> below could be the correct way to go since the game is the most likely usage of the word on its own. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 22:44, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Bingo</b> is a popular game of chance played under slightly different rules in the US and the UK. In OZ and NZ, the UK version is played under the name Housie. Bingo is also closely related to other games played worldwide, such as <a href="../../../l/o/t/Loteria.html" title="Loteria">Loteria</a> in MX.</p>
<p>Then <b>Rules</b> section, then <b>US Bingo</b> section, then <b>UK Bingo/Housie</b> section, then <b>Other Variants</b> section, all with "Main article" headers where applicable.

<dd>That certainly could be fine too, but... *are* there common rules? I mean, don't Bingo/US and Housie have different rules? (I don't know). I'd be glad to see an example of what you suggest: a smallish Bingo article that points to other bingo articles and links to the disambig page for the dog/song, etc. However I'm not sure it could be pulled off since if you start talking about rules you might as well just put the Bingo US article on Bingo and link to Housie and other things from it. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 21:59, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From all I can tell they only differ in grid size and some calling routines.

<dd>I support first proposal set down by <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">Trialsanderrors</a> (A small generic article linking to the disambiguation page and the various types of bingo and related games). A lot can be said about the culture, economics, history etc. of bingo in the UK, and I am therefore for a separate article. It is not just the game itself, but the phenomenon surrounding the game which is my reason for wanting to keep the UK Bingo/Housie separate from the US game. I'm against Bingo US being the main article, as Bingo UK/Housie has just as much reason to be so. I realise this discussion took place over 6 months ago but, in any case, no action has yet been taken. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadeinsane_401e.html" title="User:Madeinsane">Madeinsane</a> 19:39, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As no action has yet been taken, and no exact consensus has been reached, I have drawn the attention of users participating in similar talks on <a href="../../../h/o/u/Talk%7EHousie_d267.html" title="Talk:Housie">Talk:Housie</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/n/Talk%7EBingo_%28US%29_421e.html" title="Talk:Bingo (US)">Talk:Bingo (US)to</a> this, more central, discusson, and put relevant banners on the pages.

<p>I would argue that, in the UK in particular, something more significant than differences in game play, is that bingo has developed into a common passtime with a national identity, glamourised by a change in marketing strategy and popularised by comedians (such as in, <i><a href="../../../t/h/a/That_Peter_Kay_Thing_cdfe.html" title="That Peter Kay Thing">That Peter Kay Thing</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/a/That_Peter_Kay_Thing_cdfe.html#Eyes_Down" title="That Peter Kay Thing">Eyes Down</a></i>) and as such could be discussed as a cultural phenomenon not relevant to any other part of the world. Some of the content already conatained in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housie.html" title="Housie">Housie</a> article, such as the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housie.html#Business_Aspect" title="Housie">business aspect</a> section is also relevant to this modern phenomenon, and should not be included in any generic article. Some other cultural aspects such as <i><a href="../../../h/o/u/Housie.html#Calling_nicknames_.28UK_Bingo.29" title="Housie">calling nicknames</a>, but particularly their <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housie.html#Usage_of_Bingo_nicknames_in_the_UK" title="Housie">usage</a> and the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housie.html#Trivia" title="Housie">trivia</a> section are also particularly relevant to this modern phenomenon.</i></p>
<p>My suggested solution therefore is closest to option (a) <a href="../../../b/i/n/Talk%7EBingo_%28disambiguation%29_418e.html#Overview" title="Talk:Bingo (disambiguation)">above</a>:</p>
<table class="wikitable">
<tr>

<p>There would be no additional articles unless they could be justified for reasons such as those I have argued above in the case of the UK.<br />

<dd>The considerations listed in the first para of this section seem to me to imply that there should be separate articles for the regional variants. The games are quite different, the atmosphere in the halls is different, the terms are different. Furthermore, the original omnibus article got confusing, as the subject switched back and forth repeatedly from US-style bingo to UK-style. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_FitzGerald_1eab.html" title="User:John FitzGerald">John FitzGerald</a> 01:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree, the original generic article was confusing, but the current layout with two articles linked from a disambiguation page could be very off-putting for users who are unfamiliar with basic game rules, let alone regional differences. The problem is that the games do have a lot in common in terms of their shared histories and basic rules (see overview <a href="../../../b/i/n/Talk%7EBingo_%28disambiguation%29_418e.html#Overview" title="Talk:Bingo (disambiguation)">above</a> for examples); and the amount of content repeated over the two articles only serves to emphasise this point. Also in one club I worked in in the UK, we played "American Bingo", with a 5x5 ticket, in addition to the ordinary 3x15 ticket. The biggest differences are therefore not in game play, so a generic article could more effectively highlight these differences and similarities. If a separate article is needed to explain atmosphere etc, then this could be developed later, if there is enough content. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadeinsane_401e.html" title="User:Madeinsane">Madeinsane</a> 14:29, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As there hasn't been much objection over the issue this time round I'm going to go ahead with the merger of the two pages as I explained above. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadeinsane_401e.html" title="User:Madeinsane">Madeinsane</a> 06:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was pointed towards your article about bingo by the BBC and would like to let you know that UK bingo has very different antecedent to the US game. As one of your corespondents noted bingo in the UK has a particular and significant cultural aspects that the commercial game has not destroyed in the way that has occurred in the US. The British game also has a long history and is part of a continuing tradition of random numbers games played by the British, especially by working class women. I think what would be best is an article on bingo that had a separate section on the history and culture of British bingo.Carolyn Downs 12:03, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The whole shebang is fairly static and will hardly ever require any serius updates. It is not that yankee bingo and pommie bingo require frequent work, which could be halve by amalgamation.</p>
<p>I have just used it and was happy with it just the way it is. No mental work needed for sorting out terms and abberations, etc.. Just simply reading the article and getting the idea.</p>
<p>Don't waste any energy here - look for typos if need be. Wikipedia has tons of them to offer&#160;;) Shout out loudly "Bingo!" once you have found one. <a href="../../../o/a/l/User%7EOalexander-En_1c6c.html" title="User:Oalexander-En">Oalexander-En</a> 15:12, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
