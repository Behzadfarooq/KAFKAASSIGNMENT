<p>I am wondering if this article is nonsense. My only knowledge of bindis is from Bollywood movies, but ... how is a bindi different from the smudge that people (male and female) get on their foreheads when they visit a temple, or are received as a guest and get smudged from the tray of flowers and lights symbolizing welcome? I dunno if the yoga, ayurvedic, third eye stuff is generally believed, or if the bindi is just a mark either saying "I've been through a religious ceremony" (like Ash Wednesday) or "this is my belief". Don't different shapes and colors of bindis give off different social messages? And how is a bindi related to the three white marks that South Indian Shivaites wear on their foreheads?</p>
<p>And the bit re married women -- isn't that confusing the mark between the eyebrows with the red mark, sindhoor, on the center part of the hair? We need some native informants here! <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 05:23, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bindi is not necessarily a religious/married-women thing. Usually, women wear Bindi as they would do other ornaments. Right now, most of the Bindi (also called "Tip" in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangla.html" title="Bangla">Bangla</a>) are adhesive versions. But if you are asking about religiou significance of it, I guess somebody from <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> may cast some light on it. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 02:41, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For a custom of millions of people, you would think there would be more than just a paragraph on the subject. Every time I hear something about Bindis I hear something different. Some say it has caste significance, some religious, some say it indicates marriage, and even others say it is an old outdated custom with all the significance of an ear ring (by that, just for looks). If any Wiki definition needs analitical explanation, this I am sure qualifies. --209.112.222.98 00:20, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, yes, we need more info. The web doesn't seem to have much. Is there a forum of South Asian editors where this question could be asked? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:43, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All the usage cited by 209.112.222.98 are correct, Bindis are used for Hindu castes, marriage symbol for married Hindu Women, religious symbol, and also as a body decoration worn by women from almost all religion in South Asia. I can't help with the religious significance since I'm not well-versed in Hindu customs, but for decorative usage of it (along with pictures of Bindis taken off my wife's collection), I can help.

<p>That's OK with me, since a bindi seems to be a subset of tilak. I'd just want a redirect, so that anyone looking for bindi would be taken directly to the tilak article.</p>
<p>I will do what I can with the copyediting, but this is one area of Indian custom where I am quite ignorant, so I'm going to have to rely on other editors to make sure the info is correct. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 00:23, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <b>Strongly disagree</b>. The article <a href="../../../t/i/l/Tilaka.html" title="Tilaka">Tilaka</a> is on the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>-related religious significance of the Tilaka symbol, whereas Bindi is mostly an ornamental symbol, used by women regardless of religion. It is ok to have a summarized section on Bindi in the Tilaka article, but at the same time, Bindi should have its own, elaborate article. In <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Asia_cf77.html" title="South Asia">South Asia</a>, Bindi is used by Muslim, Buddhist and Christian women in the same way as Hindu women, and the wearing of Bindi has nothing to do with the religious significance, rather it is more of a cultural phenomenon. The merger of these articles would only propagate the fundamentalist notion and fatwas that wearing of Bindi is a Hindu practice (something not shared by the mainstream culture in South Asia). So, these articles are better left as they are now. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 04:54, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed with Ragib. Bindi article should have "See also: Tilak" and Tilak "See also: Bindi". -Jan/VEDA, 20/12/2005</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>well but then the article should <i>say</i> there is a difference. As long as the bindi article says its the same as tilak, and the tilak article says that bindi is just the Hindi term, there is no point in keeping the articles separate. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 17:50, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do understand and appreciate what Ragib means. However, while it may be true that many non-Hindu women of south Asia wear the vermilion mark on their forehead, it is not the case that such usage is known as "wearing the Bindi", while the more emotion-charged use by married Hindu women is known as "wearing the Tilak". If anything, "tilak" has the imagery of use by men, while <i>bindi</i> conjures up a woman. Perhaps we could merge, mention this, and have sections mentioning both occasional use by non-Hindus, and the problems this occasionaly causes. During the heyday of the separatist <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khalistan.html" title="Khalistan">Khalistan</a> movement in Punjab, Sikh women who sported the Bindi (a pervasive trend) came in for denounciation and even physical assault. Would Ragib agree that merging, with these provisions, would be a good idea? I prefer merging, given the profusion of pages: see <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumkum.html" title="Kumkum">Kumkum</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sindoor.html" title="Sindoor">Sindoor</a> as well.

<p>I think I'm still in favor of keeping them as separate articles, since the tilak article seems to concern the Hindu meanings, while the bindi article focusses on the fashion uses of the bindi. Given that so many women wear bindis as fashion statements, I think I'd agree with Ragib that the bindi has "escaped" its Hindu origin. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 22:09, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have just seen this after I put a comment on tilak page. I believe they should be merged and clearly say bindi is not just hindu. We can simply say in the header as "a dot on forehead for relegious or for fashion reasons in south asia and India", and have seperate sections for "relegious significance" and put all hindu information there. It is just confusing and overlapping. It is my opinion, and I can live with either. <a href="../../../m/l/p/User%7EMlpkr_f425.html" title="User:Mlpkr">Mlpkr</a> 20:00, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The two are different, a Bindi is NOT a subset of a Tilak. The two are not synonyms in the current real life. The Tilak is the religous of the two and has a different shape, it's put by smearing coloured powder, and can even have rice grains added on. A Bindi now is mostly used for fashion and is even available as a commercial product with stick on adhesive. A Bindi is used only by women, and a Tilak can be on men or women, the shape and significance of the two are vastly different. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 11:02, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, looking at it more closely, I think it means that when someone uses a sniper rifle, the laser sight on the rifle paints a red dot on the area that the bullet should hit (leaving out of account wind and the like). The bindi looks like a sniper dot. That is, if someone is a racist who thinks killing people with bindis is funny.

<p>Someone edited the article and replaced all instances of South Asia with Indian sub-continent. South Asia is a more acceptable term, as it doesn't claim the whole sub-continent for one of the five nations that share it. That's aggressive nationalism, and it is NOT OK. Someone also replaced the word Hinduism with "Hindu dharma," which is an Indian locution that would not be understood by most readers. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:42, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd request Bharatveer to provide evidence that the arcane term "Indian subcontinent" is more commonly used for the region in contemporary usage. I looked in google and failed to find any university with a department titled "Indian subcontinent studies" (except for one or two in Australia). However, most of the universities that do have a department on the region, have named it "South Asian studies". I also looked up the usage of the words "Indian subcontinent" versus "South Asia" (excluding the wikipedia mirrors), and South Asia vastly outnumbers the phrase "Indian subcontinent" (the ratio is 40:1). So, unless Bharatveer can show any proof of the prevalence of the term "Indian subcontinent", which seems to be on its way of becoming a thing of the past, I suggest not reverting this article (and others) constantly.

<p>Yes, it came into use after the Partition, as non-inflammatory. Please stop using a term that will inevitably provoke upset in the citizens of four other nations. South Asia is the term now in use -- even by my Indian friends. Indian sub-continent is primarily used in a geological context, not in a political context. "Indian sub-continent" gets 965,000 google hits and "South Asia" gets 29,800,000 ghits.

<dd>That's YOUR opinion. Until I see any proof of Indian subcontinent being more common (rather than the 30 uses of South Asia for each I.S. use), It'll stay this way. Change when you have some numbers to show for it. That you don't like it really isn't an argument when we have these disparities in the usage of the words.

<p>One reference was to a commercial website written in sub-standard English, and the other was to a dictionary. Insisting on "Hindu dharma" is silly, given that the phrase is not colloquial English. If it gets taken into regular English, then we can use it. In terms of ghits, Hinduism wins out over Hindu dharma 4 to 1 -- and most of the ghits for "Hindu dharma" seem to be Hindu religious websites. As for "not a battleground" -- projection? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 04:15, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Now you are being silly here.

<p>OK, the phrase "Hindu dharma" is neither used in spoken (colloquial) nor extremely formal English. (The two varieties of English are a continuum rather than disjunct; many expressions that are colloquial are also perfectly acceptable in formal writing.) It sounds strange. It sounds HINGLISH. That's my professional (copyeditor, proofreader) opinion. I can ask a copyeditors' mailing list and I'm sure that they would say the same thing. Why fight about this? What the heck is the point of saying "Hindu dharma" rather than "Hinduism"? <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 10:01, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In acceptable English, whether proper British, American, or Indian, the term Hindu dharma is not used. South Asia is much more common, lke "BBC News South Asia" etc. "Indian subcontinent" would be less than accurate, and the strongest reason would be that this does not include Sri Lanka and by definition Nepal or Bhutan. South Asia however includes all those countries. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasawala_1ef6.html" title="User:Basawala"><font color="forestgreen"><b>Mar de Sin</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBasawala_bd91.html" title="User talk:Basawala"><font color="navy"><sup><b>Speak up!</b></sup></font></a> 21:03, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I just saw that the Wikipedia article says Indian subcontinent <i>does</i> include Sri Lanka, but other sources only include India-Bangladesh-Pakistan. A subcontinent usually wouldn't include islands like Sri Lanka or the Maldives, and South Asia would be much more accurate since all definitions I searched included these countries. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasawala_1ef6.html" title="User:Basawala"><font color="forestgreen"><b>Mar de Sin</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBasawala_bd91.html" title="User talk:Basawala"><font color="navy"><sup><b>Speak up!</b></sup></font></a> 21:09, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've reverted BharatVeer's favorite revert ... i.e. replacement of South Asia with "Indina subcontinent". I have demonstrated the more common use of the word "South Asia" over "Indian subcontinent" while talking about the culture and the region. Unless BharatVeer can show some numbers, I'll request him to stop reverting according to his personal tastes.</p>
<p>As for the word "Hindu dharma", the commonly used term in *English language* IS <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>. Once you get enough consensus to change the name of the article <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> to Hindu Dharma, please revert here. Until then, trying to make an English language encyclopedia replaced by regional languages is plainly illogical.

<dd>Well, this is turning into really irritating game of reverts. As I have shown before, "South Asia" is the more commonly used term for the region, "Indian subcontinent" is NOT. Unless you show proof of your position, this is very unreasonable for you to revert it again and again. Please stop this.

<dd>Also, please stop misleading with summaries like "changed to version with reference ". Your reference doesn't show in any way that the region is more commonly called "Indian subcontinent" anymore, and it wasn't removed either. 40:1 ratio of usage between South Asia and Indian subcontinent is a good reason why South Asia is definitely the word to use here for the region.

I've also shown that almost all universities (save one or two) have "South Asian Studies" departments rather than "Indian subcontinent studies" departments. Almost all countries have state departments on "South Asia" and NOT on "Indian subcontinent". That you like IS is your own preference, and there is no reason for the rest of us to follow that over common usage. And precisely the same goes for your continuous arguments for a non-English term over a very commonly used term.

I can read the above discussion to see that most of it was about the phrase "Hindu Dharma", and not about the word "Dharma". You say, <i>you need a reference for the word "hindu" also?</i>. No I don't, but I do like to see some numbers showing that the phrase "Hindu Dharma" is more common than the other term <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> in English language.</dd>

<dd>I should perhaps add that the term "dharma" is widely used by English-speaking practitioners of Buddhism. However, it's usually used in the sense of "the underlying rules of the universe" which the Buddha is believed to have learned and taught. "Dharma" is used as shorthand for "Buddhist teachings." (The WP article on <a href="../../../d/h/a/Dharma.html" title="Dharma">Dharma</a> is pretty much OK at explaining this.) However, I am under no illusion that any of this would make sense to non-Buddhists. Hence I don't use the term outside my sangha. Insisting that others use terms that make sense only to believers is not the best way to communicate, or to make friends for your beliefs. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 03:53, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, you cleverly try to evade the question. I read very well, and since you asked, here is an excerpt from your "reference" ... The meaning of Dharma, as given in the M-W dict, is not what you imply here, rather its meaning is given as <i>an individual's duty fulfilled by observance of custom or law 2 Hinduism &amp; Buddhism a&#160;: the basic principles of cosmic or individual existence&#160;: divine law b&#160;: conformity to one's duty and nature</i> . However, you are arguing that it is a very commonly used synonym for the English language word&#160;: "Religion", and therefore, "Hindu + Dharma" = "Hindu + Religion" = Hinduism. And here is your fallacy. Anyway, I've wasted enough bytes here showing the same thing at least three times, so there is no meaning in repeating that again. Even if, hypothetically, your reference showed the word "Hindu Dharma" in the M-W dictionary, there is absolutely no reason we should replace it with something which is 30 times less commonly used. Thank you, and unless you come up with something logical enough, I won't reply to your personal opinions.

<dd>Fine! All I asked was that you give some real references to your viewpoint, and we are yet to see any from you. I have repeated the issue several times above ONLY because you simply skipped the questions and went over and over on the same things (even after being shown that the references don't support them). --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 05:54, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>User Ragib pls stop spouting lies.The reference was for the word dharma which means "a&#160;: the basic principles of cosmic or individual existence&#160;: divine law b&#160;: conformity to one's duty and nature ".</dd>
<dd>First you say that there is no such word "Dharma" in english .When the reference is given, you say that word is not in regular usage.And NOW you are saying that "Hinduism" is used more commonly than "Hindu dharma".So finally the question is about consensus. Let a consensus evolve among the users.There are no fixed rules in wikipedia that only the most acceptable word should be used here.</dd>

<dd>I dont think it applies to Ragib, but Zora should definitely read this. "Outside South Asia" makes no sense because the geographical area is referred to as the subcontinent.

I went to this page just as a casual American, native-English speaker curious about bindi. If the purpose of the article is to educate those of us who are curious about Indian customs, it makes more sense to use the more-commonly-understood-to-non-Indian-English-speakers term Hinduism rather than Hindu dharma, which would mean nothing to me without looking it up, be it ever so correct. As I think the point here is communication and education and not didacticism, and this is an English article, I think that might be a useful consideration. As for the other "discussion," I bow to those of you with superior knowledge. Alicefaith 23:16, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you. I hope the discussion on the English use of the term "Hindu dharma" can end, because no matter how often the terms are <i>separately</i> used, they <b>don't make sense</b> together in English, especially not when compared to the accepted term "Hinduism". <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasawala_1ef6.html" title="User:Basawala"><font color="forestgreen"><b>Mar de Sin</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/a/s/User_talk%7EBasawala_bd91.html" title="User talk:Basawala"><font color="navy"><sup><b>Speak up!</b></sup></font></a> 20:58, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Indian subcontinent" is something that's used only in the Indian subcontinent, probably only in India. So 'South Asia' indeed is the right way to call it.</dd>
<dd>And that apart, again and again and yet again, <b>WHY do we have the Hindi transliteration here</b>? This kind of 'Hindi'-ising every article possible even remotely connected to India is shameful. Either remove the Hindi transliteration and replace it with a spelling with diacritics/IPA etc., or add transliterations of every other language in <s>India</s> the 'sub-continent'. Otherwise a <a href="../../../p/o/t/Pottu.html" title="Pottu">Pottu</a> for the Tamil usage, a Bottu for the Kannada usage, the respective terms in Bangla, Sinhala, and all other languages of the subcontinent/South Asia will be in order. Because certainly a 'Bottu' is every bit as important and notable and encyclopaedic as the 'Bindi'. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 02:40, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not seconding Sarvagnya's comments regarding using Hindi (if Bindi is a Hindi language word, Hindi is the language to use here, if it is from something else, that'd be the language to use, so no point in arguing over that). But we are not talking about mountains and oceans here. When it comes to the culture, people, and nations, the term in use is "South Asia", as demonstrated by contemporary usage. You'd find "South Asian studies" for departments that study the culture and people of the region; and NOT "Indian subcontinent studies". Numbers show that the ratio is almost 30-40 to 1. That, by itself, is enough to end this discussion. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 05:15, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello? Isn't this getting just a little bit silly? This talk page is umpteen kilobytes and the article itself is only a screen full. Obviously there are some regional differences. Describe what you know from your region as applicable to your region, and if someone from another region finds things to be the same, they can note that it's the same in their region, too. Don't fret too much about it; you've got readers all over the world just trying to get a general idea of what this Bindi thing is all about. -- <a href="../../../k/e/4/User%7EKe4roh_a96d.html" title="User:Ke4roh">ke4roh</a> 03:47, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I replaced the imported phrase "Hindu dharma" with "Hinduism" once again. Same reasoning -- this is an English language encyclopedia and we use the terms that are most familiar to readers.</p>
<p>I'm also wondering about one thing in the article -- the article states that married Hindu women wear the bindi. I left that there for now, but I think that statement confuses the bindi on the forehead with the application of red to the parting of the hair that symbolizes marriage.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if we should also add something re the smudge of red that is put on your forehead when you visit a Hindu temple and receive prasad. It's a smudge, not a neat bindi, but it's same place, same color in many cases ... related? Name for this? Comments welcome -- I'm not Hindu, so I'm probably ignorant of the fine points. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:45, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>However, yet again, you have not shown that the term "Hindu Dharma", referring to Hinduism, is more common than the English language word "Hinduism". Please don't repeat the things about "Hindu" and "Dharma" (2 separate words) being present in the dictionary, your own references show Dharma to refer to a separate concept than to be an exclusive synonym for "Religion". In other words, once you show "Hindu Dharma" a common, widely used replacement for the English word "Hinduism", revert to that. Until you do so, please refrain from doing the same thing again and again. I have shown the relevant numbers regarding common usage.

<dd>Resorting to personal attacks again? Replying with an argument would have been easier. Again, you have failed to show any answer to my question: is "Hindu Dharma" a synonym for "Hinduism", and is it more common than the English language word "Hinduism". Please don't revert until you answer this. Finding the word "Dharma" in a dictionary isn't really an answer, as your own reference shows it to allude to a concept rather than be the sole synonym for religion.

<p>My opinion -- there's no question it should be: "Some Westerners who have converted to <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>..." in terms of common usage.
