<p>If it is true that, as the article says, she is as famous as her father, she deserves an article. Also, the Steve Irwin article says that she was working on her own TV show at the time of his death, which sounds very notable to me. <a href="../../../p/v/o/User%7EPvodenski_a42d.html" title="User:Pvodenski">Pvodenski</a> 14:00, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To say that she's as famous as her father is to stretch it a bit, but I consider her famous enough to have her own page. She's had that much exposure in the programs, not only as a cute little kid but actually taking part of the show. And her own show has just been cleared to continue and will air world wide in january-07. Hdw 13:14, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Count me as one who thinks she isn't worthy of an article. <b>If</b> she goes on and fronts a TV show, then create the article then. At the moment, she's just the child of a famous person.

<dd>Are you serious?! That's <i>exactly</i> what we do here: decide who is and is not notable (or famous). We are guided by certain policies and guidelines such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and, probably most important of all, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, but at the end of day editors have to decide whether or not a person is notable enough to qualify for an article. Appearing in TV programs does not mean a person automatically passes the test.</dd>
<dd>At the moment, I think it's best to leave things as they are with the material merged into <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Irwin_a65f.html" title="Steve Irwin">Steve Irwin</a> and this article redirected to that page. The alternative is we take it to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> and the article gets deleted.</dd>
<dd>Gdavidp, I strongly encourage you to review the policies and guidelines, especially if you are going to edit biographies. Thanks, Sarah Ewart (Talk) 18:57, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You must be joking! She is very famous in Australia. A child star. Now even more so after the death of her father who was a living national treasure.

I'm a new wikipedian and unfamiliar with how such things are done. Thankyou for the advice. He has reposted his unfounded allegations above your posting. Is that enough evidence? It will also be recorded in the logs I suppose. The Bindi Show is definitely going ahead. Her manager John Stainton has affirmed this. That makes her notable.</p>

<dd>To be completely honest, I doubt he has enough evidence... checkuser is not something done lightly, as it means exposing a users personal information, such as IP, even if it is just to a Checkuser, who either tells us that it's the same guy or not, but the Privacy agreement precludes letting the actual IP's out into the public. As for your links, please review <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, specifically the section on <b>Not a Crystal Ball</b>.

<p>Thankyou for the rapid responses. Wikipedia is certainly a large place to navigate. I had no idea your rule book was so well organised. I will come back after reading the links you have provided. Is it alright if I delete these libel messages from yale_s? They contribute nothing to the topic and I find them insulting. The links to the Courier Mail and other sources seemed perfectly ok to me. Ofcourse I'll remove them if they breach any rules. I posted the links in response to statements that Bindi Irwin was not assured of having her own show. It is not crystal ball gazing as it has been officially stated her show is going to air. She is already famous from countless television shows anyway. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroclover_71f7.html" title="User:Croclover">Croclover</a> 00:52, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>CrocLover /Wayne Smith / Universe daily / 203.56.233.122 / etc, etc does not need to check the links. The redirect spam/neo-nazi/porn sites belong to him. He knows wher they go and is linkspamming deliberately. The Admins need to block the IDs and IPs, as all of Wayne Smith's sockpuppets are indefinitely exiled from WP.</p>

<dd>it isn't hard to run a whois on a site. If the 'official' site you're linking is registered by j.random loser or a protected account it's not an official site. In this case you would expect official sites to be registered to Austrailia Zoo, Animal Planet or Discovery Channel. Hdw 00:57, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hdw, I am not sure who you are talking to. If you are talking to "Croclover", than you don't seem to understand that he KNOWS its not the "official" site. HE IS THE LINKSPAMMER. If you are talking to me, then I already KNOW its not the "official" site. I am the one removing Wayne Smit's LINKSPAMs until the admins block his sockpuppet IDs and IPs.

<p>Googling her turns up a variety of articles about her specific to her pending television show, and also from before Steve's death. Wouldn't that count as making her notable enough for her own article?

<li>I have reverted the redirect - you should have discussed before redirecting. It no longer seems appropriate to discuss Bindi in relation to her father, there are events post his death for which she is at least as notable as many others included on Wikipedia - most have not been watched giving a speech by 300 million people or appeared on the front page of major newspapers - let the article stay for the present and see.

<dd>Actually, I have none left, just looked. So, in regards to the aforementioned logic, I would appreciate you returning to the state the article was in after the AfD and creating another discussion to see if there should be more here. It was the last result of consensus, and it seems natural to me that it should be left there untill another consensus comes along. I am not blindly reverting, im trying to make this in line with our own policy. I may be wrong, but the last time someone actually came to a consensus, it was to have a redirect.

<p>Please also note the reason for the AfD decision to speedy delete was because the article was created by a banned user, no decision was made as to the notability or otherwise of the subject. The AfD result is thus irrelevant for its decision making as well of course for the timing - she has become more notable over the last fortnight - the reason as to why she became notable is not the point, the fact is she is currently more notable than many of the people who do have wikipedia entries.--<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a></sup> 01:49, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Surely some mention should be made of the controversy surrounding the attention she's getting and the pressure she appears to be under to be like her father (I believe some child psychologists have suggested it might be damaging probably amongst other issues that have been raised)?

<li>The reason for this is that the article is most written by Americans, who as a majority, have no knowledge or consideration for any other spelling than their own.

<p>"Bindi made her first television appearance on the The Rosie O'Donnell Show in 1989." There is no way that is possible if she was born in 1998. I'm thinking that's a typo, but honestly that entire sentance should be removed. It doesn't belong where it is placed, and has no relevance to the article as a whole. 69.66.91.45 04:48, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
