<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binding_energy.html" title="Edit section: Mass defect">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mass defect</span></h2>
<p>Because a bound system is at a lower energy level than its unbound constituents, its mass must be less than the total mass of its unbound constituents. For systems with low binding energies, this "lost" mass after binding, may be fractionally small. For systems with high binding energies, however, the missing mass may be an easily measurable fraction.</p>
<p>Since all forms of energy in a system (which has no net <a href="../../../m/o/m/Momentum.html" title="Momentum">momentum</a>) have mass, the question of where the missing mass of the binding energy goes is of interest. The answer is that this mass does not "disappear" into energy (a common misconception); rather, transformed to heat or light, this mass may <i>move away</i> to another location. The "mass defect" from binding energy is therefore only mass which has moved. However, it remains mass, because mass is conserved in systems for any given single observer, so long as the system remains closed. Thus, if binding energy mass is transformed into heat, the system must be cooled (the heat removed) before the mass-deficit appears in the cooled system. In that case, the removed heat (which has mass itself when measured in the original inertial frame) represents exactly the mass "deficit."</p>
<p>For example, when two large objects (such as the earth and a meteor) are attracted by a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitational_field.html" title="Gravitational field">gravitational field</a> and collide, the energy for the heat of impact is extracted from the gravitational field of the objects. However, the system does <i>not</i> lose mass (which represents its binding energy) <i>until</i> this heat is radiated into space, and this space is no longer counted as part of the original system (equivalent to opening the original system).</p>
<p>Closely analogous considerations apply in chemical and nuclear considerations. However, in nuclear reactions, the fraction of mass which may be removed as light or heat, and which then appears as binding energy, is often a much larger fraction of the system mass. This is because nuclear forces are comparatively stronger than other forces.</p>
<p>In nuclear reactions, the "light" which must be <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radiation.html" title="Radiation">radiated</a> to remove binding energy may be in the form of direct <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamma_radiation.html" title="Gamma radiation">gamma radiation</a>. Again, however, no mass-deficit can in theory appear until this radiation has been emitted and is no longer part of the system.</p>
<p>The energy given off during either <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_fusion.html" title="Nuclear fusion">nuclear fusion</a> or <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_fission.html" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> is the difference between the binding energies of the fuel and the fusion or fission products. In practice, this energy may also be calculated from the substantial mass differences between the fuel and products, once evolved heat and radiation have been removed.</p>

<p>A deuteron is the nucleus of a <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuterium.html" title="Deuterium">deuterium</a> atom, and consists of one <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proton.html" title="Proton">proton</a> and one <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutron.html" title="Neutron">neutron</a>. The experimentally-measured masses of the constituents as free particles are:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>m</i><sub>proton</sub> = 1.007825 u (u is the symbol for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_atomic_mass_unit.html" title="Unified atomic mass unit">unified atomic mass unit</a>)</dd>
<dd><i>m</i><sub>neutron</sub>= 1.008665 u</dd>
<dd><i>m</i><sub>proton</sub> + <i>m</i><sub>neutron</sub> = 1.007825 + 1.008665 = 2.01649 u</dd>
</dl>
<p>The mass of the deuteron (also an experimentally measured quantity) is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Atomic mass <sup>2</sup>H = 2.014102 u</dd>
</dl>
<p>The mass difference = 2.01649 - 2.014102 = 0.002388 u. Since the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energies_per_unit_mass.html" title="Energies per unit mass">conversion between rest mass and energy</a> is 931.494MeV/u, a deuteron's binding energy is calculated to be:</p>
<dl>
<dd>0.002388 × 931.494 MeV/u = 2.224 MeV</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thus, expressed in another way, the binding energy is [0.002388/2.01649] x 100% = about 0.1184 % of the total energy corresponding to the mass. This corresponds to 1.07 x <span class="texhtml">10<sup>14</sup></span> J/kg = 107 TJ/kg.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binding_energy.html" title="Edit section: Nuclear binding energy curve">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nuclear binding energy curve</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table_of_elements.html" title="Periodic table of elements">periodic table of elements</a>, the series of light elements from <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> up to <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium.html" title="Sodium">sodium</a> is observed to exhibit generally increasing binding energy per nucleon as the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_mass.html" title="Atomic mass">atomic mass</a> increases. This increase is generated by increasing forces per nucleon in the nucleus, as each additional nucleon is attracted by all of the other nucleons, and thus more tightly bound to the whole.</p>
<p>The region of increasing binding energy is followed by a region of relative stability (saturation) in the sequence from <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnesium.html" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> through <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenon.html" title="Xenon">xenon</a>. In this region, the nucleus has become large enough that nuclear forces no longer completely extend efficiently across its width. Attractive nuclear forces in this region, as atomic mass increases, are nearly balanced by repellant electromagnetic forces between protons, as <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_number.html" title="Atomic number">atomic number</a> increases.</p>
<p>Finally, in elements heavier than xenon, there is a decrease in binding energy per nucleon as atomic number increases. In this region of nuclear size, electromagnetic repulsive forces are beginning to gain against the strong nuclear force.</p>
<p>At the peak of binding energy, nickel-62 is the most tightly-bound nucleus, followed by iron-58 and iron-56.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> (This is the basic reason why iron and nickel are very common metals in planetary cores, since they are produced profusely as end products in <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernova.html" title="Supernova">supernovae</a>).</p>
<p>The existence of a <i>maximum</i> in binding energy in medium-sized nuclei is a consequence of the trade-off in the effects of two opposing forces which have different range characteristics. The attractive nuclear force (<a href="../../../s/t/r/Strong_nuclear_force.html" title="Strong nuclear force">strong nuclear force</a>), which binds protons and neutrons equally to each other, has a limited range due to a rapid exponential decrease in this force with distance. However, the repelling electromagnetic force, which acts between protons to force nuclei apart, falls off with distance much more slowly (as the inverse square of distance). For nuclei larger than about four nucleons in diameter, the additional repelling force of additional protons more than offsets any binding energy which results between further added nucleons as a result of additional strong force interactions; such nuclei become less and less tightly bound as their size increases, though most of them are still stable. Finally, nuclei containing more than 209 nucleons (larger than about 6 nucleons in diameter) are all too large to be stable, and are subject to spontaneous decay to smaller nuclei.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_fusion.html" title="Nuclear fusion">Nuclear fusion</a> produces energy by combining the very lightest elements into more tightly-bound elements (such as hydrogen into <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helium.html" title="Helium">helium</a>), and <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_fission.html" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> produces energy by splitting the heaviest elements (such as <a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranium.html" title="Uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>) into more tightly-bound elements (such as <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barium.html" title="Barium">barium</a> and <a href="../../../k/r/y/Krypton.html" title="Krypton">krypton</a>). Both processes produce energy, because middle-sized nuclei are the most tightly bound of all.</p>

<p>For a nucleus with A nucleons including Z protons, a semiemipirical formula for the binding energy per nucleon is:</p>
<p><img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/4/5/e45c4eba33b0ad4d516f6bf5a378a0a5.png" alt="B.E./A=a-b/A^{1/3}-cZ^2/A^{4/3}-d(N-Z)^2/A^2\pm e/A^{7/4}" /></p>
<p>where the binding energy is in MeV for the following numerical values of the constants: <span class="texhtml"><i>a</i> = 14.0</span>; <span class="texhtml"><i>b</i> = 13.0</span>; <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i> = 0.585</span>; <span class="texhtml"><i>d</i> = 19.3</span>; <span class="texhtml"><i>e</i> = 33</span>.</p>
<p>The first term <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/5/3/f532fcdb8b9c5c620fefcd59f1d5f869.png" alt="a\," /> is called the saturation contribution and ensures that the B.E. per nucleon is the same for all nuclei to a first approximation.</p>
<p>The term <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/6/9/d69f9ddefd9f70a24c7a7bba42b1625e.png" alt="-b/A^{1/3}\," /> is a surface tension effect and is proportional to the number of nucleons that are situated on the nuclear surface. It is largest for light nuclei.</p>
<p>The term <img class='tex' src="../../../math/f/b/7/fb7f85df8dc893580a24c1b255aa7e98.png" alt="-cZ^2/A^{4/3}\," /> is the Coulomb electrostatic repulsion. This becomes more important as <span class="texhtml"><i>Z</i></span> increases.</p>

This is because the <i>n-p</i> interaction in a nucleus is stronger than either the <i>n-n</i> or <i>p-p</i> interaction.</p>
<p>The pairing term <img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/d/a/5da82a85a55ee50e223cb7f2c0f18e80.png" alt="\pm e/A^{7/4}" /> is purely empirical. It is + for even-even nuclei and - for odd-odd nuclei.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binding_energy.html" title="Edit section: Measuring the binding energy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Measuring the binding energy</span></h3>
<p>As seen above in the example of deuterium, nuclear binding energies are large enough that they may be easily measured as fractional <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass.html" title="Mass">mass</a> deficits, according to the equivalence of mass and energy. The atomic binding energy is simply the amount of energy (and mass) released, when a collection of free <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nucleons.html" title="Nucleons">nucleons</a> are joined together to form a <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_nucleus.html" title="Atomic nucleus">nucleus</a>. All nuclei which last long enough to be weighed, are measurably lighter than a corresponding collection of free protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>Nuclear binding energy can be easily computed from the easily measurable difference in mass of a nucleus, and the sum of the masses of the number of free neutrons and protons that make up the nucleus. Once this mass difference, called the <b>mass defect</b> or <b>mass deficiency</b>, is known, Einstein's formula <a href="../../../e/3D/m/E%3Dmc%C2%B2.html" title="E=mc²">E=mc²</a> can be used to compute the binding energy of any nucleus. (As a historical note, early nuclear physicists used to refer to computing this value as a "packing fraction" calculation).</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_mass_unit.html" title="Atomic mass unit">atomic mass unit</a> (1.000000 <b>u</b>) is <i>defined</i> to be 1/12 of the mass of a <sup>12</sup>C atom – but the atomic mass of a <sup>1</sup>H atom (which is a proton plus electron) is 1.007825 <b>u</b>, so each nucleon in <sup>12</sup>C has lost, on average, about 0.8% percent of its mass in the form of binding energy.</p>
