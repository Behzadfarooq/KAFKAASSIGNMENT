<p>Not sure why this page should be called "Binaural recording" since it explicitly covers playback as well. Why not "binaural audio"? - <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin726_0e32.html" title="User:Robin726">Robin726</a> 19:05, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Could someone please explain to me the logic behind the (dummy) image caption? I cannot for the life of me understand what is being said.</p>
<p>Answer: I believe the caption suffers from not explicitly explaining that in binaural recording with an artificial head the two microphones (or their elements, as in the phote) are located at the ear canals -- in the photo the second microphone is obscured by the head; its element (at its tip) is presumably located on the other side of the head at the ear.</p>

<p>"The best playback headphone for binaural recording is one that is transparent down to ear drum i.e one that can directly inject sound to the ear drum as if the sound is being played right in front of an ear drum."</p>
<p>This statement is surely incorrect. Since binaural recordings are made with the microphones placed at the ENTRANCE to the ear canal, then the aim must be toprovide a flat frequency response to the entrance. Only if the recording were made with microphones positioned as if at the eardrum would the above statement be true. I find this is a common error. Also, it is important to realise that stereo recordings are essentially free-field, and are adjusted using monitor loudspeakers at 30 degree off axis. The response at the entrance to the ear canal is not flat, but is attenuated at HF and so normal headphones, with side presentation, would sound much too bright if they had a flat response - in practice they are all designed to have a severe notch around 5kHz. It is this that makes them unsuitable for binaural listening. --<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELindosland_587d.html" title="User:Lindosland">Lindosland</a> 10:21, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I gathered several legitimate MP3s of binaural recordings available at various websites. A harddrive failure, however, late made those files inaccessible. I've since been able to find a good number of them online again.</p>
<p>But I can think of at least one that I haven't found and sure would like to have again. I have a feeling that it was recorded in the northern, and possibly the western, half of the U.S. I remember it as rather long. In front of an audience in (I think) a church, a guy gives a demonstration of one of those fancy old pipe organs, (literally) with all the bells and whistlesâ€”the kind sometimes used for silent-movie accompaniment. It includes a performance of Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever", among other things.</p>
<p>Anyway, does anyone have an idea of how to get this recording again?</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone who can help.</p>

<p>To make this article more complete, would it better if we can list some software that can create a binaural experience? For example, the media player Foobar2000 has a plugin available (bs2b) to create a binaural experience from a stereo source.<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETREX6662k5_0e25.html" title="User:TREX6662k5">TREX6662k5</a> 10:45, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed your statement: "..In truth, binaural recordings are the best way to reproduce stereo with <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headphones.html" title="Headphones">headphones</a>. Typical stereo recordings are mixed for <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loudspeaker.html" title="Loudspeaker">loudspeaker</a> arrangements, and do not factor in natural crossfeed or sonic shaping of the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head.html" title="Head">head</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/r/Ear.html" title="Ear">ear</a>, since these things happen naturally as a person listens, generating his own ITDs (interaural time differences) and ILDs (interaural level differences)..."</p>
<p>The truth is that nobody can say what "is the best" or "the worst". It is just an opinion. Actually surveys show that consumers enjoy more, music that was recorded without using binaural techniques. So if one was to go by the opinion of consumers then non-binaural recording is the best. Most grammy winning recordings are done with non-binaural techniques. Additionally, mixing and recording are two totally different subjects and mixing engineers do not mix for "loudspeakers" as you say, but to achieve what is, in their opinion, the best artistic effect, whether using speakers or headphones. No matter if the source audio was recorded binaurally or not it still can be can be mixed. You will find a pair of reference headphones in most recording studios. And whether an engineer uses the speaker or the headphones during mixing is just a matter of preference and this has nothing to do with binaural recording.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Sorensen_10ff.html" title="User:Mike Sorensen">Mike Sorensen</a> 19:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Disagree. Dummy head recording is one particular way of doing binaural recording (there are minor variations, mostly regarding the head, wig, dress, placement); there are many other ways of making binaural recordings. You could make a section of the binaural recording article about dummy head recording, I suppose, but at that point a link to this article (expanded, I hope) would be equally in order, and help elminate the confusion that they are two names for the same thing. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtterSmith_4321.html" title="User:OtterSmith">htom</a> 15:55, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dummy head recording is indeed a subsection of Binaural recording, and a merge would make that clearer. Dummy head refers to a specific method of capturing the audio, for a binaural recording. Having them separate means that all has to be explained twice. The example audio file and image are already at Binaural.</dd>
<dd>Also, look at any featured article to see how long they generally are. Length is a good thing, it encourages collaboration at a single location.--<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiddity_6493.html" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a> 06:41, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Still opposed to the merge. Stereo recording &lt;&gt; binaural recording &lt;&gt; Dummy head recording. That this article confounds dummy head with binaural is a good reason to re-write this article; it is a very bad reason to merge the two, which would only perpetuate the confusion of the two (well, many) different techniques. Binaural is perhaps more properly characterised as a goal, with dummy head as a method -- one of several -- of approaching that goal. Reducing the number of articles for the sake of reducing the number of articles while continuing a mispreception is not, or should not be, a goal of good encyclopedic editing. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtterSmith_4321.html" title="User:OtterSmith">htom</a> 05:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody said anything about stereo recording. (?!)</dd>
<dd>And you seem to agree, that "Dummy head recording" refers to a specific method for obtaining a "Binaural recording". As in, that is all it's ever used for. Hence, it belongs as a subsection of Binaural recording. I've moved the merge tag and image down to make that clearer. The redirect would lead to the specific article section.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, I'm trying to increase the comprehensiveness of <i>this</i> article, not reduce the article count!</dd>

<dd>Opposed to merge. Manikins used for this purpose are not only used for audio recording in the arena of recording studios and music. These manikins, such as KEMAR, are used extensively in Audiology research. I have seen many manikins wearing hearing aids to investigate the effects of hearing aid processing on speech signals. In fact, a lot of these instances are done as monaural recordings, rather than binaural. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.231.116.93_eff0.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.231.116.93">71.231.116.93</a> (talk) 05:54, 23 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>The above comment about mono recording with a dummy head is most likely true, and does make sense. However until some references are provided to justify this position from a scientific point of view, I would go with the merger of the two articles. The dummy head article can always be created again if needed, if strong foundation is provided--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Sorensen_10ff.html" title="User:Mike Sorensen">Mike Sorensen</a> 05:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
