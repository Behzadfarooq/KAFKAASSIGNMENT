<p>Is this really the most basic numeral system? I can imagine base-1, where, for example, the number five would be 11111. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvercat_8d16.html" title="User:Evercat">Evercat</a> 01:15 2 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good point! So you can use a place to distinguish 1 and 2 like</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1 -&gt; 1</li>
<li>11 -&gt; 2</li>
<li>111 -&gt; 3</li>

<p>and so on. I didn't realize that. But I have never heard of base-1. Anyway I remove the claim of most basic numeral system at a time. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 01:22 2 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But if base-1 were really the simplest, how would one represent 0?</dd>

<p>Like this:</p>
<p>But seriously, the claim that binary is the "simplest" was removed from the article; even now it'd probably only make sense to call it the simplest "practical" system, but practicality is fairly dependent on purpose (for a 4-year-old learning to count on his fingers, the unary system is more practical, and he's not likely to need zero, since with zero things there's nothing to count). Unary is also limited in that it doesn't work well for real numbers (what would 111.111111 mean in unary?) These limitations are just a result of it being, in my current opinion, the simplest numeral system. Truly, though, it's hard to deny that unary <i>is</i> a numeral system, and that it is simpler than binary. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 22:38, 10 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, even <b>binary</b> doesn't work well for real numbers (what is 101011.0100110?) I assume you could use most of the same tricks used in binary <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floating_point.html" title="Floating point">floating point</a> on unary... &#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_6f2b.html" title="User:JesseW">JesseW</a> 09:00, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Easy; 101001.0100110 binary is:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 × 2<sup>5</sup> +</li>
<li>0 × 2<sup>4</sup> +</li>
<li>1 × 2<sup>3</sup> +</li>
<li>0 × 2<sup>2</sup> +</li>
<li>0 × 2<sup>1</sup> +</li>
<li>1 × 2<sup>0</sup> +</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>0 × 2<sup>-1</sup> +</li>
<li>1 × 2<sup>-2</sup> +</li>
<li>0 × 2<sup>-3</sup> +</li>
<li>0 × 2<sup>-4</sup> +</li>
<li>1 × 2<sup>-5</sup> +</li>
<li>1 × 2<sup>-6</sup> +</li>
<li>0 × 2<sup>-7</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>or 41.296875. Assuming unary works like other numeral systems (position indicates power), and that the decimal point is only there to show where the power of 0 is, then every position in unary is multipled by 1 to some power; 111.111111 would be nine, then. Alternatively, the decimal could be used to separate whole numbers from fractional numbers, in which 111.111111 could mean 3.6. There's no doubt, at the very least, that unary would have to work differently than other systems. Adding in binary involves aligning two numbers and summing their individual digits; adding in unary is just a simple concatenation. Multiplication would probably have to work differently, too - make a table with width/height equal to the two numbers to be multiplied, and fill it with 1 to get the result of multiplication. Though, I guess there might be a way to contrive an arithmetic procedure that works similarly for all radixes... I really don't know&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 16:56, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>But the true point of binary is to have a simple system that does not ocuppy much RAM, and also the system of two digits is based on on/off. Base 1 is definetly more simple, but is not a system that would work for computers.--Matthew138s</p>
<hr />
<p>Whee, converting is fun! I'm starting to wonder whether we should have some articles like Converting decimal to binary, Converting binary to octal, though a lot of times the conversion is simple and boring (like binary/octal, binary/hexadecimal). It may be going overboard to have all this conversion stuff in here, but I figure it warrants a brief mention, since binary is the lingua franca of the computer world. It's good to know how to convert it to other stuff, and outside of conversion there isn't a whole lot to say about it. Anyone else have ideas? What do people think of the organizational scheme I've started? -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 21:45 2 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think use of a table is good, that is, the table where each column is a numeral system from unary to hexadecimal and each row is a number probably from 0 to 16? -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 01:59 3 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That is probably a good idea. Though, we'll have to be sure to make it clear that there is not always a direct substitution-type correspondence, as there is with octal and hex. Ex:</dd>

<dd>You can replace blocks of three bits with a corresponding octal digit, always, but not with decimal (since its radix is not a power of 2). So I'd be worried that a table of that sort might mislead people a bit unless we're careful.</dd>

<dd>We definitely need a good section on binary arithmetic, preferably towards the top. It's at the bottom now, but a nice overview of addition, subtraction (possibly two's complement), multiplication and division would be good. Some discussion of bitwise operations (AND/OR/XOR) would be good too. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 02:06 3 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The section on arithmetic, especially, is in need of work. Multiplication is only briefly discussed, and division not at all. I don't know if there perhaps needs to be a separate article for binary arithmetic, similar to what we have for <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitwise_operation.html" title="Bitwise operation">Bitwise operation</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integral_data_type.html" title="Integral data type">Integral data type</a> covers some of the complement stuff; <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_numbering_formats.html" title="Computer numbering formats">Computer numbering formats</a> is probably the most comprehensive overview of the subject. There's probably a lot of refactoring to be done of many articles, so they don't overlap too much, but I am not sure the best way to do it. Perhaps we need a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">WikiProject</a> for computer numbering formats. It's certainly a huge topic! -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 20:02, 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's interesting,but I don't think the "binary image" really improved the article, so I removed it. It's not exactly an intuitive representation and I don't think it will help anyone understand binary any better. Computer novices might find it interesting-looking, but it could also be confusing, etc. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 04:22, Sep 20, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I put them in as a "visual overview" to counting in the numeration systems. Counting in these systems can be modelled via an odometer, and the action of this can be visualised. The reason I put them in was to show the growth in the length of the representation (logarithmic) and also the repetitive fractal-like pattern occurring on all scales. The base-phi one was the original, and has pleasing irregularity. Maybe I should have also added comments to describe their intent. If anyone feels that such images belong, or just wants to look at them to decide what they are, look at <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Binary.png" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Binary.png" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Binary.png</a> <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ternary.png" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ternary.png" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ternary.png</a> and <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phinary.png" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phinary.png" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phinary.png</a> --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewKepert_6eb5.html" title="User:AndrewKepert">AndrewKepert</a> 05:08, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't want to be harsh, but speaking as a person with a degree in Computer Science, it's just about least intuitive visualization of any mathematical concept that I've ever seen. It might be worth an interesting web page somewhere, but it really doesn't help explain the base concepts at all. And while comments would help explain what they represent, that's really missing my point. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 06:37, Sep 20, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>Ordinarily I'm against "summary executions", but having had a look at these several images I have to agree that most people would not even have the visual acuity to see how they are built up. I didn't see any image of an odometer, but it sounds to me like a useful idea. Most people do not have a clear idea of what they are doing when they write 4959 or 4a4f9 or 100101000, and they can really only operate in decimal -- and only then on the basis of habit. So the image of a wheel the moves one notch for each tick and that kicks the next wheel once as it rotates back to its own zero position will give such a student a clear idea of what is going on. We had one of the first digital clocks in our kitchen in the 1950s. It worked that way, and the wheels were large enough for me to see clearly what was going on.</p>
<p>We should not assume that we are writing for people who already know what we are talking about. Unless people on the "no child left behind" train are moving both faster and in better cars than I think they are, most high school students who view the article on binary numbers will be trying to read 10110 as ten thousand one hundred and ten even as they try to get their minds around the "fact" that it refers to some other quantity of objects.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm 100% in favor of improving the article and making sure anyone can understand it. I'm the last person who needs an explanation of the binary numeral system -- I want the article to be simpler and more intuitive, not less. When explaining a potentially difficult subject, such as binary math, I think the last thing someone needs is someone trying to explain this complicated image. I gave a "summary execution" because I'm quite confident that the images did not help bring the article towards that goal, quite the opposite. If an image helps explain a concept, especially in a way that text cannot, then by all means, we should keep it. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 08:14, Sep 20, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By the way, in the 50s there was a series of "Tutor Texts" (I think that was a trade name), and the first of them was excellent. It was called <i>Computer Mathematics</i> and it was extremely well done. It covered binary in detail and then showed how things were done in base 8 and maybe base 12 or base 16. I wish I still had my copy, as it was an exemplary "teaching machine" device.</p>

<p>Fair enough. I generated the base-phi image for my own benefit (I was trying to visualise how "carry" worked in a system where it "spills" in both directions). As a mathematician (also a CS major from a while back) I like to have several ways to view a concept -- algebraic, algorithmic, visual. I put it up because I thought it was interesting. My initial response to Daniel was to see what others thought. If the consensus is "no" due to the reasons stated, then that is fine. I will think about whether I write something more coherent on odometers. (the image is sort of like ticker tape from an odometer... 8-) --<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewKepert_6eb5.html" title="User:AndrewKepert">AndrewKepert</a> 12:46, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)~</p>
<hr />
<p>Is there already a sort of schematic image of an odometer and/or digital clock somewhere that we could just borrow (legally)? I'm fairly good at mechanical drawing, but doing it right could take a fair amount of time. I think that a hundreds disk, a tens disk, and a ones disk arranged horizontally and showing the appropriate "kicker knobs" could be very helpful when compared with a similar counter of a few disks for representing binary numbers. If we could animate the images it would be even neater.</p>
<p>Sorry about my mention of "summary execution" above, but that's the way it felt to me at first. After I actually saw the graphics I decided that the little vertical strips didn't say anything to me, although they were attractive in some way, and that they probably needed to go.</p>

<dd>Here's what I would suggest (note, I'm talking about ideas, which are not copyrightable, not text, which we can't copy willy-nilly):
<ul>
<li>Read web pages on binary numbers and see how they explain binary math. Don't set out on a quest to find an image or an odometer image. Quest to find good explanations.</li>
<li>Read introductory computer science and mathematics textbooks and see how they introduce the concept. Also try encyclopedias.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Which seem to be the best explanations? Enlist the help of a non-technical person you know to evaluate the best few. Just be careful, if you set out after images, merely because I removed an image or because someone added an image not to everyone's liking, your focus may not result in the best possible article. Odometer images may not help explain this concept better, or maybe they will. I think it's better to figure out what works well (not necessarily limiting ourselves to paper formats, of course) and do that. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 01:53, Sep 21, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>One more thing: bear in mind that not every web browser can display images and there are also sight-impaired readers. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 01:55, Sep 21, 2003 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sounds reasonable to me. I'm not stuck on images. Speaking of sight-impaired users, when I use my IBM to view these pages I get huge characters as a default, and I have to hit control-[ four times to get the page to manageable size. Switching to the Wiktionary at that point gives characters that appear to be about 2 point, and the same thing happens if you send somebody e-mail from within the Wikipedia environment. But on my Mac I don't see this problem. Maybe it's just because my IBM is running an old copy of Netscape (but then so is my Mac), but it looks like something funny is going on.</p>
<p>If a web browser can't handle images the user will by now be used to the situation, and also probably will experience difficulties visiting most WWW sites. I guess it would not be a good idea to put crucial info in an image that was not covered elsewhere. As for the sight-impaired user, it is always possible to have a clickable link to a larger image. And sight-impaired users are probably adept at grabbing an image and blowing it up to a size they can view. That can't be any fun, however.</p>
<p>There is much to be said for presenting the same information in different formats. Some people (Einstein included) think in images first and then laboriously do the math. Other people (like me) can't visualize much more than a circle, and need to get the info in words. Some people may even need spoken words.</p>
<p>The Tutor Text I mentioned is excellent. I wonder if any libraries have kept it. Maybe they have regarded it as an ephemeral publication and purged it from their stacks. The two other books in that series were dogs and so the whole series may often have been purged.</p>

<p>Some thoughts about refactoring:</p>
<p>We have an article <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_numbering_formats.html" title="Computer numbering formats">Computer numbering formats</a>, which was essentially lifted from another public-domain source. It's a good introduction to the binary system in general, but duplicates a lot of what we have here, and is long, ugly, and unwikified. Probably one of our first goals should be to merge that article with <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_numeral_system.html" title="Binary numeral system">Binary numeral system</a>; the term "computer numbering formats" is pretty vague, and that article should probably redirect to <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_numeral_system.html" title="Binary numeral system">Binary numeral system</a>.</p>
<p>A whole article could probably be written simply on how to count in binary. One could simply say "counting in binary is exactly the same as counting in decimal", which is true, but the concept is so new to many people that a thorough kindergarten-level explanation would be quite useful. I propose Counting in binary be split off from this article for that reason.</p>
<p>An entire article, possibly several articles, could be written on binary arithmetic. Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division should of course be covered; other techniques such as left/right shifting to perform multiplication/division by powers of two could be covered here as well. I propose <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_arithmetic.html" title="Binary arithmetic">Binary arithmetic</a> be split off for this purpose.</p>
<p>We've already split off <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitwise_operation.html" title="Bitwise operation">Bitwise operation</a> to discuss AND, OR, XOR, etc. That article currently discusses shifting, which is often classified as a bitwise operation even though it is not. That article is probably good as it is, although more could certainly be added by way of explaining some of the really cool (to geeks, at least) things you can do with bitwise operations, such as AND for checking flags, OR for setting multiple flags, XOR for clearing a register, etc. I'm not entirely sure that bitwise operations should be discussed at all in this article, since they have very little to do with the binary numeral system.</p>
<p>Comparing binary with other numbering systems could take volumes. Obviously, some comparison to decimal is good to have; hex and octal are also useful, since those are also commonly seen in computing environments. Any more than that may be excessive. Since the splitting off of the other topics mentioned above would result in an article dominated by the "Binary compared with..." sections, I'd probably vote to split that section off also, unless we can fill the void with something else useful. It may also make sense to merge <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_coded_decimal.html" title="Binary coded decimal">Binary coded decimal</a> with this article (though it is not really part of the binary numeral system), as well as <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_coding.html" title="Binary coding">Binary coding</a>, which seems to be an aborted and rather poor attempt at summarizing binary in general. <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truncated_binary_encoding.html" title="Truncated binary encoding">Truncated binary encoding</a> may also need refactoring. Perhaps these can be brought under a different heading, along with things like <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gray_code.html" title="Gray code">Gray code</a>, which talk about using binary as a form of symbolic code, rather than as a numeral system.</p>
<p>A good thing to keep in mind is that this article is about the binary <i>numeral system</i>. That is, it's about how to represent numbers in a symbolic format with a radix of 2. It should definitely not talk much, if at all, about binary versus ASCII files, hardware implementations of binary numerals, binary trees, etc.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 17:31, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The important question is the depth of the article; do we really want to cover those topic throughtly? Articles in wikipedia should not be something like you found in textbooks. The purpose of them should not teach people how to handle binary numeral systems. I think it would be nice to focus on more about topics interesting for the general audience, things like 1.1 cannot be expressed in binary system, history. I'd rather create an article that is compact but well-written than spliting off subtopics. <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subprogram.html" title="Subprogram">Subprogram</a> is a good example. Many subtle discussions are completely omitted, instead the article discusses why you want to use subprograms and will discuss history. Perhaps detailed discussions can be immigrated to wikibook. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 18:24, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, I think this topic should be covered thoroughly. Not to make the already-present geek-bias in Wikipedia even stronger, but to present the topic(s) in a way that non-geeks can understand. It's unfortunate that, in a world so centered around computers and digital devices, the majority of the population still has barely any notion of how the underlying numeral system works. Granted, most people don't care, but for those that do, it'd be nice to provide an accessible introduction for them. We can also focus on the interesting things that arise, such as 1.1 (decimal) being an irrational number in the binary system, but I hardly think that's a matter of interest to a general audience! At any rate, in order to even begin explaining that fact, it's necessary to explain in depth how the binary numeral system works. What good is an article about the binary numeral system if it doesn't even tell the reader how to use it or why it's useful? -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 20:36, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>correction:</i> 1.1 is not irrational in binary numeral system. It is a rational <i>number</i> (11/10) and consequently its <i>representation</i> in any radix-based numeration system is a <i>numeral</i> that either terminates (no) or recurs (yes). In this case 1.1<sub>ten</sub> = 1.0 0011 0011 0011 ...<sub>two</sub>. See <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal.html" title="Decimal">decimal</a> or my comment below.</dd>

<p>I like the above observations. I have seen some entries where so much technical jargon is used that only the person who is already an expert in the field can read the discussion. It would be hard to find anything incorrect in such an article, but it would also be hard to find anything useful to the general reader who wants to find an entryway to a new subject.</p>
<p>I am not a mathematician. I did not have a good background in mathematics, and proved that to myself when I got into a physics major at a major univeristy -- and back out again. Nevertheless, I am interested in the subject. I can remember having 3 calculus teachers. The first-semester calculus teacher worked calculus problems at blinding speed, asked, "Does everybody understand?" Saw the engineering students in the front row all nod "yes", and went on to the next problem. I never learned a thing from her lectures. The next trimester I had a teacher from South America who never wrote more than a single blackboard full of stuff per class session, but he let students understand why he was performing the operations that got him the answers. Frequently Dr. Restrepo would finish with a problem that looked like it would take all night to calculate and then he would prod us into seeing how we could do it in our heads. The third trimester I was stuck with the chairman of the math department who surely could do all the math but could not teach much better than the first teacher.</p>
<p>Eventually I remediated a lot of my math education on my own, and what I learned is that it is not mastering the operations or remembering the formulas that is crucial, but understanding why the operations and the formulas are as they are.</p>
<p>The <i>Computer Mathematics</i> book I mentioned earlier is an exemplary textbook. It was followed by many "teaching machine" texts that were poor to middling, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyway, if memory serves me at all after 50 years, the key to my own understanding of a lot of this stuff was understanding what we are actually doing when we count. That's why I agree with the idea that this article should be supplemented by one on "counting in binary." And, is there an article on "counting"?</p>
<p>As an item of possibly related interest: There was a great deal of discussion a few years ago on why Chinese students seemed to have so much less trouble with math than did American kids. One of the advantages they have is that from the very beginning they understand the format, J(1000)+K(1000)+L(100)+M(10)+N -- because that is the way you <b>say</b> a number in Chinese (and Japanese too) (except that you don't actually say the "plus" signs): J wan K qian L bai M shi N. To me, growing up, it was a major discovery to realize that "fourteen" meant "four plus ten" and that "ten" and "teen" were really the same word. Maybe some people define "fourteen" as "the number that comes after thirteen" all their lives and never get beyond that truism.</p>

<p>My little images have provoked much discussion, and now the structure of the whole page is in question. 8-) As I see it, the page starts out okay, but then wallows. I would go:</p>
<ul>
<li>intro (currently good)</li>
<li>representation of whole numbers/integers (currently ok)
<ul>
<li>Uniqueness of representation for whole numbers (This is really a key point - there is a one-to-one correspondence between bit strings and whole numbers. This could be mentioned, then explained in the conversion section)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>counting (needs work, and maybe a discussion of the odometer)</li>
<li>arithmetic (ok, better examples would help, or maybe a separate page)</li>
<li>conversions from other representations such as decimal (condense, and maybe shift octal and hexadecimal to a page where appliations to computing are being discussed)</li>
<li>Representation of real numbers -- rewrite "fractional" section to include recurring expansions, irrationals, non-uniqueness of repn: 1=0.111111..., somewhat akin to what I did in <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal.html" title="Decimal">decimal</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_mean_base.html" title="Golden mean base">golden mean base</a>.</li>
<li>applications to computing, such as bitwise ops, one-complement vs two-complement for negs, octal and hexadecimal representation, binary encoded decimal, etc -- list these with links to external pages</li>

<p>Now that you focus attention on that introduction, I don't think it is as effective as it could be. The average reader will be snowed by that first paragraph and will be looking for something to latch on to. I think it might start with things that readers might have experienced and might find familiar. Most people have seen binary written out in 1s and 0s. That might be compared to a picture of lights on an antique computer showing the same binary number, and by a sound recording of a corresponding series of prominent beeps and mild clicks. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">Patrick0Moran</a> 01:05, 22 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we have to be clear on what <i>practical</i> and <i>simple</i> are supposed to mean; otherwise, the above sounds like a contributor's own POV. Did the ancient pre-literate peoples of the world use unary to count herds of sheep? Young American children sometimes give their age by holding up "this many" fingers; that's certainly practical for kids too young to understand numerals. On the other hand, when I teach math I always introduce addition by using <a href="../../../u/n/a/Unary.html" title="Unary">unary</a>.

<p>I rephrased the intro a bit and removed some of the questionable statements (the bits regarding unary or binary being the simplest, and the vague stuff about early 20th century computers (were there digital computers in the early 20th century?) being based on on/off Boolean algebra). A clear, concise, and correct explanation of why computers use binary would be wonderful, but I am not the person to write it. Such an explanation likely belongs in the "History" section, anyway. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 20:15, 25 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>p.s. - Also, I think it's fairly important to avoid using literal numerals in the prose sections of this article, especially numerals with a 1 or 0 in them. One of the examples I rephrased was about how 999 (decimal) has 10 digits in binary. The mathematically precise approach would be to subscript every literal, but to me it seems more natural to say "ten", "two", etc. to avoid any ambiguity, particularly before the notation of subscripting has been explained. It should always be totally clear what number or system we're talking about. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 20:22, 25 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Temporarily removed the following text</i>:</p>
<p>In binary, multiplying by two amounts to moving all digits one position to the left and inserting a leftmost zero. This observation leads to the following faster conversion algorithm, a variant of the <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horner_scheme.html" title="Horner scheme">Horner scheme</a> which does not require the computation of the powers of two: start with a result of zero and scan over the binary string from left to right. If the current digit in the string is a zero, multiply the result by two; if the current digit is a one, multiply the result by two and add one. Continue until you hit the right end of the binary string. Example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>To convert the binary number 101101001 into decimal: 0 × 2 + 1 = 1, 1 × 2 = 2; 2 × 2 + 1 = 5; 5 × 2 + 1 = 11; 11 × 2 = 22; 22 × 2 + 1 = 45; 45 × 2 = 90; 90 × 2 = 180; 180 × 2 + 1 = 361.</dd>

<p>I think the Fu Xi sequence of the Yi Jing probably deserves a mention here. It predates Pingala by 2-3000 years, although it does not define any rules for arithmetic, it does define a binary representation of the numbers 0-64. As I understand it, it is where Leibniz got the idea from.

<dd>It may deserve a brief mention, but from what I can tell (please correct me if I'm wrong), it's not really a numeral system. There are certainly some principles in common with binary representation---six two-state entities in each hexagram, giving a total of 2<sup>6</sup>=64 unique symbols---but I don't see how the symbols in the I Ching comprise a numeral system, unless there are numerical relationships between the symbols. Do such relationships exist? -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 16:10, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>[P0M:] Leibniz was startled when he saw a Song dynasty chart that arranges the hexagrams in what appears to be binary order, but two tbings have decided people like Joseph Needham (<i>Science and Civilization in China</i>) against the idea that they functioned as numbers. (1) They were never used to count anything. (1) In the series that shocked Leibniz, the numbers go from 00 to the "binary" equivalent of 31 and then from 64 back to the "binary" equivalent of 32. The reason is that when they are arranged around a circle each "1" is matched with a "0". A better way to look at it would be to say that each +1 is matched with a -1 so that the sum along a diameter is 0. The whole idea is of male parts fitting into and filling female parts. So the connection between hexagrams and binary numbers is only a strange footnote on the apparent similarity of symbols. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 19:02, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Interesting, though I don't really see the particular ordering in a circular arrangement that results in a complementary relationship between opposite symbols; symbol 01 (||||||) would be opposite symbol 02 (::::::); symbol 03 (|:::|:) opposite symbol 50 (:|||:|); 04 opposite 49, 5 opposite 35. Also, a linear arrangement that would result in what we today call "binary order" (positional numbering with significance ascending to the left) would arrange the symbols as one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>02, 23, 08, 20, 16...</li>
<li>02, 24, 07, 19, 15...</li>
<li>01, 43, 14, 34, 09...</li>
<li>01, 44, 13, 33, 10...</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a name for the set of numbers, where all the 1s in the binary representation are in one block?</p>
<p>Such a number is the product of a power of two and a number one less than a power of two. All known <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_number.html" title="Perfect number">perfect numbers</a> belong to this set. The first few are</p>

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 48, ...

<p>In the division example of 11011/101 the answer is reported to be 101<sub>2</sub>. Should not the answer actually be <b>101<sub>11</sub></b> so all digits are in binary? --Zippanova 21:59, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No! Reading all digits as binary, the base subscript <sub>11</sub> would mean three, which is not the base we want. Then, one might write <b>101<sub>10</sub></b> instead, which, reading all as binary, means <i>101-read-in-base-two</i>, i.e. five, as desired. However, reading it as decimal, it means <i>101-read-in-base-ten</i>, i.e. hundred-and-one, which is incorrect. In fact, adopting a convention about always writing the base subscript in the base in question will cause no end of confusion, as the base would <i>always</i> appear as <b>10</b>. Instead, the arbitrary convention is that the base subscript is always written in decimal.--<a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoe_b8ad.html" title="User:Noe">Niels Ø</a> 12:15, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>there is a card trick where you have 6 cards. the numerals are written in base 10 but arranged in base 2. for instance the card that starts with 4 has 4-7(100-111), 8-15(1000-1111), 20-27(10100-10111)... in others words if the 4s place is one the card has that number(shown in base 10 of course) the cards start with 6 different numbers 1,2,4,8,16,and 32. anyway you have someone think of a number and pick all the cards that have that number and hand you the cards, then you just add up the first number on the cards mentally and name the number. example: they think of 42, 42 is on the card that starts with 4,8, and 32. 32+8+4=42. don't know if you find this interesting. 24.237.198.91 01:27, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
