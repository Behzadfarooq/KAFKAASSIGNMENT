<p>Hello, good work on <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Graham_61b3.html" title="Matthew Graham">Matthew Graham</a>, and thanks for the contribution. However, you did not provide any references or sources in the article. Keeping Wikipedia accurate and verifiable is very important, and as you might be aware there is currently a push to encourage editors to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite the sources</a> they used when adding content. From what websites, books, or other places did you learn the information that you added to Matthew Graham? Would it be possible for you to mention them in the article? You can simply add links, or see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITET_7f44.html" title="WP:CITET">WP:CITET</a> if you wish to review some of the different citation methods.

<p>Bingo, you really need to let us know, at least in the edit summary, where the info comes from. I don't read the OG forums much these days, and I had to troll through them to determine if the information was even reliable. This will solve a lot of potential problems when people who are not au fait with the latest news look in on your edits and wonder whether you're just being a rumor-monger or a crank. (It does happen - we've had a spate of people insisting on the "Planet 14" hoax title, for example, even after drwho-online stated that it was mistaken.) --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 04:54, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bingo!</p>
<p>You had no reason to know, but the reason why <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenny_Everett_0a8c.html" title="Kenny Everett">Kenny Everett</a> is now in <i>Category:LGBT people from England</i> and <i>Category:LGBT comedians</i> instead of <i>Category:Lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people</i> is because I saw that last category needed a lot of diffusion - as did the category <i>Category:LGBT people from the United Kingdom</i>. So I've been spending a fair amount of time moving people out of that category, and setting up new subcategories, and I don't really want to see people being moved back into the top-level category unless there's an overwhelming reason why they should be there as well as in their various sub-categories. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonmei_2f1b.html" title="User:Yonmei">Yonmei</a> 08:12, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Wikipedia gets thousands of images uploaded every day, and in order to verify that the images can be legally used on Wikipedia, the source and copyright status must be indicated. Images need to have an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">image tag</a> applied to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a> indicating the copyright status of the image. This uniform and easy-to-understand method of indicating the license status allows potential re-users of the images to know what they are allowed to do with the images.</p>
