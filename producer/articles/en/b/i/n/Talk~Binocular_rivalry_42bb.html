	    <p>I would like to introduce my own thoughts on how binocular rivalry could be associated with epilepsy and/or seizures during certain activities and a possible means of reducing the impact of those activities.</p>
<p>I apologise if this is not the greatest grammatical work ever constructed, but I don't have much time at the moment. Additionally, I am not interested in creating a PhD-style paper with the intention of impressing mankind with my greatness&#160;:)</p>
<p>Before I go any further, let me summarise the key areas of this "paper":</p>
<p>- Binocular Rivalry - Epilepsy - Seizures - Stress - Brain Dominance - Abnormal dominance - Brain Hemispheres - Field of vision / field of view - Photosensitive epilepsy - Computer games - Computer monitors</p>
<p>Try this website for experiencing the effects of hemispheric dominance for yourself: <a href="http://brain.web-us.com/brain/Visual_Test_Hemispheric_Dominance.htm" class="external free" title="http://brain.web-us.com/brain/Visual_Test_Hemispheric_Dominance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://brain.web-us.com/brain/Visual_Test_Hemispheric_Dominance.htm</a></p>
<p>Let me try to list the points that have inspired my ideas:</p>
<p>- It has hypothesised that the binocular rivalry phenomenon is an index of the switch rate between cerebral hemispheres. That is, there is a direct connection between binocular rivalry and the processing performed by each hemisphere of the brain and the rate at which switching occurs. See the works of Professor J. Pettigrew for more information. For example, <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/nuq/jack/procroysoc.html" class="external free" title="http://www.uq.edu.au/nuq/jack/procroysoc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uq.edu.au/nuq/jack/procroysoc.html</a></p>
<p>- Visual information is presented in two fields of vision. One on the left and the other on the right. Both eyes contribute to the processing of visual material on the left. Both eyes contribute to the processing of visual material on the right. Visual information to the left is processed on the right side of the brain. Visual information to the right is processed on the left side of the brain. Most processing occurs in the hemisphere opposite the field of view that the "focal image* occurs on. That is, if you are concentrating (focusing) on an image to the left, most processing (work) will be performed in the right hemisphere. If you are concentrating (focusing) on an image to the right, most processing (work) will be performed in the left hemisphere. People with conditions such as mixed brain dominance can force their brain to process visual stimuli in a desired hemisphere by positioning themselves in a particular location relative to the focal image. For example, in a classroom situation they can force information to be processed in the left hemisphere be sitting on the left side of the classroom.</p>
<p>- Binocular rivalry has an associated rate at which alternation between the two sides (left and right) occurs. Professor Pettigrew suggests that bipolar disorder may be associated with a slower rate. Others have suggested the schizophrenia may be associated with an "abnormal" rate.</p>
<p>- Using a computer screen or playing a computer game can, if the above information is correct, involve a hemispheric switch in the brain's processing. The rate at which this occurs has two contributing factors. Because of the close proximity of the computer (or game) screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>A switch will occur when the subject (user) moves his/her head from one side of the screen to the other because the dominant "field" has changed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A switch can occur during a routine "binocular rivalry change" (which may take place as slowly as once every 20 seconds, or it may occur very frequently depending on the predisposition of the individual). The reason that a switch could occur in this case is due to the distance to the screen relative to the distance between the eyes. The screen is now in a different field of vision and the information coming from the screen is therefore processed on the other side of the brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>- Epilepsy and/or seizures can in some patients be triggered by visual stimulus (photosensitive epilepsy). It may also leave them stressed and exhausted while playing and also for some time (a day or more) after playing (like myself).</p>
<p>- Epilepsy can and usually does result from abnormal activity within the brain.</p>
<p>- Epilepsy can be characterised by abnormal activity at a hemispheric level. Sometimes surgery is performed to completely separate the two hemispheres. For others it can require removal of an entire hemisphere.</p>
<p>Can anyone see where I am going with this? Anyone at all? The extra work being performed by the brain during such activities can take a toll on the brain.</p>
<p>If you are in a situation where you suffer from the effects of using games/monitors for prolonged periods may I suggest the following strategy. If it works it works. If it doesn't it doesn't, but I believe it is worth a try:</p>
<p>When using a game or a computer screen, position the screen so that it is either to the left or to the right of your face. Alternatively, keep your head where it normally is but face towards one side of the screen. This should ensure that the visual stimulus is always being processed on the same side of your brain. This may not be terribly easy at first but your ability to do so should improve ove time. In the case of computers a wireless keyboard would be of assistance.</p>
<p>Kind regards and good luck.</p>
