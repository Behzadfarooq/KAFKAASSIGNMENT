<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinaryTed_Star_Destroyer_c0b1.html" title="Edit section: Imperial-class Star Destroyer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer</span></h2>
<p>The term "Star Destroyer" most often refers to the common dagger-hulled combat vessels used by the Empire in the three films of the original Star Wars trilogy. These ships are commonly referred to as <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyers, their official designation as of a short time after the declaration of the newly formed Empire. During the earliest weeks of Imperial regime and the latter days of the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clone_Wars_%28Star_Wars%29_b249.html" title="Clone Wars (Star Wars)">Clone Wars</a>, the class was known as the <i>Imperator</i>-class. This is regarded as the most common class of Star Destroyer, and one of the most important symbols of the Galactic Empire, serving the Imperial fleet for at least five decades. When the term "Star Destroyer" is used without further qualification, it usually refers to ships of this class.</p>
<p>All <i>Imperial</i>-class variants are said to be 1,600 meters (approximately one mile) long, with three large and four small engines capable of accelerating the ship with a force of several thousand <i><a href="../../../a/c/c/Acceleration_due_to_gravity.html" title="Acceleration due to gravity">g</a></i> and a hyperdrive capable of carrying them across the galaxy in a matter of weeks. <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyers carry a complement of at least 37,000 staff, including officers, technicians and computer operators, fighter pilots, and support-craft crew. These vessels also carry a full complement of 9,700 <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormtroopers.html" title="Stormtroopers">stormtroopers</a> which brings the overall total to 46,700 men. In service with the New Republic (forged by the heroes of the <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel_Alliance_d8fe.html" title="Rebel Alliance">Rebel Alliance</a> after the end of the movie saga) the crews were reduced to about 28,000 men. Although some <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mon_Calamari_Cruiser_5fdf.html" title="Mon Calamari Cruiser">Mon Calamari Cruisers</a> are considered equivalent to the Imperial Star Destroyers in space combat, the latter has no documented equal in its multiple roles for support and planetary assault.</p>
<p>There are two subtypes of <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyers: the Mark I and Mark II designs. This distinction that seems to reflect the two distinct VFX models used in the Star Wars films; on a Mark I ship, the tractor beam array at the top of the superstructure sometimes stands up to look like a tall, X-shaped structure, while the Mark II has the same array on its side to look flat. At other times the Mark I array appears in repose, as in the Battles of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hoth_76f2.html" title="Battle of Hoth">Hoth</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Endor</a>. More permanent variations include differences in weaponry (discussed below), and three small baffles arranged 60Â° apart around the main exhaust nozzles at the stern of the ISD-I. The Mark I was the only ISD type featured in <i><a href="../../../a/_/n/A_New_Hope_840f.html" title="A New Hope">A New Hope</a></i>. A mixture of Mark I and Mark II vessels appear in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Empire_Strikes_Back_1636.html" title="The Empire Strikes Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a></i> and <i>Return of the Jedi</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinaryTed_Star_Destroyer_c0b1.html" title="Edit section: Naming debate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Naming debate</span></h4>
<p>While most Star Wars lore describes the Star Destroyer as an "<i>Imperial</i>-class" ship, an alternative designation <i>Imperator</i>-class also exists, and the priority of the two names is a source of contention between some fans.</p>
<p>The <i>Imperator</i>-class name apparently originates in a set of blueprints produced in 1978 attributed to "<a href="http://www.geoffreymandel.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.geoffreymandel.com/" rel="nofollow">Geoffrey Mandel</a>" and packaged with Lucasfilm copyright. One Geoffrey Mandel, possibly the same man, is a well-known TV and film graphic artist, perhaps best-known for his work on <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Geoffrey_Mandel" class="external text" title="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Geoffrey_Mandel" rel="nofollow">Star Trek</a>. However some fans allege that in 1978 he was a nineteen-year-old fan. These fans â€” proponents for the second-generation "<i>Imperial</i>-class" literature â€” allege that the blueprints were a work of fan-art (albeit a high-quality piece). They also cite the differences between the drawings and the actual ISD.</p>
<p>However, the Lucasfilm copyright marks on the packaging undermine this theory. Further, differences between the drawing and the actual Star Destroyers seen in the films are present in other official drawings and spec sheets, as seen in the ISB or EGVV. <i><b>What are these?</b></i></p>
<p>Copies of Mandel's blueprints continued to circulate in fandom and collector shops. Twenty years later, they were recognized as "rare but official" early material by online fans including the <a href="http://theforce.net/swtc/isd.html" class="external text" title="http://theforce.net/swtc/isd.html" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Technical Commentaries</a> website. The label was subsequently reaffirmed and reconciled in the <i>Incredible Cross-Sections</i> guide for <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge_of_the_Sith_bd67.html" title="Revenge of the Sith">Revenge of the Sith</a>: it explains that "<i>Imperator</i>-class" was the original, 'correct' designation, but was politically re-dubbed <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer after the Jedi Purge.</p>
<p>The <i>Imperial</i>-class designation, which seems to have originated in <i>Star Wars</i> <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">Role-playing game</a> material in the later 1980s, remains the designation used in most official material. <i>Incredible Cross-Sections</i> allows that the type was renamed to <i>Imperial</i>-class following the declaration of the Galactic Empire by <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a>, while the official <a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/republicattackcruiser/?id=eu" class="external text" title="http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/republicattackcruiser/?id=eu" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Databank</a> leaves the exact relationship between the prototype <i>Imperator</i>-class and the iconic <i>Imperial</i>-class of the movies somewhat vague. The two names will be used interchangeably in this document, as both are official.</p>

<p>The main bridge of all known Imperial ships has the same basic layout. The outermost part features nine triangular viewports. The center contains two crewpits which house the control consoles for the ship; between these, the command walkway. To the right and left sides of the bridge are two alcoves containing the weapons and defense stations. Behind the bridge are the communications stations, a turbolift, and a HoloNet pod for ship-to-ship communications.</p>
<p>On the level directly beneath the bridge is the main navigation complex.</p>

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinaryTed_Star_Destroyer_c0b1.html" title="Edit section: Weapons">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Weapons</span></h5>
<p>A single Imperial Star Destroyer is said to have sufficient firepower to overwhelm almost any warship deployed by enemies of the Empire, and to be capable of reducing a hostile planet to an uninhabitable ruin. Later <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel_Alliance_d8fe.html" title="Rebel Alliance">Rebel Alliance</a> ships, particularly <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mon_Calamari_Cruiser_5fdf.html" title="Mon Calamari Cruiser">Mon Calamari Cruisers</a>, could be a match for a Star Destroyer individually - although greatly outnumbered as a class.</p>
<p>The ISD-I carries batteries of four massive double-barreled turrets on either side of the main superstructure, with smaller visible gun-emplacements on the centerline and in the notches on the edge of the hull. On the ISD-II, eight-barreled guns in open mountings replace the larger turrets.</p>
<p>Published specifications contrast with this appearance. They give the ISD-I an armament of 60 <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbolasers.html" title="Turbolasers">turbolasers</a>, 60 <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion_cannons.html" title="Ion cannons">ion cannons</a>, and 10 <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractor_beam.html" title="Tractor beam">tractor beam</a> projectors. They also give the ISD-II 50 turbolasers, 50 heavy turbolasers, 20 ion cannons, and 10 tractor beam projectors.</p>
<p>Both models can house a full wing of 72 Imperial <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Fighter_13f3.html" title="TIE Fighter">TIEs</a> organized into 12-fighter squadrons. At the time of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Yavin_6f1b.html" title="Battle of Yavin">Battle of Yavin</a>, a standard wing included 4 <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Fighter_13f3.html" title="TIE Fighter">TIE Fighter</a> squadrons, 1 <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Interceptor_365b.html" title="TIE Interceptor">TIE Interceptor</a> squadron, and 1 <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Bomber_b02a.html" title="TIE Bomber">TIE Bomber</a> squadron. By the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Battle of Endor</a>, one of the fighter squadrons was replaced with an interceptor squadron. At least one ship, NRS <i>Rebel Dream</i>, featured an enlarged hangar bay, but it is unknown if a greater number of fighters were carried.</p>
<p>Star Destroyers also carry ground forces. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Expanded_Universe_9ad4.html" title="Star Wars Expanded Universe">Expanded Universe</a> literature places several thousand troops, a prefabricated base for rapid subjugation of rebellious territories, 20 <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-AT_3fef.html" title="AT-AT">AT-ATs</a>, and 30 <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-ST_1b54.html" title="AT-ST">AT-STs</a>. According to such sources, Imperial Star Destroyers also carried support craft and drop ships, including the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walker_Dropship_f706.html" title="Walker Dropship">Y85 Titan Dropship</a> and the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_landing_craft.html" title="Imperial landing craft">Sentinel-class Shuttle</a>. They also had 8 Lambda-class shuttles.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geodesic_dome.html" title="Geodesic dome">geodesic domes</a> located on and around the bridge superstructure of Star Destroyers and related ships are a topic of debate among some fans. Some say they are sensor globes; some say they are shield generators.</p>
<p>When the <i>Executor'</i>s globe exploded during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Battle of Endor</a>, a crewman said that the shields were down. Some fans said the two events happening at the same time linked them canonically; others disagreed, saying the timing was coincidental.</p>
<p>Official literature has affirmed both sides of this argument.</p>
<p><i>Inside the Worlds of Star Wars</i> shows the bridge area of the Executor and declares the globes to be sensor globes. However, it also places backup bridge shield generators in the base of the domes. This would neatly explain why the bridge was vulnerable to being rammed by an errant A-Wing after the attack on the globes, while favoring the sensor globe explanation.</p>
<p>Many older reference books such as <i>The Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessels</i> and <i>The Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology</i> label the pair of globes on top of the bridge as "Deflector Shield Generators".</p>
<p>The use of the globes as shield generators is also evident in <a href="../../../l/u/c/LucasArts_d061.html" title="LucasArts">LucasArts</a>' <i>X-Wing</i> and <i>TIE Fighter</i> computer games, where the shields of a Star Destroyer are knocked out if the two generators above the bridge are destroyed. This strategy is also used during combat against Star Destroyers in <i><a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogue_Squadron_II%7E_Rogue_Leader_7774.html" title="Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader">Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader</a></i> for Nintendo Gamecube, where the globes are referred to as shield generators - along with the hemisphere on the ship's underside. In the MMORPG Star Wars Galaxies, the globes are clearly labeled in the targeting system as "Shield" and "Secondary Shield"</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Edlund_ae2e.html" title="Richard Edlund">Richard Edlund</a>, who was in charge of visual effects for Return of the Jedi, described the spheres as "radar domes" in a 1983 interview by <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinefex.html" title="Cinefex">Cinefex</a> magazine in which he discussed the demise of the 'Executor'.</p>

<p><i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyers had a distinguished career in the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Starfleet_c6d3.html" title="Imperial Starfleet">Imperial Starfleet</a>, where they symbolized the Empire's military might, for better or worse. The name of the prototype <i>Imperator</i>, bestowed in the last years of the Old Republic, is in the real-world the Latin word for <b>commander</b> as well as <b>emperor</b>, and later names such as <i>Imperial</i> and <i>Empire</i> (the name of the lead ship of the Mark II subclass) stressed the role of the class as primary instruments of military autocracy.</p>
<p>The exact number of these ships in service is disputed among fans. No more than about forty are seen on-screen in <i>Return of the Jedi.</i> According to official literature, the Imperial Fleet had a peak strength of "over 25,000 Star Destroyers."</p>
<p>This official figure is accepted by the majority of fans. A small but vocal minority prefer <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">fanon</a> figures giving the Empire millions of Imperial Star Destroyers. Another small but vocal minority of fans suggest that no more than a few thousand of the 25,000 were <i>Imperial</i>-class ships, with the majority being smaller types such as <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Destroyer_09b7.html#Victory-class_Star_Destroyer" title="Star Destroyer"><i>Victory</i>-class</a> ships.</p>
<p>Some Star Destroyers were destroyed in the fractious warfare that followed the death of Emperor <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> at Endor. Others heeded the summons of Palpatine's clone, and rallied secretly in the <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Core_6c97.html" title="Deep Core">Deep Core</a>. Others defected to (or were captured by) Rebels. The majority of the surrendered vessels were decommissioned, but some remained in service in the New Republic's navy; (<a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Destroyer_09b7.html#New_Republic_service" title="Star Destroyer">see below</a>).</p>
<p><i>Imperial</i>-class star destroyers are identified as the centerpiece of Superiority Fleets, used by local sector-level forces to scour Imperial space clear of enemy warships (i.e., Rebel ships). Within each Superiority Fleet, six ISDs served as the command ships for component formations known as "Battle Squadrons."</p>
<p>ISDs have also been observed to operate more or less independently, or in pairs as guard ships on important worlds. By the time of the final peace between the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperial_Remnant_c146.html" title="Imperial Remnant">remnants of the Empire</a> and the heirs of the Rebellion, the eight remaining sector fleets of what was left of Imperial Space still centered around the <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer, with around a dozen such ships per Sector, but they often operated as battle lines without support from smaller vessels, and may have been refitted to carry more defensive weaponry on their own hulls, making them more capable of fending off fighter and gunship attack.</p>
<p>Some fans claim the ships were light warships, equating them with real-life <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyers</a>. Much larger ships appear within the Star Wars saga; these would then be Star <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">Cruisers</a>, and Star <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreadnaught.html" title="Dreadnaught">Dreadnaughts</a>. Some warships smaller than Star Destroyers would then be Star <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frigate.html" title="Frigate">Frigates</a>. However, even the largest of the bigger warships are often called "Star Destroyers," as <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_Ackbar_0d5f.html" title="Admiral Ackbar">Admiral Ackbar</a> refers to the 'Executor' in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Battle of Endor</a>. Further irking these fans is the fact that frigates and cruisers a small fraction of the size of a Star Destroyer are also present in Star Wars.</p>
<p>Scores of <i>Imperial</i>-class ships are shown as forming the vanguard of Imperial battle-fleets. At the Battle of Endor in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, there were about forty <i>Imperial</i>-class destroyers and one <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Destroyer_09b7.html#Executor-class_Star_Dreadnaught" title="Star Destroyer">Super Star Destroyer</a>.</p>
<p>In other Star Wars lore, a battlefleet charged with defending the Imperial Core Worlds had one Super Star Destroyer and fifty-seven other capital ships, while Grand Admiral Josef Grunger's fleet consisted of one Super Star Destroyer, thirty Star Destroyers, and almost 200 smaller ships, and the fleet assembled by <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_Daala_7672.html" title="Admiral Daala">Admiral Daala</a> included one Super Star Destroyer, more than forty <i>Imperial</i>-class ships, and more than a hundred <i>Victory</i>-class ships. A fleet at the center of the Empire's strategies for defending the Outer Rim, <i>Black Sword Command</i>, contained about forty <i>Imperial</i>-class and <i>Victory</i>-class Star Destroyers and three Super Star Destroyers, but one of these SSDs was simply fitting out at a shipyard within the command's jurisdiction, and it is not impossible that at least one of the others was merely under construction.</p>

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinaryTed_Star_Destroyer_c0b1.html" title="Edit section: New Republic service">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New Republic service</span></h5>
<p>The <i>Imperial</i>-class (or <i>Imperator</i>-class) Star Destroyer has also appeared in the forces of other space-defense navies. A number were commissioned into the private defense-fleet of the shipyard system of Kuat where they were initially designed, while the independent monarchy that ruled the <a href="../../../h/a/p/Hapes_Consortium_c39c.html" title="Hapes Consortium">Hapes Star Cluster</a> was able to seize some vessels during their war against Imperial occupation. After the fall of the Empire, Star Destroyers were most visible in the armadas of the New Republic, the successor-state formed by the heroes of the Rebellion such as Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo. The refits implemented by that government often involved structural modifications, and generally required a much smaller crew. These revisions resulted in a lack of capability to deploy planetary-assault soldiers and greatly reduced endurance, as the New Republic Defense Force doctrine operated ships on relatively short patrols and deemphasized armies of occupation.</p>
<p>The New Republic initially chose to focus on <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mon_Calamari_Cruiser_5fdf.html" title="Mon Calamari Cruiser">Mon Calamari Star Cruisers</a> instead of the <i>Imperial</i>-class, which was apparently too much of a symbol of Imperial might to deploy in large numbers. Many of those used by the heirs of the Rebellion were symbolically high-profile prizes of war, such as the <i>Accuser</i> and <i>Adjudicator</i> captured at the Battle of Endor, the <i>Avarice</i> which defected during the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bacta_War_1b18.html" title="Bacta War">Bacta War</a>, and the <i>Tyrant</i> which had once been part of Darth Vader's personal fleet; renamed <i>Emancipator</i>, <i>Liberator</i>, <i>Freedom</i> and <i>Rebel Dream</i> respectively</p>
<p>Some <i>Victory</i>-class Star Destroyers were used during the early years of the New Republic, perhaps because the <i>Victory</i> was a symbol of the Old Republic's military machine, or perhaps more simply because its designer had joined the Rebellion as opposed to the creators of the <i>Imperial</i>-class design which remained loyal to the Empire.</p>
<p>In later years, however, after the end of the Galactic Civil War, the use of <i>Imperial</i>-class ships apparently became regarded as much more acceptable to the heirs of the Rebellion, with many new ships like the <i>Mon Mothma</i> being named for former heroes of the Rebel Alliance.</p>

While Captain Terrik was not permitted to keep all of his weapons after the operation, they were reinstated during the <a href="../../../y/u/u/Yuuzhan_Vong_68ce.html" title="Yuuzhan Vong">Yuuzhan Vong</a> invasion, and, according to rumor, were augmented by a ship-killing superlaser. During the Vong invasion, the <i>Errant Venture</i> served as a temporary <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> sanctuary and also as squadron flagship in the forces that rallied to defeat the Yuuzhan Vong.

<p>Of course, the iconic <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer is not the only "Star Destroyer" in Star Wars: in the movies alone, the <i>Venator</i>-class attack cruisers of <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge_of_the_Sith_bd67.html" title="Revenge of the Sith">Revenge of the Sith</a></i>, Darth Vader's massive command ship <i>Executor</i>, and even the cigar-shaped <a href="../../../s/e/p/Separatist.html" title="Separatist">Separatist</a> flagship <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Federation_Cruiser_1da0.html" title="Trade Federation Cruiser"><i>The Invisible Hand</i></a> @mdash; all could be said to be "Star Destroyers".</p>
<p>Beyond a simple physical description, it has proven hard to find a precise definition of the term "Star Destroyer" that satisfies all of the franchise's fans. Most official products call the <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer, arguably the most famous of the group, a <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">cruiser</a>. Some fans believe that a "Star Destroyer" is a <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyer</a> in the traditional naval sense, and that such a destroyer must be a relatively medium-sized ship. Translations of <i>Star Wars</i> literature into non-English languages generally support this definition. Both of these claims are questioned by other fans, but it must be admitted that the largest battleships are many times larger than the commonplace <i>Imperial</i>-class. Some of the largest warships are known in recent <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Expanded Universe</a> materials as <i>Star Dreadnoughts</i>.</p>
<p>In the original draft scripts of the movie that would become <i>Star Wars</i>, it can be noted that the term "Stardestroyer" (as a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compound_word.html" title="Compound word">compound word</a>) referred to two-man fighters flown by what would become the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Empire_%28Star_Wars%29_ca1b.html" title="Galactic Empire (Star Wars)">Galactic Empire</a> in later versions. During the classic era of <i>Star Wars</i> merchandising (1976â€“1983), preproduction artworks and some published literature perpetuated the compound word as a reference to the large, movie versions of Imperial warships.</p>

<p>Within Star Wars lore, while similar dagger-hulled warships are said to have existed for thousands of years, the earliest ships called "Star Destroyers" are the 900m <i>Victory</i>-class and the 1,137m <i>Venator</i>-class, deployed by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars, the conflict which saw that once-democratic federation transformed into the autocratic Empire. Although the two were comparable in size and power, each had distinct characteristics and abilities that the other lacked. These vessels were also employed by the fledgling Empire, but the <i>Venator</i>-class was later phased out in favor of larger and more powerful designs.</p>

Victory I-class Star Destroyer</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <i>Victory</i>-class Star Destroyer was designed by <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rendili_Stardrive_ad3a.html" title="Rendili Stardrive">Rendili Stardrive</a> to compete with <a href="../../../k/u/a/Kuat_Drive_Yards_fcee.html" title="Kuat Drive Yards">Kuat Drive Yards</a> and the successful <i>Acclamator</i>-class long-range military assault transport. They were the most powerful medium combatants of the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Republic_%28Star_Wars%29_e6ab.html" title="Galactic Republic (Star Wars)">Galactic Republic</a>'s military machine during the Clone Wars. The Republic bought both the <i>Victory</i>-class and KDY's competing <i>Venator</i>-class ships in great numbers.</p>
<p>Ships of the <i>Victory</i> class are 900 meters long. Depictions of the engines vary: some sources show the <i>Victory</i> possessing three primary ion drives for sub-light propulsion; others show two. However, they are somewhat sluggish spacecraft and even later refits never really fixed that design flaw. The first flight of ships was capable of independent flight in atmosphere; in one of the most infamous examples of this capability, then-Captain <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Moff_Tarkin_aebb.html" title="Grand Moff Tarkin">Tarkin</a> landed his vessel on a crowd of protestors in what would later be called the Ghorman Massacre. The second flight was not capable of effective atmospheric operations.</p>
<p>The <i>Victory-I</i> subclass included eighty concussion missile tubes, while the rarely produced <i>Victory-II</i> subclass lacked them in favour of ion cannons. The <i>Victory-II</i> also had faster sublight drives for better space-to-space combat and lost its atmospheric capability, perhaps making it an even closer predecessor to the <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyers that followed. All ships carried two squadrons of star-fighters. Presumably there are heavy weapons turrets flanking the command tower, but they have never been explicitly shown in the official literature.</p>
<p>With the rise of the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Empire_%28Star_Wars%29_ca1b.html" title="Galactic Empire (Star Wars)">Empire</a>, the <i>Victory</i> was replaced in general service by the <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer, a much more capable design. Many <i>Victory</i>-class ships were sold off (many to the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_Sector_Authority_d9d0.html" title="Corporate Sector Authority">Corporate Sector</a>) or decommissioned. Nonetheless, <i>Victory</i>-class ships still saw much action against Rebels and pirate groups. After the end of the civil war, the <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer was seen by some in the New Republic government as too much a reminder of the Empire. Under <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Rebel_characters_in_Star_Wars_3d08.html#Mothma.2C_Mon" title="Minor Rebel characters in Star Wars">Mon Mothma</a>, the New Republic concentrated on developing new ships based on the <i>Victory</i>-class design - which was seen as more of a product of the Old Republic that preceded the Empire. The design lineage lives on in the <i>Republic</i> and <i>Nebula</i>(more commonly known as <i>Defender</i>) class Star Destroyers in service with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Republic_%28Star_Wars%29_803b.html" title="New Republic (Star Wars)">New Republic</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Admiral_Thrawn_d066.html" title="Grand Admiral Thrawn">Grand Admiral Thrawn</a> also made significant use of the Victory Star Destroyer to overcome his limited number of capital ships.</p>
<p>One notable feature of the <i>Victory</i>-class is that it is one of the largest ships capable of operating effectively in the atmosphere of a planet. This gives it an advantage over its larger cousins in planetary assault scenarios, where it can be used to provide close-support for ground forces, and to intimidate the enemy. This advantage did not prevent it from being phased out and replaced by new classes as the main warship of the Empire, but it did ensure that the <i>Victory</i> was often assigned to invasion or policing fleets to make use of this ability.</p>
<p>The Victory Star Destroyers also have a faster hyperdrive than the succeeding Imperial-class vessels; this enables the former to respond faster to uprisings and incidents.</p>
<p>The <i>Victory</i>-class Star Destroyer was originally described in West End Games' <i>The Star Wars Sourcebook</i> in the 1980s. However, the <i>Victory</i> was never seen in the original Trilogy or Episode III, despite being widely recognized as the direct predecessor to the <i>Imperial</i>-class in this and many later sources (including <i>The Essential Guide to Vessels and Vehicles</i>, published before the release of <i>The Phantom Menace</i>). It was perhaps because the <i>Victory's</i> wings and bridge/tower nodes seem like ugly additions to the otherwise sleek design and clean lines of the <i>Imperial</i>-class (otherwise, the <i>Victory</i> is very similar to the <i>Imperial</i> in looks). The <i>Acclamator</i> and <i>Venator</i>-class ships, however, were created for Episodes II and III, and never existed in any literature prior to the release of those movies.</p>

<p>Also known as "Republic Attack Cruisers," <i>Venator</i>-class Star Destroyers were the successors of the successful tradition of the <i>Acclamator</i>-class assault transports and the <i>Victory</i>-class Star Destroyers. While the <i>Acclamator</i> was primarily an armed troop transport and the <i>Victory</i> was a jack-of-all-trades, the <i>Venator</i> was primarily a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfighter.html" title="Starfighter">starfighter</a> <a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft_carrier.html" title="Aircraft carrier">carrier</a>/<a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyer</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>Venator</i>-class destroyer was 1,137 meters long and carried a crew of 7,400. Its main reactor could consume up to 40,000 tons of fuel per second and had engines that could accelerate the massive vessel at 30,000 m/sÂ². The ship is capable of operating within atmospheres and landing for docking as well retrieving/disembarking the ground forces.</p>
<p>The <i>Venator</i>-class carried upwards of 400 starfighters in its large hangar bays, a feature phased out of successor <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyer</a> designs in favor of heavier weapons on the ships themselves. Standard fighter complement was 192 V-Wing starfighters, 192 ARC-170 starfighters, and 36 Eta-2 <i>Actis</i> Jedi Interceptors. 40 <a href="../../../l/a/a/LAAT_7f89.html" title="LAAT">LAAT/i</a> gunships and 24 <a href="../../../a/t/-/AT-TE_a8c4.html" title="AT-TE">AT-TE</a> walkers were carried for ground operations. Combined with its fighters, the <i>Venator's</i> powerful engines, strong deflector shields and armament consisting of 8 heavy turbolaser turrets, 2 medium dual turbolaser cannons, 52 point-defense laser cannons, 4 heavy proton torpedo tubes, and 6 tractor beam projectors made it one of the most powerful and fearsome medium warships of the time.</p>
<p><i>Venator</i>-class Star Destroyers were deployed in a number of battles during the Clone Wars, most notably during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Coruscant_2a68.html" title="Battle of Coruscant">Battle of Coruscant</a> when upwards of a thousand of the ships helped protect the capital.

<p>The cigar-shaped Separatist cruisers seen in <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> have been called Star Destroyers by some fans, even though no canonical sources refer to them as such. While their capabilities and power levels are comparable to Old Republic and Imperial Star Destroyers, they are depicted solely as components of the CIS starfleet. For purposes of this article, such ships are considered to be Star Destroyers.</p>

Instead it was a tapered cylinder, looking more like a Coruscanti skyscraper laid on its side then a warship. At 1,088 meters in length it was larger then the <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Republic_%28Star_Wars%29_e6ab.html" title="Galactic Republic (Star Wars)">Republic's</a> <i>Victory</i> class but smaller than Star Destroyers later fielded by the Republic. The standard ships apparently had limited hangar facilities, a limitation corrected in some variants. The variants had extended hangars at the expense of engine space, but were capable of 2,500 Gs in open space and 2,000 kph in atmosphere. It has been claimed that these craft lacked direct power feeds from the reactor to the guns. However their offensive armament included a large number of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proton_torpedo.html" title="Proton torpedo">proton torpedo</a> launchers.</p>
<p>The reactor power of the <i>Invisible Hand</i> (12,000 tons per second fuel annihilation) is within the band of vessels classed as Destroyers (e.g. between <i>Venator</i> with 40,000 tons/s and <i>Recusant</i>-class with 8,600 tons/s), rather than the lower power of Star Frigates (e.g. <i>Munificent</i> with 2,300 tons/s).</p>
<p>There is some dispute as to whether this class is to be considered a "Star Destroyer". Critics claim that it was only called such "in passing" and raise the possibility of it being slang. Nevertheless, since there is no clear evidence against this designation, canon policy mandates we accept it as true, and the page will assume thus until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>With a known production run of 3 ships, this <i>Providence</i> variant saw limited use in the Clone Wars. When Viceroy Gunray commissioned this ship, he had them remove the aft reactors, fuel stores, and some of the engine components to make room for a massive hangar. The result was a significant weakening of the ship in return for an extravagant hangar facility. When <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Grievous_6859.html" title="General Grievous">General Grievous</a> assumed command of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems_856b.html" title="Confederacy of Independent Systems">Confederacy's</a> armed forces, he seized this ship as his personal vessel to insult the Viceroy, who had previously and repeatedly insulted him. Two sister ships were commissioned, the <i>Lucid Voice</i> and <i>Collicoid Swarm</i>, and they were used in a disinformation campaign to keep <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Republic_%28Star_Wars%29_e6ab.html" title="Galactic Republic (Star Wars)">Republic</a> spies unable to pinpoint <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Grievous_6859.html" title="General Grievous">Grievous'</a> exact location.</p>
<p>The modifications to this ship left it with a reduced and weakened armament. It now carried only 14 <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbolaser.html" title="Turbolaser">quad turbolaser</a> turrets, 34 dual <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbolaser.html" title="Turbolaser">laser</a> cannons, 2 <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion_cannon.html" title="Ion cannon">ion cannons</a>, 12 <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion_cannons.html" title="Ion cannons">point-defense ion cannons</a>, 102 <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proton_torpedo.html" title="Proton torpedo">proton torpedo</a> launchers, and an unknown number of point-defense flak cannons. It carried 240 droid starfighters, 160 Mobile Troop Transports, and 280 assorted droid vehicles. For infantry duty it caried up to 1.5 million deactivated droids, and had a crew of 600.</p>
<p>In <i>Revenge of the Sith: Incredible Cross-Sections</i>, it is called in what is apparently intended to be a technical capacity a "Modified <i>Providence</i>-class carrier/destroyer".

<p>The most renowned user of Star Destroyer-type ships was the tyrannical Galactic Empire. The menacing profile of a huge Star Destroyer became a symbol of Imperial might and domination, and many <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel_Alliance_d8fe.html" title="Rebel Alliance">Rebel</a> convoys and even militarized armadas were punished by <i>Imperial</i>-class warships acting as sector defense ships and blockade enforcers, either with impoundment or total destruction (and sometimes both, as evidenced by the off-record capture and annihilation of the <i><a href="../../../t/a/n/Tantive_IV_b228.html" title="Tantive IV">Tantive IV</a></i>, consular ship of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Leia_Organa_9b1b.html" title="Princess Leia Organa">Princess Leia Organa</a>). At nearly all major engagements of the war, Star Destroyers were present. The Navy's standard <i>Imperial</i>-class ship was 1,600 meters long, but the term "Star Destroyer" was also loosely applied as slang to larger ships, including massive star battleships stretching more than ten miles from bow to stern. For the purposes of this particular section, only sub-<i>Imperial</i>-class or ships roughly equal to the <i>Imperial</i>-class will be overviewed.</p>

The ship that some believe is a <i>Tector</i>-class Star Destroyer, pictured upside-down, from the Battle of Endor sequence of <i>Return of the Jedi</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The existence of the <i>Tector</i>-class is established in the <i>Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections</i> fact book.</p>
<p>A <i>Tector</i>-class Star Destroyer may have been seen during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Battle of Endor</a>. The alleged <i>Tector</i>-class vessel appeared similar to the <i>Imperial</i>-class, but lacked the ventral hangar bay and visible reactor-bulb. For this reason, it is hypothesized that it is a dedicated attack ship, and not a hybrid carrier/transport/attack ship like the <i>Imperial</i>-class.</p>
<p>The <i><a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Falcon_baaa.html" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i> can be seen flying over this ship's belly in a scene in <a href="../../../r/e/t/Return_of_the_Jedi_3be9.html" title="Return of the Jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>, also showing the only clear example of a capital ship being upside-down relative to nearby ships in a Star Wars movie.</p>
<p>It is never explicitly stated whether this ship shown is a <i>Tector</i>-class Star Destroyer or not, and there are no officially identified images of a <i>Tector</i>-class Star Destroyer.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Rome_6564.html" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> army, <i>Tector</i> referred to a type of cavalry trooper equipped with a large shield, or befitting a warship with extra armor. In less common, civilian contexts, the word described an artisan who applied plaster finish to walls, the Roman equivalent of a house-painter.</p>

<p>A Star Destroyer featuring <i>Victory</i>-like "wings" but an <i>Imperial</i>-class grade of hangar bay (fairly large) as well as several other cosmetic differences, the <i>Harrow</i> measured about the length of a <i>Victory</i>-class vessel (900 meters or thereabouts) and may have been a <a href="../../../k/u/a/Kuat_Drive_Yards_fcee.html" title="Kuat Drive Yards">Kuat Drive Yards</a> attempt to shoo competitor <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rendili_StarDrive_a5ee.html" title="Rendili StarDrive">Rendili StarDrive</a>'s still-successful <i>Victory</i> out of the market with their own niche-fitting light Star Destroyer. <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogue_Squadron_a24d.html" title="Rogue Squadron">Rogue Squadron</a> encountered the <i>Harrow</i>, which seems unlikely to be a one-of-a-kind vessel, in orbit of <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatooine.html" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a> some months after the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Battle of Endor</a>, though with the confusion and chaos in the Imperial war machine following the Emperor's death, it would appear doubtful that the <i>Harrow</i> was constructed and put into service in the time following the Battle of Endor (meaning that it likely was introduced to the fleet during or before the height of the Galactic Civil War).</p>
<p>The starship <i>Harrow</i> possessed two main sub-light engine drives and then two smaller ones between them stacked vertically. It was commanded as of the Tatooine mission by Captain Semtim, and judging by its mission (to recover supplies hidden by Grand Vizier <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sate_Pestage_61d7.html" title="Sate Pestage">Sate Pestage</a> on Tatooine), size, and design similarities to the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victory.html" title="Victory">Victory</a>-class Star Destroyer, was probably capable of travel through a planet's atmosphere. However, as with the conjecture on when it was introduced, there is no solid proof in one direction or the other.</p>

<p>Characterized by its four gravity-well projectors as well as its "double bridge" tower, the <i>Dominator</i> was the command ship of Loka Hosk and its main body bore similarities to the standard <i>Imperial</i>-class line of warship. The <i>Binder</i> of Delak Krennel's forces was also of this type, as was an anonymous Interdictor in <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrawn.html" title="Thrawn">Thrawn</a>'s fleet. As with the <i>Harrow</i>, it seems possible - maybe even probable - that this is a Kuat Drive Yards response to a ship developed by a rival manufacturer - in this case, the Immobilizer-418 built by <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sienar_Fleet_Systems_06da.html" title="Sienar Fleet Systems">Sienar Fleet Systems</a>.</p>
<p>The ship's true classification remains unknown, though it has been described as both a "cruiser" and a "dreadnaught". While "cruiser" seems to be a catchall terminology for any starship larger than a starfighter (having been used in the <i>Jedi Quest</i> series of books to describe <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mol_Arcasite_fcc0.html" title="Mol Arcasite">Mol Arcasite</a>'s ship, from context appearing to be something between being an assault starfighter on the smaller side or a larger, freighter-sized attack ship on the bigger), its size is similar to the 1,600-meter <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyer, which fits the role of cruiser. As previously observed, though, attempts to class Star Wars warships by <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> sea navy standards are almost certainly doomed to failure. It can best be described, probably, in terms of naval role as a heavy interdiction cruiser.</p>
<p>Some might refer to the <i>Dominator</i>-type as an <i>Interdictor</i>-class Star Destroyer, which may very well be the closest to an official name that we have. For now, it's listed as a <i>Dominator</i>-type interdictor Star Destroyer, but <i>Dominator</i> certainly isn't the only ship observed of this class. In the post-Endor period, however, it seems to be reasonably common (and as with the <i>Harrow</i>, its first sighting was mere months after the Imperial catastrophe over the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor.html" title="Endor">Forest Moon</a>, meaning that it was probably at least commissioned prior to then) though they haven't been overtly said to be used as of the <a href="../../../y/u/u/Yuuzhan_Vong_68ce.html" title="Yuuzhan Vong">Yuuzhan Vong</a> invasion. New Republic/Galactic Alliance ships such as <i>Elegos A'Kla</i> and <i>Mon Mothma</i>, modified <i>Imperial</i>-class Star Destroyers Mark II with gravity-well projectors, seem to be filling their role quite admirably, and it seems that this as-yet anonymous interdictor Star Destroyer may have been phased out by that time, or at least too rare to be of much real value.</p>

<p>The defeat at Endor did not lead to the immediate destruction of the Imperial fleet, but it did mark the end of the Empire as the galaxy's dominant superpower. The victorious <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebel_Alliance_d8fe.html" title="Rebel Alliance">Rebel Alliance</a> became the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Republic_%28Star_Wars%29_803b.html" title="New Republic (Star Wars)">New Republic</a>, and it began to build new Star Destroyers of its own.

<p>The <i>Republic</i>-class Star Destroyer was designed and built by <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rendili_StarDrive_a5ee.html" title="Rendili StarDrive">Rendili StarDrive</a> for the New Republic as a lower-cost destroyer. She only required a fifth of the crew, yet had firepower twenty percent greater than that of an <i>Imperial</i>. Fighter complement remained similar at six squadrons. However, the design almost certainly had much inferior endurance, with only about half of the armor of an <i>Imperial</i> , and the extensive ground-assault complement of the <i>Imperial</i> was probably eliminated. The design had much more in common with the <i>Victory</i>-class Star Destroyer than the <i>Imperial</i>.</p>
<p>In the <i>Star Wars: Visionaries</i> graphic novel, in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Coruscant_2a68.html" title="Battle of Coruscant">Battle of Coruscant</a>, one <i>Republic</i>-class Star Destroyer is seen right above <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Grievous_6859.html" title="General Grievous">General Grievous</a>'s flagship.

<p>The <i>Nebula</i>-class Star Destroyer was designed by Republic Engineering Corporation as a relatively low-cost line warship for the New Republic as part of the New Class modernization program.</p>
<p>Unlike most Star Destroyers, the <i>Nebula</i> deletes the large dorsal superstructure that had exemplified the design of most major warships for decades; instead, it had what appeared to be a small navigation bridge thus making the lines much smoother. In addition, the firepower was considered equal to that of the <i>Imperial I</i>-class Star Destroyer; its fighter complement consisted of one wing. Like most New Republic designs, the <i>Nebula</i> probably had endurance on the order of six months and virtually no ability to land troops.</p>

<p>Like the <i>Nebula</i>-class Star Destroyer, the <i>Defender</i> follows a design philosophy of sleekness, largely eliminating the protruding bridge tower and mostly internalizing shield generators. <i>Defender</i>-class vessels served with distinction during the <a href="../../../y/u/u/Yuuzhan_Vong_68ce.html" title="Yuuzhan Vong">Yuuzhan Vong</a> invasion of the galaxy, participating in battles including the Battle of Ebaq 9 and the Battle of Yuuzhan'tar.

<p><i>Defender</i>s measure a standard 1,040 meters in length, making them shorter than the elderly, long-retired <i>Venator</i>-class Star Destroyers, but have enough firepower to challenge ships as large and renowned for power as the <i>Imperial</i>-class and <i>Tector</i>-class Star Destroyers.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some factions believe that the <i>Defender</i>- and <i>Nebula</i>-class Star Destroyers are actually one in the same, and oppose one another on what its formal name and designation is or should be.</p>

<p>Named after <a href="../../../a/c/k/Ackbar.html" title="Ackbar">Ackbar</a>, deceased former Supreme Commander of the New Republic Armed Forces, the <i>Admiral Ackbar</i> seems to be a <i>Victory</i>-class Star Destroyer with extensive modifications, probably enough to push it into being at least a subtype, not the least of which is a giant turret-mounted <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tractor_beam.html" title="Tractor beam">tractor beam</a> generator sufficient enough to seize ships at a considerable distance and tow them in for handling by smaller and more precise beam generators capable of guiding them to the hangar bay, as well as fifty <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turbolaser.html" title="Turbolaser">turbolaser</a> <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery_battery.html" title="Artillery battery">batteries</a>. Commanded by Admiral <a href="../../../n/e/k/Nek_Bwau%27tu_5771.html" title="Nek Bwau'tu">Nek Bwau'tu</a>, it captured the <i><a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Falcon_baaa.html" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i> with Jedi and renowned heroines <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leia_Organa_Solo_6b68.html" title="Leia Organa Solo">Leia Organa Solo</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/b/Saba_Sebatyne_22f0.html" title="Saba Sebatyne">Saba Sebatyne</a> aboard and impounded them for attempting to run a blockade against <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killik.html" title="Killik">Killik</a>-held worlds on the edge of the <a href="../../../u/n/k/Unknown_Regions_f5ad.html" title="Unknown Regions">Unknown Regions</a>. The <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorog.html" title="Gorog">Gorog</a> Dark Nest of Killiks attacked and overwhelmed the <i>Ackbar</i>, using carefully planted assassin bugs inside the ship to incapacitate much of her crew during the assault, and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Raynar_Thul_8aaa.html" title="Raynar Thul">Raynar Thul</a>, ex-Jedi and leader of the "Colony" of Killiks, came aboard the ship to take personal command. Though Bwau'tu, Organa Solo, and Sebatyne escaped along with many crew members, a large fraction of the ship's personnel was not so lucky.

<p>At least one other class of dagger-shaped vessel other than <i>Executor</i>, <i>Imperial</i> and <i>Tector</i> was represented during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Endor_782c.html" title="Battle of Endor">Battle of Endor</a>. It was a large Star Cruiser of unknown class with multiple bridges in its command-tower, which was identified in the ROTJ novel as being an <b>Imperial Communications Ship</b>. According to the novel, it suffered heavy fire from a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mon_Calamari_Star_Cruiser_66de.html" title="Mon Calamari Star Cruiser">Mon Calamari Star Cruiser</a>, which knocked out its shields and made it defenseless against a fighter onslaught. In the <a href="../../../r/e/t/Star_Wars_Episode_VI%7E_Return_of_the_Jedi_e410.html" title="Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi">movie</a>, its multi-bridged tower can be clearly seen in the center of one scene.</p>
<p>Han Solo's comment in <i>A New Hope</i> about outrunning Imperial ships, like the "<b>big, Corellian ships</b>", could be extrapolated to hint at one or more large warship designs originating from the Corellian Engineering Corporation. In the old <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel</a> Star Wars comic, there were several issues depicting an Admiral Giel, whose command ship had a hammerhead-shaped bridge-section. The "hammerhead"-bridge is a trademark of the CEC, and can be seen on its <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corellian_Corvette_8cb7.html" title="Corellian Corvette">Corellian Corvettes</a> and Gunships. Another ship in the AdmiralÂ´s fleet looked like a carrier-version of his wedge-shaped command ship. These two designs could be connected to Solo's on-screen dialog, but a "canon"-connection has not yet been made.</p>
<p>The <i>EX-F</i> of the Black Sword Command was stated to be a "dreadnaught" in the <i>Black Fleet Crisis</i>. This ship cannot be a <i>Dreadnaught-class</i> Cruiser, as it is stated that the Black Sword Command consists of no ships smaller than a Star Destroyer. The smallest known Star Destroyer is the <i>Victory-class</i> at 900m long. A <i>Dreadnaught-class</i> Cruiser, is a mere 600m long, some 200m shy of being equal in length to any Star Destroyer. This coupled with the fact that it is escorted by 5 <i>Imperial-class</i> Star Destroyers, and that its experimental antimatter engines contaned enough antimatter to consume not only itself but 5 ISDs, suggests it is a very large vessel. One explanation for the <i>EX-F</i> is that it is a Star Dreadnaught, such as those from the Clone Wars era. It was probably a new class of warship, given its experimental engines, however, other options cannot be ruled out. It may be of the old <i>Mandator-class</i>, or yet another unknown class of warship. Alternatively, "dreadnaught" may refer to its role in the space navy, as would "destroyer", "frigate", "cruiser", or "battleship".</p>

<p>These massive dreadnaughts helped form the Kuat Sector Defense Fleet, working alongside <i>Procurator</i>-class Star Battlecruisers (according to the <i>AOTC ICS</i> book.) The main reactor was large enough to have a ventral bulb protruding from the "belly" of the ship, differentiating it from the smaller <i>Acclamator</i>-class Assault Ships. There is known to be a <i>Mandator</i>-class Mark II model developed for the Republic Starfleet by the time of the Battle of Coruscant. It was powerful enough to be challenged only by 1,000 of the Confederacy's <i>Recusant</i>-class light destroyers, according to some sources. The <i>Mandator</i>-class Mark II model under Republic service is established in the <i>Revenge of the Sith Incredible Cross-Sections</i> fact book.

<p>The <i>Vindicator</i>-class heavy cruiser was the standard 600 meter-long "heavy cruiser" of the Imperial Starfleet. It was intended for use in situations in which Imperial-class Star Destroyers were unavailable, and smaller ships were not powerful enough. The ship was manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems, and designed by Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin himself.</p>
<p>The ship's armament consisted of 25 light turbolasers, 20 light quad turbolasers, 10 point-defense laser cannons, 20 light point-defense ion cannons, and 3 tractor beam projectors. The Vindicator was equipped with a class 2 hyperdrive. It carried 400 troops and a crew of 2,551. Most <i>Vindicator</i>s were specifically configured so that they could carry a full TIE starfighter wing and operate independently without the need for support ships.</p>
<p>Although the Vindicator was designated as a "heavy cruiser," it was smaller than the <i>Acclamator</i>-class assault ship as well as the <i>Munificent</i>-class frigate.</p>
<p>The Immobilizer-418 Interdictor cruiser was designed using the same basic hull as the <i>Vindicator</i>. In addition to manufacturing new Immobilizer-418s, the Empire converted a number of Vindicators into Interdictor cruisers. The <i>Vindicator</i> hull was used again to build the <i>Enforcer</i>-class picket cruiser, a patrol ship used by the Pentastar Alignment.</p>

<p>A favorite of Imperial commanders during the Galactic Civil War, Im-418 Interdictors were commonly used to trap ships, pulling them out of hyperspace with a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity-well_projector.html" title="Gravity-well projector">gravity-well projector</a> imposing a virtual "mass shadow" similar to those created by heavenly bodies, such as planets, moons, comets, asteroids, stars, black holes, and neutron stars.</p>
<p>Interdictor cruisers are 600-meter-long cruisers built on the standard <i>Vindicator</i>-class heavy cruiser hull. They are a valuable addition to the Imperial Navy.</p>
<p>The Interdictor Cruisers were first manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems two years before the Battle of Yavin though these costly cruisers were produced in very limited quantities prior to the Battle of Hoth. Interdictor cruisers, also known as Immobilizer-418 cruisers, have the appearance of small Star Destroyers.</p>
<p>However, they have four large globes that house gravity well projectors which mimic a large mass in space, restricting hyperspace travel. Other ships which make use of gravity well projectors are the <i>Dominator</i>-class, the <i>Eclipse</i>-class, and the <i>Sovereign</i>-class. Nearby vessels are automatically prevented from engaging Hyperspace engines, and any ship passing through the area via hyperspace are forced into real-space.</p>
<p>Immobilizers are also equipped with 20 quad-laser cannons for short range combat against other ships. The Interdictor's hull is nearly identical to that of the Vindicator-class heavy cruiser and can support several additional weapons depending on mission profile. Enemy fire is absorbed by more than a dozen shield generators.</p>
<p>Since they were rare and costly to produce, Imperial tacticians often placed them on the edge of a battle area to prevent enemy ships from escaping. The Interdictors were also used to blockade planets or moons, such as Yavin 4. The only opportunity to evade them is in the minute or so it takes for the gravity well projectors to recharge, though this was rarely enough time for an entire fleet to make the jump to hyperspace. Producing an entire fleet of such cruisers proved a time-consuming and delicate project and by the time of the Battle of Endor, Sienar Fleet Systems had manufactured only a few Interdictors which were mainly under the command of Grand Admiral <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrawn.html" title="Thrawn">Thrawn</a> in the Outer Rim.</p>
<p>These vessels would not realize their potential until several years after the Empire's death, when they became a key component in Thrawn's attempt to defeat the New Republic. The Grand Admiral would deploy such ships to ambush New Republic forces. He once used an Interdictor in conjunction with his flagship the <i>Chimaera</i>, in an attempt to capture Luke Skywalker. However, the Jedi eluded capture, by reversing his X-wing's acceleration compensators and firing two proton torpedoes, confusing his pursuers. With the tractor beams of <i>Chimaera</i> focused on the incoming torpedoes, Luke made a quick jump into hyperspace, eluding the Grand Admiral.</p>
<p>After Thrawn's defeat, the New Republic confiscated the remaining ships. New Republic technicians redesigned the Interdictor's gravity-well projectors, improving both their range and recharge rate. These new Interdictors, designated "Immobilizer-418A", became one of the key components of the New Republic Defense Fleet's navy during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. During the Battle of Fondor, the New Republic supplied 4 Interdictors to the Hapan fleet.</p>

<p><i>Imperial/Imperator</i>-class Star Destroyers were seen in all three movies of the original trilogy. However, the Imperial Star Destroyer had been slightly redesigned for "The Empire Strikes Back", and that variant is known as the Imperial-II, making the "A New Hope" vessels the Imperial-I. The "Super Star Destroyer" <i><a href="../../../e/x/e/Executor_%28Star_Wars%29_9ef0.html" title="Executor (Star Wars)">Executor</a></i> was seen in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Wars_Episode_V%7E_The_Empire_Strikes_Back_3943.html" title="Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../r/e/t/Star_Wars_Episode_VI%7E_Return_of_the_Jedi_e410.html" title="Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi">Return of the Jedi</a></i>. A <i>Tector</i>-class Star Destroyer and the Communications Ship were briefly seen in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Acclamator</i>-class assault ship was seen in <i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Star_Wars_Episode_II%7E_Attack_of_the_Clones_5ae6.html" title="Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones">Attack of the Clones</a></i>. The <i>Venator</i>-class Star Destroyer was seen in <i><a href="../../../r/e/v/Star_Wars_Episode_III%7E_Revenge_of_the_Sith_4ecb.html" title="Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith">Revenge of the Sith</a></i>.</p>

<p>Star Destroyers of various other classes occur throughout <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Expanded Universe</a> material, most notably in <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Empire_4ca3.html" title="Dark Empire">Dark Empire</a></i>. All <i>Executor</i>-class ships listed after the <i>Executor</i> itself, had their origins in the Expanded Universe. There is a small amount of controversy, especially over a large number of ~1600m long Star Destroyer classes seen in comic books; some believe them to be separate classes, others believe them to be poorly-drawn <i>Imperial</i>-class ships. Even in <i>Star Wars:Empire #55</i> the <i>Victory</i>-class Star Destroyer is seemingly too big and a few details remain un-depicted.</p>
<p>In the Thrawn Trilogy written by Timothy Zahn, when Skywalker, Solo, Bel Iblis, and Leia Skywalker were trying to capture the Katana Fleet, Imperial Star Destroyers were involved in a battle. it was said that the forward ventral sensors were knocked out, thus giving the pirates "free rein of the Star Destroyer's underside". This implies that there are only two sensor stations that are solely responsible for targeting and detection.</p>

<p>Star Destroyers have featured prominently in many Star Wars computer games, primarily as targets to be destroyed by starfighters, as in the <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-Wing_computer_game_series_3aee.html" title="X-Wing computer game series">X-Wing computer game series</a>. The <i>Doomgiver</i> in the second Jedi Knight game can also be presumed to be a "Super Star Destroyer" of an as yet unnamed class.

<p>In 2002 the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Lego.html" title="Lego">Lego</a> Group released the Imperial Star Destroyer. The model is made up of 3,104 pieces and at more than three feet long, the scale is roughly 1/1600. At the time of its release it was, piece-wise and length-wise, the largest set Lego had ever produced. Its piece count has since been surpassed by a model of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_II_f52a.html" title="Death Star II">Death Star II</a> released in 2005.
