<h2><span class="mw-headline">Decimal bits, binary bytes</span></h2>
<p>Apple may be ducking this controversy by counting decimal bits. Relevant to the article's claim "Operating systems usually report disk space using the binary version" is the reference "Apple Publications Style Guide" of January 2006, available in Google. That guide claims:</p>
<p>"kilobyte (1024 bytes) KB computer memory"</p>
<p>"kilobit (1000 bits) kbit computer memory"</p>
<p><a name="Binary_or_decimal_context_implied_by_electronic_memory" id="Binary_or_decimal_context_implied_by_electronic_memory"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Binary or decimal context implied by electronic memory</span></h2>
<p>In the page, I see the quote: Electronic memory such as RAM and ROM always uses the binary versions, because the physical structure of the device makes it naturally come in sizes that are powers of two.</p>
<p>This isn't true, but I don't yet know how to fix it concisely, help.</p>
<p>For example, flash is an electronic memory, and ECC-protected RAM is an electronic memory, but their capacities aren't naturally powers of two.</p>
<p>A concise true alternative I saw said recently was: The RAM and ROM folk gave us this confusion by behaving as if memory were reliable. That is, by converting to precise binary prefixes from loose decimal approximations, they left no room for <a href="../../../e/r/r/Error-correcting_code.html" title="Error-correcting code">ECC</a>, etc.</p>
<p>In more detail ...</p>
<p>All that's naturally a power of two in memory is the count of raw cells in a single layer.</p>
<p>Yes, P * Q cells appear in a rectangular array. P * Q is a power of 2 because P and Q are powers of 2. P and Q are powers of 2 because pins cost much money. If you make N pins into an address bus, then you can address 2^N rows or columns. Yes. So far so good.</p>
<p>But electronic memory today - 2005 - often contains a lot more than a single layer of raw 1 or 0 cells. As in modems, so now in memory cells, the discrete stored voltage may be multilevel, e.g., representing 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, not always binary. The chip may contain more than one layer. Part of the chip may be dedicated to ECC, or left free for wear-leveling.</p>
<p>Consequently, the capacity of <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flash_memory.html" title="Flash memory">flash memory</a> in particular is now "continuously variable", and their physicists follow the HDD physicists by using the standard metric units to count bits.</p>
<hr />
<p>Memory controllers on motherboards always address whole bytes (which includes any parity or ecc bits) or whole words (whole multiples of whole bytes) in chunks measured in binary multiples. This is because binary math is the natural form for practically all processors. The presence of ECC in RAM makes no difference. The ECC bits are part of the byte, even though the ECC bits are not sent to the CPU, the memory controller reads the extra bits when it reads the byte. RAM modules are always measured according to how many binary multiple bytes are available no matter how wide the data path is.</p>
<p>"Flash memory" today refers to non-volitile storage devices that are accessed exactly like hard drives. They use virtual cylinder, head, and sector specifications for the computer system to address the device and even though they contain memory that is accessed in a "random" (non-serial) method, in discreet rows and columns, it is not considered "RAM".</p>
<p>Yes, Flash often uses multilevel cell technology, but the data is converted to a binary representation. So even though one cell can hold more than a simple on/off representation, the absolute capacity is still a function of bits and bytes. And the memory used by the CPU through the memory controller does not yet use multilevel cell technology. DDR and RAMBUS are still ones and zeros.</p>
<p>Flash manufacturers have followed the hard disk drive path to designate capacity, decimal. No matter how many ECC cells or spare cells for wear-leveling are allocated, the capacity is based on decimal multiples and does not include the spares and ECC.</p>
<p>So I guess I would say, instead of, "<i>Electronic memory such as RAM and ROM always uses the binary versions, because the physical structure of the device makes it naturally come in sizes that are powers of two.</i> <b>I propose</b>, "<i>RAM memory modules always designate capacity in binary multiples because that type of math is "native" to binary processors.</i> or " <i>because CPU's use RAM in binary multiples and building RAM modules according to that system is most logical."</i></p>

<dd>Large flash units used for bulk storage are certainly treated like hard drives but bare flash chips and flash used in microcontrolors for program storage is far more like a more conviniant to use variant of EPROM (reads out like rom, requires special actions for programming) <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlugwash_0129.html" title="User:Plugwash">Plugwash</a> 23:53, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hard disk sizes</span></h2>
<p>My Maxtor 40 GB is actually 38.2 GB (dd tells me it has 80022600 sectors, or 38.1577 MB). That's 39,073.5352 MB, 40,011,300 K, 40,971,571,200 bytes. OTOH, my Maxtor 160 GB has 320173056 sectors, or 152.67 GB. That's 156,334.5 MB, 160,086,528 K, 163,928,576,512 bytes. Clearly, if GB meant 1000*1024*1024 bytes, then they'd be giving me less than claimed (and I could sue them!). If GB meant 1000³ bytes, they'd be giving me almost a gig more for my 40 GB, and almost 4 gigs more for my 160 GB. They probably use 1 GB = 1000*1000*1024 bytes.</p>
<p>But my Quantum Fireball advertises "4.0 GB" and actually has that much (assuming Windows is accurate), 4.0062 GB, 4102.32 MB, 4200776 K, 4301594624 bytes. It also says "4.3AT" and has "43" in the model number, which I assume refers to 4.3 decimal GB.</p>
<p>Then, my Seagate 40 GB has 78163247 sectors, or 37.2711 GB, 38165.6479 MB, 39081623.5 K, 40019582464 bytes. It <i>should</i> have 78165360 sectors (according to the specs), no idea why it has less. It'd be false advertising unless GB meant 1000*1000*1000 bytes. Western Digital seems to use 1 GB = 1000*1000*1000 bytes, as well (which means it was worth paying more for my Maxtor). Hitachi seems to use 1000*1000*1024 bytes.</p>
<p>So we have one company using 1024³ (except I have no recent HDs from Quantum, and they don't seem to make them anymore), two companies using 1000²*1024, and two more using 1000³.</p>

<p>Also, Toshiba uses 1 GB = 1000³ bytes, so does Fujitsu. Samsung says they use 1000³, and <a href="http://www.samsung.com/Products/HardDiskDrive/utilities/hutil.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.samsung.com/Products/HardDiskDrive/utilities/hutil.htm" rel="nofollow">not-so-official sector counts</a> appear to confirm this. Since Quantum doesn't make hard disks anymore, for current hard disks, we have two companies using 1000²*1024, and five using 1000³ <a href="../../../e/l/e/User%7EElektron_fd80.html" title="User:Elektron">Elektron</a> 23:36, 2004 Aug 30 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that gigabyte shouldn't redirect here... it's not a binary prefix, and that would just confuse things. However, it wouldn't be a bad idea to go through all the articles and strip out all the information that belongs in more general articles (like this one) and replace it with a quick summary and link to the more comprehensive discussion, per <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a>. The amount of duplication is distressing. <a href="../../../6/8/2E/User%7E68.81.231.127.html" title="User:68.81.231.127">68.81.231.127</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Good point. gigabit/byte should not redirect, i guess, even though they are binary prefixes in this instance (according to this article, giga, mega, etc. can be used as both binary prefixes and SI prefixes, though I think they should only be considered SI prefixes. but according to this very article, they ARE binary prefixes...) I already added the see also binary prefix to each article, but no one notices and just adds stuff to each individual article. - <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 20:07, Jan 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It's even worse.. those are SI prefixes, but they are not SI units because B is not an SI symbol for byte (or even <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bel.html" title="Bel">Bel</a>, at least not yet I think&#160;:). And then there are special case like the 1,024×1,000 <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megabyte.html" title="Megabyte">megabyte</a> variant....</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, a lot of articles seem to link to the kilo-, mega-, and giga- variants (150–250 for the -bytes series), while tera- is only linked about 50 times, and peta- and higher have &lt;20 each. So at least the big three or four are natural links, and might justify their own articles. There are also enough special cases in the big three (which industry uses it, etc) that they'd still need separate sections in a big article, so it's probably easier to keep them separate. (I don't think it matters either way, but if the larger units <i>are</i> turned into redirects, they should probably be pointed to byte [or bit].)</dd>

<p>Alright. If we're not going to consolidate all the little articles, we should add a template to all of them with all of the others on it.

<p>which I would like to insert into this article. I would hope that this could enable aome rationalisation of the existing tables, and could perhaps eventually be inserted into all the individual binary prefix articles, e.g. kibi, mebi, etc (assuming that they are not merged beforehand).</p>

<dd>Now I really don't like the middle section, and don't think it deserves a place under the sun due to it being inappropriately erroneous, and making the whole table ambiguous and confusing. Might want to put word "standard" as well into the SI heading. The IEC section lacks the 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> column which is more appropriate there. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelicates_7b26.html" title="User:Delicates">Delicates</a> 22:13, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for that. I'm concerned that you think it's erroneous. Please can you indicate where the errors might be? The SI prefixes are known as such in Wikipedia, so I didn't see the need to include the word 'standard'. If they become known as SI standard prefixes, then I'm happy to change the template. Regarding the 2^n column, I was told that the table was too wide as it was previously. I was trying to avoid duplicating the same column. I have been wondering whether it might be possible to remove one of the 'kilo' columns to reduce the width further without generating confusion, but I don't think this can be done easily. Please can you indicate where you find the template confusing? Alternatively, be bold with your editing and let others review your changes.

<dd>The problem I have with it is that it has two identical columns that contradict eachother which is both erroneous and confusing in context of the same table. I think the middle section should be taken out alltogether, because it is redundant in the presence of “≈” symbol, which makes the association of the SI prefixes with the binary meaning pretty clear. The only problem that with this is the inconsistent use of ‘k’ and ‘K’ for “kilobyte”. The people who find this page through a search engine won't be aware of SI prefixes being known in Wikipedia as standard. It is good to be consistent so that people don't have doubts when they see something applied to one thing but not to another. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelicates_7b26.html" title="User:Delicates">Delicates</a> 02:13, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Do not include -zebi and -yobi</span></h2>
<p>There are no such prefixes. They should not be included in a table that purports to be documenting the IEC standard. Everyone understand, and the article states explicitly, that they are the logical <i>extension</i> of the IEC system, but until and unless the IEC chooses to extend the system they should not be included. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:35, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>PLEASE DO NOT reinsert these values into the table without discussion. They are <i>not</i> "unofficial extensions." They are <i>not</i> real terms at all. They are purely speculative; someone's guess as to what names would be used if these units had names. I believe, based on Google hits, that they are mostly a sort of nerdish urban legend propagated by people copying tables from teach other. Unless you can convince me otherwise by showing a good citation from a serious, authoritative source that shows the names "zebibyte" and "yobibyte" are in real use in the computer field, I will continue to feel that these should not be in the table of binary prefixes at all. I don't mind the sentence pointing out that -zebi and -yobi are the obvious continuations. I'm not at all sure it's necessary to give the numeric values of 2<sup>70</sup> and 2<sup>80</sup>, but you wanted them there and I didn't see a problem with it. Change them to the 1000<sup>n</sup>×1.#### format if you think that provides more insight. But they should not go in the main table. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:34, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm just not sure what harm there is in adding them to the table, properly identified as speculative. Why the allergy? As for giving the values, yes they are required because they're not easily calculated (i.e. they must be done by hand, unless you have some peculiar calculator available). Ah well, this is not worth an edit war, obviously.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">B is for bel</span></h2>
<p>In editing the article, <a href="../../../u/r/h/User%7EUrhixidur_9dbb.html" title="User:Urhixidur">Urhixidur</a> commented " B is Bel, b recommended for byte".</p>
<p>Big deal. B is also for boron.</p>
<p>But you'd need to change that last b to an m to describe someone who imagines a likelihood of even as much confusion between bytes and bels (lowercase, of course) as there would be between boron and bels.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why should bels get preference in any case? They aren't an SI unit, are only listed as acceptable for use with SI.</li>
<li>Bels and bytes are used in completely different fields of activity.</li>
<li>The bel is never used standing alone, and never used with any prefix other than "deci-".</li>
<li>Bytes are never used WITH the prefix "deci-".</li>
</ol>
<p>Those points are, of course, applicable even setting aside the reason I changed Urhixidur's edits in the first place; "b" is used as the symbol for "bits" in this article, and it would be silly to use the same symbol for "bytes" as well. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 23:44, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more point about SI: In SI, the radian (symbol rad) is a derived unit. The rad (symbol rad) is among the units in Table 10 of the BIPM brochure and in Table 9, temporarily accepted for use with the SI, in the NIST brochure. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 00:01, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>«&#160;Why should bels get preference in any case?&#160;»</dd>
<dd>Because of the well established rule that upper-case symbols tand for units named after people, in this case <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Graham_Bell_395d.html" title="Alexander Graham Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a>.</dd>

<p>How about this? Feel free to come up with a better/smaller phrase/sentence to put at the bottom. Variants I thought about: "applied to", "added to", "used with", remove word "prefixes", add word "terms", and so on... What do you think?

<dd>I think all those dinky little stub articles are nonsense which should be eliminated, most of them wouldn't even be worth a "dictionary" entry. They certainly are not encyclopedic. I could see having an article for each prefix, and linking to that. For the rest, one article on Orders of magnitude for bits and for bytes would be more than sufficient--even that's too much IMHO, this article is enough for both. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 17:33, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Little articles like <a href="../../../p/e/b/Pebibit.html" title="Pebibit">pebibit</a> keep getting stuff about other units added to them, get altered so they aren't consistent with the others, etc. by anons who probably don't realize there is an article for each individual prefix and unit, like <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megabit.html" title="Megabit">megabit</a>/<a href="../../../m/e/b/Mebibit.html" title="Mebibit">mebibit</a>/<a href="../../../m/e/g/Megabyte.html" title="Megabyte">megabyte</a>/<a href="../../../m/e/b/Mebibyte.html" title="Mebibyte">mebibyte</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Support</b>. I'm sure we can all work together to keep the articles to an acceptable consistency, and a template project, along with other minor changes along the way, would be the best way to maintain them without losing information on each article or making this one too central and overpowering. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexwcovington_2ca2.html" title="User:Alexwcovington">Alexwcovington</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexwcovington_ddca.html" title="User talk:Alexwcovington">talk</a>) 04:47, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

The only exceptions that come to mind are <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megabyte.html" title="Megabyte">Megabyte</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigabyte.html" title="Gigabyte">Gigabyte</a>, which have interesting debates about their meanings for floppy and hard disks respectively. – <a href="../../../s/m/y/User%7ESmyth_5631.html" title="User:Smyth">Smyth</a>\<sup><a href="../../../s/m/y/User_talk%7ESmyth_c017.html" title="User talk:Smyth"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 16:39, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b>, and I do believe I owe an apology. I deleted most of the merge templates because I found the discussion on <a href="../../../k/i/l/Talk%7EKilobyte_3129.html" title="Talk:Kilobyte">Talk:Kilobyte</a> dated June 2004 and I assumed they all dated that far back...then I found the discussion here. What to do? My rationale:
<ul>
<li>Each article removes the need to link munge (i.e., <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_prefix.html" title="Binary prefix">kilobytes per second</a>) since I think it's extremely bad practice</li>
<li>Each article has its own "What links here" and it'd be much easier to see what links to each unit (instead of one page (which is currently limited to 500 max) for all units)</li>
<li>Each article would *explicitly* state what each unit means instead of forcing the visitor to hunt down a table</li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest that at the bottom of each -bibyte pages we have a <i>see also</i> with links to: the corresponding decimal-prefixed version, the corresponding -bibit, the <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_prefix.html" title="Binary prefix">binary prefix</a> article, and the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Orders_of_magnitude_%28data%29.html" title="Orders of magnitude (data)">orders of magnitude (data)</a> article.

<dd>And so you did, and a fine job i might add. I added 2 lines below and noted them as mine so as not to confuse the remainder of this work done by <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a>. I think we are settled in data rate issues pretty firmly as being the standad <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> interptitations of the units. What I said in <a href="../../../g/i/g/Talk%7EGigabyte_be8b.html" title="Talk:Gigabyte">Talk:Gigabyte</a>, however, is still true. the original and (from a computer's standpoint) accurate definitions are still very much the standard definition. We can not abandon all that computers are built on and pretend like transistors have 10 fingers. The <a href="../../../m/e/b/Mebibyte.html" title="Mebibyte">mebibyte</a> notation has not gained widespread use and we can not pretend as though it has. The standard rule for such things on the wiki is to use the most common usage as used in the world. Also, the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">manual of style</a> tells us <i>"For units of measure use SI units, unless there are compelling historical or pragmatic reasons not to do so"</i> and i feel that this is definatly both historical and pragmatic. I am willing join IEEE in conceeding this common usage in the name of clarity and, for lack of other options from IEEE or SI, use the unpopular IEC titles. In order to set a standard to be uniformly implemented across the wiki, I would like to suggest that we create a boilerplate of some sort to explain that we use the less popular titles directing inquisitive readers to this article. I would also like to see us create a rule in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a> in order to guide editors. I don't know what it takes to create such rules, but I think that this might be a wise move. perhaps it's time to move this discussion (once again) to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_dd27.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style</a>? <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 23:36, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

So whether their commonness is a "compelling historical reason" to use them or whether these recommendations even count as standards is debatable.</dd>

<dd><b>My biased POV:</b> So the physicists should have their own definition of the mega- prefix so that quoting the speed of light is the more convenient whole number 3 instead of 2.99792458? Or the chemists will come up with their own version of the standard prefixes so that Avogadro's number starts with 6 instead of 6.0221415? The whole point of the SI prefixes is to maintain a consistent set of multipliers so that the various disciplines mesh well together.

<dd>Just my 2c since I've been wondering whether to edit this article on the same lines. When measuring bits (or clock cycles), the most common usage appears to be powers of 10 ie. SI. The confusion appears to arise when talking about <i>bytes</i>, whether these should be powers of 10 or powers of 2. Operating systems such as Windows and Linux measure bytes in powers of 2, as do RAM manufacturers. The odd man out seems to be makers of secondary storage devices such as hard disks and USB drives who insist on bytes measured in powers of 10. As far as the manual of style goes, I'd recommend bits are always SI, bytes are always powers of 2. --<a href="../../../k/u/d/User%7EKudz75_c95a.html" title="User:Kudz75">kudz75</a> 01:04, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>hmmm, where to start? clock cycles would be true. they have very little to do with computers as that it's a measure of time. the measure of time existed before computers and stands independently of computing components. the same would be true for computing terms which done requre computing components such as the gigaflop. these are not derived from a binary system comming out of a transistor or similer device. the case of data rates is interesting. a bit is either 1 or 0 and in that sense, its binary. however data rates dont care about what the data is, they care how much is moved. if you move 100 bits in 1 second, it doesnt matter what those bits were and therefore si units work fine. data storage is where the tables turn. if i have 1 bit of memory, i can store 2 values (0, 1). if i have 2 bits, i can store 4 values (00, 01, 10 , 11). if i have 3 i can store 8 values (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111). it is easy to see that this is a 2<sup>x</sup> case where x is the number of bits you have. the fact that we break them into bytes and then count them from there is a historical norm, it was once thought that 8 bits could represent any nessicery number/chariter and therefore was the largest nessicery size for data storage.</dd>

<dd>as time progressed, we started to make larger devices and used the kilobyte (historical usage) to be 10 bytes of data. this would, of course, store 2<sup>10</sup> different bytes, not 10<sup>2</sup> differnt bytes. in hindsight, we should ahve found something other to call it than the kilobyte. back then calling it the kibibyte would have us currently not talking about it. the fact that we were already grouping into 8 bits at that time is the reason this is a bytes discussion. you see, if we never went to the 8 bit theory, we would have declared the kilobit (historical useage) to be 2<sup>10</sup> bits. this is why it would be a bad idea to keep the powers of 2 called this confusing tytle in bytes and just not bits (which is what we are pretty much doing now). now, hard drive manufacturers can claim whatever reason they want for using powers of 10 and not powers of 2 but the fact remains that the people who make the drives know the difference and that a drive with ~74 GiB of data has a giant 80GB written on the box. if one drive wrote 74 and another wrote 80 at the same price, you can guess which would sell better. in any case, we count in powers of 10 because we ahve 10 fingers, computers count in powers of 2 because they have 2 states. the confution here came when we chose not to give a new name to this new way of counting. I did not make this decition personally, but it was made and saying that it shouldnt have been doesnt change history. the best we can do a tthis point is figure out how to correct it.<a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 18:05, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>perhaps you and i define "popular" diffently, i mean that not only your adverage consumer has never hear of it, i mean that your adverage person who works with electronics and computers on a day to day basis also has never hear of it. that it has been referenced in a document somewhere does not make it popular. I see no point in pointing the finger at OS'es or anything/anyone else. there is a prudent reason why the historical definitions were used. last i heard SI did not have a unit to measure data storage. perhaps they will soon but i havent see that shown. IEEE asked people to not use KB to mean 1024, they did not ask people to use KiB to mean 1024. this is why i said that it was not accepted as their standard. when i get some more time on my hands, ill read your page, it sounds like an interesting thing to track. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavebear42_d406.html" title="User:Cavebear42">Cavebear42</a> 21:20, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nominal 1.44 MB floppies and Windows XP</span></h2>
<p>I've rewritten some text on the 1000*1024 hybrid "megabyte" used e.g. in floppies. This text was quite properly restored by <a href="../../../s/m/y/User%7ESmyth_5631.html" title="User:Smyth">User:Smyth</a> after deletion by an anon. I just checked <a href="http://www.cdw.com" class="external free" title="http://www.cdw.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdw.com</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">as of 2005</a> every vendor still refers to the standard floppy as nominally 1.44 MB.</p>
<p>Now, as for Windows XP, the situation is curioser and curioser. I was going to put something in the article but changed my mind pending any rational explanation of what Windows XP is doing.</p>
<p>As of the last time I tried, which was five minutes ago: when formatting a 3.5" floppy, Windows XP's formatting utility designates the diskette and the formatting operation as</p>
<dl>
<dd>3.5" 1.44MB 512 bytes/sector</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is, <i>Windows XP still uses 1.44MB as the nominal capacity of a floppy.</i></p>
<p>But, after formatting, Properties reports the "capacity"</p>
<dl>
<dd>1457664 bytes 1.38 MB</dd>
</dl>
<p>(which is exactly 2847 sectors BTW... and only 1.4235 "hybrid" 1024000 megabytes, not 1.44, so obviously this is the usable capacity after the overhead of the FAT directory is deducted).</p>
<p>Now, 1457664 / 1024 / 1024 = 1.39014 MiB. That is, the second value is NOT consistent with MB meaning MiB, and cannot be explained as roundoff error since the fraction BOTH rounds AND truncates to 1.39 MiB, not 1.38 MiB.</p>
<p>Sounds like some kind of unaccountable sloppiness on Microsoft's part. I can come up with the following wild-ass guess. Suppose there was some point in the code's history in which the code computed 1457664 / 1024 / 1000 = 1.4235 hybrid "megabytes."</p>
<p>Now suppose that for some reason that was arbitrarily truncated to 1.42 MB for display.</p>
<p>Now suppose someone came along and decided that it should be displayed in 1024 * 1024-byte "MB."</p>
<p>Now suppose that instead of fixing the calculation they slapped on a correction.</p>
<p>Now suppose that for some reason they based the correction on 1.42 rather than 1.4235.</p>
<p>1.42 * 1000 / 1024 = 1.3867</p>
<p>Finally, suppose for some utterly unaccountable reason they decided to truncate rather than round... well, I guess you could get 1.38.</p>
<p>Given that all of the intermediate values in the appropriate calculations can be expressed EXACTLY in binary fractions OR decimals OR floating point with a very reasonable number of decimal places, this would seem to suggest sloppiness.</p>

<dd>It doesn't matter, but you're missing the point here. This is not a question of binary prefixes and which unit XP decided to use.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why decimal bytes for HDD?</span></h2>
<p>I think there is a non-neutral POV in this sentence, "<i>Hard disk drive manufacturers state capacity in decimal units, so what is advertised as a "30 GB" hard drive will hold 30 × 10^9 bytes, roughly equal to 28×2^30 bytes (i.e. 28 GiB).</i>"</p>
<p>It implies that HD manufacturers specifically use the decimal designation to inflate the capacity designation. While it may be true at this point in history, it almost certainly was not the original intent of the engineers who created the first hard drives. <b>I propose</b> something like, "<i>Hard disk drive manufacturers state capacity in decimal units. Since most computer operating systems report drive usage and capacity in binary units, the difference causes an apparent loss between the advertised capacity and the formatted, usable capacity.</i>"</p>
<p>Second, since the article speculates on the tradition of using decimal units for HDD capacity, I don't think the immediate subsequent statement is accurate, "<i>This usage has a long engineering tradition, and was probably not influenced by marketing. It arose because nothing about the physical structure of the disk drives makes power-of-two capacities natural: the number of platters, tracks and sectors per track are all continuously variable.</i>"</p>
<p><b>I propose</b>, "<i>The decimal unit capacity in hard disk drives follows the method used for serially accessed storage media which predated direct access storage media like hard disk drives. Paper punch cards could only be used in a serial fashion, like the magnetic tapes that followed. When a stream of data is stored, it's more logical to indicate how many thousands, millions, or billions of bytes have been stored versus how many 1024, 1,048,576, or 1,073,741,824 bytes have been. When the first hard disk drives were being developed, the decimal measurement was only natural since the hard disk drive served essentially the same function as punch cards and tapes. Thus today, any device that is addressed or seen as "storage" uses the decimal system to identify capacity.</i>"</p>

<dd>I think Microsoft would do the world a favor if they said 28.0 GiB but they certainly make it clear that this is a 30 billion byte drive. To support the <i>"most computer operating systems"</i> assertion I'd suggest we would have to review the various current utilities and properties on current OS's like XP, various LINUX, Apple X, etc. I suspect XP is not unlike Win2K so given XP has by far the largesst installed base, <i>most</i> will not hold up. BTW, my recollection is that MSDOS in all its flavors reported integer capacity with no prefixes or even commas&#160;:-). So most may also not be historically true. I'd like to see less definitive language which puts the source of the confusion at the inconsistent and/or unexplained usage of prefixes by the OS companies. I'm thinking about such language but I thought I'd post this talk before I edited the article. Yr thoughts?Tom94022 01:07, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It still use binary units rather than decimal units even in your example (so for a user unclear about what a "giga" the only two numbers he can compare will appear inconsistent) and if you look at disk from explorer with "show details", you will only get the binary unit in "size" without the number written in full. Thus, I see no reason to reformulate the text. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPer_Abrahamsen_cd80.html" title="User:Per Abrahamsen">Per Abrahamsen</a> 07:25, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We agree, 30,065,098,752 is decimal units! Windows is inconsistant, using both decimal units to 11 places and decimal units with non-standard binary prefixes. So the current text is incorrect since Windows does provide capacity in decimal units! I don't know much about Apple and I'm told that some Linux have a flag -T for ds that displays capacity with decimal prefixes. So a more correct sentance might be something like:

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Legal disputes</span></h2>
<p>I added the Legal Disputes section. The information I provided is publically available in many places on the web. Within each case is exactly the kinds of debates going on here.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the difference though is that these people are attempting to take advantage of the debate and claim that corporations are literally charging "per megabyte" and that the corporate megabyte is smaller than the "commonly understood" megabyte and so the consumer is being deceived and cheated. In my opinion, the plaintiffs are filing frivolous lawsuits without merit.</p>
<p>Even though the capacity available to the user is (almost universally) less than the capacity designation, consumers do not pay a dollar amount per mega/gigabyte, therefore they are not paying something for nothing. Likewise, there are no hard drive or Flash drive manufacturers who designate capacity in the binary method and are therefore harmed by the other manufacturers' deception.</p>
<p>EVEN IF the capacity designation were accurate according to the binary method, and a 30GB drive had a formatted capacity of 32,212,254,720 bytes, it is a practical impossibility to store 32,212,254,720 bytes of user data on such a drive. Who is to be sued for THESE losses?</p>

<dd>You make good points. But I would make a weak case for there being some kind of consumer issue here, however. The issue is this: can the consumer make a fair comparison? I don't think it's terribly farfetched to say that, left to themselves, companies will eventually engage in "specsmanship" in which they use deliberately confused, varying, and obfuscated measurements in order to make comparison difficult. It's no accident that supermarkets shelve all the General Foods cereals together, rather than putting all the different kinds of cornflakes together.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the 1960s and 1970s stereo components makers were engaged in a kind of "horsepower race" and different companies used differing definitions of a "watt." There really was no easy way for the average consumer to know whether the a "20 watts per channel" system from one vendor was really comparable to a "20 watts per channel" system from another. In the case of stereo systems, where, all things being equal, a 20 watt system really costs quite a bit more than a 15 watt system, if a manufacturer could sell a 15 watt system and represent it as a 20 watt system by using a slightly different definition of "watt," the financial gains were meaningful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It was very, very difficult to shop for fuel-efficient cars until the EPA tests were introduced, and similarly for household appliances.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the case of disk drives, however, I don't think that different disk vendors are using different definitions of a gigabyte. As far as I know, a nominal 80 gig Maxstor drive is perfectly comparable to a nominal 80 gig Seagate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A very analogous case is the tradition of measuring screen sizes by the diagonal. This made perfect sense in the 1950s, when picture tubes were, in fact, circular. People might have been <i>disappointed</i> or <i>confused</i> when they bought a nominal 21 inch set and found that the picture on it was only 16 inches wide, but everybody's 21 inch set was the same size. However, in the 1990s there were quite meaningful differences in usable picture size between different vendor's nominal 15" computer monitors.</dd>

<dd>There are good reasons for customers to want vendors to use a common, well-defined way of specifying disk capacity. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:10, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion, corporations should be left to their own devices UNTIL they use "specsmanship" with an intent to deceive. Back when the speed national speed limit was reduced to 55, I don't think consumers were harmed by Chrysler's "zero to fifty" (or was it 55) acceleration scores. Obviously in that case, the measurement system was built into the rating.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"There are good reasons for customers to want vendors to use a common, well-defined way of specifying disk capacity." I quite agree. In the case of the hard disk drives, I think it was a common and well-defined system. It just didn't agree with what the new consumers expected and worse were being told by their OS vendor. The major Flash drive manufacturers used the same common and well-defined system, but it again didn't jive with consumer expectations that resulted from their chosen OS.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The binary spec is meaningless to consumers with regards to RAM except for direct comparisons to other computers being considered for purchase. With regards to disk storage, the binary spec is only meaningful because the OS vendor arbitrarily chose it. Remember when people actually bought software to add "virtual" RAM. I don't think it was ever licensed per megabyte, but what a glorious time that would have been for a memory warehouse. They could just ship paper licenses for 64KiB, 128KiB, 256KiB, 512KiB, and 1MiB of v-RAM. <a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 19:33, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I bet the IEC had many of the same debates we're now seeing on WP. But I assume this particular issue was handled with the question of "what is most technically correct?". That leads to the question, why would we want 2 prefixes that both mean 1000? Having 2 isn't an "upgrade path" because that implies that the intermediate designation will be discontinued at some future date and then we get to have these debates all over again. "<i>But we've been using 'kidi with a D' bytes for years now. Using 'kilobytes' to mean 1000 bytes is just too confusing.</i>" But it's wrong to say that this change implies that half the people are wrong.

<dd>Maybe you should stop thinking Microsoft gigabytes as "real" gigabytes. It will be years before OS's start differentiating between giga and gibi. Obviously it's easier to ignore the issue. Maybe someday some sewer dwelling lawyer will decide to sue Microsoft for falsely claiming their leech of a client's hard drive had only 50 terabytes of free space when it actually had 55 terabytes. When that happens, Microsoft might join the larger community. Until then, explain to people that Windows XP has a flaw in how it calculates a gigabyte that makes it seem like their is less space. Or just keep telling them, like we've all been doing for years and years, that there are 2 common meanings for gigabyte and Windows wastes a lot of space on the hard drive so use those measurements as a rough estimate...--<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 15:41, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

<p>It's not "we against the industry." You can't get more "industry" than the IEC and other organizations which have endorsed the standard. If it must be phrased in terms of a conflict, it is more like "engineers versus marketers." Engineers have a vested interest in making measurements clear. Marketers have a vested interest in making them fuzzy, to make it harder for consumers to compare products. And, once their competition adopts a slightly misleading usage that puts them in a better light, it's a marketer's <i>job</i> to make that their own company follows suit.</p>
<p>To the extent that we take sides, Wikipedia should be on the side of "making things clearer." To the extent that imprecise or commercially loaded language is part of ordinary discourse, we should note that fact and explain it.</p>
<p>We should do whatever is needed to make sure that users <i>understand.</i></p>
<p>In this case, we have a usage which is officially endorsed by a number of standard organizations, is easily understood, is precise, but is less familiar to most readers. Against it, we have a usage which is imprecise, ambiguous, <i>not</i> used consistently by those who use it, but is more familiar to most readers.</p>
<p>To my mind, on balance we should favors the first usage, primarily because the "common" usage is <i>not</i> easily understood. The average person has no idea whether a gigabyte of RAM stores as much as a gigabyte of disk. When someone uses the word "gigabyte," nobody, no matter how experienced in the industry, really knows whether they mean the binary or the decimal usage. Sure, you can <i>guess</i> at the meaning, but we should not put our readers into a situation where they need to guess. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:58, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think so. The meaning of those prefixes is defined by the BIPM, International Bureau of Weights and Standards, and their use in the industry was incorrect according to those definitions. Cans containing 13 ounches coffee are sometimes referred to by their manufacturers as "13-ounce pounds" but I would not expect to be challenged if I were to say "It is incorrect to refer to 13 ounces as a 'pound.'" This is because in the U. S. it is the National Institute of Science and Technology that defines these terms, and Maxwell House is not the NIST.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, the confusion is recent because my perception was that during, say, the sixties and seventies, the binary meanings for "kilo" and "mega" were well understood to be sort of a joke. It was only when the PC revolution suddenly expanded the use of computers to a huge nontechnical population that people started to believe that the binary meanings were "real."</dd>
<dd>What organization would you suggest has the right to define the meanings of the SI prefixes? Is there a <i>serious,</i> <i>widely held</i> viewpoint that says that Microsoft, not the BIPM, is the authority for this?</dd>
<dd>I am not sure, but I imagine that in countries using the SI, the BIPM is actually the <i>legal</i> authority for the meanings of terms defined in the SI.</dd>
<dd>Eventually, yes, there is a point when a technical term is misused by marketers and the uninformed to the point where the misuse does become standard, but I don't think this is the case here. Note that as soon as there was perceived to be a problem, the industry's response was to introduce binary prefixes, <i>not</i> to lobby for the BIPM to add the binary meanings for the old terms to the existing standard.</dd>
<dd>These phrases could be expanded to "even though this is incorrect according to the SI" or "even though this usage is contrary to the international usage that had been in effect for decades," but I think that would be unnecessarily wordy and pedantic. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 10:42, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

However, the use of SI prefixes in the binary sense is still, exactly as correct or incorrect as the use of the word "pound" to refer to a 13-ounce can of coffee. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:58, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The way I see it, though, is that the binary prefixes were "borrowed" from the almost-equivalent SI units because of the need to work in powers of two for addressing and other binary purposes. So they don't really claim to be SI units, just that SI prefixes avoided the need to provide a whole new set of definitions. Maybe they should have used "MiB" and the like from the start, but until now, the context has largely eliminated any ambiguity. But first and foremost, the fact that most of the industry and most consumers still use the old binary prefixes indicates that they are not incorrect to use. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartH_a780.html" title="User:StuartH">StuartH</a> 23:14, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For decades? I'm sure you meant centuries. Besides the <u>incorrect</u> usage is even a minority in computing industry itself. Most of computing terms use the prefixes correctly.

<dd>Yes, it is pushing a point of view. The way our language works, someone can coin a new word, or a new prefix. But there is nothing which gives them absolute control in perpetuity over its use. These prefixes aren't "trademarked" or anything like that.</dd>
<dd>So yes, the originators of the usage can certainly argue that other usage is "incorrect" and contrary to the original intention, but that doesn't really mean that it really fails any linguistic test of correctness.</dd>
<dd>The BIPM has no legal authority to set any standards; it is just responsible for day-to-day operations. Even the CGPM has no general, plenary legal authority to set general standards on the use of the English language. Anything they say along those lines is more of an advisory nature, not a "legal authority".</dd>

Since it is stated that the tables refer to IEC recommendations, and not to "common usage" (regardless my POV), I think that notations should be removed, or moved elsewhere, or the captions should be changed.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citing of SI prefixes implies "Millibyte" and "Microbyte" and ...</span></h2>
<p>The whole article eschews to mention the other existing prefixes for <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> units. All physical units of the SI standard can be scaled up (with kilo, mega, giga...) but ALSO always scaled down (with deci, milli, micro, ...). However for theoretical units like the byte, only the upscaling prefixes are used, because other <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> prefixes oh so surprisingly make no sense here.</p>
<p>So when citing it, the article should note that <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_ce77.html" title="SI">SI</a> may not require, but obviously implies applicability of ALL scaling prefixes. And it should note that therefore the not so widespread use, limited meaningfulness or even non-existence of units like "microbyte" or "decibyte" hint that byte unit prefixes may not be identical in meaning to their SI unit counterparts. (Things like "microbyte" might make sense theoretically for crypthography or computer compression algorithms, but apart from that would be totally idiotic.) --mario</p>

<dd>No one measures in yoctometres or gigafarads, either. All of the units have natural limits to the prefixes that are commonly used with them, but all the prefixes are still valid, for hypothetical examples, etc.
<dl>
<dd>Right, "attometers" or something like that are too small to be measured in practice, and others like an "exajoule" are unlikely to occour in nature. The difference between such physical values and the mathemetical / computer sciences Byte however is, that a millibyte not only cannot be measured, but plainly makes no sense / does not exist. If you think about it, a byte can hold values from 0 to 255, and a bit can old 0 or 1. A supposed "decibyte" however cannot hold information at all (I fail to understand what 80% of a bit could be useful for). OTH I have no reference to back up what is mostly my opionion here. But anyhow the article should note that there is a real discrepancy in applying the same-named <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_prefixes_335d.html" title="SI prefixes">SI prefixes</a> to non-physical units like the byte.

Fractional-bit quantities are customarily referred to by using the word "bit" together with ordinary numeric notation.

<dd>Although fractional bits are useful, I cannot come up with any explanation, however contrived, that would say that multiples of 1/1024 bit occur more often in information theory than multiples of 1/1000 bit. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:44, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Raisbeck, "Information Theory," MIT Press, 1963, p. 18 refers to "225.7 bits;" on p. 19, "4.76 bits." On p. 25, we find ".72 bit per letter" and ".96 bit per second." On p. 48 he estimates that a chess master playing simultaneous blindfold chess is "taking in .2 bit per second." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:50, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's stay focused here folks. As I said above, we all agree that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fractional prefixes on bits may be useful in theory</li>
<li>In practice, they are never used</li>
</ul>
<p>So I ask again, what are we arguing? Is the issue whether or not fractional units of a bit should be mentioned in the article? Personally, I don't see any reason we couldn't include the above two points, but I think they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Binary_prefix&amp;oldid=59383386" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Binary_prefix&amp;oldid=59383386" rel="nofollow">currently</a> much too prominent in the intro, so I'm moving them down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#Binary_prefixes_using_SI_symbols_.28non-standard.2C_but_common.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#Binary_prefixes_using_SI_symbols_.28non-standard.2C_but_common.29" rel="nofollow">somewhere more suitable</a>. --<a href="../../../p/3/d/User%7EP3d0_7b66.html" title="User:P3d0">P3d0</a> 11:05, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's also about the fact that we list ridiculous prefixes for other units, that don't even make any physical sense. I like your change, though. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 13:33, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'd prefer to characterize it this way:
<ul>
<li>Fractional bits are used and are useful in some area such as information and communication theory.</li>
<li>It is not clear whether or not SI prefixes are useful, even hypothetically.</li>
<li>In practice, they are virtually never used.</li>
<li>Even if the term "millibit" had much use, nobody has articulated any reason why one would want to refer to multiples of 1/1024 bit rather than 1/1000 bit.</li>
</ul>

</dd>

<dl>

<dd>We are arguing about: what if anything be said about fractional prefixes in the article.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Distinguish common use and scientific use</span></h2>
<p>Just like nonmetric measures never disappeared despite of any standards (horsepower, calories, inches, feet, gallons, ...) so current common use of binary measures will never disappear nor get more precisely defined on a broader basis. It's another thing in scientific and engineering use - kiB, MiB, GiB, ... are easy, exact notations and hopefully their use will increase. What I'm missing in the discussion is the fact that the terms KB, MB, GB are looked at here as combinations of SI prefix (k, M, G, ...) and information unit (byte). Why not treat them as atomic terms with the common meaning they have in the field for decades? Exactly like B stands for 8 bit, KB stands for 1024 Bytes etc. - Wmk 08:09, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wear Leveling</span></h2>
<p>People have removed my <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag from the section that states that the difference between the binary capacity and the decimal capacity is used for wear-leveling. I've never heard that this is the case, and as such would like to know where people are getting this information since it's (apparently) common knowledge.</p>
<p>Any flash memory invariably has extra cells to keep the yield at a manageable level, so there's really no reason that manufacturers couldn't add extra cells for wear levelling too, other than economics (indeed, some flash memories DO match their binary capacities).</p>
<p>Until somebody shows evidence that wear-levelling is responsible for the "lost" capacity, I'm adding the <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag again. 129.128.213.126 20:40, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I rephrased the entire paragraph to exclude wear-levelling as a reason for describing flash drives in binary multiples. Wear-leveling is NOT the reason or a factor in the "decision" to call them 256MB, but I didn't state that in the article. Flash drives almost universally offer the full decimal megabyte capacity of their designation, but my data is original research that isn't published anywhere, so I left the article more vague. Either way, the <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag is much less important, I think. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 00:56, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Legal Disputes, part deux</span></h2>
<p>I just added another lawsuit. And I find it more interesting in that now, 3 of the 4 cases were brought by the same legal team of Gutride and Safier. That's 2 for 3 for Gutride Safier. Half million dollars + $2.4 million. Not a bad deal just for screwing over a few million consumers who will never even know Gutride Safier screwed them. That's just my personal opinion. All of it is personal opinion. Every word was opinion. I was claiming no facts.

<dd>Why aren't they suing software manufacturers for misrepresenting the size of files?&#160;:-) Or maybe the hard drive manufacturers should sue Microsoft for getting them into a lawsuit by reporting the sizes of their drives wrong. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 21:00, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ZACKLY! Microsoft needlessly sucks up more of my drive space than anything else and they're the one giving consumers the wrong capacity. But I would really like to file a class action lawsuit against the the lawyers and the plaintiffs who brought these suits. Because of them, the cost of all hard drives, MP3 players, and flash drives is higher than it would have been. Other than the lawyers getting millions of dollars, and the plaintiffs getting their $1000, no one was helped by any of these lawsuits.
