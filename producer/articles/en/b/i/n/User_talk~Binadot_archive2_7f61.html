<p>Greetings. &#160;:-) Thanks for taking the time to respond to my request for comment re user Wareware. I think it's scandalous that people on Wikipedia let racist garbage like that go unchallenged. They'd prefer to pretend they don't see it -- but then jump on me when I lose patience and respond with mere sarcasm. This website is appalling. No <i>wonder</i> there are so few black people here. I've posted a request for intervention on the admin page, so we'll see how it shakes out. Peace 2 u -- and, again, my thanks. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 23:10, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Binadot, I saw you had moved your name from an endorser of the summary to certifying the dispute. Are you aware that this means you attempted to resolve the same dispute with Wareware before it came to RfC? That's what certifying means. Also, only two editors are required to certify. Unless you actually tried to resolve that dispute, it would make more sense for you to endorse the summary. Best, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 03:10, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is why I didn't certify immedtiately, because I did not have enough evidence to suggest that I participated in the dispute, <i>as such</i> (I thought it was limited to Af. and related content dispute, with some left-over antipathty from other articles – but nothing of this nature). Still, on 2nd thought, I decided that considering I was involved <i>per se</i>., and did try to mediate the dispute (even though, again, I did not know it for what it was), and moreover, since Ww himself contacted me seperately (that he didn't get back to me was his decision, I was willing to help), likely meets the burden. This way, the off-chance for uncertified technicalities are no longer an issue, thus eliminating any potential delays. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 03:50, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Done! I'm not sure how helpful my brief comments were (I could add nothing to yours); there seem to be more who think it should be deleted. We'll have to watch and see. Peace.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 18:07, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I personally don't get the concern over whether Afrophobia is a neologism or not. Who cares? If the subject is complex/broad enough to merit an article, then why <i>shouldn't</i> it be a separate article? Is there some unwritten rule that neologisms (or subjects/words of any other category) do not merit article status? Seems silly/arbitrary to me. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 06:12, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I went back to <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a> and started a talk page -- just musings about the possible direction of the piece. I don't know if it's of any value to the discussion about whether or not to keep it. Any thoughts? Additions? <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 06:50, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good morning, earlybird!&#160;:) Good idea send a notice of the rewrite. I hope you add your thoughts on the talk page, too, and direct them there -- so, perhaps, they can see the potential of the piece. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for this one. Peace 2 u. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 11:02, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In my earlier response to you, I forgot to mention that I concur completely that the Golliwogg photo is far too benign for this article. Something stronger, even jarring, would be far more appropriate and help to hit home the importance of this subject. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 11:47, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>As of this a.m. (03/30), it looks as though the tide has turned in favor of keeping the article -- thanks in large part to your efforts. &#160;:) <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 16:47, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for your help with afrophobia. The Golliwog image was an especially nice touch. It seems that it is open-season on unconventional ideas on wikipedia. Articles on <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negrophobia.html" title="Negrophobia">negrophobia</a>, colorphobia and <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pigmentocracy.html" title="Pigmentocracy">pigmentocracy</a> are showing the depth of research that is possible and it seems that they are likewise being targeted for VfD as well. Thanks again. --<a href="../../../n/a/z/User%7ENazikiwe_f635.html" title="User:Nazikiwe">Nazikiwe</a> 00:49, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes. I'll be sure to take a look when I have an opportunity. Right now, though, things are crazy for me. Will let you know my reactions. Peace 2 u.&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 03:20, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings. I've made some edits to <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golliwog.html" title="Golliwog">Golliwog</a> which I hope meet with your approval. I think the disambig/article pages should be reversed, however. The actual name of Upton's literary character is the "Golliwogg," with the generic term, "golliwog" having only one "g." Since the article concentrates on the literary character, I think it should be titled accordingly. If you agree, perhaps you'll make the necessary changes? Regards. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 05:10, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>One more thing. Are Upton's illustrations in the public domain? I've found a website that has four earlier (and, as a consequence, IMO, better) examples of Upton's Golliwogg. The hair is wilder, the character not as endearing: <a href="http://www.golliwogs.com/books/a4.html" class="external free" title="http://www.golliwogs.com/books/a4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.golliwogs.com/books/a4.html</a> . If it's possible, I think one of these would be much better for use here and in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">Afrophobia</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 05:15, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since the two are so closely related and the article treating both is not lengthy, I think I'd just stick with my suggestion. Apparently, others saw no need to split the two, and I don't either. What's your take on the earlier illustrations? Aren't they great? <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 05:28, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for taking care of the page switch on <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golliwogg.html" title="Golliwogg">Golliwogg</a>. I haven't taken the time to learn the procedure for posting photos on Wikipedia, so I'll have to get to the older Upton photo for that article later, when I have more time. I'd been having computer problems (since Friday), which I finally managed to troubleshoot successfully late yesterday afternoon. And then there was/is that RfC process. (Thanks again for your support, by the way.) So, now I've got to tend to a couple of really, really pressing deadlines. Hope your day goes well. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeceevoice_c129.html" title="User:Deeceevoice">deeceevoice</a> 11:08, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Howdy.</p>
<p>Based on your recent responses on his articles that get nominated for VfD, and your recent activity on his talk page, I can guess that you're as frustrated with <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuraiClinton_47cc.html" title="User:SamuraiClinton">SamuraiClinton/GoofyGuy/TheSamurai</a> as I am. I can't figure this guy out – he seems sincere, but he's made absolutely no effort to improve his contributions, despite dozens of suggestions from other editors. I don't know what to do at this point, besides start an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RfC</a>. Would you support that? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 05:00, Mar 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I started a draft RfC page and have collected a large set of links to our pal's edits, broadly categorized. I started from the beginning of his contribs and got about 2/3 of the way through. I'm having a particularly tough time tracking down policy that relates to idiosyncratic/strange editing – AFAICT, there's no explicit policy like "don't add junk." Feel free to edit either of those pages as much as you want. Discussion would probably be best located <a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_Temp_f7f1.html" title="User talk:Android79/Temp">here</a>.
