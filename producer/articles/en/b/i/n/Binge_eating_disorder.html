<p><b>Binge eating disorder</b> is a psychiatric disorder in which a subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>periodically does not exercise control over consumption of food</li>
<li>eats an unusually large amount of food at one time (on average, 1500 calories).</li>
<li>eats much more quickly during binge episodes than during normal eating episodes</li>
<li>eats until physically uncomfortable</li>
<li>eats large amounts of food, even when they are not really hungry</li>
<li>always eats alone during binge eating episodes, in order to avoid discovery of the disorder</li>
<li>often eats alone during periods of normal eating, owing to feelings of embarrassment about food</li>
<li>feels disgusted, depressed, or guilty after binge eating</li>
</ul>
<p>Binge eating is an element of another eating disorder, <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulimia_nervosa.html" title="Bulimia nervosa">bulimia nervosa</a>. The formal diagnosis criteria are similar: at least two binges per week for an extended period of time.<a href="http://www.mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/ken98-0047/default.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/publications/allpubs/ken98-0047/default.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> In binge eating disorder, by contrast, the person does not purge, fast or engage in strenuous exercise after binge eating. Additionally, people with bulimia are typically of normal weight or may be slightly overweight (the purging, etc., have little to no effect on the subject's body fat), whereas people with binge eating disorder are typically overweight or obese.</p>
<p>Binge eating disorder is similar to, but it is distinct from, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compulsive_overeater.html" title="Compulsive overeater">compulsive eating</a>. People with binge eating disorder do not have a compulsion to overeat and do not spend a great deal of time fantasising about food. On the contrary, some people with binge eating disorder have very negative feelings about food. As with other eating disorders, binge eating is an expressive disorder - that is, the disorder is an expression of a deeper psychological problem.</p>
<p>It is actually hotly contested whether binge eating disorder has its own diagnosis. Some believe that it is a milder form, or subset of bulimia nervosa, but others argue that it is its own distinct disorder. Currently, the DSM-IV categorizes it under <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_disorder_not_otherwise_specified.html" title="Eating disorder not otherwise specified">Eating disorder not otherwise specified</a> (EDNOS), simply stating that more research is needed.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binge_eating_disorder.html" title="Edit section: Occurrence and risk factors">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Occurrence and risk factors</span></h2>
<p>Most people with this problem are either <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overweight.html" title="Overweight">overweight</a> or <a href="../../../o/b/e/Obese.html" title="Obese">obese</a> (discussed below), but people of normal weight can also have the disorder.</p>
<p>About 2 percent of all adults in the United States (as many as 4 million Americans) have binge eating disorder. About 10 to 15 percent of people who are mildly obese and who try to lose weight on their own or through commercial weight-loss programs have binge eating disorder. The disorder is even more common in people who are severely obese.</p>
<p>Binge eating disorder is a little more common in women than in men; three women for every two men have it. The disorder is found in all ethno-cultural and racial populations.</p>
<p>People who are obese and have binge eating disorder often became overweight at a younger age than those without the disorder. They might also lose and gain back weight more often.</p>
<p><a name="Causes" id="Causes"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binge_eating_disorder.html" title="Edit section: Causes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Causes</span></h2>
<p>No one knows for sure what causes binge eating disorder. As many as half of all people with binge eating disorder have been depressed in the past. Whether <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a> causes binge eating disorder or whether binge eating disorder causes depression is not known for sure.</p>
<p>Emotional cues such as; anger, saddness, boredom, and anxiety can trigger binge eating. Impulsive behavior and certain other emotional problems can be more common in people with binge eating disorder. However, many people also claim that binging occurs regardless of their mood.</p>
<p>It is also unclear if <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dieting.html" title="Dieting">dieting</a> and binge eating are related. Some studies show that about half of all people with binge eating disorder had binge episodes before they started to diet.</p>
<p>Researchers also are looking into how brain chemicals and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metabolism.html" title="Metabolism">metabolism</a> affect binge eating disorder. Although this research is still in the early stages.</p>
<p><a name="Complications" id="Complications"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binge_eating_disorder.html" title="Edit section: Complications">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Complications</span></h2>
<p>People with binge eating disorder can get sick due to a lack of proper nutrition. Binging episodes usually include foods that are high in sugar and/or salt, but low in healthier nutrients.</p>
<p>People with binge eating disorder are usually very upset by their binge eating and may become very depressed.</p>
<p>People who are obese and also have binge eating disorder are at risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, levels, gallbladder disease, heart disease, certain types of cancer.</p>
<p>Most people with binge eating disorder have tried to control it on their own, but have not been able to control it for very long. Some people miss work, school, or social activities to binge eat. Persons who are obese with binge eating disorder often feel bad about themselves and may avoid social gatherings.</p>
<p>Most people who binge eat, whether they are obese or not, feel ashamed and try to hide their problem. Often they become so good at hiding it that even close friends and family members don't know they binge eat.</p>
<p><a name="Dieting" id="Dieting"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binge_eating_disorder.html" title="Edit section: Dieting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dieting</span></h2>
<p>People who are not overweight should avoid <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dieting.html" title="Dieting">dieting</a> because it sometimes makes their binge eating worse. Dieting here means skipping meals, not eating enough food each day, or avoiding certain kinds of food (such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbohydrates.html" title="Carbohydrates">carbohydrates</a> or <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fats.html" title="Fats">fats</a>). Many people with binge eating disorder are obese and have health problems because of their weight. People with binge eating disorder who are obese may find it harder to stay in a weight-loss program. They also may lose less weight than other people, and may regain weight more quickly due to a slowing of the metabolism. (This can be worse when they also have problems like depression, trouble controlling their behavior, and problems dealing with other people.) These people may need treatment for binge eating disorder before they try to lose weight.</p>
<p><a name="Treatment" id="Treatment"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Binge_eating_disorder.html" title="Edit section: Treatment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Treatment</span></h2>
<p>People with binge eating disorder, whether or not they want to lose weight, should get help from a health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker for their eating behavior. Even those who are not overweight are usually upset by their binge eating, and treatment can help them. There are several different ways to treat binge eating disorder. <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_therapy.html" title="Cognitive therapy">Cognitive-behavioral therapy</a> teaches people how to keep track of their eating and change their unhealthy eating habits. It also teaches them how to change the way they act in tough situations. Interpersonal psychotherapy helps people look at their relationships with friends and family and make changes in problem areas. Drug therapy, such as antidepressants, may be helpful for some people.</p>
<p>Researchers are still trying to find the treatment that is the most helpful in controlling binge eating disorder. The methods mentioned here seem to be equally helpful. For people who are overweight, a weight-loss program that also offers treatment for eating disorders might be the best choice.</p>
<p>If you think you might have binge eating disorder, it's important to know that you are not alone. Most people who have the disorder have tried but failed to control it on their own. You may want to get professional help. Talk to your health care provider about the type of help that may be best. The good news is that most people do well in treatment and can overcome binge eating.</p>
