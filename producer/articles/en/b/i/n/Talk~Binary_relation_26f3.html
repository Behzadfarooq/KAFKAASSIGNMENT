<p>It seems to me that "mere" relations as "x &gt; y", x and y of the given pair (x,y), can be repeated: {(5 &gt; 1), (5 &gt; 2), (2 &gt; 1), (3 &gt; 2)}. "x=5" is repeated. But "generated" relations --being the graph of a given function f: x --&gt; y, y=f(x)-- as "y = 2x + 1", x and y of the given pair (x,y), can not be repeated: {(5,11), [(5,11),] (2,5), (3,7)} because when "x=5" is repeated, "y=11" is repeated, too. Yielding, duplicated pair member in the set, and being discarded immediatly. The explanation is mine but the idea is coming from: Costas Bush, <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/courses/fall00/modcomp3/class1.ppt" class="external free" title="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/courses/fall00/modcomp3/class1.ppt" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.rpi.edu/courses/fall00/modcomp3/class1.ppt</a> and //www.doc.eng.cmu.ac.th/course/cpe333/LectureNotes/chapter1_Introduction.pdf [Enrique Villar; <a href="mailto:evillarm@capgemini.es" class="external free" title="mailto:evillarm@capgemini.es" rel="nofollow">mailto:evillarm@capgemini.es</a>]</p>

<p>I have seen another definition of binary relation as an ordered triple R=(X,Y,G), where G is a subset of X × Y and is called the graph of R. This definition is better then the definition here as it avoid the confusion while talking about the function and its graph.

<dd>I have seen another definition of a graph - G(N, T), where N and T are set of nodes and connections/relations/associations/links/etc binding em correcpondingly. So, the notation G(R) used here for graph definition is merely unclear. Javalenok</dd>
<dd>So, in my opinion, the steps of constructing the graph G=(V,E) for a relation must be given. The set of vertices is the union N = (X v Y) which are connected by directed edges when xRy; that is, E={(x,y)|xRy}.</dd>

<p>"A partial order which is trichotomous is called a total order or a linear order." This is wrong. A partial order is antisymmetric and hence cannot be trichotomous.</p>
<p>To fix, either we also admit to call a relation &lt; a partial order when it is: asymmetric (which has to be defined yet as: not (a&lt;b and b&lt;a)) and transitive, and then referring to this definition for adding trichotomy. Or we simply change "trichotomous" to "total" in the above sentence.</p>

<dd>Yes, the definition of "total order" given in the article was wrong. A total order is a partial order (i.e. reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive) which is total (i.e. everthing is related).

<p>What does it mean for a relation to be total? There are two different definitions in the article, one under <i>special relations</i> (for all x in X there exists a y in Y such that xRy) and one under <i>relations over a set</i> (for all x and y in X it holds that xRy or yRx); the latter one I have seen before. If the former one is also used in the literature, then it should be clarified that there are different definitions. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> 14:57, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the first meaning the term <i>entire</i> may be preferable. I used this term in the <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axiom_of_dependent_choice.html" title="Axiom of dependent choice">Axiom of dependent choice</a> article, but I don't remember where I got it from. --<a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZundark_7566.html" title="User:Zundark">Zundark</a> 15:42, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I now recall that <i>total function</i> is used in computer science for a function which is defined on all elements of its domain to distinguish it from a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partial_function.html" title="Partial function">partial function</a> (of course, it would be confusing to talk about <i>entire functions</i> in this context).

</dl>
<p>Now, Paul August has changed it back. I seem to remember that it has also changed some time ago,</p>
<p>The first definition has the advantage that it agrees with function composition (as Paul notes). However, I looked at some web pages found via Google (which is of course heavily slanted towards computer science), and it does seem that the second definition appears regularly. What should we do? Should we mention both? -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 21:35, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid there's no "correct" definition. Conventions differ, though in my experience the second definition is more common. The fact that it conflicts with function composition is not necessarily a problem; also, it is sometimes resolved in other ways, either by changing the order of arguments in function composition, or by swapping domain and range in the representation of functions by relations (i.e., <i>f</i>&#160;: <i>X</i> → <i>Y</i> is identified with {(<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>),<i>x</i>); <i>x</i> ∈ <i>X</i> }). I guess any definition would work here, provided we use it consistently, and mention the other possibility as well. -- <a href="../../../e/j/_/User%7EEJ_933d.html" title="User:EJ">EJ</a> 19:13, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>We should mention both. But, since we define a <a href="../../../f/u/n/Function_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Function (mathematics)">function</a> as a particular kind of a relation, I think we need to keep the present definition, which agrees with function composition, as the "primary" definition. Unfortunately this whole business is inherently confusing. Since both orders are used for functions and relations. However, in the case of functions at least, the order now used is fairly standard (see the discussion at <a href="../../../f/u/n/Function_composition.html" title="Function composition">function composition</a>. The current standard defines <i>f</i> o <i>g</i>, so as to preserve the "natural" order of <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>), that is so that (<i>f</i> o <i>g</i>)(<i>x</i>) = <i>f</i>(<i>g</i>(<i>x</i>)). Being a category theorist, I would actually <i>prefer</i> the opposite "arrows order", whereby <i>f</i> followed by <i>g</i>, would "naturally" equal <i>f</i> o <i>g</i>.

<p>JA: I humbly (but most sensibly) suggest that the class/set distinction, however important it may be in the long run, is definitely not 'line 1' material, since it can't be defined or discussed without getting into a controverted variety of different axiomatizations for set theory, and that the (non-pejoratively speaking) 'naive' reader should probably be given a (however illusorily) 'solid' foundation in naive set theory before being led down that particular garden of forking paths. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 17:16, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If relations have frames (as described in the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relation_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Relation (mathematics)">relation (mathematics)</a> article), then a binary relation is a specific case of the more general concept of k-ary relation. However, if a relation is identified with its graph, then k-ary relations are special cases of binary relations (in fact, a (k+1)-ary relation is a species of k-ary relation...) I am myself an unregenerate advocate of simplicity: the relation is its graph. Adding the frame to the relation as a component is analogous to sticking type-labels to things: objects should not have to carry type labels around with them, as the context in which they appear should provide cues sufficient to tell what type we are currently assigning to them. This is not a proposal to change the article (the usage described is unfortunately common), just a philosophical comment... <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandall_Holmes_3178.html" title="User:Randall Holmes">Randall Holmes</a> 23:46, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>JA: I think that you may be confusing relations with tuples. That lingo that goes "so and so is a k-tuple ..." is just an idiom that means "the information that is required to specify a so and so comes in k pieces". It may be confusing if one takes the "is" in too literal an ontological sense, rather than what is more properly understood as an informational sense. Be that as it may, the specification still invokes only a tuple, and not a relation, and so there is no unfounded loopiness here. And even if one forces a recursive definition on the matter, a singleton relation consisting of a single tuple is still a simpler sort of relation, and so the recursion goes to ground as it ought. I don't get the thing about labels — the "frame" is just the requisite context made explicit. And that's a good thing. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Awbrey_aa98.html" title="User:Jon Awbrey">Jon Awbrey</a> 05:36, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, I'm not confusing anything. I am standing up for the old-fashioned view that a binary relation from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> is best identified with its graph (a subset of the cartesian product of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>) and not complicated with indications of its domain and codomain. If binary relations are defined in this way, then ternary relations (for example) are a kind of binary relation (I don't tout this as a virtue of the old approach -- it's merely an observation that things are different there). If relations are encumbered with explicit indications of domain, then this ceases to be true (binary relation is then a special case of k-ary relation). The domain and codomain labels are indications of type (indications of how the graph is intended to be used); my view (in general) is that the context in which an object is used rather than intrinsic features of the object should give type information (the context should not be part of the object, but just that -- its context). Please note though that this is a philosophical grumble (because in my writing I keep having to nod to the (IMHO misguided) general practice), not a proposal that articles should be written differently. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandall_Holmes_3178.html" title="User:Randall Holmes">Randall Holmes</a> 00:36, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FYI, in case anyone is reading this page and not <a href="../../../r/e/l/Talk%7ERelation_%28mathematics%29_c006.html" title="Talk:Relation (mathematics)">Talk:Relation (mathematics)</a>, I have proposed that we consider moving <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binary_relation.html" title="Binary relation">Binary relation</a> to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relation_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Relation (mathematics)">Relation (mathematics)</a> and moving what is currently in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relation_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Relation (mathematics)">Relation (mathematics)</a> to <a href="../../../n/-/a/N-ary_relation.html" title="N-ary relation">n-ary relation</a>. See the discussion at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Talk%7ERelation_%28mathematics%29_c006.html" title="Talk:Relation (mathematics)">Talk:Relation (mathematics)</a>; in the interest of consolidating, let's have the discussion over there. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mangojuice</a> 19:08, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please don't. How would that help, at all? Binary relations are an important special case, but are certainly <i>special</i>. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 19:51, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think there word "binary" in front of word "relation(s)" is missing somewhere. In other case if someone read those paragrafs out of text context it can be confusing and maybe false.</p>

<p>The text i'm using uses the terminology "on" a set instead of "over" a set.. would it be appropriate to add a note mentioning the alternative usage?--<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughitt1_b525.html" title="User:Hughitt1">Keith</a> 00:42, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to my experience, a "binary relation" is usually a relation from one set to itself; a "relation" is usually a (dyadic) relation from one set to another, and never an <i>n</i>-ary relation unless this is explicitely stated.</p>
<p>Thus, all (...) could be dropped in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a function from E to F is a (functional) relation from E to F (m-maybe "on" E x F)</li>
<li>a relation (on E x F) is a (dyadic) relation from some set E to some set F</li>
<li>a (partial) order on E is a binary relation on E, i.e. a dyadic relation on E x E or from E to E</li>
<li>a <i>n</i>-ary relation on E_1 x E_2 x ... x E_n is an n+1 tuple R = (E_1,...,E_n, G) where G is a subset of E_1 x E_2 x ... x E_n, called the graph of R.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you really know (one? / several? / many?) places where an author speaking of a "relation" <i>tacitely</i> understands relations which are not dyadic relations (i.e. more than 2 arguments), without saying so explicitely?</p>
<p>If not, I would strongly argue for making some minor changes explaining more clearly this (<a href="../../../i/m/h/IMHO_c339.html" title="IMHO">IMHO</a>) universial use of terminology. — <a href="../../../m/f/h/User%7EMFH_a7c6.html" title="User:MFH">MFH</a>:<a href="../../../m/f/h/User_talk%7EMFH_e552.html" title="User talk:MFH">Talk</a> 16:14, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
