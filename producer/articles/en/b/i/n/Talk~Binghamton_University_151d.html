<p>19:13, 21 March 2007 (UTC) okay, two (hopefully) non-contentious points. Stony Brook looks like it was founded later -- according to the school's web site, it was founded in 1957. Doesn't this make it the youngest, not Binghamton (FWIW, it's not an honor to be the youngest!!)</p>
<p>Also, what other interesting, and hopefully distinguishing, information can we put in the opening paragraph. Something about the architecture of the school? Unique colleges within SUNY (as Buffalo and Albany have), hosting any major labs or research centers (as SB runs BNL)? Again, going for NPOV, but there has got to be some interesting tidbits, distinguishing characteristics, etc. about the school that will grab a reader of the article. I added the part about being started as part of SU (I thought that was interesting), but looking for more.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>14:24, 21 March 2007 (UTC) I don't really want to belabor this, and honestly I'm pretty "SUNYed" out from researching these schools, and since none of them are land grants (excepting Cornell's SUNY colleges) they are outside my real area of interest. I do have a few points of clarification if you'll endulge me.</p>
<p>btw -- the so-called competition between SUNY campuses really hurts the system overall, and each of the campuses suffers in my opinion. By constantly knocking each other down, all of the campuses appear compromised at some level when viewed externally. SUNY administration would do well to promote the campuses in their own right and establish four world-class institutions. Or possibly combine UB/Binghamton and SB/Albany into two campuses and properly fund them.</p>
<p>If I said "weak" regarding graduate studies at Binghamton, then my mistake. This was my last stab at SUNY research (really), but I thought it worth mentioning. And please don't go jumping up &amp; down -- I'm keeping all this to the "talk" page. Compared with the other centers in terms of research funding, number of top (US News) ranked programs, etc., Binghamton seems to lag by a bit *after* adjusting for size of the school and lack of medical school (Albany also lacks a medical school). Now don't jump up &amp; down -- here are some data: Stony Brook boasts a Nobel winner on their faculty, Albany a Turing winner (Nobel equiv for CS). Stony Brook runs Brookhaven National Labs (a BIG deal), Albany runs Wadsworth for public health, Buffalo runs Roswell Park Cancer Research. Stony Brook hosts the SUNY-wide center for marine research, Albany the atmospheric sciences research center (these are really well known outside SUNY). Albany, Buffalo, and Stony Brook host other university-wide research centers, but these are less well known. Buffalo has SUNY's only law school. Stony Brook and Buffalo are AAU members -- Albany *may* (or may not!) be far behind in joining based on their funding profile. PLEASE NOTE -- I'm not going on an anti-Binghamton campaign posting all of this to their pages. You seem to think I have it "in" for Binghamton and "for" the other centers. I don't. I recently changed UBs to remove the "flagship" campus claim, because it's plain false. But you asked where I get my opinions from.</p>
<p>Maybe the Binghamton faculty are recruited more for their teaching than research, who knows? Maybe what you say about Binghamton being more focused on humanities is true. Why don't their chemistry or biology faculty attract the same funding as Albany, Buffalo, or Stony Brook? Even adjusting for size and lack of medical school, Binghamton ranks pretty low, behind all of the other centers.</p>
<p>I have no beef with the school. In fact I think it's a fine school. As an article though it was wanting. I think it's much improved, and thank you sincerely for your efforts. I think you are confusing my issues with the article with an issue with the school.</p>
<p>The "public ivy" thing is honestly pretty stupid. There's no such thing as a "public ivy league" -- anyone's list is as good as anyone else's. re: Albany, I followed the entry on their page and, sure enough, it's on a list. Do I give it, personally, any credit? No. Is Buffalo on a list somewhere somehow?? Probably. And if we're going to compare lists, then why does the Greene's list count at all after the Moll's list? Lists are lists. And, really, Arizona? Delaware? Ivy league caliber? Should we go on a wikipedia-wide campaign against schools calling themselves "public ivys"?? It's a very POV term in any case.</p>
<p>Anyway, best of luck with everything. And thanks again. You are rightly proud of your school, and I do think there's probably more to it than lists and "best value" college guides, so the article could be significantly extended and be really interesting.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I would not consider a school with top 20 graduate programs, ranked overall in the top 50 graduate schools in the country (according to US News and World Report) to be a week grad program. Additionally, I know many people, including myself who turned down multiple ivy schools to come to Binghamton. You simply are wrong about the reputation. Further more, recheck your facts... I just revisited the US News site, and Binghamton is in fact in the top tier. Additionally, Albany is tier III,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, and Buffalo and Stony Brook appear below Binghamton in tier II.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Albany, as a matter of fact, appears nowhere as a public ivy. With claims such as this one, it is apparent to me that you just make things up. Schools like Geneseo and Albany self-promote themselves as public ivies, however, they are not. For your benefit I have included the actual list of Public Ivies below (the original and then the updated list).</p>
<p>Moll's list of Public Ivies (the original list):</p>
<pre>
   * College of William and Mary
   * Miami University (Ohio)
   * University of California, Berkeley
   * University of Michigan
   * University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
   * University of Texas at Austin
   * University of Vermont
   * University of Virginia
</pre>
<p>Greene's Guides added the following schools in 2001:</p>
<pre>
   * Binghamton University - State University of New York
   * Indiana University Bloomington
   * Michigan State University
   * Ohio State University
   * Pennsylvania State University
   * Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey
   * University of Arizona
   * University of California Los Angeles
   * University of Colorado at Boulder
   * University of Connecticut
   * University of Delaware
   * University of Florida
   * University of Georgia
   * University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
   * University of Iowa
   * University of Maryland College Park
   * University of Minnesota
   * University of Washington
</pre>
<p>A side note: Wikipedia is not an accepted source for research (sorry).</p>
<p>The Watson connection is huge: He was the head founder for the University, and also gave Binghamton its original campus. Binghamton was a private school at that time.</p>
<p>As far a distinguished rankings go, most people would consider any school in the top 100 of thousands of colleges to be pretty pretigious. Additionally, like I pointed out before, it depends on how you rank them. Kiplinger's, a highly regarded publication, put Binghamton above most every public school when weighing academics and cost (2/3 is academic rankings). It's when you get into endowments, etc., that Binghamton appears to fall in the rankings (though our LOWEST ranking out there puts BU in the top 85 schools in the country... again higher than any other SUNY). Sure, in terms of specifics other SUNYs may find their way ahead of Binghamton, but schools such as Stony Brook are far more focused on research and science than Binghamton which has uniquely maintained themselves as a liberal arts focused research university (many of Binghamton's NSF grants actually go to humanities and social sciences). In terms of overall evaluation of the school, there is not a single publication that puts Binghamton behind another SUNY school. (Even in Kiplinger's comparison including collges and universities together, Binghamton comes ahead of the colleges as well as universities).</p>
<p>20:22, 19 March 2007 (UTC)~ Why my interest in general? I'm interested in land grant schools, and was thinking about writing a book on them, or something else related to schools and colleges possibly focused on the northeast. Wikipedia is (usually) a good resource. The Binghamton entry was pretty useless -- I still don't get the Watson connection (other than there was one).</p>
<p>20:09, 19 March 2007 (UTC)~ nothing against or for, to be honest. Don't agree that its rank is that much distinguished is all, and the original article was a bit much to take and not "encyclopedic" in the least. I think it's better now. But here again in the discussion point, you misrepresent facts. In the US News rankings, they go from "top tier" to "tier III", so Binghamton is "Tier II" --NOT Tier I as you claim. Before a few years ago, they had a formal Tier II (I looked it up), and Albany, Binghamton, Stony Brook, and Buffalo were all listed. You claim things about Binghamton that are either flat out false or real stretches. And yes, I edited the Albany article as well moving the "Public Ivy" claim to the lower section where it belongs (and, yes Albany is on a public Ivy list or other, but also not the original list).</p>
<p>And I have really nothing against the school. I've edited a bunch of university and college sites. I do have a problem with self promotion. Your claims of Binghamton's superiority over its close rivals in SUNY are problematic in light of its relatively weak graduate programs. In spite of your claims to the contrary, Binghamton ranks dead last in SUNY for research -- by a long shot it seems.</p>
<p>But I honestly hope you are happy with your choice. It's probably a fine school, and I'm certain you will do well in life. Compared with Cornell or Columbia grads on your resume?? We'll never know (but, really...)</p>
<p>Yes, I do get rankled with self promotion. I'm a big fan of wikipedia, and think this is a great resource provide the NPOV standards are being applied. Thank you sincerely for improving this article. Now there's probably a *lot* of other information on the school that would be generally interesting and, if you're so inclined, I'd look forward to reading about it.</p>
<p>Still looking for that chemistry rank footnote. Sorry for being a pain, but the information should at least be fact checked.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The difference is that individual research centers receive this distinction, but there are only four institutions in New York State (including Binghamton University) that are designated a Center of Excellence as an institution (very different than say the small-systems packaging center at Binghamton which is a program designated center of excellence).</p>
<p>I'm not sure what it is you have against Binghamton or so "for" other SUNY universities, but it has been ranked time and again as a very prestigious institution where many students opt to attend over many top 20 universities. Additionally, it is ranked higher than any other SUNY institution, and its graduates are viewed in that respective light (granted each school has its own strengths and weaknesses). Binghamton, for instance is a tier I (top 75 out of 3,00o+ schools) school according to US News and World Report... Albany is not even ranked and is listed as a tier III school (this means they aren't even considered in school rankings). Additionally, Binghamton's selectivity, graduation rates, retention rates, and admission criteria are well above the other four university centers, which is a direct reflection of the student body.</p>
<p>Part of my personal decision to attend Binghamton was via input from potential employers who expressed a preference of a Binghamton student over a Cornell, or Columbia students, for example. Not to put other schools down, but it appears you are trying to bring Binghamton down through the masking and/or eradication of facts. There is a reason that Fisk guide calls Binghamton the Premier Public University in the Northeast every year... it is not just PR stunt. His publications (mind you he was the former admission director for Harvard, and education editor for the Times) outline explicitly why the said distinction was given.</p>
<p>I think this needs to be the end of the qualms... I have gone to extensive measure to pursue diplomacy on the matter, of which I think was done fairly and sufficiently.</p>
<p>18:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)~please post link to ACS. I'm an ACS member and don't put a whole lot of stock in their opinion of programs (prefer to look at publications and funding), but still it's worth footnoting.</p>
<p>Also other university centers have centers of excellence. UB in Bioinformatics, Albany in nanoscience and engineering, Stony Brook in wireless. Binghamton's may be the newest, but it is by no means unique within SUNY (you have got to stop reading the schools PR!!). Check out <a href="https://portal.rfsuny.org/portal/page?_pageid=1307,1623613&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL" class="external free" title="https://portal.rfsuny.org/portal/page?_pageid=1307,1623613&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL" rel="nofollow">https://portal.rfsuny.org/portal/page?_pageid=1307,1623613&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL</a>.</p>
<p>Also, Albany and Stony Brook host university-wide research centers -- Albany in atmospheric science, and stony brook in marine biology. Binghamton also lags, by far, the other three in terms of research funding. My read is that SB and Albany are the best for grad programs and research, Binghamton is the best for undergrad, and Buffalo is somewhere in between for both but by far the largest center. Lastly, Buffalo hosts Roswell Park Cancer Center, Albany runs Wadsworth Labs, and Stony Brook runs Brookhaven National Labs -- again, I don't believe Binghamton has this distinction, but please post if I am incorrect. I've learned a lot about SUNY through this research, and it looks like a pretty good system overall. The university centers are all probably a bit better than their national profile, and hopefully they'll catch up. I really believe, from the reading I've done, that you can get as good an education at Binghamton (or Buffalo, SB, Albany) as you can at Penn St, Wisconsin, UC-x. And I suppose if you read the footnotes of the guidebooks, they all basically say the same thing. Of course I'm not happy that Princeton is currently #1.</p>
<p>American Chemical Society beginning in 2004. In general, Binghamton's sciences are some of the top in country. Binghamton is the only SUNY school designated as a center of excellence in research. Binghamton's placement into grad schools, especially medical fields is the highest in SUNY. Placement into vet and optometry school is 100%, and med school is more than 20% above the national average.</p>
<p>16:05, 19 March 2007 (UTC)~ thanks for making the changes. I really think the article is improved. Not to nitpick, but where is Binghamton's chemistry dept ranked #19? I tried to follow the source and couldn't find it. I recruit from top-20 science departments, and Binghamton isn't on my list (Buffalo, Albany, Stony Brook are though).</p>
<p>In the interest of diplomacy, I am systematically going through this article to check for facts, but mostly to address the language to ensure a NPOV stance. I will say that I evidentally dissagree with some definitions of NPOV (for instance, I believe that if it is a cited fact, then it isn't biased, hence NPOV).</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried to alter definative statements like, "Binghamton is the number 1..." to "According to XYZ, Binghamton is the number 1..."</li>
<li>I attempted removing unecessary comparison language, such as, "higher than any other SUNY." - just giving the fact.</li>
<li>I moved around some of the sentences to make a more appropriate NPOV flow.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/n/Talk%7EBinghamton_University_151d.html" title="Edit section: Highest ranked&#160;?? Cornell??">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Highest ranked ?? Cornell??</span></h2>
<p>15:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)~ But shouldn't this be under the "rankings and stats" section rather in the opening paragraph (if at all)? Seems like boosterism to me -- most other schools, including schools much more highly regarded than Binghamton, maybe have a sentence about a ranking or otherwise. Take a look at UC-Berkeley, arguably the best public university in the U.S. There's no mention of ranking or otherwise in the opening paragraph (apart from it being the flagship campus of UC, which is true). In the rankings section there are three total paragraphs, only mention US News, etc. To look at a "real ivy", I checked Yale's, and again in the opening paragraph there's only a mention that the College is "particularly well known". Whatever, right now the article looks like a hack job and does Wikipedia users no real service. Binghamton has its own home on the web where they can self promote all they want.</p>
<p>15:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)~ In terms of so-called rankings, I think again you're specifically talking about undergraduate education. From what I've read, Binghamton ranks at the bottom of the research universities for graduate education -- in terms of research funding, US News ranking of departments, caliber of faculty research, etc. So, again, this claim that it's the best is suspect -- particularly given that it is designated primarily as a *research* unversity by SUNY. If I pick up the US News graduate guides, Binghamton is last, and probably last in the Northeast (considering UConn, the other SUNYs, UVM, Massachusetts).</p>
<p>This entire page reflects those of most colleges and universities in the country (in terms of numbers of facts, etc.) I have systematically gone through to add refrences. It is not Binghamton's claim to be the highest ranked, it is a cited fact (and it IS in fact cited on the article). Additionally Cornell DOES NOT count in public school rankings. This is not an opinion, no matter what a rep from the school may say... If they were considered a public school, they would ranked and compared with such institutions, however publications like US News, Kiplinger's, Fisk, etc., do not include Cornell or any land-grant institutions for that matter. You should not delete information on this page... especially cited information. There are some pages, such as Geneseo's who have flirted with breaking Wikipedia rules by including language that is not fact, rather acknowledge promotional language of their admissions office. For instance, they also claim to be a public ivy, however, they do not appear on the actual list of public ivies. Binghamton however, is actually listed in the publication as a public ivy... (Follow the public ivy link. You will find that Binghamton is there, and the only mention of Geneseo is that they are not actually a public ivy, but self-promote themselves as such). The Binghamton article isn't using promotional language, it is, whether you like it or not, citing facts. 14:12, 19 March 2007 (UTC)~ Doesn't seem to matter. This still violates Wikipedia's academic grandstanding in letter and spirit. Cornell is a public/private school according to sources including a Cornell rep I spoke with. I don't see how Binghamton can offer an "ivy-league caliber education" without ivy-league students in the peer group. Looking at graduate programs, it appears to me that Binghamton is by far the *lowest* ranked of the SUNY schools -- if, for example, I were to go by the # US News graduate programs ranked. Seems Buffalo, Albany, and Stony Brook far outpace Binghamton for the caliber of graduate studies. But, again, none of these are "ivy league".</p>
<p>But regardles. The claims have to go. You can pull them, or I will. Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_academic_boosterism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_academic_boosterism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_academic_boosterism</a>. This guideline specifically says to avoid "burying the reader in facts" -- i.e., replacing vague claims of prestige with a bunch of facts, etc. And, more to the point, avoiding them in the opening paragraph. If you want to re-write this to better comply, that's fine. Honestly it will reflect better on your school, because right now, "The lady doth protest too much, methinks".</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Binghamton University actually the highest ranked public school within NYS (even the northeast according to some publications). Cornell is not a public school, they are a landgrant school with components that are public... that is in fact rather different than a public school. They are not ranked with public schools. Additionally, US News and World report is one source, incidentally the source that ranks Binghamton the lowest. Other Publications, such as the Fisk Guide to College, written by Edward Fisk, former admissions director for Harvard and education editor for the New York Times, call Binghamton the, "Premier Public University in the Northeast." They rank Binghamton the highest in all of the Northeast. Additionally, Binghamton appears in Greene's Guide of Public Ivies being cited as a public school that offers an Ivy League caliber education. Also, Kiplinger's Personal Finance ranks Binghamton the number 1 and 5 best value school in the country for out-of-state and in-state students repectively, based approximately 2/3 on academics and just 1/3 on financials.</p>
<p>Nothing should be deleted from the site. All of the information is in fact backed up, and many of those claims you mention are cited. I also looked into, and Binghamton has many programs ranked top twenty in the county: Political Science, Sociology, Chemistry, Psychology, etc.</p>
<p>I believe you may be getting caught up over language. For example: SUNY Geneseo is a college, while Binghamton University is a University. These schools are not ranked against each other, except in unique area, such as best values. Harvard and Syracuse, for instance, are not ranked against schools like Geneseo, Swathmore, or Bowdoin.</p>
<p>I also found out that approximately 1/3 of the student body addmitted to Binghamton is also admitted to Cornell, but chooses Binghamton (I cannnot cite that source, it was in print text). As someone who turned down Cornell, I would have to say that you are overly edifying their institution. As far as comparing them academically, the fact that Binghamton is considered a public ivy automatically impolies a comperable education. Often schools like Binghamton are unfairly hurt in rankings (like US News) that include endowments in their calculations. Binghamton is a young institution, founded in 1946, and hence still has a relatively small endowment. Those public schools that tend to be found higher in the rankings are frequently among the oldest, formerly private, sector of schools. Other factors that are included in the ranking calculations would imply that Binghamton measures up: Retention rates near Ivy League standards, the 3 highest graduatation rate among public schools (according the national education trust) behind UVA and the College of William and Mary, it is a center of excellence for important research, etc. Additionally, those publications that do not include things like endowments and focus more on the academic integrity of a school rank Binghamton much higher. Not to be redundant, but Kiplinger's is one such publication. Based 2/3 on academics, they are ranked the 1st best value for out-of-state students, and the 5th best for in-state. That ranking also puts universities and colleges together (Geneseo, who actually costs slightly less than Binghamton is ranked below Binghamton in value for both categories, is hence not ranked as highly academically).</p>

<p>03:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)~ that's how I'm leaning, but let a bit of time before making the edits (only fair to allow for responses). Also the "rankings" section is a bit of a joke; much of it is uncited, and there are no rankings in the typical sense. Also, they mention Binghamton is #38 of national state schools, but not that it's tier #2 overall, which is hardly distinguished. Very little of this article contains interesting information about the school, and it's one of the more dull reads on wikipedia. I suppose my so-called 'proof' that it's misleading is that when I check the actual sources I find Binghamton to be a relatively high-decent state university -- decent for certain, but not outstanding. But from the article you would think this is was SUNY Yale or something.</p>
<p>The edits to the University Centers and Geneseo seem to be largely the work of one individual intent on asserting the "superiority" of his alma mater over the rest of the SUNY system. I agree with you wholeheartedly that this is like asserting that a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subaru_Outback_8b5b.html" title="Subaru Outback">Subaru Outback</a> is the best station wagon among all <a href="../../../s/t/a/Station_wagon.html" title="Station wagon">station wagons</a>.

<p>19:43, 18 March 2007 (UTC)~ okay, never mind. I see the qualification, although it doesn't really seem noteworthy to be the "highest ranked public" in NYS, does it??? Looks like grasping at straws to promote the school to me. Not exactly NPOV. I looked as the US News rank, and Binghamton isn't even a top-50 university, with most good publics well into the list (e.g., Michigan, UNC, several UC, Indiana, etc., etc.) Still interested in comments re: Cornell. Public, private, hybrid? How do we factor this? <small>Posted anonymously by User:71.232.55.30</small></p>
<p>19:40, 18 March 2007 (UTC)~~ okay -- I'm pulling it unless there's something more compelling. Turns out University of Connecticut is ranked a good bit higher at #67. Cornell aside -- it doesn't matter. Please respond here, as I don't want to go back and forth on the edits (plus it's rude to edit without some consensus, even if, as in this case, it's just factually incorrect). <small>Posted anonymously by User:71.232.55.30</small></p>
<p>19:31, 18 March 2007 (UTC)~ yes, I get that. But it seems wrong somehow with Cornell down the road, publically funded, etc. and Geneseo #1 in another category (I think). Misleading at best. <small>Posted anonymously by User:71.232.55.30</small></p>
<pre>
highest-ranked public university in New York State, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report.[1] 
</pre>
<p>This is confusing, and I'm looking for input here. Cornell is in a different league than Binghamton, I think we'll all agree. A good chunk of the Cornell is public, and part of SUNY. In fact, Cornell is New York State's land-grant school -- along the lines of Michigan, UC-Berkeley, etc. But Cornell is technically a mixed public and private university. <small>Posted anonymously by User:71.232.55.30</small></p>
<p>comments? Should we (a) pull the claim as non-factual, (b) qualify the claim, (c) leave it "as is" since Binghamton is a fully public University? This somehow seems wrong though. Currently I'd vote for "a" since it's a misleading claim at best, and the US News lists Geneseo fairly high as well, but in another category. Can we say one campus is better than the other? <small>Posted anonymously by User:71.232.55.30</small></p>
<p>For the record, I'm not an alum of either school (attended SU, Columbia, and Harvard). Thought it worth mentioning because this college site in particular seems loaded with editorial. <small>Posted anonymously by User:71.232.55.30</small></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Geneseo is the only UNDERGRADUATE COLLEGE in SUNY with a Phi Betta Kappa chapter. Binghamton also has a chapter (I'm in it), and I believe atleast one other University Center has it.</p>

<p>I looked at the Geneseo article. Apparently they're the first _undergraduate_ school with a PBK chapter. Binghamton has had one for years. I don't mean to denigrate Geneseo, I just wonder if the statement "SUNY Geneseo has eclipsed Binghamton in its admission standards and caliber of teaching" is an objective statement. -- <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanO_49f3.html" title="User:SeanO">SeanO</a> 12:05, August 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I couldn't care less about getting into a pissing contest about who is best. More facts, less comparison; this is a page about SUNY-B, not Geneseo, so why bother cross-referencing and opening up a can of worms? (If we include Geneseo, why not include Stony Brook? Buffalo? Albany? etc.) If you felt "best" was too strong, that's understandable; let's tone it down to something more objectively agreeable as suggested above.

<p>Actually, this is not entirely true. While they cannot forbit a student from applying, they can refuse the student the use of that institution's recommendation, hence disqualifying the individual from candidacy into most any grad program. So, no, a school can't actually stop the student, but they can take drastic strides in assuring the school's image through statistics. Binghamton University has made the decision to stand against such practices and while giving students practical guidance will allow, without any implimented restraints, an individual to apply where ever he or she wishes.</p>
<p>Applicants to graduate school do not need the permission of their undergraduate institution to do so. Undergrad institutions may limit access to certain "pre-" programs (pre-med, pre-law) but this does not forbid them making an application to any graduate program.</p>

<dd>This is the sentence in question, correct? "Important Note: Unlike MOST schools, Binghamton allows (with guidance) any student who truly wishes to apply to a graduate school the opportunity.

<p>19:30, 18 March 2007 (UTC)~ Someone qualified this as the "Greene's guide", but again, this is a bit suspect. Not sure what credibility Greene's guide has, and, honestly, there's no such thing as the "public ivy league". There's no list of member universities, no council, etc. It doesn't exist. If anything, in other college articles they seem to insist it appear on the originial 1985 list -- the entry for UConn for example, makes no mention of being a so-called public ivy. Binghamton was not on the original list (nor was ANY SUNY school).</p>
<p>On another note, this is hardly an NPOV article -- seems like a lot of promotional material posted by a Binghamton student or alum.</p>
<p>Left it in for now, but SUNY Binghamton is *not* a public Ivy. this is a very specific list, and was published in 1985. The schools are William and Mary, Virignia, Michigan, Berkeley, UNC, Miami (OH), UT Austin, and Vermont. Greene's Guides added Binghamton to a new list in 2001 that has nothing to do with the original or original term (they also added Michigan State, Indiana, Ohio State, Arizona, UConn, Deleware, etc.) -- not sure how much credit is given the new list, since several tier3/tier4 schools are on it.</p>
<p>I've never heard Binghamton called, "The Public Ivy". Has anyone NOT affiliated with the university used this term, other than that one Greene's Guide which called numerous other public institutions, "Public Ivies"? I also thought of "Suny-Bing" as being the unofficial nickname for the school. We should probably pull this claim, or at least have it better qualified.</p>

<dd>Who knows... It's a very POV term... The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education lists SUNY Albany as a public ivy, but not Binghamton... There's no official list. Regarding "SUNY-Bing"...
