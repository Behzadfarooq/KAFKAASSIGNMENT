<p><b>William Keith Nelsen</b> (Born <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_29.html" title="January 29">January 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>) was a former <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">football</a> player who played collegiately for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Southern_California_4e4b.html" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a> and professionally with both the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Steelers_bedf.html" title="Pittsburgh Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Browns_d021.html" title="Cleveland Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>. He was known for his leadership ability and ability to play with pain, having endured a series of knee injuries during the course of his career. He later served as an assistant coach with four NFL teams.</p>

<p>After playing one season at Cerritos Junior College in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, Nelsen moved on to USC, where he was a key player during his first two seasons, leading the squad in total offense in both <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, he split time at the position with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Beathard_214a.html" title="Pete Beathard">Pete Beathard</a>, helping the team capture the national championship.</p>

<p>Nelsen was drafted in the 10th round of the 1963 NFL draft by the Steelers, but saw limited action during his first two seasons. In 1965, new head coach <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Nixon_7390.html" title="Mike Nixon">Mike Nixon</a> gave Nelsen the starting job. However, the struggling team finished 2-12, offering him little help, with Nelsen throwing for eight touchdowns, in addition to 17 interceptions. In the <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> game against the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>, Nelsen suffered a knee injury that plagued him the remainder of that year and underwent surgery after the season.</p>
<p>The following season, Nelsen suffered a knee injury against the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Lions_6dd4.html" title="Detroit Lions">Detroit Lions</a> in the season's second game. Originally scheduled to be out of the lineup for six weeks, Nelsen would not return until the season's 12th week. The limited time on the field allowed him to set a league record for fewest interceptions (100 minimum passes) with just one on the campaign. In the season finale on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_18.html" title="December 18">December 18</a>, he completed his final 11 passes to defeat the expansion <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Falcons_01c3.html" title="Atlanta Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a>.</p>
<p>In 1967, the injuries continued for Nelsen when during the closing moments of the September 24 game against the <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Cardinals_c8e5.html" title="Arizona Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals(football)</a>, he was injured following a tackle by <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Walker_aeb3.html" title="Chuck Walker">Chuck Walker</a>. He missed the next four games, but came off the bench to engineer a 14-10 comeback victory over the expansion New Orleans Saints on October 29.</p>
<p>On May 14, 1968, Nelsen was traded, along with defensive back Jim Bradshaw to the Browns. After serving as <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Ryan_%28American_football%29_c09a.html" title="Frank Ryan (American football)">Frank Ryan</a>'s backup for three games that year, Nelsen was elevated to the starting role, and quickly made his mark with a shocking 30-20 upset of the previously unbeaten <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Colts_aabe.html" title="Indianapolis Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> on October 20. By the end of the season, Nelsen had led the team to the playoffs, winning nine of his 11 starts.</p>
<p>In 1969, Nelsen had another strong season, leading the Browns to a 10-3-1 record and a postseason berth, as well as being selected to his first and only <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro_Bowl_580f.html" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowl</a>. One week after throwing for five touchdowns in a 42-10 victory over the previously unbeaten <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Cowboys_c876.html" title="Dallas Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">November 2</a>, Nelsen spent a miserable afternoon against the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Vikings_eec0.html" title="Minnesota Vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a> on the losing end of a 51-3 score. In addition, he briefly left that game with a pinched nerve in his throwing arm, a malady that would trouble him for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>In game two of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_NFL_season_6dff.html" title="1970 NFL season">1970 NFL season</a>, Nelsen took yet another hit to his knees in a September 27 game against the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_49ers_43f8.html" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>. The injury forced him out of the game and kept him on the sidelines the following week as well. After a midseason slump, he was replaced for one game by rookie <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Phipps_25e6.html" title="Mike Phipps">Mike Phipps</a>, but returned to start the final five games. Unfortunately, the Browns dropped to a 7-7 mark and missed the postseason.</p>
<p>In 1971, Nelsen led the Browns to four wins in their first five games, but another midseason slump once again relegated him to the bench for one game. Unlike the previous year, however, Nelsen led the team to five straight victories to once again reach the playoffs. Nelsen briefly won the starting job to start the 1972 season, but gave way to Phipps after a 26-10 loss to the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Bay_Packers_4077.html" title="Green Bay Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> in the opening game. Weeks after the conclusion of the season, Nelsen underwent his fifth knee operation and announced his retirement.</p>

<p>On February 14, 1973, he was hired as an assistant coach for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, but resigned after two years. After briefly considering the Browns' open head coaching slot, he accepted an assistant position with the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Falcons_01c3.html" title="Atlanta Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a>. He resigned that position following the dismissal of head coach <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marion_Campbell_ff0b.html" title="Marion Campbell">Marion Campbell</a>.</p>
<p>On February 9, 1977, he was named quarterback coach of the <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers_437e.html" title="Tampa Bay Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>, reuniting him with his former college coach, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McKay_60db.html" title="John McKay">John McKay</a>.

After sitting out the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_NFL_season_a23d.html" title="1983 NFL season">1983 NFL season</a>, Nelsen was hired by <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Lions_6dd4.html" title="Detroit Lions">Detroit Lions</a>' head coach <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monte_Clark_d913.html" title="Monte Clark">Monte Clark</a>, a former Browns teammate, as their offensive coordinator on January 20, 1984.</p>
<p>Nelsen has since retired from coaching.</p>
