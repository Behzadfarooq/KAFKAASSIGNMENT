<h2><span class="mw-headline">Breaking up article</span></h2>
<p>Since this article is now bigger than the preferred size, I think that it should be broken up into smaller chunks with the Bill Clinton page itself becoming a directory to these pages. New pages could be donoted as follows family and early career, govenorship, presidency, and post-presidency. I think his presidency may have to be broken up into at least two pages, one for each term at least. This is my two cents on the matter. <a href="../../../g/m/o/User%7EGmosaki_b9a2.html" title="User:Gmosaki">Gmosaki</a> 22:15, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that some of the more lengthy material should be spun off into sub-articles. I <i>strongly</i> disagree that the Bill Clinton page should become merely a directory to these pages. The main page should be an encyclopedia article, summarizing the important material, with links to expanded discusssions of various topics in the sub-articles. The point is that one shouldn't have to wade through all that stuff to get a basic understanding of the topic ... otherwise, why have sub-articles at all? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 16:02, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Caution: President Has "Zero Influence" Over Economy</span></h2>
<p>Derex has corrected all of our problems! When facts are introduced, hey, the truth must go. While leaving all the other numbers and conjectures (conjectures until proven), the cited, independent fact must go. But hey, ZERO INFLUENCE is ZERO INFLUENCE. Everyone in agreement I am sure will all at once bombarding this site with removals of the economy section! After, it wasn't Clinton's credit . . . or fault.</p>
<dl>
<dd>For the context of the current tirade, please see the section just below. And personally, I don't think Clinton had much impact on the economy one way or the other; but that's just my opinion. The point is that <b>by law</b> Clinton has no control over the Fed, so it's clearly inappropriate to suggest otherwise. That's my last word on the matter, I'll not respond to further trolling. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">@</a> 18:06, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's folly to think that a President has zero influence over the economy. The President DOES have influence over interest rates, albeit indirectly. The Fed, generally, has a mandate to fight inflation/stimulate the economy via interest rates. When the budget and trade deficit is high, the Fed will have pressure to increase interest rates to beat down inflation. When the reverse is true, there is more scope to expand the economy via lower interest rates.</p>
<p>In addition, the president also has influnce over the economy, via the budget, by encouraging investments in training and education, or, alternatively, by rewarding productive behaviour. Was welfare reform not a Clinton initiative? Was the Earned Income Tax Credit, effectively a tax cut for the working class, not a Clinton initiative?</p>
<dl>
<dd>yes, as you point out, the fed controls interest rates. exactly my point, the president doesn't except through nomination of members. but then you might as well say the president makes supreme court decisions also.</dd>
<dd>i absolutely agree that over the long-run the tax code, education, infra-structure etc do affect the growth rate of the economy. i find it highly unlikely that any of these things have much impact within the span of just a few years. even the old keynsian argument of stimulus via budget is usually far too sluggish a mechanism to control business cycles ... it's great for a catastrophic depression but essentially useless for modern business cycles. there are sound theoretical and empirical grounds for this viewpoint. i can point you to the relevant literature if you are interested.</dd>
<dd>in short, yes the president impacts the economy. for example, the bush policies have been incredibly damaging to our long-term prospects. but are they the reason the economy is in the doldrums at the moment? highly doubtful. the impacts will unfold over a long time as reduced gdp growth, reduced infrastucture maintenance and improvement, reduced social spending, less improvement on poverty, worse environmental performance, ... overall a drag on standard of living. is bush personally responsible for elevated unemployment, or for the recent uptick in inflation? no, those are short-term phenomena over which the president has little control. they are also far less important than the long-term impacts i mentioned.</dd>
<dd>however, this is all tangential to the point under dispute ... the president simply does not set interest rates any more than he can overturn roe v. wade. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 16:19, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Interest Rate: Not Relevant Now</span></h2>
<p>Interesting: there were fictitious "lowest interest rates" quoted here that was relevant . . . but not pointed out as a lie, so not relevant . . . oh, I see, let's just mention the good parts about the economy. Derex says the president doesn't control when something bad happens . . . maybe he didn't control any of the good things either and they should all be removed. Of course, none of that information is cited currently. When talking about the economy, lets be FAIR and BALANCED. Did Clinton control the unemployment rate? Homeowner rate? By Derelicx's logic, no. Everyone, realize a slant when you see one.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Excuse me? What slant? You put in a graph of the 50-year fed funds rate. That's pure silliness. By <b>law</b>, the president has no control over the Fed funds rate. Certainly it does not deserve one of the few images here. Further, it didn't even back up the claim that you made in the text ... that interest rates increased dramatically during clinton's tenure. They didn't. They went down a bit, then up a bit, never varying by more than a point either way. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">@</a> 03:23, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your excused, but only this once. A mistake once, shame on that pesky graph. A second time, shame on you.(Many seventh graders have difficulty reading that darn x- and y-axes; interest rate is 3.00&amp; in September 1992, but was 91% higher by Feb. 2000 and 117% higher by May 2000<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.) NOTE: Don't believe me, read the facts. By <b>law</b> the president has no control over the unemployment rate, stock ownership, or all the other myriad of claims made on Wiki. That's pure silliness. YET you left it in . . . uncited, might I add. First, some poor would-be-Wiki editor said interest rates lowered . . . that Clinton controlled interest rates like he did home ownership and the number of people that work on Long Island . . . not only wrong, but a flat out lie. So, I correct it since there is this broad assumption of the economic control of Bill Clinton. Hey, that is the whole hype about the economic boom. But then this one pertinent negative isn't. Fantastic! ALL HAIL: DEREX IS REMOVING THIS INCREDULOUS ECONOMIC INFORMATION BECAUSE HE FINALLY REALIZES WHAT MANY HAVE MISSED (AND NOT BEING FACETIOUS, but I really do agree) THAT THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T CONTROL THE ECONOMY; FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MISSED THAT SECTION IN 6TH GRADE, THAT WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF A TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENT, NOT A DEMOCRATIC ONE. Kudos to Derex! Kudos to Derex! He has my vote for Editor-in-Chief. See, we do agree on something!
<dl>
<dd>Anon, respectfully, you are being obnoxious shouting like that; it just makes you seem intemperate. <b>By law</b> the president has no influence over the Fed, which controls interest rates, beyond nomination of the board of governors. That is different from every other aspect of the economy, <i>de jure</i>. Whether the president <i>de facto</i> influences other aspects of the economy is an open debate. It is often argued that fiscal policy, government spending and tax policies, plays an important role in the economy. The president does, by law, have quite a bit of control over fiscal policy. Further, social welfare programs, which the president also largely controls, play an important role as well.</dd>
<dd>Further, the fed rate is not the economically relevant one, that's just the overnight inter-bank lending rate. The relevant rate is really the commercial &amp; housing rates. A one-point move in the fed rate may be a high percentage there, but it is a <i>much</i> less significant percentage change in the relevant economic rates. Interest rates were, by historical standards, quite stable over Clinton's presidency. Not that he had control over that, again by law. Your 50-year graph of the fed funds rate is clearly out of place.</dd>
<dd>As to your 6th grade crack, I actually did graduate high-school, as my user page shows. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">@</a> 15:41, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"Clearly out of place." Sounds great, yet no one contested the fact before and only questioned it once it disputed the original suggestion of lower interest rates (and what is relevant and what is not is another matter). That is the problem. Whether you say de jure or de facto is irrelevant: the facts weren't right and they weren't questioned until proven negative -- then they're not relevant. That is troubling. Everyone in their right mind knows the President does not control the interest rates -- but if out of line, then also ask the same questions about the other economic indicators. Now, instead of removing a pertinent negative that was once proudly exclaimed as meaningful to the Clinton presidency, reviewers need to start checking the other claims (that's right: all the other numbers on the economic site that do not have a citation are questionable because who came up with the figure and how did they do it). The, whether the role of the president in different matters can be properly assessed and balanced. Hey, qualified facts first and then some analysis. Right now, there is neither because there are not qualified facts. Even the one quote that talks about the deficit is from Clinton's press release. Hardly reliable unless cross-referenced. Still, I am happy that the interest rate myth is dispelled. That was the original goal . . . though only taken down when factually referenced as negative . . . that is disturbing: ok as positive/myth, irrelevant as negative/fact. Where is the logic in that?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clinton Approval -- Lower than 40%?</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Please excuse any talk page guidelines I have unwittingly broken, I'm pretty new to this.</p>
<p>I am curious why the article states that Clinton's "approval rating varied over the course of his first term, ranging from about 40% in 1993"? A coworker of mine asked me what Clinton's lowest approval rating was, I answered 40% based on this page. The coworker pointed me to this page from Roper:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/cgi-bin/hsrun.exe/Roperweb/PresJob/PresJob.htx;start=HS_fullresults?pr=Clinton" class="external free" title="http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/cgi-bin/hsrun.exe/Roperweb/PresJob/PresJob.htx;start=HS_fullresults?pr=Clinton" rel="nofollow">http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/cgi-bin/hsrun.exe/Roperweb/PresJob/PresJob.htx;start=HS_fullresults?pr=Clinton</a></p>
<p>Which seems to show that for two months some polls were consistently showing an approval rating as low as 36%.</p>
<p>I would prefer to believe the polls were biased or poorly done but...?</p>

Update! Although I still greatly admire the way you <i>characterized</i> the unsubstantiated rumors about Bill Clinton and collapsed them into one tight paragraph, I've been instructed that the use of the terms "far right" and 'fomented' are considered unacceptable for use in Wikipedia and should be removed. Any comments on this before I go ahead and make the modifications? Thanks! Big Daddy 09:41, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>POV Clean Up</p>
<p>I changed this - "Clinton was viewed with intense personal dislike of his policies and character by some on the far right.

<dd>Seems fine to me. In terms of syntax, I think the first sentence should be. "Clinton's character and policies were viewed with intense, personal dislike by some conservative critics." The change to the Waco thing makes sense.

I agree although the re-introduction without comment of the word fomenting may be problematic. Either way, with the removal of the emotion-laden tags "far right" I think this is an excellent model of how to deal with the litany of unsubatantiated attacks that are thrown at almost any controversial political figure. I'm glad you agree with me that this is a good treatment for the Clinton article, as I plan on using this model in treating similar rumors and inneundos in other articles.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question about Approval Ratings -- What is an outlier?</span></h2>
<p>CBDunkerson recently reverted an edit of mine where I noted that according to Roper, Clinton's approval rating had dropped to as low as 36%. CBDunkerson's edit comment was: "If we are including outliers we should do so in both directions. Also fixed link."</p>
<p>I have several questions:</p>
<p>A) What is an outlier? When I visit the Roper Poll I had linked to, <a href="http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/cgi-bin/hsrun.exe/Roperweb/PresJob/PresJob.htx;start=HS_fullresults?pr=Clinton" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/cgi-bin/hsrun.exe/Roperweb/PresJob/PresJob.htx;start=HS_fullresults?pr=Clinton" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, I (reluctantly) note that they have 21 data points for approval between 5/26/93 and 8/3/93, a period of a bit more than two months, or 1/6 of 1993, or 2% of his entire term. Within this period, Roper lists 10 data points showing Clinton's approval below 40%. Those 10 data points seemingly represent repeated polling by 4 polling agencies. So for the period in question almost 50% of the data points are less than 40%. In what sense then is a mentioning that Bill Clinton had a low of 36% approval rating relying on an outlier?</p>
<p>B) Which outlier on the high end are you referring to? I say that if it makes sense, list it. But that's just me.</p>
<p>C) How are these sorts of polls handled on other wikipedia topic pages?</p>
<p>If you can help me get my bet back my demonstrating that the 5/26-27/93 Yank/TIME/CNN 36% rating is to be discarded I would appreciate that. But it seems like a reasonable data point and not an outlier to me.</p>

<p><br />
It was from a <b>March 11, 1993 USA Today</b> article. The title of the article was "NRA change: `Omnipotent to powerful'" and Clinton was referring to firearm posession rights during that particular quote. Here is the relevant section from that USA Today article:</p>
<p><i>Reportedly considering a guns tax to help pay for a new health care plan, Clinton is no Second Amendment absolutist. "We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans to legitimately own handguns and rifles . . . that we are unable to think about reality," he said last week.</i></p>
<p>The full archived article can be seen at NewsMine.org <a href="http://newsmine.org/archive/security/gun-laws/cant-preserve-rights-ordinary-citizens.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://newsmine.org/archive/security/gun-laws/cant-preserve-rights-ordinary-citizens.txt" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>While it was misquoted and out of context in this wikipedia article, I do think that it is an important quote to include in its entirety. It shows that, as far as public policy is concerned, Clinton tended to be more mindful of the practical effect of federal laws rather than being a strict constructionist.</p>

<dd>First off...<i>take it easy</i> with your resentments and claims of double standards. I'm not going to speak for Guettarda's views on this. My point is that impeachment is such a rarity in US politics that it warrants mentioning and placement into context. This sets the US system apart from other representative republics where whimisical votes of no confidence lead to more frequent turnover of leaders. A reference to Nixon is not inherently POV as you seem to imply. Nixon subverted law in ways that are far more complicated and far reaching. Yes, I agree that a comment on the Nixon page would be appropriate, just as you have proposed.

The wording is too strong, and there are scholars who would take serious issue with it as written. I suspect the issue will have to be revisited.</li>

<dd>2. Why need the standard for inclusion of Clinton's <i>actual</i> impeachment in the <i>Nixon</i> article be the <i>near-certitude</i> of Nixon's own impeachment? Especially while you simultaneously assert that the fact that Nixon was <i>merely threatened</i> with impeachment warrants its inclusion in the <i>Clinton</i> article?</dd>

<li>The standard does not need be the near certitude. The standard is only that there is a relevant connection (impeachment or threat thereof) between Johnson, Nixon, and Clinton. At the time of the Clinton impeachment hearings, the media and people in general were discussing the history of impeachment and it seems reasonable that the Clinton article (under subheading Impeachment and other scandals) contain a reference to the history of impeachment (or Nixon's resignation under threat).</li>

<p>A question as a newbie: Why would adding Vince Foster to the list of Clinton scandals continually be reverted? It seems that it deserves mention and was phrased in a NPOV manner.

<p>So much for quick answers, or even an answer period. Perhaps this is why so many people are feeling alienated by Wikipedia and Wikipedia is getting so much heat in the public press.

<p>I see that this isn't a new issue here. The introduction mentions that he was "the third-youngest president," and "the first baby boomer president," but not that he was only one of two Presidents to be impeached. The intro to the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Johnson_4b5c.html" title="Andrew Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> article mentions he was the first to be impeached. The intro to the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> article mentions impeachment, even though Nixon was not impeached. Regardless of one's POV about the justification or motivations behind the impeachment, or the conduct that inspired it, to me it seems like it is at least as historically notable as his age on election or his status as a Baby Boomer. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaisershatner_51b9.html" title="User:Kaisershatner">Kaisershatner</a> 17:31, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK I know that this is a big can of worms, but I'm thinking of making some evolutionary rather than revolutionary changes to both of these sections. Healthcare seems ok except that it's fairly short and repetitive, and needs some stylistic work. Welfare reform needs to be explored, too. This was a key turning point in the clinton presidency, and lead to the resignation of at least one cabinet official. You can't talk about Clinton without mentioning his complex, triangular relationship between liberal democrats, congressional (conservative) republicans, and his own administration; simply saying "he supported welfare reform" doesn't do it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to get some ideas before I made any changes.</p>

Regardless of one's POV about the justification or motivations behind the impeachment, or the conduct that inspired it, to me it seems like it is at least as historically notable as his age on election or his status as a Baby Boomer. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaisershatner_51b9.html" title="User:Kaisershatner">Kaisershatner</a> 17:31, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Professor Von Pie, thank you for your recent work to expand this article's information on Don't Ask, Don't Tell. And thank you for including references with your more recent edits. They do discuss Clinton's pledge to end the ban on gays in the military. But you already included a note about that earlier in the paragraph. The <i>new</i> claims immediately preceding the references are that 1) Clinton specifically pledged to end the ban <i>by executive order</i>, and 2) that he mentioned Truman's similar order in doing so. But I can't find anything in the two references to support either claim. Am I missing something? --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 01:06, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I too appreciate the fact that Professor Von Pie got some good sources this time, but I also have a couple problems with the way it is worded now. First, the sources don't prove that Clinton made the promise as an "outreach to gain gay votes and gay campaign contributions". What they do show is that some prominent gay commentators believe that he did this. So it should not be stated as a fact. Second, as you point out, there's nothing in there to show that Clinton pledged to end the ban by executive order. However, I don't think Professor Von Pie is trying to make the claim that Clinton mentioned Truman's similar order. He is saying that gay commentators have mentioned it. Of course, there is no source for that either. - <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximusveritas_5f31.html" title="User:Maximusveritas">Maximusveritas</a> 01:27, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
