<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Waugh_774a.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Waugh was born in <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastrop%2C_Texas_445e.html" title="Bastrop, Texas">Bastrop, Texas</a> in February, 1929. In 1945, upon meeting two local <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marines.html" title="Marines">Marines</a> who returned from the fighting in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the then-15 year-old Waugh was inspired to enlist in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Corps_50a5.html" title="Marine Corps">Marine Corps</a>. Knowing that it was unlikely that he would be admitted in Texas because of his young age, Waugh devised a plan to hitchhike to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, where he believed a person had to only be 16 to enlist. He got as far as <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Cruces_bc75.html" title="Las Cruces">Las Cruces</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> before he was arrested for having no identification and refusing to give his name to a local police officer. He was later released after securing enough money for a bus ticket back to Bastrop. Now committed to serving in the military once he finished school, Waugh became an excellent student at Bastrop High, graduating in 1947 with a 4.0 grade point average.<sup id="_ref-waughschool_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-waughschool" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Waugh enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1948, completing <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_training.html" title="Basic training">basic training</a> at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Ord_eb36.html" title="Fort Ord">Fort Ord</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> in August of that year. He was accepted into the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Airborne_School_ea15.html" title="United States Army Airborne School">United States Army Airborne School</a> and became <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airborne.html" title="Airborne">airborne</a> qualified in December 1948. In April 1951, Waugh was assigned to the 187th Airborne <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regimental_combat_team.html" title="Regimental combat team">Regimental Combat Team (RCT)</a> in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">Korea</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Waugh_774a.html" title="Edit section: U.S. Army Special Forces">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">U.S. Army Special Forces</span></h3>
<p>Shortly after the end of the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>, Waugh began training for the Special Forces. He earned <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Forces_Tab_9f05.html" title="Special Forces Tab">Special Forces Tab</a> and green beret in 1954, joining the 10th Special Forces Group (SFG) in <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Tolz_f81c.html" title="Bad Tolz">Bad Tolz</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Germany_9d9b.html" title="West Germany">Germany</a>.</p>
<p>As U.S. involvement in the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> increased, the United States began deploying Special Forces "A-teams" (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Special_Forces_a603.html#SF_A-team_composition" title="United States Army Special Forces">Operational Detachment Alpha</a>, or ODA, teams) to <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_Asia_4c93.html" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> in support of <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterinsurgency.html" title="Counterinsurgency">counterinsurgency</a> operations against the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Viet_Cong_04da.html" title="Viet Cong">Viet Cong</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Vietnam_5079.html" title="North Vietnam">North Vietnamese</a> and other <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> forces. Waugh arrived in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Vietnam_334f.html" title="South Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> with his ODA in 1961, and began working alongside <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilian_Irregular_Defense_Group_96a0.html" title="Civilian Irregular Defense Group">Civilian Irregular Defense Groups (CIDGs)</a> there, as well as in <a href="../../../l/a/o/Laos.html" title="Laos">Laos</a>.</p>
<p>In 1965, while participating in a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commando.html" title="Commando">commando</a> raid with CIDG troops on a <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Vietnamese_Army_6fa9.html" title="North Vietnamese Army">North Vietnamese Army</a> encampent near Bong Son, <a href="../../../b/i/n/Binh_Dinh_1fb6.html" title="Binh Dinh">Binh Dinh</a> province, Waugh's unit found itself engaged with much larger enemy force. While he and his men attempted to retreat from the battle, Waugh received numerous severe wounds to his head and legs. Despite his injuries, and with the assistance of his teammates, Waugh was safely <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medivac.html" title="Medivac">evacuated</a> from the combat zone. He spent much of 1965 and 1966 recupurating at <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Reed_Hospital_879f.html" title="Walter Reed Hospital">Walter Reed Hospital</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_DC_48ce.html" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a>, eventually returning to duty with 5th SFG in 1966.</p>
<p>At this time Waugh joined the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Assistance_Command%2C_Vietnam_Studies_and_Observations_Group_e781.html" title="Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group">Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG)</a>. While working for SOG, Waugh helped train Vietnamese and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambodia.html" title="Cambodia">Cambodian</a> forces in <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconventional_warfare.html" title="Unconventional warfare">unconventional warfare</a> tactics primarily directed against the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Vietnamese_Army_6fa9.html" title="North Vietnamese Army">North Vietnamese Army</a> operating along the <a href="../../../h/o/_/Ho_Chi_Minh_Trail_a4b3.html" title="Ho Chi Minh Trail">Ho Chi Minh Trail</a>.</p>
<p>Waugh retired from active military duty at the rank of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant_Major_4f01.html" title="Sergeant Major">Sergeant Major</a> (E-9) on February 1, 1972.</p>

<p>After Waugh retired from the military, he worked for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Postal_Service_3c00.html" title="United States Postal Service">United States Postal Service</a> until he accepted on offer in 1977 from ex-CIA officer <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_P._Wilson_4a0a.html" title="Edwin P. Wilson">Edwin P. Wilson</a> to work in Libya on a contract to train that country's special forces. This was not an Agency-endorsed assignment and Waugh might have found himself in trouble with U.S. authorities if it weren't for the fact that he was also approached by the CIA to work for the Agency while in Libya. The CIA tasked him with surveilling Libyan military installations and capabilities – this was of great interest to U.S. intelligence as Libya was receiving substantial military assistance from the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> at the time. This additional assignment quite possibly protected Waugh from prosecution after Wilson was later indicted and convicted in 1979 for illegally selling weapons to Libya.<sup id="_ref-waugh_libya_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-waugh_libya" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1980s he was assigned to the <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwajalein.html" title="Kwajalein">Kwajalein</a> Missile Range in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_Islands_94ee.html" title="Marshall Islands">Marshall Islands</a> to track <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet.html" title="Soviet">Soviet</a> small boat teams operating in the area and prevent them from stealing U.S. missile technology. Some of his more critical assignments took place in <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khartoum.html" title="Khartoum">Khartoum</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> during the early 1990s, where he performed surveillance and intelligence gathering on terrorist leaders <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_the_Jackal_418c.html" title="Carlos the Jackal">Carlos the Jackal</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>.</p>
<p>At the age of 71, Waugh participated in <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Enduring_Freedom_074b.html" title="Operation Enduring Freedom">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> as a member of the CIA team led by <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Schroen_4a00.html" title="Gary Schroen">Gary Schroen</a> that went into <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> to work with the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Alliance_0f0b.html" title="Northern Alliance">Northern Alliance</a> to topple the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a> regime and <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Qaeda_48e2.html" title="Al Qaeda">Al Qaeda</a>. Waugh was in-country from October to December 2001. He continues to work as a "Green Badger", a covert contractor for the CIA.</p>

<p>In 1985, Waugh was again requested by the CIA for clandestine work.
