<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Wyllie_a6a6.html" title="Edit section: Early career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h2>
<p>Wyllie was born in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perth%2C_Western_Australia_3c92.html" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth</a> in the early 1930s. His parents divorced when he was eight, and he spent a brief period in an orphanage while his mother looked for work in the country areas of Western Australia. His mother rented a small house at <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarborough%2C_Western_Australia_47d9.html" title="Scarborough, Western Australia">Scarborough, Western Australia</a> in 1942. At the age of 11, Wyllie successfully applied for a job as a post boy at 15 shillings a week. <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18449081-29277,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18449081-29277,00.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>He left school at the age of 13, and worked in timber mills while studying to be a motor mechanic. After gaining qualifications as a mechanic, he successfully completed correspondence courses in automotive and aeronautical engineering.</p>
<p>In 1952, he joined Wearne Brothers, an Australian automotive and heavy equipment distribution company working from <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> learning business skills. He was also a successful racing car driver, with a car that he built himself. The <i>Singapore Straits Times</i> sponsored his entry in the 1958 <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macau_Grand_Prix_88e3.html" title="Macau Grand Prix">Macau Grand Prix</a> where he made friends with one of his sponsors <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Harper_a4d3.html" title="Bob Harper">Bob Harper</a>, who was an American man, based in Hong Kong.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Wyllie_a6a6.html" title="Edit section: Hong Kong career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hong Kong career</span></h2>
<p>Harper advised Wyllie that his automotive business was struggling at the Macau Grand Prix of 1963. He invited Wyllie to review its operations, resulting in Wyllie recommending that the company be restructured and staffing levels reduced. His proposals were agreed to by creditors, including a moratorium on repayments. Wyllie was appointed as Managing Director, receiving a third of the shares. <a href="http://www.wylliegroup.com/bill-wyllie-a-personal-profile.htm#top" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wylliegroup.com/bill-wyllie-a-personal-profile.htm#top" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>The company returned to profitability and was renamed as Harpers International. By 1968, the company had become Hong Kong's most successful automotive distributor and had branched into finance. In 1972, Harpers International was sold to <a href="../../../s/i/m/Sime_Darby_Limited_b4d8.html" title="Sime Darby Limited">Sime Darby Limited</a> for $HK146 million, forming part of China Engineers Limited, which was a publicly traded company that was controlled by Sime Darby.</p>
<p>By late 1974, China Engineers had run into difficulties with Sime Darby asking Wyllie to become Chairman and CEO of the company. The company quickly returned to profitability in 1975. In 1975, he became the Chief Executive of <a href="../../../h/u/t/Hutchison_Whampoa_2dbd.html" title="Hutchison Whampoa">Hutchison International</a> one of Hong Kong's biggest companies which had run into financial problems. By 1976, 103 Hutchison subsidiaries had been liquidated or sold. He also acquired a number of key businesses, notably the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock. By 1977, the new company had become known as Hutchison Whampoa. In 1981, Wyllie stood down as Chairman and CEO in favour of <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_Ka_Shing_dd68.html" title="Li Ka Shing">Li Ka Shing</a>.</p>
<p>Wyllie worked subsequently in his private company, Asia Securities. In 1982, Wyllie was approached by BSR Limited a British company, to become Executive Chairman and perform another corporate restructure. After returning the company to profitability, Wyllie stood down as Executive Chairman in 1982. He was also involved in restructuring the Regal Hotel Group and Paliburg Investments serving as Executive Chairman between 1984 and 1986, and as an Executive Director until 1997. In 1991, Wyllie sold his interests in Asia Securities for $HK800 million, and established Wyllie Group Pty Ltd.</p>
