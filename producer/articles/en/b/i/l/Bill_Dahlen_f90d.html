<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Dahlen_f90d.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>Dahlen was born in <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelliston%2C_New_York_8177.html" title="Nelliston, New York">Nelliston, New York</a> at the corner of Berthoud and Dahlen and East Main. He was a very good hitter and had a good amount of power for the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead-ball_era.html" title="Dead-ball era">dead-ball era</a>. He began his career with the Colts in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1891_in_baseball.html" title="1891 in baseball">1891</a>, and during his eight years with the team finished among the NL's top ten players in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home runs</a> four times and in <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slugging_average.html" title="Slugging average">slugging average</a> three times. He also scored over 100 runs with 10 or more triples in each of his first six seasons; in 1894 he posted the highest batting average to that time by a major league shortstop (various sources state .357 or .362), and he followed with a .352 average in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896_in_baseball.html" title="1896 in baseball">1896</a>. His 1894 season included a record 42-game hitting streak from <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_20.html" title="June 20">June 20</a> to <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, surpassing the 33-game streak by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Davis_%28baseball_player%29_0a3a.html" title="George Davis (baseball player)">George Davis</a> one year earlier. Amazingly, after going 0-for-6 in the next game, a 10-inning contest on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_7.html" title="August 7">August 7</a>, Dahlen pulled off another 28-game streak, ending up having hit in 70 of 71 games. His mark was broken three years later by <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Keeler_abe2.html" title="Willie Keeler">Willie Keeler</a>, who hit in 44 straight; that NL record was eventually tied by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Rose_8e17.html" title="Pete Rose">Pete Rose</a>. Only <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_DiMaggio_29be.html" title="Joe DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a>, with his 56-game streak in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941_in_baseball.html" title="1941 in baseball">1941</a>, has bettered Dahlen's mark among right-handed batters. Dahlen also twice hit three triples in a game (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_3.html" title="May 3">May 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896_in_baseball.html" title="1896 in baseball">1896</a>; <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898_in_baseball.html" title="1898 in baseball">1898</a>), and once he tripled twice in one inning (<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">August 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900_in_baseball.html" title="1900 in baseball">1900</a>).</p>
<p>Prior to the 1899 season, Dahlen was traded by Chicago, and ended up in Brooklyn after another deal. His new team won the NL title in each of his first two seasons, and although his batting average had dropped from that of earlier years, he compensated by continuing to accumulate numerous walks and <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">stolen bases</a> and by playing outstanding defense. In 1902, he finished fourth in the NL with 74 RBI. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903_in_baseball.html" title="1903 in baseball">1903</a> he set an NL record for <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fielding_percentage.html" title="Fielding percentage">fielding percentage</a> with a .948 average, breaking <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Wright_%28baseball%29_3c88.html" title="George Wright (baseball)">George Wright</a>'s <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878_in_baseball.html" title="1878 in baseball">1878</a> mark of .947; <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Corcoran_3934.html" title="Tommy Corcoran">Tommy Corcoran</a> broke his record in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905_in_baseball.html" title="1905 in baseball">1905</a> with a .952 average.</p>
<p>After the 1903 season, Dahlen was traded to the Giants, the team he'd always strived to play for, in exchange for <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcher.html" title="Pitcher">pitcher</a> Jack Cronin and Charlie Babb. While Cronin and Babb contributed only three bad years to Brooklyn, Dahlen posted great numbers with the Giants, leading the league with 80 RBI in his first year, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904_in_baseball.html" title="1904 in baseball">1904</a>. In 1905 he was again among the RBI leaders, despite hitting only .242, as the Giants won their first <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905_World_Series_cba8.html" title="1905 World Series">World Series</a> title. Although he was hitless in the five-game Series, he contributed with flawless defense and by drawing three walks and stealing three bases. He was often considered one of the quietest players in the game, keeping to himself most of the time. After the 1907 season, he was traded to the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Braves_4729.html" title="Atlanta Braves">Boston Doves</a>, for whom he played his last two full seasons. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909_in_baseball.html" title="1909 in baseball">1909</a> he broke <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jake_Beckley_e737.html" title="Jake Beckley">Jake Beckley</a>'s record of 2386 career games; his record was broken in turn by <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honus_Wagner_4380.html" title="Honus Wagner">Honus Wagner</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914_in_baseball.html" title="1914 in baseball">1914</a>. He was named Brooklyn's manager for the 1910 season, but never finished above 6th place in four seasons. His last playing appearances were three games as a pinch-hitter in 1910, and one game at shortstop in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911_in_baseball.html" title="1911 in baseball">1911</a>.</p>
<p>In a 21-season career, Dahlen batted .272; his 84 home runs were then among the fifteen highest totals in history, and ranked behind only <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman_Long_0c2c.html" title="Herman Long">Herman Long</a> (91) among shortstops. His 289 stolen bases after the <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html#Background" title="Stolen base">statistic was redefined</a> in 1898 were then among the ten highest totals, as were his 547 total steals since they were first recorded in 1887. His records for games and putouts at shortstop were broken by <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbit_Maranville_8d2c.html" title="Rabbit Maranville">Rabbit Maranville</a>, and his mark for assists was surpassed by <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Aparicio_87e5.html" title="Luis Aparicio">Luis Aparicio</a>, with his NL record standing until <a href="../../../o/z/z/Ozzie_Smith_ed2a.html" title="Ozzie Smith">Ozzie Smith</a> broke it in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_in_baseball.html" title="1993 in baseball">1993</a>; his record for double plays was broken by <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Peckinpaugh_0313.html" title="Roger Peckinpaugh">Roger Peckinpaugh</a>. Dahlen's 14,566 total chances at all positions have been surpassed by only Maranville (16,091) and Wagner (15,536). In four years as a manager, all for Brooklyn, he posted a 251-355 record for a .414 winning percentage; he earned his nickname with a ferocious arguing style which drew 65 ejections as a manager, still among the top ten in history.</p>
<p>Dahlen died in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn.html" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> after a long illness at age 80., and was buried in the <a href="../../../c/e/m/Cemetery_of_the_Evergreens%2C_Brooklyn_6466.html" title="Cemetery of the Evergreens, Brooklyn">Cemetery of the Evergreens</a>, Brooklyn, New York City, New York. As of 2006, his grave remains unmarked.</p>
