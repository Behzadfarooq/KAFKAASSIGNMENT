<p>What's so hard to understand? What jingoism? I added the Romanian and the Turkish name for the city. What is disruptive about that? Any article about a city should have other versions of the name mentioned, as long as they represent some kind of significance. See <a href="../../../s/u/c/Suceava.html" title="Suceava">Suceava</a> and <a href="../../../i/a/s/Iasi.html" title="Iasi">Iasi</a>: we have Ukrainian, Polish, and Hungarian version of the name. And even, even if this was against Wiki policy—which of course it isn't—it wouldn't fall under <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>. The only jingoists here are those who oppose having the Hungarian version of the name for the Transylvanian cities; and we do have the Hungarian versions for the name of those cities. Why not this one? And why accuse me of jingoism and for being disruptive? I want you to either justify your accusations or retract them. I also think you should first discuss before reverting. In my opinion, you are the one who is being disruptive—as you have been for most of the time. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Thus Spake Anittas</a> 23:51, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, if you want to move the Romanian and Ottoman Turkish names up to the top, also move the Greek, Latin, Italian, Russian, Bulgarian, Gagauz, Polish, Hungarian, Hebrew, and German names as well. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 06:02, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You can do that if you wish, but according to the Wiki policy, at least 10-percent of the names included should be known in English references. Akkerman And Cetatea Alba are probably better known in English than the Ukrainian name; and yes, I think they would pass the 10-percent mark, but I'm not so sure about the Latin, Greek, and Italian names. The Gagauz name seems to be the same as the Bulgarian and Turkish name, but I believe that those countries or states, that either had a significant presence in the city, or held it for a few centuries, should have their name included in the article; but if you don't want that, then it's no biggie.--<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Thus Spake Anittas</a> 06:08, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see what you're saying, but the second part says "or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place." According to this, wouldn't Polish, Greek, Gagauz, Hebrew, etc. apply as well? (for being at the top) Actually, Yiddish would be more appropriate than Hebrew. Anyways, my point is that the intro would be too crowded and its readability would be impaired if we did this. For this article, I think it's best to move <b>all</b> non-official, historical names to the "Name" section. This is only because there are so many of them (that would fall into the categories mentioned in the guideline). <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 07:01, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If there are many to choose from, then choose the more significant one's, as in this case, The Turkish and Romanian variant. Many of the other variants are either archaic; of a people who were just a minority and never held the city; or of a people who held the city for a short period of time. The Ottomans and Moldavia—and later Romania, held the city for centuries; altough officially, in Medieval Moldavia, the city was named Belgrod, or something to that effect. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Thus Spake Anittas</a> 16:19, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Moldavia + Romania held the city for about 110 years, less than Russia + Soviet Union (about 150 years). But anyway, the wikipedia convention mentioned above clearly states that if we have a "name" section, we shouldn't put alternative names in the headline.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonimu_9d7a.html" title="User:Anonimu">Anonimu</a> 17:15, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And precisely where in the Moldavian Slavonic chronicles does Anittas see the words "Cetatea" and "Albă"? <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a>
<dl>
<dd>We also wrote in Romanian, pretty early. Stefan is also said to have written in Romanian; and even tho the official name in the Slavonic documents was Belgrod, as I have already mentioned, the name used by people was probably C. Alba. But even if it wasn't, it's still the Ro name and the Moldavian rule must be considered. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Thus Spake Anittas</a> 17:56, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't follow your logic. First of all, I do not know how you deduced what the name for the city was in unrecorded Romanian (it is more likely than not that it was <i>not</i> called "Cetatea Albă", but "Bolgrad", and that, like "Alba Iulia" for "Bălgrad", the name was coined by purists in more modern times). Secondly, aside from you toying with wiki conventions (I agree with Anonimu there), your "it's still the Ro name and the Moldavian rule must be considered" is a non sequitur. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 18:06, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, btw: the claim that Stephen wrote in Romanian is ridiculous. And just <i>who</i> says such absurdities? Who even begins to theorize that Stephen ever <i>wrote</i>, let alone that he wrote in a language that is known not to be used in writing by anybody who could write back then? Really, Anittas, come up with something tenable. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:27, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't buy that. Many such names were written in Cyrillic, including our own town names. Should we include the Cyrillic version of those names as well? How about the Turkish version, or the Greek version? We may even find an Arabic version for some of the cities. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Thus Spake Anittas</a> 21:35, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you can document them, the Cyrillic could be used in a separate section on names. I'm not sure that the other ones are relevant enough to be listed (the Ottoman Turkish forms tend to vary a lot for the same word, and are generally inaccurate; Greek versions may not be relevant for most cities, as, I'm guessing, they are generally modern transliterations from the Romanian, and not alternative place names). Outside "Ottoman Arabic writing", your reference to "Arabic version" is just a lame joke. <a href="../../../d/a/h/User%7EDahn_1772.html" title="User:Dahn">Dahn</a> 21:50, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Anittas: The Moldovan alphabet used Cyrillic <i>officially</i> from the 1930s to 1989, right? Since we have the Hungarian name, I figure it wouldn't hurt to use an alphabet that was official for such a long period of time. Even though Cyrillic for Romanian isn't used much today, there's nothing wrong with keeping it for historical interest. This is the same reason why we have the Ottoman Turkish names (in the Arabic script) at <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a>, <a href="../../../r/h/o/Rhodes.html" title="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samos_Island_ec34.html" title="Samos Island">Samos</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbos_Island_4797.html" title="Lesbos Island">Lesbos</a>, etc. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 22:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are wrong—it does hurt, but that's irrelevant. What is relevant is that it is now obsolete and should not be used because it serves no purpose. It serves no historical purpose, as you say and could lead to having all versions of several languages and alphabets included in similar articles, which can only contribute to an overdosed article. Also, why include the Moldovan Cyrillic version and not the Latin version? In fact, yes, I think we should have a Moldovan version: the version which is official and not obsolete. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Thus Spake Anittas</a> 22:27, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

Even though it's obsolete, the whole "Names" section is mostly historical names, not ones that are currently used today. How does it serve no purpose?

<dd>It has nothing to do with censorship. It's about irrelevancy. It's not about not adding the name, it's about the alphabet used, which in this case, is an obsolete alphabet; and no, it was not used for a long period of time.

<p>Guys, please calm down. First, no one is pushing the Cyrillic Moldovan name to the article's top. Since we have a names section, all names are there and it's fine. Listing it in the names section is <i>informative</i> on one hand, since the name was indeed used, and does not give the questionable to some Moldovan language an undue weight, since it is not at the article's top. If we just say that this is how the city name was written, this is useful and encyclopedic info which supports neither side in an unrelated debate about the RO and MO.

<dd>Thanks, Irpen, but I have to revert it back because the text is misleading. Some readers may think the Cyrillic alphabet is the official alphabet of Moldova--which it isn't. If you guys want to keep that obsolete version, then you should make it clear that it no longer is in use. I don't know what the purpose of that would be, but that's your choice. It would also be good to include the name written in the Latin alphabet. --<a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnittas_0872.html" title="User:Anittas">Thus Spake Anittas</a> 06:41, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
