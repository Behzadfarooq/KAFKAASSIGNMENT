</div>
</div>
<p>Returning to the United States in early <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>, Mitchell was appointed the deputy director of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_Air_Service_fc94.html" title="U.S. Army Air Service">Air Service</a>, retaining his one star rank. It had been widely expected throughout the Air Service that Mitchell would receive the post-war assignment of Director of Air Service, but the Army chose an <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantryman</a> and commander of the <a href="../../../4/2/n/42nd_Infantry_Division_%28United_States%29_89e9.html" title="42nd Infantry Division (United States)">Rainbow Division</a> in France, Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_T._Menoher_dc22.html" title="Charles T. Menoher">Charles T. Menoher</a>, to maintain operational control of aviation by the ground forces.</p>
<p>Mitchell did not share in the common belief that World War I would be the war to end all wars. "If a nation ambitious for universal conquest gets off to a flying start in a war of the future," he said, "it may be able to control the whole world more easily than a nation has controlled a continent in the past."</p>
<p>His relations with superiors continued to sour as he began to attack both the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_War_9516.html" title="United States Department of War">War</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navy_Department_ba88.html" title="Navy Department">Navy</a> Departments for being insufficiently farsighted regarding airpower. He advocated the development of bombsights, ski-equipped aircraft, engine <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercharger.html" title="Supercharger">superchargers</a> and aerial <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torpedo.html" title="Torpedo">torpedoes</a>. He ordered the use of aircraft in fighting <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_fires.html" title="Forest fires">forest fires</a> and border patrols and encouraged a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transcontinental.html" title="Transcontinental">transcontinental</a> <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_race.html" title="Air race">air race</a>, a flight around the perimeter of the United States, and encouraged Army pilots to challenge speed, endurance and altitude records—in short, anything it took to keep aviation in the news.</p>
<p>Mitchell infuriated the Navy by claiming he could sink ships "under war conditions," and boasted he could prove it if he were permitted to bomb captured German battleships. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, he successfully sank numerous ships, including the stationary German WW1 battleship, the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Ostfriesland_b26b.html" title="USS Ostfriesland"><i>Ostfriesland</i></a> and the U.S. <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pre-dreadnought.html" title="Pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought battleship</a> <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Alabama_%28BB-8%29_4613.html" title="USS Alabama (BB-8)"><i>Alabama</i></a>.</p>

Bombing tests which sank SMS Ostfriesland, September, 1921.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Although Mitchell had stressed "war-time conditions", the tests were under static conditions and the sinking of the <i>Ostfriesland</i> was accomplished by violating agreed-upon rules that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions; Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rule and quickly sank the ship in a coordinated attack. This proved—at least to Mitchell—that surface fleets were obsolete. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> he met the like-minded Italian air power theorist <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giulio_Douhet_7275.html" title="Giulio Douhet">Giulio Douhet</a> on a trip to Europe and soon after an excerpted translation of Douhet's <i>The Command of the Air</i> began to circulate in the Air Service.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, Mitchell's superiors sent him to <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, then <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, to get him off the front pages. Mitchell came back with a 324-page report that predicted future war with <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, including the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_c6a2.html" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. His report was mostly ignored.</p>
<p>He also experienced difficulties within the Army, notably with his superiors <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_T._Menoher_dc22.html" title="Charles T. Menoher">Charles T. Menoher</a> and later <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mason_Patrick_bd3b.html" title="Mason Patrick">Mason Patrick</a>, when he appeared before the Lampert Committee of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_of_Representatives_5a56.html" title="U.S. House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> and sharply castigated Army and Navy leadership. The War Department had endorsed a proposal to establish a "General Headquarters Air Force" as a vehicle for modernization and expansion of the Air Service, but then backed down before objections by the Navy, incensing Mitchell.</p>
<p>In March <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a> he reverted to his permanent rank of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> and was transferred to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio%2C_Texas_74ae.html" title="San Antonio, Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, as air officer to a ground forces <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corps.html" title="Corps">corps</a>. Although such demotions were not unusual at the time—Patrick himself had gone from <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_General_811b.html" title="Major General">Major General</a> to Colonel upon returning to the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army_Corps_of_Engineers_76f3.html" title="Army Corps of Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>—the move was nonetheless widely seen as punishment and exile, since Mitchell had petitioned to remain as Assistant Director of the Air Service when his term expired, and his transfer had been directed by Secretary of War <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Weeks_e196.html" title="John Weeks">John Weeks</a>.</p>

A scene taken from Gen. William "Billy" Mitchell's court-martial, 1925.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When the Navy dirigible <i><a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Shenandoah_%28ZR-1%29_a981.html" title="USS Shenandoah (ZR-1)">Shenandoah</a></i> crashed in a storm, killing 14 of the crew, Mitchell issued a statement accusing senior leaders in the Army and Navy of incompetence and "almost treasonable administration of the national defense." In 1925 he was <a href="../../../c/o/u/Court-martial.html" title="Court-martial">court-martialed</a> at the direct order of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">President</a> <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calvin_Coolidge_91e2.html" title="Calvin Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>, found guilty of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insubordination.html" title="Insubordination">insubordination</a>, and suspended from active duty for five years without pay. Mitchell resigned instead, as of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">February 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926.html" title="1926">1926</a>, and spent the next decade writing and preaching air power to all who would listen. However his departure from the service sharply reduced his ability to influence either policy or public opinion.</p>
<p>Mitchell viewed the election of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt_4d26.html" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, a Navy man, as advantageous for airpower. He believed the new president might even appoint him as assistant secretary of war for air or perhaps even secretary of defense in a new and unified military organization. Neither ever materialized. Mitchell died of a variety of ailments including a bad heart and influenza in a hospital in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">February 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> and was buried at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Home_Cemetery_a19a.html" title="Forest Home Cemetery">Forest Home Cemetery</a> in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee%2C_Wisconsin_a6b4.html" title="Milwaukee, Wisconsin">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>.</p>
