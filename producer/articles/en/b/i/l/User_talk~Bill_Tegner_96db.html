<p>By "extraneous rude quotation marks" you presumably mean inverted commas. I used them because I presumed that you were American who chose to use the title "Irish". But since that is clearly a sensitive matter, no problem. I will not use them again. Now could you please delete the word "fucking" from Iamlondon's riposte. That is a lot ruder than my use of inverted commas and would seem to bring Wikipedia into disrepute. Bill Tegner 09:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know if you are intentionally <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">trolling</a> or simply don't understand that Wikipedia needs to maintain a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, but your edits aren't very constructive. The vast majority of your edits are talk page edits, not adding to articles. You are using talk pages as a venue to push your own POV and you barely even discuss the actual article. Above I have already outlines some of your instances of altering other people's comments. Your article edits aren't much better.

<p>No, I'm not intentionally trolling. I do however realise that my comments (not only on Plastic Paddies) cause some contention. But someone's decided that Plastic Paddy can stay as a topic, even though people are uncomfortable about it, so surely I can comment? It is actually a very interesting topic. I mean why does Bill Clinton want to be Irish so much? And why was Ronald Reagan so disinterested in the ethnic origins of seven of his eight great grandparents? Incidentally, I did not specifically refer to you as a Plastic Paddy; all I said was that you are presumably not instantly recognisable as Irish. If that is the case, is that a problem for you? I can't see why it should be, though it does seem that being English born and educated happens to be a problem for Messrs MacGowan and O'Toole. I have, incidentally, already agreed with you that I won't alter people's comments, even if they are obscene and/or illiterate. Bill Tegner 09:26, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bill, can you please stop adding spam messeges to various talk pages including the talk page for the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plastic_Paddy_dc50.html" title="Plastic Paddy">Plastic Paddy‎</a> article. Much of your additions have nothing to do with the article and would be more suited to a chat room or discussion forum. I also note that out of the last 30 or so edits to the talk page 3/4 of these are yours however you have never made 1 edit to the article itself. Your contributions to this article and others relativing to Irish topics is starting to look like trolling, please modify your activity. regards--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 10:27, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK. I understand the point you're making and I'll desist. But as for "spam", I'm not sure that's quite fair. For example, although my piece about Anglo-Indians has been removed, surely it's a fair point? Why are people so keen to be Irish (but see caveat below) but less keen to have Indian blood in them? Why doesn't Hillary Clinton, who is predominantly English by ancestry, go on about being "English", though apparently she's very interested in her Welsh forebears&#160;? How can Bill Clinton be "Irish" when he can't prove Irish ancestry? On the other hand, it's also interesting that neither Tony Blair nor Jim Callaghan go/went on about being Irish, when both of them had an Irish parent (that made them four times as Irish as Reagan)? As for "IrishGuy", well, being Irish means a lot to him, but I've a sneaking suspicion that he's never heard of Steve Staunton, D4, or the M50. I was once asked what my greatest fault was, and I said, "cynicism". Sláinte. Bill Tegner 19:01, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Being Irish isnt just about being from Ireland, any scolar in Irish history could tell you that. As for your asertions about the Clintons, Callaghan and Blair - I dont know is the answer and unless there is an article or book from outside of wiki written about it then this is not the place to discuss it. May I suggest boards.ie - regards --<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 14:58, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is the only warning I will give you...stop making rude trolling remarks about me. You know nothing about me and I will not provide any personal information no matter how often you prod me to do so. As noted above, if you have nothing to add to actual articles, feel free to join a message board somewhere.
