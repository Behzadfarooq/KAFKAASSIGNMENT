<p><b>Civilian</b></p>
<p>National Advisory Committee For Aeronautics (NACA) <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_28.html" title="January 28">January 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> - <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_4.html" title="November 4">November 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>. Wynne began his employment at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (<a href="../../../n/a/c/NACA_11bb.html" title="NACA">NACA</a>, later <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> Glenn) Lewis Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory for seven years; hired for the Flight Icing Research Program. With teams of scientists, participated in flights under extremely hazardous conditions, often when all other aircraft were grounded to prove de-icing equipment developed by engineer Lewis Rodert. The <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> bombers, <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-24.html" title="B-24">B-24</a> and <a href="../../../b/-/2/B-25.html" title="B-25">B-25</a> were the most completely de-icible planes in the world. They were used in making continuous runs to accumulate as much ice as possible and then de-ice or try to get to the ground for photo records to match data taken on the flights. Many of the flights were extremely rough, making some crew members airsick. On several occasions, seven inches of ice were accumulated in 70 seconds, causing the planes a loss of air speed of 70 mph. The de-icing and anti-icing equipment tested during this program was designated by the Federal Aviation Authority <a href="../../../f/a/a/FAA_42fa.html" title="FAA">FAA</a> for use in all commercial and military aircraft and are still in use over 58 years later. It is said that no planes were ever lost due to icing conditions if the equipment was turned on. (Source: "Engines and Innovation: Lewis Laboratory and American Propulsion Technology." Virginia P. Dawson, The NASA History Series, SP4306. Published by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 1991)</p>
<p>Wynne also participated in the Full Scale Aircraft Crash Fire Program for betterment of Air Safety January <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> - November <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>. His most valuable contribution was the development of a camera timer to mark each frame of seven high-speed movie cameras spread over quarter mile distances from north to south, and east to west directions covering the crash apron. The impact of the planes running at takeoff speed on a guided rail then striking a barrier which wiped out landing gear, simulated striking trees and fence posts while slanted phone poles with six inch long, one inch in diameter spikes ripped open the fuel tanks, setting up mechanisms of crash fires. The cameras and timer recorded the crashes with accurate readouts related to time of the planes crashing in sequences, allowing engineers to make accurate analysis even though each camera was running at different speeds. The accuracy was within 1/10,000 of a second, cameras recorded the varied mechanisms of flame starts and progression. In some instances, whole planes were consumed. Some fires started with previously unknown sources. Recommendations to the aircraft industry offered possible solutions and preventions as air safety measures. (IBID)</p>
<p>Wynne's timer devices were used by Lewis researchers for 24 years until new liquid crystal digital timers came into use. Except for highspeed cameras with timing lights (running up to 4000 frames a second) these had a very limited running time, at top speed of one and half seconds). The three main cameras used were ultra sharp with 1200 feet film loads, giving over an hour of continuous running time. Prior to the timer it was impossible to establish sequences because of the variable speeds in the cameras. Factory rated at 128 frames a second, the camera timer proved each camera never reached that speed and varied in speed, each fluctuating between 105- to 120 frames per second. There were drops as much as 15 fps, in one tenth of a second caused by the heavy runaway 1200' film spools that slowed down, jarring the precision-built Mitchell cameras. (IBID)</p>
<p>In another situation, Wynne used the timer to prove a new $6 million jet engine test lab had the potential of a detonation, as proved in a model experiment under a given possible event. Detonations exceed the speed of sound and are non duplicatable. With explosions (below the speed of sound) data is repeatable, and therefore safeguards can be built in. The detonation discovery proved to be too costly to build in safe guards and the Jet Propulsion Lab still in use was reconfigured to exhaust, rather than recirculate air in a tunnel. Wynne was involved with doing full-time photographic research to meet the needs of aeronautical research as commercial cameras, and other equipment were inadequate and modifications or new equipment had to be designed. Even films were pushed beyond the limits of manufactures specifications. Just before leaving, NACA Wynne was working on a Araindrop camera@ that successfully photographed rain drops in free flight in a ground outdoor lab he built on the NACA hangar apron. It was further developed to place in aircraft to measure drop sizes in given storms for coordination with radar forecasting. With some of Lewis NACA/NASA most outstanding engineers, Wynne is one of only two technicians mentioned in the NACA/NASA Lewis Lab 50 Year History (1990); a copy of which is in NASA LEWIS' 100-year Time Capsule. (IBID)</p>
<p>Cleveland PLAIN DEALER November <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a> - September <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>. In 1953, Ted Vorpe, Editor of the Sunday Magazine and head of all photographic departments of the Cleveland PLAIN DEALER, had previously published some of Wynne's freelance photo essays offered Wynne a position at the Plain Dealer. Wynne began work as a color photographer for the Sunday Magazine and to do some commercial photography as well as doing work with the Sunday Features department doing assignments such as society events, fashions, foods, art, gardens, school activities and other features along with a spattering of news. The <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Shepherd_2366.html" title="Sam Shepherd">Sam Shepherd</a> case began <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">July 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>. As he was the first man to arrive at the Plain Dealer day shift which was customary in the Sunday department, and since the daily morning newspaper newsmen started work later for publishing at night, Wynne was called on five occasions to cover news assignments involving the Shepherd case, all of which were important spot news-events. After 11 years, Wynne asked to be assigned to the news department, although he continued to cover most of the Sunday department assignments. (Cleveland Plain Dealer, July 5, 1954)</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, Editor Wilson Hirschfeld requested Wynne be placed in his department on the important State Desk for Ohio's largest newspaper. From <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> through <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, Wynne worked as state roaming writer/photographer covering major news stories and creating 500 full page photo essays. Many of these were seen only in the Bulldog/first edition (circulation 85,000) delivered mostly around the state. Many pages carried over in city editions. Among major State News stories were elections, of the Governor, and other Columbus representatives and polling for forecasting election predictions. Covered also were flooding and erosion of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Erie_5da4.html" title="Lake Erie">Lake Erie</a> shores, architecture, <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenia.html" title="Xenia">Xenia</a>, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> tornado damage (37 killed), Willard Ohio tornado, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_State_University_2761.html" title="Ohio State University">Ohio State University</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kent_State_University_5644.html" title="Kent State University">Kent State University</a> student riots and the Ohio Penitentiary.</p>
<p>The biggest assignment was as part of the three man investigation of Lima State Hospital for Criminally Insane - an exposé of gross mistreatment of inmates by prison guards in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>. Reporters Richard Widman, Theodore Whelan and photographer William A. Wynne interviewed many and recorded evidence that flashed over a month of daily Page One running news stories and sidebars. The Governor assigned a special lawyer investigation. This resulted in the conviction of 28 employees and 3 former employees on felony charges - the largest group of government felony convictions in Ohio history. The three newsmen were finalists for a <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>. .</p>
<p>The Associated Press of Ohio presented five awards to the three, recommending a special AWARD by giving a "Sweepstakes Prize" for, by far, the best entry, "The Exposé of Inhumane Treatment of Inmates By Employees at Lima State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.”</p>
<p>In 1974 Wynne returned to the News Photo Department, retiring in 1984.</p>
<p>At NASA's request, Wynne returned to NASA Lewis Flight Propulsion Lewis Laboratory photo department, serving when he retired again to work on his book, AYorkie Doodle Dandy.@</p>
