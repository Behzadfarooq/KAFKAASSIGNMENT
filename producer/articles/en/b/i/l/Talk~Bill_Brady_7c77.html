<p>This article seems trumped up. For instance what did Brady do that demonstrated leadership? It seems he held positions but says nothing of what he actual did while he was involved.</p>
<p>I can't find any support for Transplant International existing. Is this defunct? If so what significance did it ever have?</p>
<dl>
<dd>{{<a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">sofixit</a>}}. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 23:52, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The only Transplant International found on the internet is a journal about transplants not an organization dedicated to securing them for people as the entry asserts. I conclude that the entry is mistaken in its characterization of Transplant International and Brady's relationship to it. Unless it was different 30 years ago and is now dead.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I Googled "Transplant International Bill Brady" and came up with (among lots and lots of other things) a quote form the estemable and noble Mr. Bill Brady,</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"In the mid â€˜80s, Dr. Cal Stiller, who was chief of the Transplant Unit of University Hospital, invited me to be part of a new initiative, Transplant International, and for years our group worked in all parts of Canada to raise public awareness of the urgent and growing need for organ donors as hundreds of Canadians waited for life-saving transplants.</p>
<p>The letter I have quoted came to us at the very time we were attempting to get a vital message to hospitals and the professionals who live with the reality of death almost daily in emergency rooms and intensive care units. We felt families facing the imminent loss of a loved one needed to be given the opportunity to rescue something positive from their loss. We urged nurses in the critical care areas, the doctors and chaplains to discuss organ donation with the family even as they worked their way through their shock and grief."</p>
<p>Hes almost a saint, wouldn't you agree?. I prostrate myself at his very feet. This winter I'm going to go shovel his driveway. For free. I may name my first born child Bill now. I urge you to do the same. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 00:21, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I agree that his intentions are noble, but I disagree that they are notable. <i>He</i> wrote one column that you cite from, which says he got involved with a group in the 80's. It appears that group is now defunct, what is not clear is what that group accomplished, it is one thing to try and do something and quite another to actually get results, and it is not clear what Bill s involvement in it was. I think it very likely that he was only able to offer his name in support. If he was responsible for logistics I want to know what they were and what they accomplished before I ascribe significance and merit to an activity he was involved with.</p>
<p>Respectfully I think you are conflating him being a good person (which he probably is) with a notable person. His work at CFLP may have had an effect on you, but it didn't on me (I was just not influenced by it one way or the other) and irrespective I don't think it had any impact of significance boardly on the community, especially not anything that warrants being called notable. That's the hard truth. That's why he shouldn't be listed.</p>
<p>By all means work on his driveway, but please consider seperating how you feel personally about him from whether he warrants a listing as notable on wikipedia. It is a grave mistake to think that someone should be included just because they can be. His inclusion brings down the quality of notables listed.</p>
<p>Update: I did a search and found no record of "Transplant International" or "Transplant International Canada" ever being incorporated in Ontario, as a charity or a non-profit. There may have been a group but it wasn't necessarily any more official than you and me starting an organization called "Organization X" it never had legal standing, which does call into question the significance of that group.</p>
<p>Solution: here is one possible solution, now that Brady has his own page, which I will permit you to fill with whatever hyperbole you want, he gets taken off the notable list in the london page. Brady gets his own entry free from interference, being as much of a testament to him as you'd like, and in exchange he gets kept off the list of notable londoners? In terms of compromise, and being constructive this is what I can come up with that is fair.</p>
<p>Or in the alternative the warning box with the controversy label should accompany his listing on the london page saying: "his inclusion in this list is controversial as some argue he does not warrant a place on this list, see discussion"</p>
<p>If these are not acceptable provide alternatives.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's not a compromise at all; writing an article for him was the justification to keep him on the list. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 03:48, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well until someone proposes an acceptable solution it will just stay protected, no featured article status because of Bill Brady. I can live with that, but would rather have it not protected and capable of being a featured article, but not at the expense of including Brady.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Brady_7c77.html" title="Edit section: Brady as executive">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Brady as executive</span></h2>
<p>If you look at the Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_officer.html" title="Corporate officer">Executive</a>, you will find that the vice-presidency of a company qualifies him as such. I will add executive to the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manager.html" title="Manager">Manager</a> blue link that was substituted thus giving the reader more information, and making his article more complete. Thanks for the addition of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manager.html" title="Manager">Manager</a>! <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 03:44, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Although prima facie he may have been involved as what technically qualifies as an executive, I think a more accurate characterization of him is a radio station manager. Do you have any concept of the scope and importance of CFPL, the local London station? It simply does not rate in any kind of broad and balanced assesment. Brady represents the sheer medicority of London, and the fact that you hold him out, beyond all reasonableness to be notable, is a reflection of a myopic London world view.</p>
<p>Now more broadly within what is less than 5 people, only 2-3 of which are from London, have moderately supported Brady's inclusion. However this is number of people is not representative of Londoners generally or objectively. If this was to be decided in court, but an objective judge, I would win hands down. You have not been able to marshal significant evidence to support your point. Why not the editor of the free press, why not include him, he outranks Brady in terms of training, accomplishment, and likely community involvement? It would make no sense to me to include this guy, but if we are fair by Brady standards he would get in.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a lesson for me that Wikipedia while a wonderful public resource generally can be subverted by a herd mentality which can decidely slant the truth. I will not be complicit in this outrage!</p>
<ul>
<li>As I pointed out above, the fact that Brady acted as a vice president of a significant and notable media corporation, he qualifies as an executive, according to the strictest sense of the term. I am not being liberal with the term, nor is it hyperbole. Be as outraged as you want. Its your right, you don't need <a href="../../../p/e/r/Permit.html" title="Permit">permit</a> from anyone. But to address your points,show me another <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalist</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manager.html" title="Manager">manager</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive.html" title="Executive">executive</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_personality.html" title="Television personality">television personality</a> that has won an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Canada_843d.html" title="Order of Canada">Order of Canada</a>, and who has dedicated considerable time, energy and expertise to <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_service.html" title="Public service">public service</a> and the betterment of his community (and by extension his nation, as per his award), and I will write another article! I promise! I will! I will ask you to sign your future posts with four tildes (~). Or three tildes ~ is sufficient, I don't need to now the time of your posts, the pages history keeps track of that. And I will ask that you contain the discussion you engage in on this articles talk page to the pertinent discusion. For the sake of clarity and the benifit of other people who might visit this page, who may not understand the problems that have been created with your anti-Brady bias elsewhere. You see there is no real point of reference for such users when you discuss 5 people, or 2 or 3 users, as you have above. Nor do I feel there should be. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 05:07, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Bill Brady is Zorra Township's Senior of the Year! If this doesn't make him notable, I don't know what does!

<p>What is the Zorra Township's Senior award? How does that make someone notable? That seems like a silly thing to say. It assumes that everyone has heard of this award and comes from someone whose mentality is that the small Ontario town where he is from is the center of the universe.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was a joke.
