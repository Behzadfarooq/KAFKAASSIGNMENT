<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Rogell_332a.html" title="Edit section: The Early Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Early Years</span></h3>
<p>Rogell was originally signed by the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> prior to the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925_in_baseball.html" title="1925 in baseball">1925</a> campaign after two seasons in the Southwestern League. The Red Sox quickly tried to covert the <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switch_hitter.html" title="Switch hitter">switch-hitting</a> Rogell into solely a right handed batter thinking that he would benefit from more appearances from the right side, hence more chances to drive balls off the famed <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Monster_6b23.html" title="Green Monster">Green Monster</a>. “They just screwed me up for a couple years,” Rogell would say later.</p>
<p>He appeared in 58 games for last place Red Sox--49 at second base--while hitting .195 in 169 at-bats. He was sent back to the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_league.html" title="Minor league">minors</a> for more grooming during the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1926_in_baseball.html" title="1926 in baseball">1926 season</a> before being called back to the big league club for <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927_in_baseball.html" title="1927 in baseball">1927</a>.</p>
<p>Rogell battled his way through another rough year. Playing in 82 games he hit .266 while splitting time between third and second. The Red Sox again finished in the cellar, losing 100 games for the third year in a row.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928_in_baseball.html" title="1928 in baseball">1928 season</a> he appeared in games at short, third, second, as well as all three outfield positions. But after another dismal campaign for both him and the Red Sox the club released him at the conclusion of the season.</p>
<p>Rogell spent a year away from the majors. Playing <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929_in_baseball.html" title="1929 in baseball">1929</a> for the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Paul_Saints_95fd.html" title="St. Paul Saints">St. Paul Saints</a> of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_%2820th_century%29_5fdf.html" title="American Association (20th century)">American Association</a>, he batted .336 and drove in 90 runs. Following the season, amid offers from a handful of teams, Rogell signed with the Detroit Tigers where he would spend the next ten seasons.</p>

<p>At first his time in Detroit was more of the same. Rogell struggled out of the gate and the club, disappointed with his showing, acquired shortstop Mark Koenig from the Yankees <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930_in_baseball.html" title="1930 in baseball">mid-season</a> and plugged him into the lineup. Koenig, the same age as Rogell but already a household name, had been an integral part of the Yankees’ famed <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murderers%27_Row_149a.html" title="Murderers' Row">Murderers' Row</a> lineup in 1927 and was still considered by many as one of the premier shortstops in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a>. Rogell finished the year with a .167 average in 54 games, splitting his time between short and third.</p>
<p>Though his start in Detroit was unimpressive, by the time the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931_in_baseball.html" title="1931 in baseball">1931 season</a> had ended it was clear to the Tigers that they had found their shortstop of the future. Rogell unseeded Koenig late in the year and finished the year hitting .303 in 48 games, every one of them at shortstop. Koenig was released after the season ended.</p>
<p>Rogell was the Tigers’ <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opening_Day_d752.html" title="Opening Day">Opening Day</a> shortstop for the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932_in_baseball.html" title="1932 in baseball">1932 season</a>, a position he would hold for the next eight years. A sure-handed fielder, he and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum_b09c.html" title="National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum">Hall of Fame</a> double-play partner <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Gehringer_8d40.html" title="Charlie Gehringer">Charlie Gehringer</a> would give the Tigers one of the best keystone-combinations in baseball history. Marv Owen, who would man the left side of the Detroit infield with Rogell for five years, said of Rogell’s fielding prowess, “He’s the only player I ever knew who could catch a bad hop… I don’t know how he did it.”</p>
<p>Rogell’s offense continued to show the promise it had with the St. Paul club. He hit .271 with 29 doubles and 88 runs scored during the ’32 campaign, and improved the following year to .295, 44 doubles, 11 triples, and drew 79 walks to post a .381 on-base percentage while playing in every game. The <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933_in_baseball.html" title="1933 in baseball">1933 season</a> also marked the first time Rogell, Gehringer, Owen, and first baseman <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Greenberg_79fd.html" title="Hank Greenberg">Hank Greenberg</a> appeared in the same lineup.</p>

<p>The Tigers, perennial <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_division.html" title="Second division">second division</a> finishers, acquired catcher/manager <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Cochrane_04f8.html" title="Mickey Cochrane">Mickey Cochrane</a> from the Philadelphia A’s during the winter.

<p>Rogell, leading off in front of four future Hall of Famers (Cochrane, Gehringer, Greenberg, as well as <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goose_Goslin_92c7.html" title="Goose Goslin">Goose Goslin</a>), had the best season of his career, hitting .296, driving in 100 runs and scoring 114. The infield combined for a major league record 462 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runs_batted_in.html" title="Runs batted in">runs batted in</a>. The Tigers won the league by seven games and were set to square off against the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a>.</p>
<p>Rogell, unbeknownst to the Cardinals or the media, played the series on a broken ankle. Despite the injury he was able to collect eight hits and drive in four runs over the seven game series. He also found his way into one of the most popular plays in World Series history.</p>

<p>After driving in a run with a single to right in the fourth inning of game four, <a href="../../../s/p/u/Spud_Davis_dd54.html" title="Spud Davis">Spud Davis</a> was replaced by Hall of Famer <a href="../../../d/i/z/Dizzy_Dean_d3cf.html" title="Dizzy Dean">Dizzy Dean</a> as a pinch runner at first base. <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepper_Martin_12c4.html" title="Pepper Martin">Pepper Martin</a> then stepped in and hit a ground ball to Gehringer at second. Gehringer turned and threw to Rogell who forced out Dean at second, and then fired the ball squarely into Dean’s forehead on the relay throw to first. The ball ricocheted off Dean’s head and landed over a hundred feet away in the outfield. Dean, always known for his quick wit and humorous nature, remarked after a visit to the hospital, “The doctors X-rayed my head and found nothing.” Rogell would say of the play later, “If I’d have known his head was there, I would have thrown the ball harder.”</p>

<p>After losing in seven games to the Cardinals, the Tigers returned to the series the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935_in_baseball.html" title="1935 in baseball">following season</a>. Again led by their stellar infield, the Tigers won the pennant by three games over the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">Yankees</a> and earned a trip to face the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> for the world championship. Rogell finished with another solid year at the bat, hitting .275 with 88 runs scored while drawing 80 walks. Although he had shown speed in the minors, Rogell rarely had a chance to move on the bases with Detroit. “They didn’t want me to steal,” he would say after retiring. “I had Gehringer and Cochrane and Greenberg hitting behind me.”</p>
<p>Even with <a href="../../../m/l/b/MLB_Most_Valuable_Player_Award_8b7f.html" title="MLB Most Valuable Player Award">American League MVP</a> Greenberg out for much of the series, the Tigers finished off the Cubs in six games. Rogell had another good showing in the fall classic hitting .292 during the series.</p>

<p>Although continuing to post winning records through the rest of the decade, the Tigers could not bring home another pennant. Rogell, after two more solid seasons at the bat, began to slip during the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938_in_baseball.html" title="1938 in baseball">1938 campaign</a>. He did, however, set a Major League record on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_19.html" title="August 19">August 19</a> of that year when we was walked in 7 consecutive plate appearances (a record tied by three other players since, but never eclipsed). He accomplished the feat over a three-game span. He injured his arm after the season playing handball, and by the close of the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939_in_baseball.html" title="1939 in baseball">1939 season</a> he had been replaced by 24-year old Frank Croucher at short. He was traded to the Cubs during the winter for shortstop <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Bartell_543e.html" title="Dick Bartell">Dick Bartell</a>. The deal was described in the papers as being a trade of “one worn-out shortstop for another.”</p>
<p>While Bartell would be a key part of the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940_in_baseball.html" title="1940 in baseball">1940</a> pennant winning Tiger club, Rogell entered a hornets nest the moment he stepped foot into the Cubs’ spring training camp. Holdovers from the 1935 team still held resentment toward Rogell and his Tiger teammates. Rogell, defending his former mates, got into a posturing match with manager/catcher <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabby_Hartnett_dc3f.html" title="Gabby Hartnett">Gabby Hartnett</a>, who finally shouted, “You don’t belong here!” Rogell immediately asked for his release which the Cubs refused. He spent the year riding the bench, as the Cubs rode their way into the second division of the National League, and retired at the conclusion of the season. He appeared in only 33 games, collecting just eight hits.</p>

<p>Rogell led American League shortstops in <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fielding_percentage.html" title="Fielding percentage">fielding percentage</a> in 1935, ’36, and ’37. He also led the league once in both <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putouts.html" title="Putouts">putouts</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assist_%28baseball%29.html" title="Assist (baseball)">assists</a>, and twice paired with Gehringer to lead the league in <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_plays.html" title="Double plays">double plays</a>. The two played over 1000 games together, making them one of the longest tenured double-play combinations in the history of the game.</p>
<p>A fiery competitor, Rogell provided an intriguing foil to “The Mechanical Man” throughout their careers. Gehringer recalled in his Hall of Fame induction speech, "I wasn't a rabble rouser. I wasn't a big noisemaker in the infield, which a lot of managers think you've got to be or you're not showing. But I don't think it contributes much."</p>
<p>Rogell, however, did not employ Gehringer's ideals when it came to on-field dialogue. On one occasion, after both failing to cover second on a steal attempt, Cochrane charged out from behind the plate shouting at Rogell and Gehringer. From <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Bill James"><b>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract</b></a>:</p>
<p><tt>Rogell, astonished, looked at Gehringer to see if he was going to say anything. Gehringer, of course, had nothing to say.<br />
<br />
"Goddamn you," yelled Rogell. "Don’t you come charging out here telling me how to play shortstop. You go back there and do the catching, and I’ll play shortstop. If I’m not good enough, you can find someone else." Cochrane went back to his own position.</tt></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Rogell_332a.html" title="Edit section: Retirement from Baseball">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement from Baseball</span></h2>
<p>Rogell spent the bulk of his “retirement” as a member of the Detroit City Council. After a brief stint in the minors as a player and coach, he returned to Detroit and began his civil service career in 1942. He would serve on the council, with a two-year break in the late forties, until 1980, playing a key role on the city’s planning commissions. “I think I did a lot for that city,” he would say after leaving his post. “I was chairman of the committee that built the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Metropolitan_Wayne_County_Airport_676e.html" title="Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport">big airport</a> there. Also the roads and bridges committee.” The road entering Detroit's Metropolitan Airport from the north, Merriman Road, changes its name to William G. Rogell Drive as it enters the airport.</p>
<p>Rogell also used his position to help old ballplayers in the Detroit area. Former Tiger teammate <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Bridges_dd1e.html" title="Tommy Bridges">Tommy Bridges</a> (who came to the Tigers the same year as Rogell), a sober man throughout his career, started to drink while serving in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. After trying to restart his career with Tigers following the war Bridges moved on to the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Coast_League_795c.html" title="Pacific Coast League">Pacific Coast League</a>. His drinking became more and more prevalent until he finally collapsed drunk on the mound during a game. He divorced his wife, married a waitress from a bar he often visited, moved back to Detroit, and caught up with some of his old teammates.</p>
<p>Rogell, upset with the condition his former mate was in, lined up for Bridges a sales job in Detroit. Bridges never came to work, but Rogell did not hold any kind of resentment toward Bridges. “It was terrible to see that,” he said. “But nice guys go, too, you know.”</p>
<p>Numerous other former players also turned to Rogell when they had run out of options, and he always worked hard to try to provide them with whatever assistance he could.</p>
<p>Rogell, after leaving the council, spent the rest of his retirement in Detroit. At age 94 he threw out the first pitch at the final game at <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Stadium_%28Detroit%29_4914.html" title="Tiger Stadium (Detroit)">Tiger Stadium</a> on September 27, 1999, nearly 70 years after he had debuted for the Tigers in the same park.</p>
<p>Billy Rogell died of pneumonia at the age of 98 in the Detroit suburb of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Sterling_Heights%2C_Michigan_1ed0.html" title="Sterling Heights, Michigan">Sterling Heights</a>.</p>
