<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Shankly_7131.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>Shankly was born in the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Ayrshire_fb5a.html" title="East Ayrshire">East Ayrshire</a> mining village of <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenbuck.html" title="Glenbuck">Glenbuck</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, into a family of ten children. He was one of five brothers who went on to play professional football. His brother <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Shankly_8d9c.html" title="Bob Shankly">Bob</a> was also a successful manager, guiding <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dundee_F.C._8666.html" title="Dundee F.C.">Dundee</a> to victory in the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Football_League_3007.html" title="Scottish Football League">Scottish championship</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>. His tough upbringing was the basis for his own brand of humanitarian based socialism, and he would joke in later life that he never had a bath until aged 15, and that the poverty brought about a good sense of humour.</p>
<p>Football was a way of getting away from the mine shafts - either on a Saturday afternoon and during weekly training, or as a professional option. All five Shankly brothers were members of the <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenbuck_Cherrypickers_2fdb.html" title="Glenbuck Cherrypickers">Glenbuck Cherrypickers</a> - a team famous at the time for producing 49 footballers from the village, straddling the latter part of the 19th and the early years of the 20th century - although Bill, the youngest brother, never played for their first eleven.</p>

<p>Bill Shankly's playing career began in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Junior_League_b252.html" title="Scottish Junior League">Scottish Junior Football</a>, where he played for the now defunct Cronberry Eglinton and Glenbuck Cherrypickers. In July <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> he caught the eye of scouts and was signed to play for <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlisle_United_F.C._c75f.html" title="Carlisle United F.C.">Carlisle United</a> making his debut on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a> against <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochdale_A.F.C_1854.html" title="Rochdale A.F.C">Rochdale</a>. In July 1933, after only 16 appearances for Carlisle, he signed for <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preston_North_End_F.C._4a42.html" title="Preston North End F.C.">Preston North End</a> for a fee of £500.00</p>
<p>He was a key member of the Preston side promoted to the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_Division_One_835a.html" title="Football League Division One">First Division</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> and played in two <a href="../../../f/a/_/FA_Cup_f364.html" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> finals, Preston losing to <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunderland_A.F.C._5fa7.html" title="Sunderland A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, but beating <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield_Town_A.F.C._d084.html" title="Huddersfield Town A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> in 1938.</p>
<p>Shankly made his debut for <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland_national_football_team.html" title="Scotland national football team">Scotland</a> in a 1-0 win against <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_football_team.html" title="England national football team">England</a> in April <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>. He made four further appearances for his country, plus another seven in wartime internationals, but his distinguished playing career was cruelly interrupted by <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">war</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>.</p>

<p>He retired from playing in March <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> and the same month was appointed the manager of Carlisle United, starting his managerial career where his professional playing career had also started. He was undistinguished at Carlisle, and walked out citing a lack of financial commitment on the part of the directors - a pattern which would repeat itself for the next ten years across a succession of northern English football clubs.</p>
<p>After a failed interview at Liverpool, Shankly moved to manage <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grimsby_Town_F.C._16d1.html" title="Grimsby Town F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>, then <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workington_A.F.C._cf7d.html" title="Workington A.F.C.">Workington</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>, and finally <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield_Town_A.F.C._d084.html" title="Huddersfield Town A.F.C.">Huddersfield</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> - where he signed a talented 15 year-old called <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Law_eddd.html" title="Denis Law">Denis Law</a>. After Law broke into the first team at 16, Shankly recommended on business grounds improving Law’s terms and tenure, but the board saw no reason to increase the wages of a player they already had under contract. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a>, the board wanted to accept an offer of £45,000 for Law, from <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everton_F.C._db0c.html" title="Everton F.C.">Everton</a>. Shankly went ballistic: <i>“Get out your diary and write this down. One day, Dennis Law will be transferred for £100,000.”</i> After four years at Huddersfield, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_City_F.C._90bc.html" title="Manchester City F.C.">Manchester City</a> signed Law for a transfer fee of £55,000, setting a new British record.</p>
<p>Shankly appeared prone to falling foul of the boardroom at each club, as he never felt they gave the same commitment to team affairs as he did. It was Shankly's own commitment and enthusiasm that had initially intrigued Liverpool chairman T.V. Williams when Shankly had been interviewed for the vacant Liverpool job in 1951. It was felt at the time that he was both lacking experience and wasn't a big enough name for the club,<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> but this time Williams knew instinctively that Shankly and Liverpool were right for each other.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Shankly_7131.html" title="Edit section: Liverpool">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Liverpool</span></h3>
<p>Shankly became the manager of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_F.C._2b1a.html" title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool</a> in December <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>. Shankly is remembered by many Liverpool fans as their greatest ever manager. His record of honours (in itself notable) pales compared to some of his successors (including the man that immediately followed, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Paisley_c614.html" title="Bob Paisley">Bob Paisley</a>) but he is credited with establishing the club's reputation and setting the scene for subsequent successes.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>, Liverpool was a club in the bottom of the old Second Division, with a crumbling stadium, poor training facilities and a large and poor quality playing staff. The only quality was in the backroom staff, with <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Fagan_1e42.html" title="Joe Fagan">Joe Fagan</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuben_Bennett_b37d.html" title="Reuben Bennett">Reuben Bennett</a>, added to by the recently retired and Shankly admired <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Paisley_c614.html" title="Bob Paisley">Bob Paisley</a>. Shankly firstly told the three of them that they all had jobs while he was there, recognising that the team around was a key to success - and that was probably the start of the now infamous Bootroom.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The training ground at <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melwood.html" title="Melwood">Melwood</a> was in a terrible state, overgrown and with only one mains tap. But Shankly turned this into a strength, by getting the players to arrive instead at Anfield, and then bus them over to Melwood - this created team camaraderie. At Melwood Shankly introduced fitness training including diet assessment, and skills training including using an artificial goal painted on a convenient wall, split into eight sections which he would demand the players hit each time. For playing practice, Shankly introduced five-a-side games that so defined his football thinking - pass and move, keep it simple, a creed taken from the daily matches played by the miners of Glenbuck. After training, the team would all bus back to Anfield together to shower, change and get a communal meal. This way Shankly ensured all his players had warmed down correctly and he would keep his players free from injury. As a result, in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> season Liverpool finished as champions using just 14 players and two of those only played a handful of games.</p>

<p>Slowly at first, and then with a gathering pace, Shankly and his backroom team turned Liverpool around. The Anfield crowd sensed change, with gates regularly topping 40,000<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> and with new signings <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Yeats_156f.html" title="Ron Yeats">Ron Yeats</a>, <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_St._John_5d17.html" title="Ian St. John">Ian St. John</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Milne_5c09.html" title="Gordon Milne">Gordon Milne</a>, promotion was gained back to the first division in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>.

The supremacy of Everton in the city of Liverpool was the first target for Shankly now that he had got the club back into the top flight, and in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, Liverpool clinched their 6th title, from former champions Everton.</p>
<p>The first F.A. Cup win in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> was followed by Europe where Liverpool were stopped by <a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajax_Amsterdam_0e8e.html" title="Ajax Amsterdam">Ajax Amsterdam</a>, led by then 19-year old Johan Cruijjf (7-3 on aggregate; including a 5-1 hammering in Amsterdam). Whilst Shankly, orchestrating events at Anfield was at one with the fans, perfectly in tune with the Kopites, knowing and understanding how they felt about football and the pride a successful team gave them - remaining in touch with his working class roots. His would tell anyone who cared to listen that his lads played to a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a> ethic. If a player was having a poor game Shankly would expect a team mate to cover for him and bail him out like you would do for a neighbour or a colleague down the mine.</p>

<p>The decline of the 1960s team saw the birth of Shankly's second great Liverpool side.

Bill Shankly during a lap of honour of <a href="../../../a/n/f/Anfield.html" title="Anfield">Anfield</a>, during the infamous scarf incident</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Due to his <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working_class.html" title="Working class">working class</a> background, Shankly had a strong feeling for how the fans followed the team and wanted them to perform. He felt he was letting the fans down when the team didn't do well.</p>
<p>When he wasn't managing a football club, Shankly was usually at his typewriter, personally replying to the letters which arrived at Melwood. Shankly even called some supporters at home to discuss the previous day's game, while the accounts of him providing tickets for fans are endless.<sup id="_ref-icliverpool_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-icliverpool" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the most iconic images of all was caught on television, when a Liverpool scarf which had been thrown at Shankly during a lap of honour was flung to one side by a policeman. Shankly pounced on the scarf and reprimanded the copper, uttering the immortal words <i>"Don't do that. This might be someone's life"</i>. In a tour of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> Shankly couldn't believe American people had never heard of <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Finney_854e.html" title="Tom Finney">Tom Finney</a>. Shankly was a huge fan of Finney's as a footballer, and was also a close friend of his.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After his retirement he said: <i>"I was only in the game for the love of football - and I wanted to bring back happiness to the people of Liverpool."</i></p>
<p>The journalist John Keith, who wrote the play <i>"The Bill Shankly Tribute Story"</i>, commented that Shankly knew how important the fans were to a successful team, and that even after his retirement, at the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> second leg of the Uefa Cup final in Brugge: <i>"A fan came over and said he didn't have a ticket - so Shanks went and bought him one." <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup></i></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Shankly_7131.html" title="Edit section: Retirement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h2>
<p>Shankly was by now 60 years old, and in July <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> decided to retire - he said that going to tell the chairman of his decision was like facing the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_chair.html" title="Electric chair">electric chair</a>. He wanted to spend time with his wife Ness and their family. When news of Shankly's resignation first emerged, distraught fans jammed the club's switchboard and local factory workers threatened to go on strike unless their hero returned <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The club was left in capable hands, with the bootroom staff supplemented by ex-players <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronnie_Moran_88c3.html" title="Ronnie Moran">Ronnie Moran</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Evans_d5dd.html" title="Roy Evans">Roy Evans</a> and they got behind new manager Bob Paisley. Later it was revealed that Shankly wanted <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Charlton_0336.html" title="Jack Charlton">Jack Charlton</a> to succeed him at Liverpool, and not Bob Paisley. This was the start of a deteriorating relationship between Shankly and the club, which only got worse during his retirement. Indeed, Shankly would often frequent the training headquarters and ground on match days of City rivals Everton, often saying that he 'feels more welcome here'.</p>
<p>Shankly was awarded the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_honours_system.html" title="British honours system">OBE</a> in November <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. He even went regularly to <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melwood.html" title="Melwood">Melwood</a>, to watch the team train. He continued to live in the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terraced_house.html" title="Terraced house">terraced house</a> that he and his wife had bought when they moved to Liverpool, and he was a regular sight around the city, happy and willing to talk to anyone about football. In the end his wife had to take him shopping to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> instead.</p>
<p>On the morning of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_26.html" title="September 26">26 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> Bill Shankly was admitted to <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadgreen_Hospital_3d3e.html" title="Broadgreen Hospital">Broadgreen Hospital</a> following a <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>. Whilst in Hospital he insisted on being nursed in an ordinary ward not a private one. <i>"That is where he wanted to be,"</i> a hospital spokesman told the <i><a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool_Echo_8988.html" title="Liverpool Echo">Liverpool Echo</a></i> newspaper.<sup id="_ref-icliverpool_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-icliverpool" title="">[1]</a></sup>. His condition was stable and it appeared that he was going to make a full recovery. There was no suggestion that his life was in danger. The switchboard was jammed with concerned fans and prayers were said for him in the Sunday morning and evening services at both of the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Anglican</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic.html" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> Cathedrals. However, late on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_28.html" title="September 28">28 September</a> Shankly unexpectedly took a turn for the worse and died, aged 68, at 1.20am on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">29 September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>. He was cremated, and buried at the <a href="../../../a/n/f/Anfield_Crematorium_ff90.html" title="Anfield Crematorium">Anfield Crematorium</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">2 October</a>. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> conference stood in a minutes silence when his death was announced, for a man who had always been a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a>. Sir <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Busby_8995.html" title="Matt Busby">Matt Busby</a> was so upset when he heard that Shankly had died he refused to take any telephone calls asking him how he felt. <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Giles_2557.html" title="Johnny Giles">Johnny Giles</a> suggested afterwards that something inside Shankly exploded and that "he could have died of a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broken_heart.html" title="Broken heart">broken heart</a>, being ignored by the board and also seeing the team going on to achieve greater glories without him". Indeed there may be some truth in this as Bill Shankly was a very fit man, who rarely was ill and who neither drank or smoked.</p>
<p>His rift with the club was quickly resolved, when on the first game at Anfield following his funeral, a huge banner was unfurled on the Kop which read <b>"Shankly Lives Forever"</b>.</p>
<p>Bill Shankly was made an Inaugural Inductee of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Football_Hall_of_Fame_0969.html" title="English Football Hall of Fame">English Football Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, in recognition of his impact on the English game as a manager.</p>
