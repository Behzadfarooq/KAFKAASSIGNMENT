<p>Bill was born on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_26.html" title="November 26">26 November</a> <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a> in <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorset%2C_Vermont_c4bc.html" title="Dorset, Vermont">East Dorset</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermont.html" title="Vermont">Vermont</a> to Gilman Barrows Wilson and Emily Griffith. In 1918 Bill married Lois Burnham. Bill began drinking in the military during World War I. Upon his discharge from the military Bill became a stock speculator in New York City. Over the next several years his drinking progressed and became more serious. He had to be locked up in a psychiatric hospital several times under the care of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Duncan_Silkworth_300c.html" title="William Duncan Silkworth">Dr. William D. Silkworth</a> at the Towns Hospital. He was told that he would either die from his alcoholism or have to be locked up permanently due to alcoholic insanity.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_W._e203.html" title="Edit section: Bill's conversion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bill's conversion</span></h2>
<p>One day, an old drinking friend named <a href="../../../e/b/b/Ebby_Thacher_9304.html" title="Ebby Thacher">Ebby Thacher</a> phoned Bill wanting to visit with him. Expecting to spend a day drinking and re-living old times, Bill was instead shocked by Ebby's refusal to drink. When Bill asked Ebby why he wasn't drinking, Ebby said, "I've got <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a>." Ebby had gotten sober 2 months before under the guidance of Roland Hazard of the Oxford Group, which was an evangelical society. They spoke for hours about Ebby's religious awakening and newfound sobriety. Bill had long held contempt toward organized religion, and upon this revelation Ebby asked him, "Why don't you choose a God of your own understanding?" This simple statement opened the door for Bill and gave him a whole new outlook on spirituality. Bill did not stop drinking that day, but this conversation stuck with him.</p>
<p>Shortly after his visit with Ebby, Bill set out for Towns Hospital for the last time; and while laying in bed recovering from his drinking bout, in depression and despair, he cried out, "if there be a God, let Him show Himself! I'll do anything! Anything!". He then had what he later called a "hot-flash experience". His obsession to drink vanished at once. Bill spoke about his experience with Dr. Silkworth, who told him that he didn't know what had happened to Bill, but he'd better hold onto it. Ebby went to the hospital to visit Bill and walked Bill through some of the basic tenets of the Oxford Group. Upon his release from the hospital, Bill was told to seek out and bring the message of his recovery to others as Ebby had done for him.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_W._e203.html" title="Edit section: A new spiritual program for recovery">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A new spiritual program for recovery</span></h2>
<p>Bill joined the Oxford Movement, and set out trying to help other alcoholics. He had no success in helping anyone get sober because, as he later stated, he was telling them of his spiritual experience in the hospital. When he lamented to Lois about this, she gently pointed out that <i>he</i> was staying sober. Bill visited Dr. Silkworth who told him to try talk to alcoholics about the grave nature of their disease, about the allergy and the obsession, and about his own experience with alcohol. Shortly after, in 1935, he made a trip to <a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron%2C_Ohio_8a85.html" title="Akron, Ohio">Akron, Ohio</a> for a business deal. The transaction failed and in a state of frustration he was tempted to drink again. He concluded that his only hope in remaining sober was to help another alcoholic. So instead of drinking, he camped in a phone booth at his hotel and started calling the phone numbers on a church directory. The last number on the directory put him in touch with Henrietta Seiberling, who had prayed with Dr. Bob Smith and other members of their church for a solution to Bob's drinking problem. Bill was proclaimed by Henrietta to be "manna from heaven." She arranged a meeting with Dr. Bob, who was a general surgeon and was also a member of the Oxford Group. Dr. Bob had been unable to stay sober on his own, so he was skeptical that Bill would be able to help him, but he agreed to give Bill 15 minutes nevertheless. Fifteen minutes turned into 4 hours as Bill and Bob each spoke freely of their own personal experiences and Bill told Dr. Bob of the solution he had found. Shortly after, Dr. Bob had his last drink. This new approach worked so well that Bill and Dr. Bob decided to try it with another alcoholic.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_W._e203.html" title="Edit section: The first AA meeting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The first AA meeting</span></h2>
<p>Using the same approach Bill had used with Dr. Bob, the two men went to a hospital to talk to another alcoholic named Bill D. The approach they used was based on the idea that, because experience brings credibility, one alcoholic can help another alcoholic as nobody else can. Bill D. sobered up and now there were three men carrying this new message of recovery. This became the actual founding of the first group of Alcoholics Anonymous (although it would not be so named until a few years later). The three men then carried the message to another alcoholic, and so the fellowship began. Bill soon returned to New York and began to carry the message there. This bore fruit and soon there was a second group in New York City.</p>

<p>In 1938, after about 100 alcoholics in Akron and New York had sobered up, the fellowship decided to write a book that described the program of action that had helped them to recover from alcoholism. In so doing, they hoped their message would reach more alcoholics who were in a state of helplessness and hopelessness. Because Bill had such good writing skills, the group allowed him to do the honors. The book was designed and written in such a way to carry the message in the same manner that a face-to-face meeting would. The Twelve Steps appeared in the fifth chapter entitled "How It Works." These steps were not new to mankind. Some of the Oxford Groups basic tenets were used, as well as many spiritual principles that are basic and common to most religions. The only difference was that these alcoholics had found a way to put these ideas into practical application in a way that kept them sober. After grappling for a proper title for the book, the title "Alcoholics Anonymous" was selected, and the new movement took the same name. The book was printed in 1939 and the fellowship was about to take off in a way that everybody had hoped, but nobody had expected.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_W._e203.html" title="Edit section: Developing The Twelve Traditions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Developing The Twelve Traditions</span></h3>
<p>In 1939 An article titled "Alcoholics and God" was written by Fulton Oursler for <i><a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_%281924-1950%29.html" title="Liberty (1924-1950)">Liberty</a></i>, which brought many inquiries to the small fellowship. By the end of 1939, the fellowship had grown to about 800 alcoholics. This was followed in 1941 with an article by Jack Alexander for the <i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Evening_Post_2355.html" title="Saturday Evening Post">Saturday Evening Post</a></i>. By the end of 1941, there were about 8,000 members.</p>
<p>In response to these inquiries, and to avoid the problems that caused the demise of the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_movement.html" title="Washington movement">Washington movement</a>, Bill wrote the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_traditions.html" title="Twelve traditions">"Twelve Traditions"</a> to serve as basic constitution and to protect the groups' singleness of purpose — "to carry the message of recovery to the alcoholic who still suffers."</p>
<p>There is evidence that during this time Bill participated in <a href="../../../s/%C3%A9/a/S%C3%A9ance.html" title="Séance">séances</a> and attempted <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channelling_%28mediumistic%29.html" title="Channelling (mediumistic)">channelling</a> for guidance <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. He wrote about these experiences and their influence in letters written to <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Shoemaker_b2d3.html" title="Sam Shoemaker">Reverend Samuel Shoemaker</a>, a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> and Father Ed Dowling, a Catholic Priest and personal friend of Bill's <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Before the twelve traditions were in place, Bill was not shy about personal publicity. Following their establishment he became an anonymous member and would later state that the principle of "public anonymity" was the greatest "spiritual principle" advanced by A.A. Bill refused numerous honors during his life, including an honorary degree from <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>, and refused to allow himself to be on the covers of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine.html" title="Magazine">magazines</a>.</p>
