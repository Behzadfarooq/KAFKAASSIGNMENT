<p>Bill Fennelly</p>
<hr />
<p>Courtesy: Iowa State University Release: 07/18/2006 Head coach Bill Fennelly put Iowa State on the women’s basketball map, orchestrating one of the biggest turnarounds in women’s basketball history. With exceptional personnel and an explosive offensive scheme, Cyclone women’s basketball has become a perennial national powerhouse.</p>
<p>Fennelly took over a program that had only five winning seasons in its 22-year history. He has led the Cyclones to nine postseason tournament appearances, including a 1999 NCAA Elite Eight berth, NCAA Sweet Sixteen games in 2000 and 2001 and the Final Four round of the 2004 WNIT. Fennelly’s Cyclones captured the only league championships in program history, winning back-to-back Big 12 Conference Tournament championships in 2000 and 2001 and earning a share of the regular-season crown in 2000.</p>
<p>In 2006-07, Fennelly will go for his 400th career victory, as he enters the campaign with a 399-163 overall record in his 18-year coaching tenure. He is also one conference win shy of reaching the 200 mark for his career. Fennelly has captured 105 league wins at Iowa State over 11 seasons to go with his 94 conference victories in seven seasons at Toledo.</p>
<p>The 2004-05 Cyclones posted the seventh 20-win season in Iowa State history and the sixth during the Fennelly era. The 18-year head coaching veteran has recorded 20 wins 12 times in his career.</p>
<p>Iowa State spent more than four years in The Associated Press national poll, including 34 weeks in the top 10, and returned to the national rankings two seasons ago. Fennelly posted more conference victories (98) in his first 10 seasons at ISU than all of the previous seasons combined (43). He earned his 300th career victory in Iowa State’s 2001 Big 12 Tournament win over Baylor and his 350th with an upset of the nationally ranked Lady Bears in 2004.</p>
<p>The Cyclones have been phenomenal at home during Fennelly’s tenure, compiling a 139-27 record (.832) in Hilton Coliseum, including a 60-3 mark against regular-season non-conference opponents. Three of his ISU squads have posted perfect home records, including an unblemished 15-0 mark in 2004-05.</p>
<p>Under Fennelly, Iowa State has made seven NCAA Tournament appearances, playing host to first- and second-round games five times. In the Cyclones’ inaugural WNIT appearance, Fennelly coached ISU to the Final Four. His teams have drawn record-setting crowds of loyal fans into Hilton Coliseum. ISU’s attendance average ranked among the top 11 schools nationally in each of the last eight seasons and the Cyclones enjoyed their first-ever sellout crowd in a 2004 WNIT/NIT doubleheader against Saint Joseph’s.</p>
<p>Fennelly’s leadership produced ISU All-Americans Stacy Frese, Angie Welle, Anne O’Neil and Lyndsey Medders. His Cyclones have earned all-conference recognition 30 times, while seven of his players have been selected in the WNBA professional draft. Most recently, Brittany Wilkins made the defending WNBA Sacramento Monarchs as a free-agent.</p>
<p>Fennelly’s Cyclones excel in the classroom as well as on the court. The team’s GPA ranked third nationally among Division I schools in 2004. Iowa State has been represented on the academic all-league list 58 times over the past 11 seasons. Four Cyclones earned academic All-America honors during Fennelly’s tenure, while an ISU player has made the district All-America list 11 times during that span.</p>
<p>Fennelly was named Iowa State’s sixth head women’s basketball coach on July 10, 1995. In his first season, he recorded the biggest turnaround in Cyclone women’s basketball history and the best record ever (17-10) for a first-year ISU coach. In just his second season at the helm, Fennelly took the Cyclones where no coach had taken them before — the NCAA Tournament. One year later, the Cyclones weren’t just going to their second-straight NCAA Tournament, they hosted two rounds of championship play. In 1998-99, ISU’s NCAA Tournament run included a Sweet Sixteen win over top-seeded Connecticut that propelled the Cyclones to the Elite Eight and into the national spotlight.</p>
<p>In 1999-2000, Fennelly’s squad recorded the best record in Iowa State history (27-6) en route to the program’s first-ever conference regular-season and league tournament championships. ISU, the No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament’s Midwest Region, narrowly missed a return to the round of eight with a one-point Sweet Sixteen loss to Penn State.</p>
<p>The 2000-01 Cyclones equaled the school record in wins by posting a 27-6 slate and advancing to the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament for the third consecutive year. ISU earned its highest tournament seed ever with a No. 2 draw in the NCAA Midwest Regional. Fennelly’s Cyclones roared through the Big 12 Conference Tournament as the No. 3 seed, beating three NCAA Tournament qualifiers (Baylor, Texas Tech, Oklahoma) to capture their second consecutive championship.</p>
<p>Led by three-time All-American Angie Welle, the most decorated player in Cyclone women’s basketball history, the Cyclones earned their sixth consecutive NCAA Tournament bid in 2002, playing host to first- and second-round games for the fifth-straight season. Iowa State put together a 24-9 record, including an undefeated 12-0 non-conference slate to start the season. Fennelly’s Cyclones posted a 9-7 league record that included an 82-66 win over national runner-up and then-No. 3 Oklahoma. Iowa State finished sixth in the Big 12 standings and advanced to the semifinals of the Big 12 Tournament for the fifth consecutive season.</p>
<p>With just one senior on the roster and two freshmen in the 2003-04 starting lineup, Fennelly watched his Cyclones evolve and post an 18-15 record and advance to the Final Four round of the Women’s National Invitation Tournament. The Cyclones enjoyed the first sellout in the program’s history with a capacity crowd at the WNIT matchup with Saint Joseph’s. The regular season was highlighted by a win over top-ranked Texas Tech, the highest ranked team ISU has ever defeated. The Cyclones also topped No. 15 Oklahoma, who went on to win the Big 12 Tournament crown, and upset No. 18 Baylor.</p>
<p>Iowa State proved the naysayers wrong in 2004-05, returning to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in three years, posting just the third perfect home record in school history (15-0) and earning national respect in both collegiate polls. The Cyclones, picked to finish sixth in both preseason conference rankings, finished just two games out of first with a 12-4 mark in Big 12 action. ISU matched the best start in school history en route to a 23-7 record and the program’s seventh 20-win season. The resurgence of Cyclone basketball was noticed by the nation’s coaches, as Fennelly earned district coach of the year honors for the second time and was a finalist for Naismith’s national award.</p>
<p>Fennelly is the only ISU coach to turn in 10 winning seasons and owns the program’s best winning percentage (.679). His phenomenal accomplishments at Iowa State have been recognized nationally. He is a three-time finalist for the Naismith Coach of the Year Award (2001, 2002, 2005). His peers voted him WBCA District 5 Coach of the Year twice (1999, 2005) and he finished as the 1998 runner-up to Tennessee’s Pat Summitt in The Associated Press’ Women’s Coach of the Year balloting.</p>
<p>2005-06: Fennelly guided the Cyclones to their ninth postseason appearance in the last 10 years behind a starting lineup that featured two freshmen and two juniors. Iowa State went 18-13 on the season, making the WNIT second round before falling in overtime to Marquette, 69-63. The Cyclones ranked seventh in NCAA attendance, marking the eighth consecutive season among the nation’s top 11.</p>
<p>The Cyclones recorded their 15th winning season in school history, while Fennelly posted his 17th winning campaign in 18 years. Junior Lyndsey Medders earned WBNS All-America third-team honors after leading the nation in assists per game (7.7) and becoming the 17th player in ISU history to join the 1,000-point club.</p>
<p>Brittany Wilkins recorded one of the best senior campaigns in Cyclone history. After getting sporadic nods in her first three seasons, she nearly averaged a double-double (16.1 ppg, 8.9 rpg) and signed a free-agent contract with the Sacramento Monarchs at the conclusion of her collegiate career.</p>
<p>The Cyclones advanced in the Big 12 Tournament for the ninth time in the last 10 years, defeating Texas before falling just short of defeating top-seeded Oklahoma in the quarterfinals, 78-74. Iowa State swept all three in-state opponents in 2005-06, marking the sixth time in school history ISU swept regular-season meetings with Drake, UNI and Iowa.</p>
<p>2004-05: Fennelly was named a Naismith Coach of the Year Award finalist when Iowa State earned its seventh NCAA Tournament invitation and tied for third place in the Big 12 with a 12-4 league record after being piked to finish sixth in the preseason by both coaches and media. He also earned Russell Athletic/WBCA District 5 Coach of the Year accolades.</p>
<p>The Cyclones used a game-winning three-pointer with .02 seconds left against Colorado in the opening round of the Big 12 Tournament, before bowing out with a 61-59 quarterfinal loss to Texas Tech. In the NCAA Tournament, ISU fell to Utah, 73-61, in just the Cyclones’ second road trip in seven NCAA Tournament trips.</p>
<p>ISU posted just the third undefeated home campaign in school history with a 15-0 mark in Hilton Coliseum and the Cyclone’s 12 conference victories were the most since the 2001-02 squad finished 24-9. Iowa State matched its best start in school history with a 15-1 overall mark and owned a 12-game win streak that ranked second nationally before losing at Kansas State on Jan. 25.</p>
<p>Anne O’Neil finished her career on the Kodak/WBCA District 5 Team, as well as earning All-America national team honorable mention honors. She also earned ESPN the Magazine/CoSIDA Academic All-America First Team honors and was drafted by Sacramento in the third round as the 30th overall pick in the WNBA Draft.</p>
<p>2003-04: With just one senior on the roster and two freshmen in the starting lineup, Fennelly watched his Cyclones evolve and post an 18-15 record. A strong finish to the season that was a result of the development of the young players and a solidifying of team chemistry propelled Iowa State into the Final Four round of the Women’s National Invitation Tournament.</p>
<p>All-conference guard Anne O’Neil helped guide ISU to its first-ever WNIT appearance. The Cyclones got plenty of help from their fans and enjoyed the first sellout in the program’s history with a capacity crowd at the WNIT matchup with Saint Joseph’s.</p>
<p>The regular season was highlighted by a win over top-ranked Texas Tech, the highest ranked team ISU has ever defeated. The Cyclones topped No. 15 Oklahoma, who went on to win the Big 12 Tournament crown, and upset No. 18 Baylor. O’Neil represented Iowa State in the postseason as a participant in the ESPN 3-Point Championship.</p>
<p>As usual, Fennelly’s Cyclones continued to impress in the classroom. The team’s GPA ranked third nationally among Division I schools. O’Neil was a district academic All-American and was one of five Cyclones on the academic all-conference list.</p>
<p>2002-03: Despite a 12-16 record, the Cyclones had plenty of highlights. Iowa State beat No. 3 Kansas State with a 74-69 win in Ames, getting 27 points from Lindsey Wilson. Wilson, a first-team all-Big 12 Conference selection, also turned in a 41-point performance at Colorado and had 36 points at Baylor. The 5-9 point guard and academic All-American was selected by the Connecticut Sun in the third round of the WNBA draft.</p>
<p>The fans remained loyal, giving Iowa State the fifth-highest attendance mark nationally with an average of 9,632 at the turnstiles for home games. It was the fourth consecutive season the Cyclone faithful ranked fifth or higher in the national attendance standings.</p>
<p>Fennelly’s Cyclones were stellar in the classroom, boasting the highest team GPA in his tenure. Seven student-athletes were named to the Big 12 academic all-conference first team, which requires a 3.0 GPA or higher. It was the most first-team selections in school history.</p>
<p>2001-02: Led by three-time All-American Angie Welle, the most decorated player in Cyclone women’s basketball history, the Cyclones earned their sixth consecutive NCAA Tournament bid, playing host to first- and second-round games for the fifth-straight season.</p>
<p>Iowa State put together a 24-9 record, including an undefeated 12-0 non-conference slate to start the season. The Cyclones collected three tournament titles in that span, including the prestigious Coaches vs. Cancer Challenge by defeating Mississippi State 87-74 in a nationally televised game on ESPN for the trophy.</p>
<p>Fennelly’s Cyclones posted a 9-7 league record that included an 82-66 win over national runner-up and then-No. 3 Oklahoma. Iowa State finished sixth in the Big 12 standings and advanced to the semifinals of the Big 12 Tournament for the fifth consecutive season.</p>
<p>Welle, who became ISU’s all-time leading scorer and rebounder, joined Tracy Gahan and Lindsey Wilson on the all-conference and academic all-league lists. Welle and Wilson were also academic All-America honorees. Welle represented ISU in the WBCA All-Star Challenge and Gahan participated in the ESPN 3-Point Championship. Both seniors were WNBA draft selections, giving Fennelly five professional draft picks in three years.</p>
<p>2000-01: Despite the loss of three seniors with starting experience, including All-American Stacy Frese, the Cyclones reloaded and finished the season with another Big 12 Conference Tournament championship and their third consecutive NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen appearance. ISU matched the previous year’s record-setting 27-6 finish, giving the Cyclones their fourth consecutive 25-win season.</p>
<p>Iowa State, which spent most of the season ranked among the top 10 in both national polls, spent three weeks at No. 5 on The Associated Press poll. Angie Welle earned AP All-America honors for the second time and a league-high four Cyclones graced the all-conference team for the second consecutive season. A school-record seven Cyclones earned academic all-conference recognition, while Lindsey Wilson was named a Verizon/CoSIDA District VII Academic All-American.</p>
<p>Senior Megan Taylor closed out her career as the school’s all-time leading scorer and rebounder, becoming just the second Cyclone in school history to earn all-conference recognition all four years. Taylor and fellow seniors Erica Haugen and Sarah Robson compiled an 104-28 record at Iowa State.</p>
<p>1999-2000: In a year of high expectations, the Cyclones captured their first-ever conference tournament championship and shared the regular-season crown. ISU’s 27-6 record boasted the most wins and fewest losses in program history, giving the Cyclones a No. 3 NCAA Tournament seed in their fourth-straight appearance. Iowa State’s record-breaking attendance helped send the squad to its second-straight Sweet Sixteen berth, missing the Elite Eight by just one basket.</p>
<p>Iowa State spent the entire season ranked in the national polls, finishing among the top 10 in The Associated Press and coaches’ rankings. ISU sported the most balanced team in the Big 12, placing an unprecedented four players among the top-15 performers on the all-conference team. It was the first time in conference history four players from the same team were placed among the top three squads. The AP named senior Stacy Frese to its All-America second team, while sophomore Angie Welle was an honorable mention choice.</p>
<p>Frese was a finalist for Naismith Player of the Year and the Nancy Lieberman Award and was a first-team all-conference pick for the third-straight season. Four Cyclones earned academic all-conference recognition, while Frese was a GTE CoSIDA District VII Academic All-American. Frese and classmate Desirée Francis were both selected in the WNBA draft, becoming the first Cyclones ever to play in the WNBA.</p>
<p>1998-99: Fennelly’s Cyclones took the basketball world by storm, emerging as one of the top teams in the nation and missing the NCAA Final Four by just one victory. The Cyclones spent the entire 1998-99 season ranked among the top 25 in both national polls.</p>
<p>ISU notched several milestones en route to the school’s second-straight 20-win season (25-8). The Cyclones went 3-1 in the NCAA Mideast Regional, upsetting top-seeded Connecticut to advance to the Elite Eight round. The win over the fourth-ranked Huskies was arguably the biggest in school history, played in front of a nationwide ESPN audience.</p>
<p>Just two weeks earlier, ISU was playing in its first-ever Big 12 Conference Tournament championship game after finishing second in the league. During the year, Iowa State swept season series’ from Colorado, Kansas and Missouri. The Cyclones handed the Jayhawks their first-ever Big 12 home loss and tallied three wins in one season over both KU and Missouri.</p>
<p>The Cyclones landed four players on the all-conference team for the second consecutive season and had six academic all-conference picks. Junior Desirée Francis was tabbed the league’s newcomer of the year, the second-straight Cyclone to earn the honor (Stacy Frese, 1998).</p>
<p>Stacy Frese emerged as one of the top point guards in the nation, earning All-America recognition from The Associated Press, Women’s Basketball Journal and Women’s Basketball News Service. A first-team all-conference selection, Frese was named to the Big 12 all-tournament and NCAA Mideast Region’s all-tournament squads.</p>
<p>Fennelly’s freshman class was essential to the program’s success, with two newcomers in the starting lineup every game. Angie Welle earned honorable mention all-conference honors and was placed on the Women’s Basketball News’ all-freshman squad. Tracy Gahan bounced back from a broken wrist and finished the season joining Frese on the NCAA Mideast Region’s all-tournament team.</p>
<p>1997-98: Fennelly guided ISU to a then-school-record 25 wins en route to the Cyclones’ second-straight NCAA Tournament appearance. Iowa State (25-8) cracked the national polls for the first time ever, debuting at No. 24 in The Associated Press poll Jan. 26. ISU spent six weeks in the AP poll and five weeks in the USA Today/CNN/WBCA Coaches’ Poll, finishing 24th and 23rd in each, respectively.</p>
<p>The Cyclones not only set numerous team and individual records, but also achieved several milestones which helped Iowa State move into the national spotlight. Those accomplishments were highlighted by the school’s first-ever NCAA Tournament victory (79-76 vs. Kent), a second-place Big 12 Conference finish and a No. 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament’s Mideast Region. Iowa State played host to first- and second-round NCAA games, setting tournament attendance records with over 9,000 fans at each game. The season also included ISU’s first win over an AP top-five team (82-73 vs. No. 5 Texas Tech), the program’s first-ever national ranking, breaking the school’s top single-game attendance mark six times and closing out the season ranked 20th nationally with an average of 3,775 fans.</p>
<p>Fennelly landed four players on the all-conference squad, placed three players on the academic all-conference team and saw ISU sweep the Big 12 awards with newcomer of the year Stacy Frese and freshman of the year Megan Taylor.</p>
<p>1996-97: Fennelly’s second season proved a historic one at Iowa State. The Cyclones recorded a then-school-record nine conference wins and four conference road victories in just their second winning league slate ever. Fennelly guided ISU to a 74-56 win over then-No. 9 Texas, the school’s first victory against an AP top-10 team.</p>
<p>Iowa State posted a 7-3 non-conference record, which included wins over 1997 NCAA participants Drake (86-57) and Oregon (72-63). The Cyclones picked up their first-ever road victories at Oklahoma and Missouri. ISU bounced back from a four-game losing skid to tally a 7-1 record in February, including the Cyclones’ largest margin of victory over a conference foe, an 88-43 win at Baylor. The Cyclones’ 9-7 conference record was good enough to tie for fifth place in the standings. ISU faced Texas A&amp;M as the No. 6 seed in the inaugural Big 12 Conference Tournament, advancing to second-round play for the first time since 1990 and just the second time ever and giving Fennelly his 200th career coaching victory.</p>
<p>The Cyclones’ at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament sent them to Charlottesville, Va., as a No. 12 seed in the first round of the West Regional. Iowa State faced fifth-seeded Utah, which ended ISU’s record-setting season with a 66-57 defeat March 14.</p>
<p>First-team academic All-American Jayme Olson was also named to the Kodak District V All-America team, just the second Cyclone ever to earn All-America honors. She became the first Cyclone since 1990 to earn first-team all-conference honors, and was joined on the squad by teammates Janel Grimm (third team) and Tara Gunderson (honorable mention). Fennelly’s squad sported five first-team academic all-conference members.</p>
<p>1995-96: Picked to finish last in the conference, Iowa State closed out the season with a 17-10 record, its best since 1990-91. Point guard Tara Gunderson was the nation’s leading three-point shooter, averaging 3.4 per game and receiving AT&amp;T’s Long Distance Award. Forward Jayme Olson was a third-team GTE Academic All-American, while six players were on the Big Eight’s Academic Honor Roll.</p>
<p>Fennelly’s exciting style and a 12-game win streak to start the season brought the fans out to Hilton Coliseum in record numbers. Attendance more than doubled, averaging 1,706 fans per home game. ISU had never averaged more than 950 fans per game in a season. On that note, three of the season’s crowds ranked on the school’s top-10 list for women’s basketball attendance.</p>
<p>Iowa State rewrote the three-point record books in just one season under Fennelly. Every individual and team three-point category was broken or tied several times.</p>
<p>At Toledo: Fennelly came to ISU from Toledo, where he compiled a seven-year record of 166-53 (.758). His list of accomplishments at Toledo included six 20-plus win seasons, six postseason tournament berths in seven years and one of the top records in the nation over that span. Fennelly coached the Rockets to second, third- and fifth-place finishes in the Women’s National Invitational Tournament (WNIT) and three NCAA Tournament appearances. Fennelly was one of seven inductees selected to the 2003 Toledo Varsity "T" Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Personal: A native of Davenport, Iowa, Fennelly accumulated 12 years of collegiate coaching experience at William Penn College, Fresno State and Notre Dame before taking the head coach position at Toledo. Fennelly graduated from William Penn with a bachelor’s degree in business administration and economics in 1979. He and his wife, Deb, have two sons, Billy and Steven.</p>
