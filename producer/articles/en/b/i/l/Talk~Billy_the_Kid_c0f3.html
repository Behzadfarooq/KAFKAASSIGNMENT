<p>There is no EVIDENCE that Billy The Kid actually died in 1881, there should be a paragragh saying IT IS still a mystery.</p>
<p>Did Billy the Kid really die on the 14th of July? I have seen elsewhere he died on the 13th, and in a few places even the 15th. Any idea if any of this is correct? There is a lot of confusion surrounding his death, and I would appreciate any help anyone can give me.

<p>The discussion of the Lincoln County Jail break confuses an earlier Jail break from the Dona Ana County Court House in Mesilla, NM. (Mesilla at the time was the county seat of Dona Ana County. Lincoln is the county seat of Lincoln County.) These are two separate events in Billy's life. Incidently, the building that Billy escaped from had previously served as "Capital" of the Confederate Territory of Arizona during the abortive invasion of NM by Confederate soldiers from Texas.</p>

<p>Thre have been several references to a 93% match of Brushy Bill versus Billy the Kid tintype. I cannot find any reproductions of the actual study, however, the people attributed to the study (Acton-Bovik) appear to be some kind of graphics processing researchers <a href="http://citeseer.ifi.unizh.ch/acton99piecewise.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://citeseer.ifi.unizh.ch/acton99piecewise.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The claims seem dubious because of the low-resolution nature of the tintype and the fact that the human eye (for most people's eyes) doesn't agree with the claims. Is there an actual paper on this to go with the claims? --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaygate_5630.html" title="User:Claygate">Claygate</a> 01:11, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article says John Miller is a known hoax, but it doesn't say how it was proven. Can anyone explain?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good question. Maybe it's considered more of a hoax because he's the less favored of the two claimants. However, in pictures it would appear that Miller looked more like the kid than Brushy Bill did. Miller didn't push the story as much as Brushy Bill and Jessie James claimants did. Miller's claimed birth date would have made him too old to be the kid, but I'm not sure if the date has been verified. --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaygate_5630.html" title="User:Claygate">Claygate</a> 23:23, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The justifications provided for Billy the Kid's murders are fairly POV, not to mention a little silly. I am also curious as to which kind of "scientists" determined whose gun was drawn first.</p>

<dd>I believe the source for that one is from an episode of "Unsolved History" on the Discovery Channel, from a couple of years ago. They put together some of the written accounts, the layout of the Maxwell ranch, some fancy computer graphics, and deduced it from that. I can't find any current references to that particular show on the web, though. --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaygate_5630.html" title="User:Claygate">Claygate</a> 00:27, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the Kid was a fast draw. I think that they ambushed him. If he was that easy to kill they would have done it awhile ago. (70.244.114.211 00:02, 27 April 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>I agree with all of the names in here except one. You said that his father's name was Patrick Henry Mccarty. There are alot of websites though that say this is one of Billy the Kid's aliases. Did he use his dad's name, is his dad's name something else, or are those sites wrong?(70.244.114.211 00:10, 27 April 2006 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is little in the historical record about his father and that's why the article states the variations given for his name. It's possible that Billy might have used his dad's name for one of his aliases so those sites are not necessarily wrong, although the main alias that's in the records (e.g. wanted posters, etc) is William H. Bonney. --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaygate_5630.html" title="User:Claygate">Claygate</a> 02:51, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding the mention of <i>The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid</i> as "wildly popular," I have heard quite the opposite; according to Bob Boze Bell in <i>The Illustrated Life and Times of Billy the Kid</i>, "the promotion of the book is poor and very few books are sold. Garrett and Upson will receive little if anything for their efforts." "Wildly sensationalistic" is pretty accurate, though. Elkoref 22:00, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bonnet, Bonnette, or Bonnet, is inconsequential, as the Franco-Prussian or Normandaise name is spelt all three ways. What is important is that you don't have his signature, and I do. It says nothing here about that frump posted as Billy the Kidd [there was a reason that it was also spelled with two "d's," since it was a family legacy, his mother's maiden name]. And, indeed, he was small and looked like a child; he was only 5'2" which gave him a decided advantage. He had Blue Eyes #10 and blonde hair, so, the frump in the picture is not Billy the Kidd, but a rather stupid stand in who couldn't rob a horse right. Which is why that frump got shot, and, since Garret himself was a horse thief, and Billy and a certain judge and a certain governor knew this, Billy went into the Witness Protection Program established under Ulysses S. Grant. In other words, his death was as pre-arranged as Doc Holiday going to New York City to become a sports writer.</p>
<p>Your history sources are really bad on this one; here's the signature and I have the documents:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.Musics.com/News/images/00064a.Wickham.von.Bonnett.02.signature.big.gif" class="external text" title="http://www.Musics.com/News/images/00064a.Wickham.von.Bonnett.02.signature.big.gif" rel="nofollow">great great grandfather's signature</a></p>
<p>Put that in your university pipe and smoke it.</p>
<p>Where did all the records go after the Civil War, like the census records? They made three copies of each you know. Ask for the records stored in Norad and you might get a better history source.</p>
<p>Sorry, but until now, you've had no sources that are reliable. Billy was, indeed, handsome, and, looked like a boy, nearly all his life. Billy Kidd Bonnett [or Bonnie as the Frenchies in Louisianna liked to say] was not ugly, as that "thing" in the alleged "only known picture of Billy the Kidd" is; there are other pictures, apparently you don't have access to them.</p>
<p>This whole thing has gotten as bad as the universities insisting that Troy was a myth until Schliemann proved them wrong.</p>
<p>And Billy hated Texas, by the way.</p>

<p>Just saw a squib on Yahoo's news site about the exhumation of John Miller's remains. Apparently no charges are being filed against the sheriff who did so in order to have them DNA tested and compared to what were believed to be blood stains from Billy in 1880. Not clear as to the result. Does someone want to follow up?</p>

<dd>It doesn't seem like there was anything noteworthy with respect to the real Kid, or they would have been some big noise about it when they did the DNA test. The logic of what they were trying to do was kind of flawed, e.g. they used the blood from a wood slab where Billy died in Fort Sumner. If Billy died on the slab, then what were they trying to find in that test, from the bones of the other guy who died much later? --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaygate_5630.html" title="User:Claygate">Claygate</a> 22:49, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I moved the <i>Brushy Bill</i> and <i>John Miller</i> pieces into separate sections, and added a bit about the DNA tests on Miller. Presumably if any test results are ever made public, this section will be updated appropriately. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 21:10, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>67.71.186.118 18:06, 29 November 2006 (UTC)You describe his appearance, then go on to say he was "personable", which means "handsome". In the context, I think you mean to say he was outgoing or friendly.</p>

<dd>Yes, he was described that way by a reporter for the Las Vegas (NM) Gazette. I'll recheck and make sure that it reflects what the reporter said. --<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClaygate_5630.html" title="User:Claygate">Claygate</a> 19:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So if you go through the article and count, there are ten murders in which Billy the Kid was involved; not nine as it is claimed later in the article. So which is it? <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClovisPt_4d21.html" title="User:ClovisPt">ClovisPt</a> 23:14, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Feb 2007 issue of <i><a href="http://www.historynet.com/magazines/wild_west" class="external text" title="http://www.historynet.com/magazines/wild_west" rel="nofollow">Wild West magazine</a></i> (one of the magazines of <a href="http://www.historynet.com" class="external text" title="http://www.historynet.com" rel="nofollow">historynet.com</a>) contains the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Billy the Kid and the U.S. Marshals Service</i> <a href="http://www.historynet.com/historical_figures/4852001.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historynet.com/historical_figures/4852001.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
<li><i>Billy the Kid Country</i> (cover story)</li>
<li><i>The Controversial Inquests and Burial of Billy the Kid</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I've added exetrnal links to historynet.com for two of their stories, the first one above and an older article from 1998. The really interesting article is the third one above, but since this is the cover story of the current issues (printed Dec 2006), it probably won't show up on their website until the issue comes out, perhaps after Jan 2007. Someone should watch this and add the link after they put it up on the web. And use some of the information from the articles to improve the Wiki article, too, of course. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 15:27, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you want to read this article from the wild west magazine dec 2006, i have pasted the link for you to go to. i have been intrested in billy the kid for a number of years now, and i am hoping to find out as much as possible. <a href="http://www.historynet.com/magazines/wild_west/4852001.html?featured=y&amp;c=y" class="external free" title="http://www.historynet.com/magazines/wild_west/4852001.html?featured=y&amp;c=y" rel="nofollow">http://www.historynet.com/magazines/wild_west/4852001.html?featured=y&amp;c=y</a> i know that the book which pat garrett wrote does not depict the life of william as people would like to believe, and does not include the fact that he shot william twice before and also does not include the fact that garrett did not shoot william dead. there is more to the book than most people reallise you just have to read between the lines and follow the leads to where he went and the reasons for which william went there. and he did not use his fathers name as an alias that was williams step-fathers name which he used on a few occsions.... s.tyler</p>

<dd>Yeah, see the link I posted above. The third article I cited seems to be biased towards the claim of Brushy Bill as Billy the Kid. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 20:44, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The text that reads 'Five of them were during shootouts in which up to between 5 to 10 or more....' is awkward. A number can be up to 10, but not up to between 5 to 10; the 'or more' makes the sentence utterly rediculous. --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesertphile_0910.html" title="User:Desertphile">Desertphine</a> 23:20, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the name Manhattan Island is unnecessary; back before the other boroughs were incorporated into NYC-proper, the island of Manhattan was known simply as "New York City." The other boroughs were separate municipalities; for instance, the present day borough of Brooklyn was known in the 19th century as the City of Brooklyn. Therefore, if you were talking about New York City back in those days, it was understood that you were talking about the island of Manhattan. Any comments are welcome. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGravinos_4617.html" title="User:Gravinos">Geoffrey C Vargo</a> 01:53, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
