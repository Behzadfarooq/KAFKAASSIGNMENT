<h2><span class="mw-headline">Photos</span></h2>
<p>I agree we shouldn't whitewash history, which is what you are attempting to do with this Clinton article. The photos are relevant and you have not contested this. You agree that similar pictures should be included on Bush's page, so why not on this page right now? Talk before changing the page.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../n/y/r/User%7ENyr14_4000.html" title="User:Nyr14">Nyr14</a> 00:25, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have talked, however, you have not listened. Biography pages of Presidents are not here for images of wars and conflicts that happened during their time. Each war or conflict has their own page, just as Kosovo does, and that is where it belongs. The only way those images stay are if images of dead bodies from Iraq are on the George W. Bush page. Clearly you are a partisan who is trying to demonize Clinton all over again, but it isn't going to work. The Kosovo war was necessary and well orchestrated with no American casulties. Please add your input on this war on the Kosovo page, not the Clinton biography page. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisDJackson_0242.html" title="User:ChrisDJackson">ChrisDJackson</a> 02:37, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>We are not talking about other president's pages but the Clinton page. President pages are here to inform people about Presidents both good and bad. The good was that Clinton stopped the forced migration and helped many refugees (shown in the picture currently up). However, there were a lot of refugees that never got that chance because of him. Both of these points should be made.</p>
<p>Your first claim for removing the image was that it was not relevant. It is a picture of the Kosovo War in a section about the Kosovo War.</p>
<p>To follow your logic we should remove the <a href="../../../o/s/l/Oslo_Accords_6e48.html" title="Oslo Accords">Oslo Accords</a> picture because there is a seperate page for it. There is a seperate page for the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlemagne_Award_a154.html" title="Charlemagne Award">Charlemagne Award</a>. Your picture should be removed because there is a sepearte page about the <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo_War_c7a9.html" title="Kosovo War">Kosovo War</a>. The impeachment picture is also on <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton_e031.html" title="Impeachment of Bill Clinton">Impeachment of Bill Clinton</a>. Hillary's confirmation didn't happen until after his presidency and so that picture should be removed and people should just go to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#The_2000_Senate_Race" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton#The_2000_Senate_Race" rel="nofollow">2000 senate election page</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I'm not a partisan at all. You're the one that has a biography page about how much you love the Democratic Party.</p>

<li>The point Chris is making is that your pictures showed a war, and the current set show Bill Clinton in various locations. Yes, this page is about Bill Clinton and what happened during his presidency, but first and foremost it is about <i>Bill Clinton</i> - that's the heading, isn't it? So by all means, make mention of Kosovo - and the article does that - but refer everything to Clinton. That's what these pictures do. It's an article about what happened while Clinton was president, but moreso about <i>his</i> involvement in these events. Showing a picture of bodies on a road does nothing but send a message to the reader that Clinton had some sort of direct connection with these deaths, and you cannot claim that without proof, but showing him at a refugee camp says, "Yes, he did have an involvement in a war, and here's the proof!" <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Harro5_d85f.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Harro5">contribs</a>) 03:00, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>They were bombs that Clinton ordered to be dropped. That's his involvement. The section of the article discusses specifically the NATO bombing campaign which was ordered by Clinton. The pictures are specifically from an accidental bombing which Clinton took the blame for. I'll refer you to an article titled "Civilian Deaths Inevitable In Warfare, Clinton Says" from the page A11 of <i>New York Times</i> on April 16, 1999:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"What we believe happened is that the pilot thought it was a military convoy and that there were apparently civilians in the convoy who were killed. That is regrettable; it is also inevitable," the President said. Despite such "errors," he vowed to continue the bombing campaign until President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia stopped terrorizing and killing Albanians and driving them from their homes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Therefore showing the picture of the bombing's effect is extremely relevant.</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You are clearly a hack who is out to re-write history. By trying to insert photos of dead bodies into a bio page of President Clinton, you are trying to say he killed those people. It just isn't right and it won't fly here. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisDJackson_0242.html" title="User:ChrisDJackson">ChrisDJackson</a> 03:24, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>He took the blame for killing those people. <a href="http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/New/html/19990415-4325.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/New/html/19990415-4325.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> "Well, first of all, what we believe happened is that the pilot thought it was a military convoy and that there were apparently civilians in the convoy who were killed."</p>
<p>84 of them were killed. thats about 1/6 of the deaths that Milosevic ended up being charged with.</p>

<p>Everytime I readd the pictures they are taken down with no explanation. Can whomever put the neutrality dispute up please tell why?</p>

<ul>
<li>I added the NPOV header up on this section because there obviously is a dispute happening. Look how many comments you and ChrisDJackson have made back and forth, and the amount of reverts. If this isn't a NPOV dispute, I don't know what is. Frankly, I think it is appauling that you feel you can justify putting pictures of bodies on a President's page. Wikipedia is used by people as young as grade school students for research - in fact, Google's third result for 'Bill Clinton' is his Wiki page, and you feel it necessary to add pictures of war and death to it. Please explain that. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarro5_1808.html" title="User talk:Harro5">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Harro5_d85f.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Harro5">contribs</a>) 07:48, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I suppose it could be considered an NPOV dispute. The picture up right now is extremely misleading; if a grade school student, or anyone for that matter, saw only that picture then they would go away with this notion that Bill Clinton was this great guy (and he did, in fact, help a lot of people that had been forcefully migrated). In order to be balanced, however, we should also show pictures of what some critics think of "bad". Hence, the pictures. Bill Clinton took responsibility for the attack and this information should be better known to others.</p>

<hr />
<p>My thoughts:</p>
<p>Personally, I would favor having no images at all in this section, or else a picture of protesters marching against the Kosovo War or something like that. Pictures should directly illustrate the subject of the subsection here, to avoid POV problems. The subject here is criticism of foreign policy, so we should show somebody criticizing his foreign policy. A picture of Pat Buchanan denouncing NAFTA might be most appropriate.</p>
<p>In addition, this whole thing is a POV mess--and not just the subject in question. Specifically, I'd like to get a citation on the 103d Congress initiating the independent counsel investigations. As such ,I've removed that allegation until a citation can be provided (the allegation was in the lead section ,if you're interested). I've also removed the pic of Clinton holding a child from the foreign policy criticisms section .<a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 19:46, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Would anyone have objections to discussing the specific incident? What about a link to the picture?</p>

<hr />
<p>As far as the picture in question was concerned, I believe that it is prudent to not display it. If one is to research Eisenhower, Reagan, Johnson, (on Wikipedia) they do not see pictures of dead Koreans, Panamanians, or Vietnamese. It IS prudent to mention the controversy and casualties, but not to publish dead bodies on a presidents bio page, after all, pictures of dead bodies are first and foremost still pictures of dead bodies.</p>

<p>No problem. However, someone is trying to remove it. I am about sure it is from the White House at the very end of his tenure, but cannot confirm it now.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism of "Criticisms of Foreign Policy" section</span></h2>
<p>The first two citations in this section are misquotes. "Defense Secretary William Cohen, claiming that genocide had occurred in Kosovo..." Nowhere in the cited <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/cohen051699.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/cohen051699.htm" rel="nofollow">article</a> does Cohen claim genocide. His assertions in this article are far too qualified to attribute a claim of "genocide" to him from this article.</p>
<p>The very next sentence attributes the claim of genocide to Clinton himself, but the speech cited never mentions genocide at all. The closest he comes in this <a href="http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/051399-speech-by-president-to-veterans-organizations-on-kosovo.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/051399-speech-by-president-to-veterans-organizations-on-kosovo.htm" rel="nofollow">speech</a> is paragraph 13:</p>
<p>"Though his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing" rel="nofollow">ethnic cleansing</a> is not the same as the ethnic extermination of the Holocaust, the two are related -- both vicious, premeditated, systematic oppression fueled by religious and ethnic hatred. This campaign to drive the Kosovars from their land and to, indeed, embrace their very identity is an affront to humanity and an attack not only on a people, but on the dignity of all people."</p>
<p>The only reference by Clinton to genocide re: Kosovo I could find was actually about Bosnia some years previous. In his <a href="http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/032499-speech-by-president-to-the-nation-on-kosovo.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/032499-speech-by-president-to-the-nation-on-kosovo.htm" rel="nofollow">speech</a> on 24 March 1999:</p>
<p>"We learned some of the same lessons in Bosnia just a few years ago. The world did not act early enough to stop that war, either. And let's not forget what happened -- innocent people herded into concentration camps, children gunned down by snipers on their way to school, soccer fields and parks turned into cemeteries; a quarter of a million people killed, not because of anything they have done, but because of who they were. Two million Bosnians became refugees. This was genocide in the heart of Europe -- not in 1945, but in 1995."</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/bosnia.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/bosnia.htm" rel="nofollow">Bosnia</a>, Milosevic did preside over an actual genocide (estimated 200,000 deaths). For some reason that fact is ignored in this section.</p>
<p>Given the misquotes, the first two paragraphs in this section are bizarre. There were only <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000/3/31/62056" class="external text" title="http://www.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000/3/31/62056" rel="nofollow">5900 US troops</a> involved in a very successful NATO effort where no US troops were killed, yet takes seriously unnamed sources that accuse Clinton of "leading the United States to war with Kosovo under the false pretense of genocide".</p>
<p>So, unless some better cites for Cohen and Clinton are found, the whole part about Kosovo should be deleted. The opening sentence, "Some critics have accused..." is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word" rel="nofollow">weaseler</a> and indicates a weak statement. "Some critics" make every accusation imaginable, so it is not NPOV to give them space without subjecting them to the same rigorous standards as any other source. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 5:52, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll give it another week or so before removing the aforementioned paragraphs. Not sure if there's any worthwhile criticism about Kosovo that I should replace it with, other than the "wag the dog" stuff, which I find ludicrous, but at least slightly more reasoned and moderate than what's in this section now. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 05:39, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Clinton administration claimed that both genocide and ethnic cleansing were taking place. I did not include a reference to the claim of genocide because that was (I thought) common knowledge. The <i>New York Times</i> reported on March 30, 1999 in an article written by Francis X Clines titled "NATO Hunting for Serb Forces; U.S. Reports Signs of 'Genocide'" appearing on page A1 that:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"NATO bombers hunted for Serbian troops in embattled Kosovo today and the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Serbian forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest yet in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic."</dd>
</dl>
<p>CNN wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned President Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send U.S. forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort." <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/23/u.s.kosovo.04/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/US/9903/23/u.s.kosovo.04/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>William Cohen gave a speech in which he said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide" <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/1999/t04091999_t407nato.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/1999/t04091999_t407nato.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Clinton (responding to some of those critics calling him a war criminal) said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"NATO did not commit war crimes. NATO stopped war crimes. NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide." <a href="http://clinton6.nara.gov/1999/06/1999-06-25-press-conference-by-the-president.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://clinton6.nara.gov/1999/06/1999-06-25-press-conference-by-the-president.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>However, NATO, stopping those war crimes, killed more civilians than Milosevic did.</p>
<p>You wrote "In Bosnia, Milosevic did preside over an actual genocide (estimated 200,000 deaths). For some reason that fact is ignored in this section."</p>
<p>The section is about Clinton's foreign policy. Clinton did not intervene in Bosnia. That is why the fact is "ignored" in this section.</p>
<p>Some critics include <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods36.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods36.html" rel="nofollow">Thomas E. Woods</a>, <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=14861" class="external text" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=14861" rel="nofollow">Joseph Farah</a>, among others.</p>
<p>And, by the way, you're right that we didn't lose any soldiers in the Kosovo conflict; we lost two. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/kosovo050699.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/kosovo050699.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> And if by "sucessful" you mean that we stopped "genocide" that wasn't going on and simultaneously killed thousands of innocent civilians, then the Kosovo operation was extremely sucessful.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Thank you for providing the appropriate sources. You did in fact cite sources originally, albeit inappropriate ones. They should be fixed if they haven't been already.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Ethnic cleansing", a broader term than genocide, was the more commonly used, and the misquoted sources made me wonder whether there were some inflated claims of the admin using the latter term.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The argument that Clinton is a war criminal because the deaths in Kosovo did not meet the standards of "genocide" is an unusual variation of the "post hoc" fallacy: a Denial of Causation or Connection (a Cart Without a Horse). We already know that there was genocide in Bosnia committed by the Serbs under Milosevic. Now the argument is that Clinton becomes a war criminal by successfully stopping another genocide by the same group, under the same leader, against essentially the same victim group. If Clinton had been <i>less</i> successful at stopping the Serbs, then the Serbs would have killed more Kosovars, and Clinton would be <b>"justified"</b> in intervening because of his <i>lack</i> of military success. Here's your source on the nature of Clinton's "crimes":</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Yet, there is just no evidence to support Clinton's conclusion (about genocide). Where are the bodies? So far, examination of the most likely dumping grounds has produced only 2,108. That's hardly genocide. It's tragic. But how does it <b>justify</b> an international bombing campaign that may well have resulted in far more civilian deaths in Serbia?" (emphasis added)<a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=14861" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=14861" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The question is, "Do such bizarre, illogical criticisms have a place in an encyclopedic article?" I would say no, but am willing to compromise. But first, a correction. Clinton did in fact intervene to stop the genocide in Bosnia:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"On August 30, 1995, effective military intervention finally began as the U.S. led a massive NATO bombing campaign in response to the killings at Srebrenica, targeting Serbian artillery positions throughout Bosnia. The bombardment continued into October. Serb forces also lost ground to Bosnian Muslims who had received arms shipments from the Islamic world. As a result, half of Bosnia was eventually retaken by Muslim-Croat troops.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Faced with the heavy NATO bombardment and a string of ground losses to the Muslim-Croat alliance, Serb leader Milosevic was now ready to talk peace." <a href="http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/bosnia.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/bosnia.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So not mentioning Bosnia seems especially suspicious, since it reasonably explains the intervention in Kosovo.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The compromise: that this section include criticisms 1) of Clinton's delay in interceding in Bosnia and 2) criticisms that he interceded in Bosnia at all, and only then 3) the criticisms that he interceded in Kosovo. However, such a solution puts the article at risk for becoming a morass of competing rants from extremist sources, of which there are a neverending supply. OR we can scrap all extremist, partisan rhetoric of "some critics" (iow, remove the offending paragraphs) and create a decent article.</dd>

<p>The section, as is, does not mention nor comment on whether the war was "justified".</p>
<p>The first paragraph deals with Clinton lying about genocide going on and inflating the numbers of dead Albanians.</p>
<p>Bosnia was not mentioned because (to the best of my knowledge) the administration never used it to justify intervening in Kosovo. The American people would have a hard time sending troops over there because of something that happened four years before. Regardless, the main justifications for war by the adminstration were the 100,000 dead and the genocide that was occuring. Those two contentions turned out to be false.</p>
<p>I agree that this section needs a rewrite and to be referenced better. Perhaps we could use the reference system used by the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">Libertarianism</a> page?</p>
<p>PS worldnetdaily is a legitimate source when used as an example of a critic, as I was doing. And it was never a source to be used in the article.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../n/y/r/User%7ENyr14_4000.html" title="User:Nyr14">Nyr14</a> 13:50, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The first paragraph does <b>not</b> deal with Clinton lying about numbers of dead Kosovar Albanians, since it never mentions a number for dead Kosovar Albanians. Nyr14 said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Regardless, the main justifications for war by the adminstration were the <b>100,000 dead</b> and the genocide that was occuring." (emphasis added)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But the article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Defense Secretary William Cohen, claiming that genocide had occurred in Kosovo, said, "We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men <b>missing</b>... They may have been murdered." <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/cohen051699.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/cohen051699.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Clinton also claimed that genocide was occurring, and spoke of "at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing". (emphasis added)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'll assume that Nyr14 is merely <i>mistaken</i> about what the article says, and not that Nyr14 is <i>lying</i>. Nyr14 is conflating two separate claims: one of a general policy of genocide, which turns out not to be an unreasonable claim given the genocide in Bosnia, and another claim of “100,000 military-aged men missing”, two claims that are then disingenuously equated to cook up an accusation of “lying”.</p>
<p>Moreover, not one of the sources cited in the article even mention Clinton “lying” about genocide in Kosovo. That is the author's own unsupported conclusion.</p>
<p>When that is fixed, the two offending paragraphs rewritten, and sources accusing Clinton of lying are cited, we can return to the issue of “justification” and all that.</p>
<p>Also, Nyr14, please do not accuse me of vandalism in the page history. I gave you a month to address the necessary changes, as well as a 5-day warning. You chose not to address the matter until a few hours after I made the change, then accused me of vandalism. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 18:35, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The administration said up to 500,000 may have been killed. The New York Times has also covered the huge disparity between the deaths claimed by "American and allied officials" and the amount of bodies actually found. The article was titled "Early Count Hints at Fewer Kosovo Deaths" and appeared on page A6 on November 11, 1999:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"While there are several hundred more reported sites to be examined in the spring, the number of the dead found so far seems significantly lower than the estimate of 10,000 ethnic Albanians killed by the Serbs, issued by Western officials, or the suggestion by American and allied officials during the war that up to 100,000 were being killed."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"During the war, however, estimated death figures were very high. On April 19, the State Department said that up to 500,000 Kosovar Albanians were missing and feared dead."</dd>
</dl>
<p>There was an editorial in the <i>Washington Times</i> on November 19, 1999 by Phyllis Schlafly in which she wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The embarrassing truth is starting to come out that the Clinton administration lied to us about Kosovo atrocities, which were supposed to justify the bombing of Yugoslavia. In five months of investigation, and exhumation of the dead in Kosovo, U.N. war crimes investigators have found only 2,108 bodies." <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a383733326c5a.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a383733326c5a.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> (You can verify it by a simple search on the Washington Times' website, as I already have)</dd>
</dl>
<p>But this argument is pointless as the article makes no claim of Clinton lying. As of now, it has a quote from Clinton and Cohen and then the real figure.</p>
<p>Your contention that the genocide in Bosnia justifies Kosovo is blatantly POV. Please comment about problems you have with the <b>article</b>.</p>
<p>I accused you of vandalism before I had seen the talk page (the talk page was not on my watchlist at the time).</p>

<p>Nyr14, you wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"The first paragraph deals with Clinton lying about genocide going on and inflating the numbers of dead Albanians."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then you wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"But this argument is pointless as the article makes no claim of Clinton lying."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Which is it? Well, it's the former, though it uses the term "false pretenses" instead of the word lying.</p>
<p>As I said, the article does not demonstrate "false pretenses", "lying", or whatever else you want to call it. The article as it stands does not cite a single source claiming false pretenses. Who is making the claim of false pretenses? You? The quotes from Cohen and Clinton do not support a claim of false pretenses. Please add and cite the "500,000 dead" quote instead of the "100,000 missing" or "500,000 missing and feared dead" quotes.</p>
<p>Nyr14 wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"As of now, it has a quote from Clinton and Cohen and then the real figure."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'll say it again: it has a quote from Cohen and Clinton on the number of dead <b>missing</b> at the time of the quote, and then the actual number of <b>dead</b>. Are you following? Missing is not the same as dead. Thankfully.</p>
<p>Also, I never claimed Kosovo was justified at all. What I did address was your source saying Kosovo was <b>not</b> justified <i>because</i> there were not enough deaths to be consider genocide. <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=14861" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=14861" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> I also said that the claim of genocide, with all the sources cited and numbers given so far, is not enough to accuse Clinton of lying.</p>
<p>Maybe you could summarize what the intention of the Kosovo portion is meant to say, because you are contradicting yourself. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 01:28, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I feel it necessary to warn that I will still scrutinize any claims that Clinton lied about genocide in Kosovo when the section is rewritten. I've let a few such go by in an effort to limit digressions and keep the focus in this discussion. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 01:51, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The false pretense sentence in justified by the Phyllis Schlafly article and the worldnetdaily article. The section says "the false pretense of genocide". Milosevic was charged with the "murders of about 600 individually identified ethnic Albanians" <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1402790.stm#kosovo" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1402790.stm#kosovo" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. That isn't genocide, and a UN court has also shared in that viewpoint <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1530781.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1530781.stm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. This is contradictory to claims by both Clinton and his adminstration (the state department and Secretary of Defense William Cohen), whom claimed that the United States should intervene because of the genocide supposedly going on.</p>
<p>Also the article should be rewritten to seperate that part from the inflated numbers that the Clinton adminstration gave out.</p>
<p>And the article doesn't claim Clinton lied, it says "Some critics have accused Clinton of leading the United States to war with Kosovo under the false pretense of genocide."</p>
<p>So what exactly is your problem with the article, as it is now?</p>

<p>Uncited quotes are not very useful (re: Shlafly editorial in "The Moonie Times", the worldnetdaily editorial).</p>
<p>Anyway, how about this compromise:</p>
<p>1) change "have accused" and "false pretense of genocide" in the first sentence to something like: "Some critics have noted that Clinton was incorrect in his prewar assertions that genocide was occurring in Kosovo." If you're not trying to imply Clinton was lying, you should have no problem with that. The primary definition of <b>pretense</b> is, "<i>The act of pretending; a false appearance or action intended to deceive</i>.". "False pretense" is redundant and means "wrong and intentionally wrong".</p>
<p>2) provide citations in sentences 2 and 3 of Cohen and Clinton using the term genocide as a prewar assertion</p>
<p>3) remove sentence 4, as it is very likely Clinton is referring to the Milosevic who killed "all those tens of thousands" in Bosnia</p>
<p>4) remove the entire second paragraph.</p>
<p>I will then add a piece about Bosnia and insert it in the section chronologically before the Kosovo portion, then maybe add some minor qualifiers to the Kosovo portion for the sake of continuity. We should not pretend any event happens in an historical vacuum. We can then revisit the subject later. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 04:09, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The tens of thousands quote was in reference to Kosovo. Here's the context:</p>
<p>"Now, having said that, what the Serbian people decide to do, of course, if their own affair. But they're going to have to come to grips with what Mr. Milosevic ordered <b>in Kosovo</b>. They're just going to have to come to grips with it. And they're going to have to get out of denial. They're going to have to come to grips with it. And then they're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's okay that all those tens of thousands of people were killed, and all those hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their homes, and all those little girls were raped, and all those little boys were murdered. They're going to have to decide if they think that is okay.<a href="http://clinton6.nara.gov/1999/06/1999-06-25-press-conference-by-the-president.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://clinton6.nara.gov/1999/06/1999-06-25-press-conference-by-the-president.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> (emphasis mine)"</p>
<p>I'm doing an extensive (and heavily referenced) rewrite of the first paragraph and I'll post it when I'm done (which might be late tommorow morning because it's getting late). We can discuss the 2nd paragraph when the first is done with.</p>

<p>Ok, he seems to be referring to Kosovo, but he is NOT referring to a preparation/pretext/argument for war. He is referring to Milosevic's election. I don't believe that you can use it in an 'argument for war' section.</p>
<p>I feel that I am compromising too much, since the entire criticism is based on a few mentions of the word genocide. Much more often the term "ethnic cleansing" was used, and the rest of the sentence you cut from the article, all of which is verifiable, "and all those hundreds of thousands of people were run out of their homes, and all those little girls were raped, and all those little boys were murdered," describes <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_cleansing.html" title="Ethnic cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a> perfectly. Are the few uses of the word 'genocide' indicative of the case made by the Clinton administration, or were the much more frequent references to ethnic cleansing the pillar of the argument? I would say it was certainly the latter, but because he merely uttered the term genocide, proving my point would be a book-length endeavor. I had not addressed this up until now because I have been acting under the assumption, and increasingly so, that you are writing with a partisan agenda. In the rewrite you can demonstrate your objectivity in the matter by including the Big Picture.</p>
<p>We've already discussed the second paragraph to some degree. But we can rehash it if necessary. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 05:04, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now that the servers are updated I can post.</p>
<p>The "tens of thousands"quote is an inflated number example. Even after the war had ended he was still claiming "tens of thousands" were killed.</p>
<p>The administration and Clinton were claiming both ethnic cleansing and genocide. Ethnic cleansing was used more frequently because of the political implications the word "genocide" has (genocide is actually a form of ethnic cleansing <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ethnic+cleansing" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ethnic+cleansing" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>). They were both pillars of the argument (with the claim of genocide probably gave the adminstration more public backing). When <i>The New York Times</i> wrote an editorial asking for the country to go to war, they said, "Decisiveness and commitment are crucial now. If we let Mr. Milosevic complete his ethnic cleansing and genocide in Kosovo, it will be the greatest human catastrophe in Europe since World War II (Lewis, Anthony (Apr. 3, 1999). "Time To Get Serious". <i>The New York Times</i>, p. A15.)." <i>The Washington Post</i> followed the next day and didn't even mention ethnic clensing:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"We must do whatever is necessary to vindicate the authority of the international community and to stop the genocide. We can and should try to accomplish these objectives through the sustained and intensified use of air power. We must resist the instinct to find failure in the lack of an immediate dramatic result. At the same time, we should position strong, mobile forces in Macedonia and Albania to protect those fragile nations and to make it plain that no option has been foreclosed (Christopher, Warren (Apr. 4, 1999). "Whatever It Takes". <i>The Washington Post</i>, p. B07.)."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your assumption is false; someone can be nonpartisan and disagree with what Clinton did.</p>

<p>Here's the rewrite I did with the references at the bottom:</p>

Secretary of Defense William Cohen, giving a speech, said, "The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Cohen"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Cohen" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Cohen" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></sup></span>." On CBS' <i>Face the Nation</i> Cohen claimed, "We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing...They may have been murdered<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Doggett"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Doggett" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Doggett" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></sup></span>." Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of "at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clinton1"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Clinton1" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Clinton1" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></sup></span>". Later, talking about Serbian elections, Clinton said, "they're going to have to come to grips with what Mr. Milosevic ordered in Kosovo...They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed...<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clinton2"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Clinton2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Clinton2" rel="nofollow">[20]</a></sup></span>". Clinton also claimed, in the same press conference, that "NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clinton3"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Clinton3" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Clinton3" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></sup></span>." Clinton even compared the events of Kosovo to the Holocaust. CNN reported, "Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned President Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send U.S. forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_CNN"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_CNN" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_CNN" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></sup></span>." Clinton's State Department also claimed Serbian troops had committed genocide. <i>The New York Times</i> reported, "NATO bombers hunted for Serbian troops in embattled Kosovo today and the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Serbian forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest yet in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Clines"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Clines" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Clines" rel="nofollow">[23]</a></sup></span>." The State Department also gave highest estimate of dead Albanians. <i>The New York Times</i> reported, "On April 19, the State Department said that up to 500,000 Kosovar Albanians were missing and feared dead<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Erlanger"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Erlanger" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Erlanger" rel="nofollow">[24]</a></sup></span>." However, the numbers given by Clinton and his administration have been proven false. The official NATO body count of the events in Kosovo was 2,788 (not all of them were war crimes victims)<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Pilger"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Pilger" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Pilger" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></sup></span>, with Slobodan Milosevic charged with the "murders of about 600 individually identified ethnic Albanians<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_BBC"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_BBC" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_BBC" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></sup></span>". Critics have noted that these numbers can not be considered genocide. The headline of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, which had launched an investigation into whether genocide had occured in Kosovo, on December 31, 1999 was "War in Kosovo Was Cruel, Bitter, Savage; Genocide It Wasn’t"<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Pearl"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Pearl" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_Pearl" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></sup></span>. <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> wrote, "the U.N.'s International War Criminal tribunal has checked the largest reported sites first, and found most to contain no more than five bodies, suggesting intimate acts of barbarity rather than mass murder...Kosovo would be easier to investigate if it had the huge killing fields some investigators were led to expect.

A United Nations Court has previously ruled that Serbian troops did not commit genocide against Albanians. The court wrote "the exactions committed by Milosevic's regime cannot be qualified as criminal acts of genocide, since their purpose was not the destruction of the Albanian ethnic group<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_BBC2"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_BBC2" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_BBC2" rel="nofollow">[29]</a></sup></span>". According to BBC, "the decision was based on the 1948 Geneva convention which defines genocide as the intent 'to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group as such'<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_BBC3"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_BBC3" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Clinton_Archive_3_d9a7.html#endnote_BBC3" rel="nofollow">[30]</a></sup></span>".

<p>It's unfortunate that we could not come to a better compromise than this unwieldy monster paragraph. I applaud your thoroughness, but it's hard to see how the resulting length clarifies the issue.</p>
<p>Also, I still do not believe the opening sentence is supported by the evidence following. We have evidence supporting a mistaken notion and a rather extremist accusation of false pretenses, but no corroborating evidence of false pretenses. I still believe the "false pretenses" sentence should be removed. Otherwise, I suggest including the source's name (Joseph Farah) in the body of the paragraph, instead of the vague "some critics" as it is now. Even "Some critics, including Joseph Farah..." would be superior.</p>
<p>I am left wondering what the standards for inclusion of opinions are. If "online newspapers" with obvious, extreme political slants are acceptable, what about blogs? What about the online diaries of 12-year-olds regurgitating their parents' opinions? Drunken, incoherent rants? How about if I happen to post my opinion on a free weblog and 10 minutes later use it as a wikipedia citation? IMO, they are all as equally ridiculous as "worldnetdaily" and "The Washington Times" as sources.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned earlier, for the sake of clarity, but unfortunately adding to the section's length, I'll begin writing a paragraph criticising Clinton's policies in Bosnia. With full citations, of course.<a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 07:28, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">William Jefferson Blythe III or IV?!</span></h2>
<p>Wow, I never thought a solid fact as Clinton's birthname can have conflict, but:</p>
<p>His own autobiography, <i>My Life</i>, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"My mother named me <b>William Jefferson Blythe III</b> after my father, William Jefferson Blythe Jr., one of nine children of a poor farmer in Sherman, Texas, who died when my father was seventeen."</i> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375414576/ref=ed_sdp_bc_excerpt/102-5113621-9479362?vi=excerpt#excerpt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375414576/ref=ed_sdp_bc_excerpt/102-5113621-9479362?vi=excerpt#excerpt" rel="nofollow">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>clintonlibrary.gov supports this as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Bill Clinton was born <b>William Jefferson Blythe III</b> on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas, three months after his father died in an automobile accident."</i> <a href="http://www.clintonlibrary.gov/bios-WJC.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.clintonlibrary.gov/bios-WJC.html" rel="nofollow">[34]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, whitehouse.gov is adamant that it is IV (the Fourth):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"President Clinton was born <b>William Jefferson Blythe IV</b> on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas, three months after his father died in a traffic accident."</i> <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/bc42.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/bc42.html" rel="nofollow">[35]</a></p>

<dd>However, an old version from whitehouse.gov also states "<i>Bill Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III</i>" <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000304010058/www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20000304010058/www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> [AR]</dd>

<p>As is Britannica:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"byname of William Jefferson Clinton , original name <b>William Jefferson Blythe IV</b> 42nd president of the United States (1993–2001), who oversaw the country's longest peacetime economic expansion."</i> <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9003019&amp;query=Bill%20Clinton&amp;ct=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9003019&amp;query=Bill%20Clinton&amp;ct=" rel="nofollow">[37]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>"Bill Clinton was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas. His given name was <b>William Jefferson Blythe IV</b>.

<dd>Suggestion: we stick with one version for now (I'd personally go with III), and somebody writes a mail to Clinton (or rather, his office), asking for clarification. As long as we don't have an answer from them, we add a comment into the article text (HTML comment, invisible to readers) that says that this bit is under dispute, and the current version should remain until we have better evidence, and direct people to the talk page. As soon as we have the answer, that should not be a matter of controvercy any more, although it might be wise to keep a note in the article text. -- <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexR_6c46.html" title="User:AlexR">AlexR</a> 10:24, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Obvious bias (Economy etc.)</span></h2>
<p>Bigdavediode here -- I have corrected a factual error at the end of the article. Bill Clinton was not disbarred from the US Supreme Court Bar as stated. That was false. You can see that he was suspended, and rather than contest it he resigned from the bar here: <a href="http://conlaw.usatoday.findlaw.com/supreme_court/orders/2001/111301pzor.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://conlaw.usatoday.findlaw.com/supreme_court/orders/2001/111301pzor.html" rel="nofollow">[41]</a></p>
<p>Additionally I have noticed a couple of other errors of fact that need to be changed. One is regarding the White House budgets in 1995. I will return to fix these later.</p>
<hr />
<p>'He was elected twice with the highest percentage of the popular vote among his opponents (but never with a general majority). Characteristics of the period he presided as President included an economic boom not paralleled since the "Roaring 20s", the most successful war in terms of American causalities during the Kosovo Conflict, inheriting the largest American budget deficit in history from his predecessor President George H. W. Bush and turning it into the largest surplus by the end of his office.'</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but this is a total joke. Nice job not even adjusting deficits for inflation, much less size of the economy and population growth.</p>
<p>As for largest surplus, the national debt didn't even go down.</p>
<p>The growth rate during Clinton's first term was 2.7 percent, half a percent below the 3.2 percent growth rate under Reagan and a full percentage point below the 3.8 percent growth rate during the 1983-89 expansion.</p>
<p>I don't have the numbers for his second term, but the NASDAQ lost half its value during Clinton's last 9 months in office.</p>
<p>Since there are only four years left that could be considered so wonderful, and one of which saw massive losses in the stock market, characterizing the period he presided over as "not paralleled since the 'Roaring 20s'" is a little, um, out there. (WikiAce)</p>

<dd>As for encarta, nothing there contradicts this article. This is the gist of their section on Clinton's economy:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the end, Clinton’s most significant achievement as president was eliminating the federal budget deficit. When he left office, the nation was running a surplus instead of a deficit. Clinton claimed the lower interest rates that came from reducing the deficit and the low inflation produced by free trade amounted to a tax cut of hundreds of billions of dollars for Americans. His economic policies helped produce the longest period of sustained economic growth in the nation’s history."</p>

<p>The best real growth rate under Clinton was 4.5%. We had 4.4% growth in 2004.</p>
<p>Clinton growth rate is 4.1% counting 1993-2000. That does not even touch the 4.9% growth of 1961-1968. So this biggest boom since the 1920s stuff is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Real debt doubled under Reagan, it did not quadruple. Again, nice job not adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p>NASDAQ Mar-2000 (all-time high): 5,132.52 NASDAQ Jan-2001 (Clinton leaves office): 2,770.42</p>
<p>NASDAQ lost half its value. If you're going to mention a boom (which I agree the LATE '90s were, but by no means the biggest since the 1920s), you should also mention the crash.</p>
<p>The "largest deficit" stuff is a Perot-esque lie. It doesn't adjust for inflation and size of the economy. The real way to measure deficits is as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p>Back to the surplus talk... This is from the Bureau of the public debt; since we're not adjusting for inflation, what year did it go down?</p>

<p>I am confused. What part of the introduction is incorrect? There is nothing that states the national debt came down. Budget surplus and national debt are two seperate economic factors. <a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.41.186.237.html" title="User:67.41.186.237">67.41.186.237</a> 17:45, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>My point is that it uses nominal numbers, which is extremely misleading. This is the same kind of crap the GOP used during the campaign to say that Kerry voted for the largest tax increase in American history: the <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1993_de9a.html" title="Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993">Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993</a>. Even just adjusting for inflation will show you that's not true in this case, but the best measure would be size of the economy, or percentage of GDP.</p>
<p>Also, growth in the late '90s was nothing compared to the growth in the mid-60s, so "largest boom since the Roaring 20s" should be scrapped. Really, unless you can identify that a large majority of economic indicators were greater in real terms in the '90s than in the '80s, '60s, and '50s, you should not try to compare it, as that is open for economists to debate, but rather just identify it as an economic boom in his second term.</p>
<p>Something like "an economic boom in his second term" and "a budget surplus for the first time since the '60s" (rather than LARGEST surplus, which is ridiculous) would be much better descriptions. WikiAce 18:52, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>WikiAce, rather than compare apples and oranges, I suggest you write an part about national debt. Good luck with the 'adjustment for inflation' thing. What inflation rate will you use to adjust a budget surplus? The 2.5% of the Clinton admin or the 4.7% of the previous administration? <a href="http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/Accomplishments/eightyears-03.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://clinton5.nara.gov/WH/Accomplishments/eightyears-03.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> It would have to take into account the inflation rate previous to Clinton's taking office, but how much previous? Besides, the whole concept is confounded; the budget surplus or deficit and other economic factors influenced by the executive office are highly correlated to the inflation rate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ironically, your comment about a 'bust' in the nasdaq following the boom would EXACTLY parallel the 1920s. But I think that level of comparison would fall apart upon closer inspection. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 19:09, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The 'adjustment for inflation' 'thing' is the most fundamental concept to any economic analysis. <a href="http://minneapolisfed.org/Research/data/us/calc/index.cfm" class="external free" title="http://minneapolisfed.org/Research/data/us/calc/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://minneapolisfed.org/Research/data/us/calc/index.cfm</a></p>
<p>The "largest deficit" is in nominal numbers. The "largest surplus" is in nominal numbers. Really, even adjusting for inflation is not enough, because of population growth; far more relevant is percentage of GDP. The 'unparalleled' economic boom is just an opinion. Far better to say 'massive stock market rally' and 'sizeable real GDP growth.'</p>
<p>An example of comparing apples to oranges would be saying the early '90s budget deficits were greater than the World War II deficits, which is of course, I'm sure you're aware, absurd. WikiAce 19:55, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a huge can of worms. You're suggesting using the Consumer Price Index as the sole indicator of value in comparing gov’t projected surpluses in dollar amounts across decades. There are myriad problems with this. For one, it insists that projected surpluses be translated into real dollars, or (I'm assuming) be rendered meaningless. But that's a false choice scenario.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The change in a given period of time in the number of apples bought for a dollar is different from the change in the same given period of time in the number of oranges bought for a dollar. (Let's not even get into fruit imported from your local banana republic!) You may be able to overlook that for a consumer, but governments are different. Gov't spending is not directly affected by consumer prices, unless the money is given back in the form of refunds, since gov'ts don't usually "buy" things in the sense that consumers do. But even if government spending were comparable to consumer spending, that does not mean that a budget surplus would be so comparable. For example, GDP may in fact increase as a result of a budget surplus, thereby reducing the ratio because of its own success. So the surplus as percent of the GDP is confounded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, if you’re going to go through with the adjustment to a budget surplus, then you also have to add the adjusted value of the deficit inherited from the previous administration, both adjusted for inflation. But now we’re talking relative numbers since neither number was produced in a vacuum… So what inflation rate do we use? IOW, the amount ‘in the hole’ added to the height of the hill. This would mitigate the size of the Reagan/Bush I deficits, but increase the Clinton surplus and Bush II deficit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, this all seems like a huge digression (even adjusted for inflation) just to tweak one word ("largest") that is not literally untrue. I don't think your claim of “obvious bias” is supported by your argument… even if it was not “the largest American budget deficit in history”. <a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 22:25, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, why is everyone arguing over a president and his supposed magical control over how the economy is transfigured. The only thing the President is supposed to do is make sure there is no corruption in it and allow for it to grow unabated. That might have some minor effect but it's private industry that leads the way here last time I checked the stock market quotes. I think Clinton failed here because of the massive corruption of it at the end of his term. There was a massive stock market boom because of <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a>. You can't attribute a 10,000 market from a 2,000 market in 8 years to one man. I don't think anyone would accept that honer alone. If anything we should probably be praising Bill Gates and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel.html" title="Intel">Intel</a> here. It's POV on the front page to say that Bush somehow hindered the economy with no facts to back that statement up. Especially when it was going back to normal at the end of his term and it would of sky-rocketed with Bush or Clinton at the helm. Silicon Valley should take credit here. Stop playing favorites everyone and look at the BIG picture. It's wrong not to let people know that there was a gient tech boom in the 90's because of the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentium.html" title="Pentium">Pentium</a> processor, <a href="../../../c/e/l/Cell_phone.html" title="Cell phone">cell phones</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadband.html" title="Broadband">Broadband</a> technology.</dd>

<p>The fact is, I was accused of vandalism on Clinton, because I pointed out that the prosperity quickly came to an end with the collapse of the stock market, just like in the 1920s. I've seen people say pretty nasty things about Clinton, but the bubble stock market on his watch is pretty much a fact that is beyond any dispute. --Gdr1998</p>

You did not, as you say, simply point out that the economy resembled the 1920's (It didn't by the way, economics is a little more complicated then Economy Goes Up, Economy Comes Down) and the crash of 1929 (clearly comparable to the Internet and manufacturing bubbles bursting). You put silly qualifier quotes around "prosperity" and inserted a nonsense description that had nothing to do with the article.

<p>I think the article should emphasize Paula Jones over Monica Lewinski (or maybe a separate more neutral 'Clinton impeachment' page) because it was that case in which purjery was commited not some sex affair. I don't think it's good to talk about a sex affair on the top of a President wikipage with a link to explicit sex scenerios. The sex doesn't matter it's that it was lied about during a rape trial. He was impeached because he commited purjery and obstructed justice. He was not impeached because he was having fun gettinng laid. That's just a ploy to make people think that the mean old Republicans don't want people to 'have a good time.'</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Moderate? More like Liberal</span></h2>
<p>Palllllease. Let's not cast him in this 'All things to all people' light; while that was the image portrayed often through a Spin city like atmosphere and seemingly endless promises and rhetoric most of his policies were very Liberal if not Radical and were never passed. I can't see a serious argument against this. It was another Political winger type candidate who failed to bridge the gap of bipartisanship when the country needed moderation most. At the end the gap was wider then ever. I also fault the Republicans for nominating <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dole_1dcc.html" title="Bob Dole">Bob Dole</a> because he was very much on the right. Although Bush might be a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">conservative</a> he has passes allot of bills most recently using <a href="../../../m/o/d/Moderate.html" title="Moderate">moderate</a> techniques.</p>
<p>Examples of Liberalism:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_health_care.html" title="Universal health care">Universal health care</a></li>
<li>High taxes on the upper middle class and rich</li>
<li>Unfettered <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affirmative_action.html" title="Affirmative action">Affirmative action</a></li>
<li>Late Term Abortion</li>
<li>Small Military</li>
<li>Little to no Internet <a href="../../../p/o/r/Pornography.html" title="Pornography">Pornography</a> regulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have modified 'Moderate' to 'Liberal' with some extra MAJOR liberal policies like <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_healthcare.html" title="Universal healthcare">Universal healthcare</a>, which is extrmeley radical if not communist (although it ould be nice if someday money didn't exist which I think might happen with tech, maybe), in the beginning, where it said he was a moderate, which I think is fare.</p>
<hr />
<pre>
  "......if not communist....."
</pre>
<p>I would just like to say that Communists were a political party that advocated Stalinist/Lenninist/Marxist/etc SOCIALISM. So, I think you would probably want to replace "Communist" with "Socialist". Furthermore, of the Western, Industrialized, 1st World Nations (G7) who are considered to be "Capitolist", the USA is the only one without some form of Nationalized Health Care, thus comparing "Universal Healthcare" to "Communism" is a bit misleading, seeing that just because the former Communist governments of the USSR and the ones of Eastern Europe all had "Universal Healthcare" does not mean that Canada, Japan, and Germany (FR) are also Communist, they are very much Demacratic/Capitolistic Republics to a greater extent.</p>

<dd>And it's been changed back. Liberal? Perhaps only to the folks far on the right. Clinton was (and is) a moderate; your examples aren't necessarily true. For example, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communications_Decency_Act_d18c.html" title="Communications Decency Act">Communications Decency Act</a> was passed during his presidency (and overturned by the courts); a liberal would have vetoed it. No Liberal would have tolerated the "Don't Ask Don't Tell" nonsense or the rollback of the welfare system. I don't know if Clinton ever said or did anything regarding late term abortion.

<p>All of the things listed in the article are liberal: education, free trade, handgun, environment. Why did you delete [Universal healthcare]? That was the major point of the administraion. Your're <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>. Your're most likley a radical and see these things as moderate.

<p>He signed the "Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act." which was part of the Conservative's "Contract with America" but is unpopular with socialists and unwed mothers. That's still not enough fuel to make him a moderate. I'm a moderate and I know. <a href="http://dailybeacon.utk.edu/issues/v66/n6/welfare.6o.html" class="external free" title="http://dailybeacon.utk.edu/issues/v66/n6/welfare.6o.html" rel="nofollow">http://dailybeacon.utk.edu/issues/v66/n6/welfare.6o.html</a> <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0225-11.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0225-11.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0225-11.htm</a></p>
<p>He passed the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communications_Decency_Act_d18c.html" title="Communications Decency Act">Communications Decency Act</a> which was struck down by the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_court.html" title="Supreme court">Supreme court</a>. This act was way to extreme and just a pamper, not enough. That's not getting allot done to protect people violated by pornagraphy. Example: Not to promote Bush but he has found minor ways to restrict child pornaography and Internet Porn. Also putting porn into the xxx domain probably is a real good thing. Also the FCC has restricted allot of radio and T.V. pronography that got seriously out of hand during the Clinton administration. I agree that a liberal wouldn't want that Communications Act but I think liberals can agree that most of the policies I listed are for the better.</p>
<p>Clinton vetoed late term abortion bans <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/07/23/lateterm.abortion/" class="external free" title="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/07/23/lateterm.abortion/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/07/23/lateterm.abortion/</a></p>
<p>Also, no moderate nor conservative tolerated "<a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_ask_don%27t_tell.html" title="Don't ask don't tell">Don't ask don't tell</a>" either because it was another illogical 'do nothing' policy to temporally please his liberal constituents; and mod/conservs were the ones that talked about that most on the radio. I think I remember liberal talk shows laughing it off but not condemning it like the conservatives. The liberals laughed it off because it fit there agenda of Gays in the military. I admit that Clinton didn't get allot done of what the liberals wanted and maybe that's why you're casting him into a moderate. But then I would call him a Swing candidate because moderates solve issues on both sides of the fence. I do admit that it is hard to tell where he was on most issues anyway because he seemed to want to please everyone, but mostly he took advantage of radical ideas on the liberal spectrum. To put 'moderate' you might as well put Bush as a moderate because he has done allot more for the Liberals then Clinton did for thew Conservatives.</p>

<li>Well, I disagree -- and it would seem others do too, since other people (not me, I've not touched any of your edits) have consistantly reverted your "liberal" characterization.

<p>In my opinion, Bill Clinton is a liberal. However, the word "liberal", "moderate", and "conservative" are quite subjective, e.g. to a far-left Marxist Bill Clinton would be seen as a conservative. Due to the labels being so subjective they should be removed or both should be included and be phrased differently. "Some see Clinton as a liberal while other view his postiion as being a moderate." --<a href="../../../n/y/r/User%7ENyr14_4000.html" title="User:Nyr14">Nyr14</a> July 7, 2005 19:00 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good point. Perhaps "Within the Democratic Party, Clinton is generally considered a moderate -- in fact, the DLC was formed specifically to overcome the 'liberal' label which had turned into a pejorative during the Reagan and Bush administrations. By many measures, he was the most conservative Democratic president of the 20th century.". Or something like that. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There can't be POV. Most of the stuff he did was Liberal. A liberal and not a centrist would want Universal Healthcare with heavy taxes on the rich and upper middle class and shtinkiing the militarty down to nothing. These were the two MAJOR points of the administration not the stuff listed. I find it very protective to list education and handgun stuff over Universal Healthcare and shrinking the military a great deal when those were the major points of the admin. I sense a large POV bias with that. Put in Universal Healthcare and small military and I don't care if you leave it centrist.</p>

<p>I changed "political moderate" to "political centrist," because I think it is biased to label one political ideology as more moderate than another.</p>
<p>Some people consider liberalism to be more moderate, for instance, while others consider liberalism a form of radicalism.</p>
<p>Radicalism is basically a dirty word in politics, and ergo calling someone a moderate is a way of passing judgment on them.</p>
<p>I'd rather just stay out of that type of argument for the sake of Wikipedia's non-bias policy - I think 99% of people can agree that Clinton was a "centrist".</p>
<p><i>Response:</i> I doubt that the percentage is that high, but it is probably as objective a statement as is possible under the circumstances, as evidenced by attacks on Clinton from both "left" and "right." However, given that, it probably should be pointed out that "moderate" is generally understood as a synonym for "centrist." --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidnite_Critic_8517.html" title="User:Midnite Critic">Midnite Critic</a> 05:19, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The suggestion that 99% of people think Clinton is centrist (or moderate) is absurd and POV bias. About 1/2 of America (the conservative half) thinks Clinton is a liberal. The other half (the liberal half) says he is a centrist. We now know what side you stand on.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton is definantly not a Centrist, being one myself. Bill Clinton's a moderate liberal. Calling Clinton a Centrist is as offensive to most Centrists as it'd be calling George W Bush a Centrist.</p>
<p>It should be changed to moderate liberal, or just plain liberal, which's what he was/is.</p>
<dl>
<dd>And calling him a liberal is offensive to most liberals (not that I'm one). In my opinion, he is best described as a pragmatic centrist, as his famous political stretegy of "triangulation" attests. Look at the top hit in the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=triangulation+clinton&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=triangulation+clinton&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for triangulation &amp; clinton. I quote "Remember 'triangulation' - Clinton's strategy of positioning himself between the much-hated Democrats in Congress and the much-hated Republicans in Congress? It was how he got re-elected. You didn't have to like Clinton, so long as you disliked him less than the other choices. The triangle put him in the middle." That sounds pretty much like a centrist to me. But, as that word offends the anon editor above who claims to be a centrist, let's call him a communist. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 16:18, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>His methodolgy was definitely 'centrist', which is basically synonymous with 'moderate' in the political environment of the last 25 years. Perhaps the two terms were divergent back when 'conservative' meant a "hands-off" approach to government, but have converged since that term became a different kind of activism.</p>
<p>Clinton and the DLC's approach to elections was coalition-building and capturing the center, as opposed, for example, to Bush II's approaching of appealing to the his conservative base. Presidential candidates are stuck emphasizing one approach or the other while limiting damage on the flanks.</p>
<p>Clinton's governing style reflected, of course, the Democratic Party's agenda. However, we can tell his centrist stance if only because both sides found something to dislike him for. There were almost as many anti-Clinton rants from the Left as there were from the Right. Someone said free trade was a liberal issue. Think about Clinton signing NAFTA. The unions are still furious at him over that. There was true despair on the Left that American politics had failed because even a Democratic president was just a Republican in sheep's clothing. Hence, the Nader vote in 2000. Other examples of Clinton's centrist/moderate politics/policy have been offered and I agree.<a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaysayer_2e61.html" title="User:Naysayer">Naysayer</a> 16:48, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Who from the left ranted about Clinton? Who? Please name names. I never saw it. The unions? Give me a break. No president enjoyed more support from the unions than Clinton. And if opposition to NAFTA is a liberal litmus test, then Pat Buchanon is King of the Liberals. G.W. Bush is for an open border with Mexico. Does that make him a moderate? His dad, G.H.W. Bush, gave us a massive tax increase. Is Bush the elder a moderate? I suggest that a better indication of a President's politics is to look at his appointments.

(e) the <i>single</i> most famous thing about clinton's political strategy was so-called <i>triangulation</i>. he was not an ideologue; he was a pragmatist. he went for the center. compare &amp; contrast to g.w. bush, who makes it a point of pride never to compromise. now that's an ideologue, that's a conservative. clinton is hardly the democratic equivalent of bush. more like the equivalent of an arlen specter. .... trivia - who first proposed a universal health care plan? that old liberal rascal richard nixon. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 03:44, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to know that, too. I agree that both parties are generally fiscally liberal, but I doubt that any of us label people as liberals and conservatives solely because of fiscal policy (especially since both parties are nearly identical on that front. Also, have you thought about the fact that liberal and conservative are (apparently) relative terms? A "conservative" in San Francisco or the EU is what you'd probably call a centrist or moderate liberal. Since views vary so much (from place to place in the U.S., even) on where the left and right markers exist on this oversimplified political spectrum, maybe it would be more fair to just explain where Clinton stood in objective terms (for this, against this, etc.). -216</dd>

In fact, many of these quotes have taken on a life of their own, being the subject of Saturday Night Live skits and referred to extensively. Many of these quotes are known by the general public, and this is so far more than any other public figure. Wiki should address these quotes. The only question is whether to include it in on a separate quote page. Based on the arguments made at <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a>, many believe that such quotes are appropriate for the main article. Thus it is important to find consistency in discussing related issues across related pages. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 22:38, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't have issues with a few quote, however I think we should limit the scope and number of quotes, for example I don't think we need 24 quotes nor quotes like ":18. You'd think he was running for First Lady.", I think we should limit the quotes sections to quotes that are directly relevant to either the rest of the article or to major events in his career. BTW, one must appreciate the irony of using something from <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> as a reasoning behind a decision for <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> :) <a href="../../../j/t/k/User%7EJtkiefer_5ea4.html" title="User:Jtkiefer">Jtkiefer</a> 22:47, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been making arguments, but you seem to be "willfully deaf, dumb, and blind" to them. Case in point, I point out that your problem with the inclusion of quotes is not the number of quotes but rather that the sheer inclusion of which constitutes POV. You then, in turn, focus upon the "idiot" portion and ignore the actual argument, citing there is no argument. So I withdraw and apologize for saying "idiot."

<li>I couldn't care less what's happening over at the Ann Coulter article. Has no bearing on this article. Certainly, inclusion of quotes is not, per se, POV; the act is entirely neutral. However, the selection of quotes can be POV; in my opinion, Noitall selected quotes to make Clinton look bad. Now, if this were an article entitled List of Bill Clinton quotes that people mock or poke fun at, it would be proper to include that list. (See <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushisms.html" title="Bushisms">Bushisms</a> for a quotation-less article on the subject.) <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 23:27, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, the quotes were derived from neutral sources that compiled them. There are a lot of them.

And anyone else is free to add their favorite quotes. I did not make this an exclusive list. If you think these quotes are selective to make it POV, feel free to add your favorites. On this page, it seems like <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> and I are in agreement, right? --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 23:47, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

At any rate, your entire inclusion was for the purpose of making a point; as such, it was rightfully deleted; if someone else wants to introduce an NPOV collection of Clinton quotes to the already too long article, they're welcome to, and then we'll see what the consensus is regarding whether to keep them in the article or not. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 00:14, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What is the consistent fear of Wikiquote? Why isn't that enough for you people? My position is that there is a Wikiquote for a reason; the only quotes that should appear on an article are maybe those for lesser known but well-quoted individuals in order to provide more information about them or their speaking style (not applicable here) or a few choice quotes of massive historical significance, i.e. "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky", a statement that touched off a year long political explosion in America. Something like the "Is is" quote is too small and unimportant to be placed on, as Jpgordon pointed out so correctly, an incredibly long page. Finally, beyond the simple question of quotes, this edit is ugly, completely inconsistent with WikiStyle, horribly POV and clearly designed to pick a fight. Noitall needs to knock it off in my humble opinion. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrza_f8cc.html" title="User:TheGrza">The</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheGrza_ecac.html" title="User talk:TheGrza"><font color="green">Grza</font></a> 03:04, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>POV is POV. If the same issue is POV on one page, it is POV on another. If Wiki policy is to put quotes on Wikiquote, then you should not just be making this selective argument on your favorite page. After all, that is what this is about. I want consistency and NPOV on every page, not just on my "favorite" page. If there is no NPOV, there is no "knocking it off." --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 03:13, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't understand what you are talking about. What is the inconsistency with placing a few quotes (Using a "consistent" WikiStyle, by the way) of major importance on this page and taking the minor and unattributed quotes to Wikiquote where they already exist, not only in a better format, but with context and citation. And what are you speaking about "favorite" pages? I'm not clear on any of what you just said. This isn't my favorite page, this isn't even a page I'm particularly interested in. I want to keep your attempt to "make a point" (NOT WHAT WIKIPEDIA IS USED FOR! AAAARGH!) out of this article. I agree with the points laid out on the Coulter page, as I do for this one. You insisting on violating your own suggestions for policy for no other reason then some completely juvenile attempt to create a mess and be annoying.

But my more important point is NPOV, which is what Wiki is for. I do not understand your statement, "I agree with the points laid out on the Coulter page." You are either being consistent with your argument here by insisting that quotes go to a Wikiquote page, or you are being inconsistent. I can't figure out from your statement which position you have adopted. Instead of focusing on any objection you have to me, however, it might be more useful, if you quit focusing on people and focused on proper editing and consistent policies. --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 03:38, July 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One of the central arguments of why a quote section should receive different treatment on an article like Bill Clinton and that of Ann Coulter, is that Bill Clinton is known primarily for being the president, and thus his article focuses upon his actions as president. Ann Coulter is <i>known for her polemic writing style, of which quotations show evidence.</i> The quote list you want on Bill Clinton would be much more appropriate on pages like Al Franken, Jim Hightower, Rush Limbaugh, and such, both liberal and conservative pundits. As for "It might be more useful, if you quit focusing on people and focused on proper editing and consistent policies..."

<dd>Yeah but of the information we know overall about Clinton, his quotatations make up far less importance then, lets say, legislation he enacted, military actions, presidential campaigns, which is enough to fill several books. For Ann Coulter and the rest of the partisan pundits, all you really can say about them is what they have said before. Regardless, I am not opposed to having a certain amount of quotes on this page, just a little bit less than what's on Coulter's page due to the wealth of information on Clinton and that an attempt, like on Coulter's page of that I have asked about a million times for people to supply balancing quotes, to balance out the quotes is made. It's really not crazy to assume we treat an article on a U.S. president and on some right-wing nutjob commentator differently. If we only stooped to your distinction of "known for", this article would be the size of several books. That's why, for the amount of information's sake, we say "known primarily for", unless you are truly arguing both that there is no hierarchy of important information to include and no threshold to exclude information at the bottom of this hierarchy. I wonder why you didn't choose George W. Bush to <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPoint_d154.html" title="WP:Point">make your point</a>, as he is far more quotable then Clinton.

<p>What acomplishment? FYI there was no surplus...only a projected surplus... it was a surplus on paper... when the dotcom bubble burst the projected revenues didn't happen and we went into a recession. Also it wasn't just an affair it was pointing his wicked finger into the camera and proclaiming to the world..."I have never had sexual relations with that woman... Ms. Lewinsky." Clinton never had to face a crisis like 9-11.--Tlotz</p>

<p>(althought the death toll in any one of these circumstances is less than that of 9/11 deaths, it is my opinion that either of the first two (if not the third) can be considered as "Major Crises".

<dd>No, but respectively they said Bush was trying to justify invading Iraq by fixing policy around the facts, that Bush was planning to blame Iraq before we even had a plan for invading Afghanistan, and that Bush had talked about going into Iraq long before 9/11. You can come to an indeterminate amount of conclusions based upon the quantity of evidence the CIA has, and if you cherry-pick to support your claim, as Bush did, you can basically make it say anything.</dd>

You wrote, "Of the 1,018 respondents, 47% identified as being a Clinton supporter)" A supporter? Which supporter was it? James Carville? Paul Begala? You need agreement. If it's respondents, it needs to be supporters. If it's respondent, it's supporter.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Majority vote</span></h2>
<p>Agiantman: Why do you think that it is not essential in understanding Clinton never received a majority of the vote to mention that there was a significant third party candidate? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 04:06, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is a potential "significant" third party candidate in every presidential election. John Anderson was a stronger candidate in 1980, but it didn't stop Reagan from attaining a majority. Also, Perot was a conservative who siphoned votes away from Bush, not Clinton. Face it: the love of your life, Bill Clinton, couldn't get 50% in both of his elections. Stop making excuses. --<a href="../../../a/g/i/User%7EAgiantman_8e43.html" title="User:Agiantman">Agiantman</a> 04:38, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure how you figure that Anderson was a stronger candidate in 1980. Anderson received 5,720,437 votes <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/U.S.-presidential-election,-1980" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/U.S.-presidential-election,-1980" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>, whereas Ross Perot received 19,741,065 votes <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/U.S.-presidential-election,-1992" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/U.S.-presidential-election,-1992" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> and 8,085,402 votes <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/U.S.-presidential-election,-1996" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/U.S.-presidential-election,-1996" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> in the 1992 and 1996 elections, of which the '92 election was over 3 times the amount of Anderson.</dd>

<p>The strength of one's candidacy is relative to one's opponent. A weak 3rd party candidate like Perot received a higher percentage &amp; vote total than Anderson because of weaker opponents. Remember, Perot withdrew from the race because he claimed Republicans had doctored a photo to make his daughter look like a lesbian. LOL! BTW, I got a kick out of your claim that describing Bill Clinton as "the love of your life" is a personal attack. LMAO! --<a href="../../../a/g/i/User%7EAgiantman_8e43.html" title="User:Agiantman">Agiantman</a> 05:22, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Glad I could be of entertainment :) In case you have some confusion as to why that was a personal attack, you have, in calling Bill Clinton "the love of my life":
<ul>
<li>Assumed bias on my part before assuming good faith.</li>
<li>Implied negative connotations through "love of my life", possibly indicative of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobia.html" title="Homophobia">homophobia</a>.</li>
<li>A paradigm of an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">Ad hominem</a> logical fallacy, in which you address my personal character rather than the merits of my argument.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No problem, sometimes its hard to catch all personal attacks, so no hard feelings.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For your claim that "the strength of one's candidacy is relative to one's opponent," I still don't follow how Anderson who gets less than one-third the votes of Ross Perot is somehow a stronger opponent. What defines strength of an opponent if not popular support then? How is Anderson stronger than Perot if he received relatively a minor amount of votes? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 05:37, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know you are too young to remember John Anderson's candidacy. Let me make this simple. If John Anderson ran instead of Ross Perot in 1992, he would have received more votes because he would have been a better (read:stronger) candidate. Perot was merely a nut who withdrew from the race and just siphoned off Republicans who couldn't bring themselves to vote for Bush the Dad.

<dl>
<dd>What I now understand is that your basis that Anderson is a stronger candidate than Perot is based upon pure unjustified (in our discussions, at least) speculation. Consequently, I guess we will simply have to agree to disagree in our interpretations. My opinion is that the enormous discrepancy between Perot's vote count and that of Anderson's (18 million to 5 million votes) is a significant detractor for those who believe as you do. But like you say, I was "too young to remember." On a side note, it's interesting that throughout our conversations, you have at some point brought up my youth in almost every discussion.--<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 05:56, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV notice</span></h2>
<p>Disclaimer: I have been editing Wikipedia since about August of last year, and this is the first NPOV notice I have ever placed.</p>
<p>After taking a look through this article, I have a big problem with much of the content. I'd say about 80% of all the sentences on this page are negative towards Clinton, and every single passage concludes with how Clinton failed something or caused controversy about this.</p>
<p>Now, I have no problem with reporting these things, but I'm really getting sick of the "Critics have claimed..." and "Detractors have said..." What critics? What detractors? Cite everything! I don't want to censor any of the info here, but it needs to be balanced out with the rest of the article. No matter how much certain editors on this page absolutely despite this man, this doesn't mean that Clinton didn't do one thing right in his entire 8 years of service. And if you think he did, then at least cite rather than getting lazy by simply saying "critics say." Also, there needs to be a discussion as to what we should be focusing upon in this article, as there are many articles covering incidental events that are merely put in here for purposes of making Clinton look bad. But for now, this article isn't that long, so I think that for now, the answer is to simply insert more (sourced) info that balances out with things that Clinton actually did right. I'd just be happy if those who hate Clinton on this page could replace "Some critics say" with actual links to actual notable critics. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 08:43, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for displaying your true colors for all to see! Not a Clinton-lover? LOL! If there are indeed sections that say "critics say," but you doubt there are critics, then let's investigate.

<p>Can we quote each of these reasons, or cite any prominent economists, as this passage seems to be based upon editor speculation at this point, <i>especially attributing this boom to Ronald Reagan's heavy deficit spending.</i> At first glance, it seems ridiculous to attribute the economic boom of Clinton to a president 4 years out of office before Clinton ever stepped foot inside the White House.

<p>"Despite criticisms that his appeal to young voters lacked substance" (this is clearly negative criticism) "Clinton won among Generation X voters in the 1992 election, with the highest Gen-X turnout ever" (this is either verifiably true or not true) "Until his inauguration as president, he had earned substantially less money than his wife, and had the smallest net worth of any president in modern history, according to My Life, Clinton's autobiography." (either verifiably true or not true, and plenty of people would consider this a POSITIVE aspect of Clinton's life) "Clinton avoided the draft with a student deferment while studying abroad during the Vietnam War." (negative? This is either true or not, and whether it's "negative" or not is a matter of how the reader fits this fact into his worldview) "lthough he was actually to the right of previous Democratic candidates for the presidency on many issues — he supported the death penalty, curfews, uniforms in public schools, and other measures opposed by youth rights supporters, and he expanded the War on Drugs greatly while in office —" (why is this all negative? He either supported these things or didn't, it's neither negative or positive, it's either true or not true, and the reader can determine how this colors his opinion of President Clinton) "Clinton's actions during the 1960s were never forgotten by his opponents." (harder to verify, but how is this negative? It could just as easily demonstrate that his opponents are petty grudge-holders) "Starting from 1992 Presidential election campaign, rumors about Clinton's adultery were floating about, and these surfaced and increased with Paula Jones' accusations of sexual harassment." (This actually happened and President Clinton verified it, should it be excluded because it's not flattering?) "Clinton was viewed with intense personal dislike of his policies and character by some on the far right." (this is only "negative" if you respect the opinions of the far right. Many people would consider this one of Clinton's accolades) "Several lurid accusations were leveled by conservative talk radio." (again, this either happened or didn't happen, and whether it's negative or positive is a matter of the viewer's opinion, not the veracity of the statement)</p>
<p>It's a peculiar phenomenon that one man's objective truth is another man's biased opinion. Much of what you cited can be easily verified as being either true or not true, or purely speculation or opinion. The stuff that can be shown to be true or not true ought to be included in an encyclopedic entry. And if you can find more stuff that rings as "positive" in your ears to add to it, by all means, do so. But much of what you cited as "negative" indictments of Clinton didn't sound negative to me at all. Most of the criticism was centered around charactarizations of the "hostile far right," and unless the reader respects those people's opinions, I don't think mentioning their sentiments is necessarily a "negative" for President Clinton. Now, if you wish to include praise that has been offered up to President Clinton, I'd suggest only that the source be quoted as well, even if in somewhat slanted and ambiguous terms like, "the far right." - I don't have a user name, sorry.</p>

<dd>I agree with you, and I wasn't inferring that any of this is untrue. Mainly, we have a vast amount of objective truths we can draw from like an artist draws from a palette of colors, but what actually goes into the painting is a delicate balance of these colors. We have a vast amount of things, both positive and negative that we can say about Bill Clinton's image, as he was both loved and hated, leaving under a scandal but with the highest approval rating of any exiting president. It is current selection of mostly negative facts of a president who left with this highest approval rating that I am opposed to. Given no size constraints, I agree that information should be added rather than removed to achieve this balance, however if this page gets too large, then we should think about selecting and balancing what truths should be included. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a> 22:15, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As a certain editor (<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizzle_7463.html" title="User:Kizzle">kizzle</a>) earlier stated on this talk page, "I have asked about a million times for people to supply balancing quotes, to balance out the quotes is made. It's really not crazy to assume we treat an article on a U.S. president and on some right-wing nutjob commentator differently." In addressing the supposed POV-ness of having pro and and critical statements, and the argument that there are not enough "pro" statements and too many "anti" statements, the solution, to paraphrase that earlier editor, "I have asked about a million times for people to supply balancing statements, to balance out the statements made." --<a href="../../../n/o/i/User%7ENoitall_1dc1.html" title="User:Noitall">Noitall</a> 22:12, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Where's Carville?</span></h2>
<p>James Carville is only mentioned once, and that's as a 'spin doctor' after the election had passed. Deep in the article and only in passing. Carville was instrumental in Clinton's presidential campaign, and this isn't mentioned at all. James Carville should be noted earlier in the article, particularly under the Presidency somewhere near the fifth paragraph. Ideally, "using the line 'It's the economy, stupid'." could be rewritten, "using James Carville's line, 'It's the economy, stupid'." I mean, it was his line, right? I would just go ahead and make this change, but since the neutrality of this article is already being disputed, it's got enough trouble already. I thought maybe it'd be better to suggest this here, and let others decide whether or not I'm right. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachsMind_d463.html" title="User:ZachsMind">ZachsMind</a> 23:59, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The real issue, in my opinion, is really that there's next-to-no coverage of the '92 campaign organization and strategy at all -- that section needs a rewrite, which should prominently mention not only Carville, but also Paul Begala, George Stephanopoulos, and Stan Greenberg. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadicalsubversiv_69e3.html" title="User:Radicalsubversiv"><b>R</b>adical<b>S</b>ubversiv</a> <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadicalsubversiv_1bf7.html" title="User talk:Radicalsubversiv"><b>E</b></a> 00:50, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><s>I would say they should be on the list. They may not be as liberal as some, but nonetheless, they are liberal. There was a discussion above about his liberalism, but I'm not sure if it was ever fully answered. I think the discussion can be reopened in a polite and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> manner. I will start. I contend that Clinton is a liberal. While being a moderate in his party, overall he was liberal. Your turn. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 14:10, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</s></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">UN Sec Gen</span></h2>
<p>In the article it says that Clinton has made it known he wants to be the UN sec gen. But on the UN Sec Gen page - it says that Clinton denies this. Can someone familiar with the situation, or who knows a source fix the inconsistency. <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovacatz_2388.html" title="User:Novacatz">novacatz</a> 05:52, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Since passage of NAFTA, the U.S. manufacturing sector has created 400,000 jobs, and exports to Canada and Mexico support 600,000 more jobs today than in 1993. (Signed 12/8/93)</p>
<p>1994 December 8 GATT Ratified The Clinton-Gore Administration worked with a bipartisan majority in the Senate to pass legislation implementing the General Agreement on Tariffs and trade (GATT). This agreement allows American workers and businesses to compete in a freer, fairer, and more effective global trading system. (PL 103-465, signed 12/8/94)</p>

<dd>Well, according to some unions [<a href="http://www.union-network.org/UNIsite/In_Depth/Interna_Relations/GATS/NAFTAjoblossesJuly.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.union-network.org/UNIsite/In_Depth/Interna_Relations/GATS/NAFTAjoblossesJuly.pdf" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>]:More than 402,981 U.S. workers have been certified as of May 7, 2002 under one special NAFTA unemployment program, NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance (NAFTA TAA).</dd>

<p>Also they claim: In a historic reversal, the U.S. has developed a trade deficit with Mexico since NAFTA. The $1.7 billion U.S. trade surplus with Mexico in 1993 has been transformed into an annual trade deficit of $25.0 billion in 2000. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has increased from $10.8 to $44.9 billion over the same period. 172.135.239.51 01:27, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This paragraph is not NPOV</span></h2>
<p>" In the wake of post-9/11 investigations into intelligence failures, critics have criticized the Clinton Administration for ignoring evidence and refusing to take action on intelligence that pointed to the locations of both Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta years before the attacks. See also Able Danger and U.S., Taliban Bargained over bin Laden." History shows there is ample evidence that Clinton did all that he could given the political environment. He just ran out of time when his presidency ended.</p>
