<p>Some web sites claim that the name comes from <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shem.html" title="Shem">Shem</a>. Although his name in Arabic is Sam but old Arabic used to be similar to Aramic so it was Sham too. Other references points out that the name Sham comes from the word Shamal. That word means either North (Syria is north of Arabia) or left as opposed to Yemen (right). --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthpedia_e836.html" title="User:Truthpedia">Truthpedia</a> 18:49, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Semitic etymologies of "content" words (such as verbs and nouns etc.) almost always proceed by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consonantal_root.html" title="Consonantal root">Consonantal roots</a>, so generally the first thing you need to ask in deciding whether two words in Semitic languages are related is, what is the consonantal root of each word, and are the consonantal roots behind the two words in fact the same? Arabic <i>sham</i> شام seems rather clearly to come from a consonantal root "Š-'-M", since older spellings like شأم and شآم, exist, and it's listed under consonantal root ش ء م in dictionaries such as the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_Modern_Written_Arabic_4b83.html" title="Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic">Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic</a>. By contrast, <i>shams</i> "sun" comes from a consonantal root "Š-M-S" and <i>shamal</i> "north" comes from a consonantal root "Š-M-L". Since the roots are different, the likelihood of the words being related is quite low. There are some exceptional cases (where forms which seem to derive from different consonantal roots can in fact be historically related), but none of the particular circumstances involved in such unusual exceptions apply here.</dd>

<dd>As for Shem son of Noah, Hebrew Š and Arabic Š do not actually correspond to each other etymologically (in terms of Proto-Semitic correspondences), and in early loanwords from Hebrew and Aramaic, the Hebrew/Aramaic Š appears as S in Arabic (so that Hebrew Yeshua` becomes Arabic Yasu`, for example). It's only in late (basically post-Muhammad) loanwords that Hebrew/Aramaic Š appears as Arabic Š. So there's no good reason to question the corespondence of Hebrew Biblical Shem = Arabic Biblical Sam. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 19:22, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dude, your map represents nothing more than the expansionist fantasy scenario of fascists fifty years ago, and is "evidence" of absolutely nothing whatsoever. Furthermore, Bilad-ush-Sham as a traditional geographical term represents the "sphere of influence" of Damascus (as contrasted with Baghdad, these being the two Caliphal capitals of the 700-900 period), and so does not include the core settled area of Mesopotamia -- you seem to be confusing this term with "Mashriq" (i.e. the Arab East). Furthermore, the fact that Bilad-ush-Sham may (or may not) be considered to include a sliver of the western desert of the curent-day Iraq does not mean that the name of "Iraq" should be added to the list in the way that you added it, since that carries the implication that all of Iraq, or the most important parts of Iraq are generally considered to be part of Bilad-ush-Sham -- which is not the case. In fact the parts of Iraq which possibly fall under Bilad-ush-Sham are the least important and least inhabited parts, which probably weren't generally even considered as belonging to Iraq before the 20th century. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 03:58, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article says:</p>
<p><i>Bilad al-Sham is not always precisely synonymous with "Greater Syria" or "Levant", since Greater Syria can refer to a smaller region, while the Levant can refer to a larger region</i></p>
<p>Here my question is that: is the difference between 'Bilad Al Sham' and 'Levant' so huge that we cannot merge them into one article? I think having two separate articles for them is not a good idea. (PS: Off course I know that Greater Syria is different than both.) <a href="../../../a/w/a/User%7EAwat_58ad.html" title="User:Awat">Awat</a> 23:35, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The two terms can be loose geographical synonyms in some contexts, but <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levant.html" title="Levant">Levant</a> is really defined starting from the eastern Mediterranean coast going eastwards (i.e. from a European point of view), while Bilad-al-Sham is defined from Damascus outwards (i.e from a point of view within the region itself), so they don't have exactly the same connotations. With Bilad-al-Sham, there's also a need to go into detailed explanation of etymology, alternative Arabic language terms, etc., most of which is completely irrelevant to discussion of Levant. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 15:04, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AL-<b>SHĀM</b>, AL-<b>SHA'M</b>, Syria, etymologically "the left-hand region", because in ancient Arab usage the speaker in western or central arabia was considered to face the rising sun and to have Syria on his left and the Arabian peninsula, with Yaman ("the right-hand region"), on his right (cf. al-Mas`ūdī, <i>Murūdj</i>, iii, 140-1 = §992; al-Mu<u>k</u>addasī, partial French tr. A. Miquel <i>La meilleure répartition pour la connaissance des provinces</i>, Damascus 1963, 155-6, both with other fanciful explanations). In early Islamic usage, <i>bilād al-Shām</i> covered what in early 20th-century diplomatic and political usage became known as "Greater Syria", including the modern political entities of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel and the west Bank of Palestine, in the north spreading into the modern Turkish <i>il</i>s or provinces of Hatay (the former <i>sandja<u>k</u></i> of Alexandretta [see ISKANDARŪN]), Gaziantep [see `AYN<u>T</u>ĀB] and Diyarbakır [see DIYĀR BAKR]. As often happened in the earliest Islamic times (cf. Mi<u>s</u>r = both Egypt and its capital), al-Shām could also denote the historic administrative capital of the region, Damascus [see DIMASH<u>K</u>].</dd>

<p>That indeed support me but oppose your entry. Furthermore, I have checked Lisan al-Arab which is the main reference of Arabic Language. Under the name "Sham", it says:</p>

<dd>الشأْم بلادٌ عن مشأَمة القبلة سُمِّيَت بهِ لذلك. أو لأن قومًا من بني كنعان تشاءَموا إليها أي تياسروا. أو سُمِّيَت بسام بن نوح فإنهُ بالشين بالسريانيَّة. أو لأن أرضها شاماتٌ بيض وحمر وسود. وعلى هذا لا تُهمَز</dd>
</dl>
<p>It says exactly what Dr Husain Atwan and C.E. Bosworth were saying. Although it does not mention the word North. However, in old Arabic شمال was used for both meaning: North or Left. This is not related to <i>unluckiness</i>. I don't mind if you replace my words with Bosworth's words, but the current wording is not correct. --AraLink 03:56, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>How does it "support" you when it mentions absolutely nothing whatsoever about root ش م ل or any related form with <i>lam</i> after <i>mim</i>, but it in fact <b>does</b> mention the alternative spelling "SHA'M" (i.e. شأم or شآم)? How do you get شأم or شآم from ش م ل&#160;? Where does the hamza come from, and where did the lam go??? Furthermore, I'm having difficulty figuring out what the words مشأَمة is supposed to mean, but it's also clearly derived from root ش ء م (as is the stem VI verb form تشاءَموا ), while nothing mentions any connection with root ش م ل . <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 06:18, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If an editor adds a tag to an article which is a valid tag and you remove it you become a vandal. there isnt a debate about this kind of action. You cannot change my content on the talk page, you cannot remove tags and stop deleting people's content. This article has in no proper sources, either that is a fact or it isnt, since it is, all of my changes are valid. U can stop now or continue your POV show here. U have vandalized my edits as you even removed the references section i added, blind edits like this are a violation of wiki policy as it doesnt develop the article. STOP NOW.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halqh حَلَقَة הלכהሐላቃህ</a> 08:18, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dude, you have raised no valid concerns, and in fact you don't know enough about the subject-matter to raise any valid concerns, but instead you are merely followwing me around and reverting my edits on unrelated matters in order to get soime kind of twisted "revenge" against me for pointing out that every Arabic dictionary says that the word <i>Zanj</i> زنج in Arabic means what you for some reason are trying to pretend that it doesn't mean. In fact, you are <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">wiki-stalking</a> me, and all your threats against me are intended solely to intimidate and harrass me.

<dd>Make you choice here and now, it is as simple as that. U r harassing me, it is a matter of view point. Keep playing with my sources on Zanj and reverting eveything while i am adding references. The thing wiki doesnt like is Original research and edit war, u r a master of all. including civility violation and calling ligit edits vandalism. blind reverts. this isnt a grammar school this is not your language course, Arabic isnt evn your mother language.

<dd>Dude, you have no knowledge in the topic of this article and no interest in the topic of this article, and have only chosen to edit it at all in order to get "revenge" against me for persistently pointing out some simple facts on article <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanj.html" title="Zanj">Zanj</a>, and refusing to be intimidated by your denial of those simple facts. This makes all your attempts at high-minded protestations about Wikipedia policies farcical -- not to mention perhaps somewhat hypocritical. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 09:38, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That might be sound advice in other circumstances, but in the present circumstances it's rather hard to ignore the fact that the only reason you've taken a sudden interest in article <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilad_al-Sham_78de.html" title="Bilad al-Sham">Bilad al-Sham</a> (which I've been editing over a year) is to get revenge on me for the fact that you're losing the argument over on unrelated article <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanj.html" title="Zanj">Zanj</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 09:55, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>U can call me Halq. edit wiki and do not enage me in an ad hominem argument. had i been really stalking you, i could have chosen all of the other articles you edit, y did i land here? B/c maybe on the other articles you didnt violate anything. but here i see a problem. if you edit wiki properly i cannot harrast you as you claim now can i. if you add references and stop deleting content of other editors i cannot do anyting can i. So edit properly and stop discussing my knowlegde level--i dont know you. reply to my actual comments. deletion of references, deletion of another editors content.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halqh حَلَقَة הלכהሐላቃህ</a> 09:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, you need a certain degree of knowledge of Semitic root structures and Arabic grammar to even understand the issues involved in whether or not Sham could be derived from Shamal (see the section <a href="#Name_origin" title="">#Name origin</a> above on this discussion page). The fact that you have been consistently unwilling or unable to take the simple step of looking up the word <i>Zanj</i> زنج in an Arabic dictionary for many months does not give me a high impression of your knowledge of the language. I don't mean to deny that you might have a limited degree of conversational proficiency in informal spoken Arabic -- but if you can't look up written Arabic words in dictionaries arranged by root, then your conversational proficiency has very little relevance or usefulness in settling the issues under dispute here and at <a href="../../../z/a/n/Talk%7EZanj_02e4.html" title="Talk:Zanj">Talk:Zanj</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 10:04, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mr Moos, Discuss any illegal activity i have discussed here. I see Zanj being an Arabic word, I see Bilad ul Sudan, being a place i have edited on, so y cant i edit on here, dont you see the connection. Y dont i go an harrast you elsewhere? Do not remove refernces section, do not remove valid tags. discuss that our be humble enought to know you made a mistake cutting content. Wiki is not a grammar book, go to trilaterial blah blah and edit there. Moreover the issue is you deleting the other editors sourced material, the editor actually is the only one to add a reference. learn 2 add references.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalaqah_2489.html" title="User:Halaqah">Halqh حَلَقَة הלכהሐላቃህ</a> 10:01, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whatever -- you're pretty confused, since I didn't add that, I deleted it. Furthermore, I've been editing this article for over a year, and in fact have expanded it significantly (merging two closely connected articles in the process), whereas you only started editing it a day ago, in order to intimidate and harass me with respect to a dispute on the unrelated article <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanj.html" title="Zanj">Zanj</a> -- in violation of Wikipedia policies <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/WP%7ESTALK_e55b.html" title="WP:STALK">WP:STALK</a>. As a simple matter of linguistics, Sham (or rather Sha'm) cannot come from Shamal, and it doesn't matter how many times non-linguists think that it does (whether Arabic speakers or non-Arabic speakers). The consensus of linguistic scholarship is the only thing that counts here in disputes over etymology of a word, whether you like it or not. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 09:48, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
