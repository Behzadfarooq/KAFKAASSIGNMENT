<p>Hi there. Wow, it already looks like you've been really productive in your first couple of days at wikipedia, and I do hope you stay with us. I'm particularly glad you decided to write <a href="../../../k/a/g/Kagyu_Samy%C3%A9_Ling_Monastery_and_Tibetan_Centre_27d1.html" title="Kagyu Samyé Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre">Kagyu Samyé Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre</a>, something I've been meaning to start myself. Thanks! Here's the usual "welcome blurb", although you seem to be doing pretty well without it:</p>
<p>You might find these links helpful in editing pages or creating new ones: <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_edit_a_page_95d1.html" title="Wikipedia:How to edit a page">How to edit a page</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/t/Wikipedia%7ETutorial_f7c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Tutorial">Tutorial</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Naming conventions</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a>. You should probably read our <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">policies</a> at some point too.</p>
<p>But don't feel you have to read every policy document before you do anything. Dive in, <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> in editing, and if you do anything wrong, someone will be quick to correct it and let you know (hopefully, <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">politely</a>!)</p>
<p>If you have any questions, see the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_0ce0.html" title="Wikipedia:Help">help pages</a>, add a question to the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_e980.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump">village pump</a> or ask me on <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">my talk page</a>. I hope you enjoy editing here and being a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedian</a>!</p>
<p>You may have already noticed that you can sign your name using three tildes, like this: ~~~. If you use four, you can add a datestamp too, as I've done below. This is mostly useful, and is considered good <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">wikiquette</a>, on talk pages. But be aware that the actual wikipedia articles should never be signed - they belong to the community, rather than the individual who created them.</p>

<p>Hello Billion. Kudos for your many edits &amp; images over the past few days. I hope you won't mind, but I've reverted your edit on the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_railway_stations_-_W_dc24.html" title="UK railway stations - W">UK railway stations - W</a> page. Links in the first column of the table are (so far) all to articles about the specified railway station, not the town to which it is attached. I'd encourage you to write even the stubbiest article about the railway station, and, perchance, take a photo of it sometime? best wishes --<a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagishsimon_49c0.html" title="User:Tagishsimon">Tagishsimon</a></p>

<dd>Thanks <a href="../../../t/a/g/User%7ETagishsimon_49c0.html" title="User:Tagishsimon">Tagishsimon</a> that's fine. I'll take my camera down, maybe in one of the brief intervals between it being painted and vandalised. Unfortunately the station is one of the town's rather neglected features although it could be quite pretty. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilllion_8f6d.html" title="User:Billlion">Billlion</a> 09:59, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because of your user name, here's a question for you.</p>
<p>What power of 10 did you originally learn the word <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion.html" title="Billion">billion</a> as meaning?? I was taught 10^9, but I have to live with the fact that many people think it is 10^12. 66.245.17.10 02:09, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi 66.245.17.10. Well I have 3 lll's (Bill+Lion). (Reminds me of joke about one L <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lama.html" title="Lama">Lamas</a> two LL <a href="../../../l/l/a/Llama.html" title="Llama">Llamas</a> and three L ....). The British usage is 10<sup>12</sup>, a million million which has a certain logic (bi+million). This is how I was taught at school in England in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is now referred to a a British Billion. The American billion in a thousand million, 10<sup>9</sup>, what we used to call a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milliard.html" title="Milliard">milliard</a>. To make matters confusing, the American useage is now used when talking about amounts of money in the UK, eg in newspapers and on the radio. Perhaps becuase 10<sup>9</sup> pounds or dollars is a more useful unit. Not all explained in <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion.html" title="Billion">Billion</a> (want to fix it?). Best practice is to stick to the convention of 10<sup>9</sup> for money, and in scientific discusions use either scientific notation or use <a href="../../../g/i/g/Giga.html" title="Giga">Giga</a> for 10<sup>9</sup> and <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tera.html" title="Tera">Tera</a> for 10<sup>12</sup>. Actually I like the sound of Giga pounds. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilllion_8f6d.html" title="User:Billlion">Billlion</a> 09:59, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>It might have just been a mistake, but I noticed you placed a section heading on <a href="../../../a/p/p/Talk%7EApplied_mathematics_9942.html" title="Talk:Applied mathematics">Talk:Applied mathematics</a> in single-equal signs (=X=). By convention, the top-most heading on any page is a <i>second</i>-level heading (using double-equals: ==X==) since the page title itself acts as the first-level heading. Doing it with single-equals also messes up the Table of Contents feature. See <a href="../../../s/e/c/Wikipedia%7ESection_0446.html" title="Wikipedia:Section">Wikipedia:Section</a>. Anyway, I fixed your heading and followed up on your comment. - <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDcljr_a662.html" title="User:Dcljr">dcljr</a> 20:26, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. Please note that as per <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a>, we don't capitalized an initial letter just because it's in a section heading. Thus "External links" and "See also", not "External Links" and "See Also". (Newbies often do this.) Also, the fact that a letter is the first letter of a link is not a reason to capitalize it. The first letter, unlike the subsequent ones, is case-insensitive. And usually a plural is not appropriate as an article title; you can write [[dog]]s or [[Australia]]n or [[apocrypha]]l, etc. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 17:04, 3 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Michael, those were very early ones and I didn't remember to go back and fix them as I learned more.

<p>In reply to you question on that article: both Tex displays appear rendered in the same way on my browser. I suspect it has to do with the way you have your Wikipedia preferences set (especially if you've never knowingly set them).

<p>Thanks for consulting on this. I haven't really though through categories yet, but my instinct is that "frogs" and "toads" are (a) too fine-grained and (b) too fuzzily defined to be useful categories - "amphibians" seems much more likely to be useful.

<p>Thanks for asking if you could use my picture of a hare&#160;:-) I have found the original and tried to improve the picture a bit, I hope thats ok. I uploaded it as "running_hare.jpg" and has translated the caption. If you would correct my english that would be fine&#160;:-)</p>

<p>Dear Billlion,</p>
<p>I now realize that I have been rather brusque in changing <img class='tex' src="../../../math/3/0/c/30c28f76ef7517dbd19df4d4c683dbe6.png" alt="\mathbb{R}^n" /> to <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup> in <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Donaldson_b406.html" title="Simon Donaldson">Simon Donaldson</a>. Sorry for that, and feel free to revert my change. I hope you are not detered from further expanding the article when you have time. I had a look at <i>The geometry of four-manifold</i> a couple of years ago, but I couldn't make much of it. Apparently you fared better; at least you know there is an intriguing connection between his work and instantons. Just out of curiosity, is there any connection between inverse problems and four-manifolds?</p>

<dd>Thanks for your kind words. I might wait until mathml rendering looks a bit better (at least on my browsers) before reverting the edit. I had the good fortune to attend Donaldson's graduate lecture course some years ago in Oxford, and I did understand quite a lot of it at the time! I haven't directly used exotic 4-space in any in any inverse problems, but I have used geometric ideas, for example anisotropic <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrical_impedance_tomography.html" title="Electrical impedance tomography">Electrical impedance tomography</a> is equivalent to an inverse boundary value problem for a (three dimensional) <a href="../../../r/i/e/Riemannian_manifold.html" title="Riemannian manifold">Riemannian manifold</a>.

<p>Good point. He's now colisted as Danish and British. If it had explicitly said he'd taken UK citizenship - or even just given details of the knighthood - I'd have spotted it, but the "Sir" passed me by. The "by nationality" category isn't all that rigid, but certainly there's got to be a substantial link (just getting born in Denmark while your parents are passing through doesn't make you Danish by nationality, for example). Citizenship obviously cuts it, and apparently Zeeman has been (at some point) a Danish citizen and later a British one, so I listed him as both. Sometimes ethnicity will suffice - if he'd been an ethnic Dane from North Germany, especially before the bureaucratic side of citizenship developed, then almost certainly he'd be listed as both Danish and German. It's probably better to be inclusive in categorisation, and maybe risk a little "horizontal redundancy" between "by nationality" subcategories. At any rate, that was a good spot of yours! <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaEmilyDavies_9249.html" title="User:VivaEmilyDavies">VED</a></p>

<p>Dear Billion, Is the word Kagyu really so well known? In all academic publications it is spelled Bka'-brgyud. Perhaps Kagyu is better known than Bka'-brgyud among buddhism enthusiasts, that is unfortunate, the latter does have the advantage of being right. It isn't an English word after all. How about this for a solution-- The first time an article uses a word give the wrong but common spelling in parentheses, and the continue with the correct spelling. e.g.</p>
<p>Bka'-brgyud The Bka'-brgyud (often mistakenly spelled Kagyu in the popular press) school of Tibetan Buddhism was founded by Sgam-po-pa, a doctor born in Dwags-po. etc. etc. The major tenents of the Bka'-brgyud school include... etc. etc.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well one fairly naive test often applied in wikipedia is the Google test. Kagyu gets 126,000 hits where as Bka'-brgyud 2,730. There are many branches of the Kagyu lineage outside Tibet, and all refer to the to it in that way, even many in non English speaking countries (eg France). So Kagyu is used by the kagyu lamas outside outside Tibet, their followers and students, and everyone who has come to know about the lineage through their activities and publications (<i>buddhism enthusiasts</i> is a bit of a derogatory term for teachers and practitioners of the Buddha Dharma. Perhaps it is scholars who do not practice who are the <i>enthusiasts</i>). Whereas Bka'-brgyud is used by scholars. Now that may be wrong, but it is not up to wikipedia to change language and it is not a suitable forum to launch a crusade for tibetan spelling reform! It will of course be very difficult to judge to what extent a common spelling has taken root outside Tibet. Certainly words like Kagyu, and Milarepa have, but there are many cases where this is not the case.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilllion_8f6d.html" title="User:Billlion">Billlion</a> 15:08, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What shall we do in those cases where an English version has not taken root, to repeat my example Gyamtsho, Jamtso, Gyatso, etc? I also want to point out that in a very real sense Tibetans all spell the word Bka'-brgyud when they write Tibetan, because that is how it is spelled in Tibetan.</p>
<p>I apologize about <i>Budhist Enthusists</i> I feared that if I said 'Buddhists' I might exclude people who have not actually taken refuge, but who are also interested parties. Perhaps the antipathy you expressed toward scholarship was not earnest, I hope not. Personally I think it a pity that many of those who find Vajrayana a path to salvation do not bother to learn the language of their teachers, or read their own holy scriptures. In my own opinion if Buddhism is ever to truly take root in the West it must be treated with the same level of care and respect as the west has treated Christianity, and that means lots of scholarship, lots of professors of Tibetan studies, etc. etc. Finally, your post has a strong implication that I am not a beleiving or practicing Buddhist which you of course have no way of knowing. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_hill_eb75.html" title="User:Nathan hill">Nathan hill</a> 10:34, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry if I casued offence, and I am sure you didnt intend to either. Should vajrayana practitioners learn tibetan? I am not sure but I have heard both views expressed by Kagyu teachers, and also different advice to different people, perhaps depending on their ability to learn the language. For some learning the language could be a distraction from learning to meditate perhaps. That said, as far as I know it is fairly typical for lamas in the vajraya tradition of western origin and trained in the west to read and speak tibetan. Christianity is also an interesting comparision. I know nothing of aramaic but should <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> be changed to Yeshua (or something like that) in wikipedia?

<p>Unfortunately even in the Tibetan script these both exist, U rgyan and O rgyan. It is a transliteration of an Indian place name and Tibetans are never sure how to spell those.

<p>In general when I have edited other peoples work I have not just changed spellings, but also changed factual content, therefore it is with some dismay that I notice that some of my pages such as Dge-lugs pa, have been reverted.

It seems nobody really contributes now anymore, maybe all feel a little bit tired with it.

<p>Hi, I'd say the evidence strongly points to him being of Irish descent, he was born in Liverpool, both his names are Irish and he went to a Catholic school.

<dd>I suggest that that is evidnece that he had <b>some</b> Irish ancestors, for some number of generations back.

Although it may not be easy to make a "clean up", I think the way user:Excellentone now took, making substential changes without discussing it, I can not agree with. What do you suggest? (Please see history.) I would suggest to ask for a mediation on this "clean up" process or a "neutral editor" to do this.

<p>Hi Billion, I'd like to hear your opinion about the benefit/use of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kadampa_Tradition#Different_views_on_NKT" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kadampa_Tradition#Different_views_on_NKT" rel="nofollow">Bluck quote</a> at the end of the <a href="../../../n/k/t/NKT_f2c4.html" title="NKT">NKT</a> article. I found it very useful because, from my POV, it balances the article, stating and suggestioning different views on how NKT can be looked at and these views are present and even fight each other when it comes to picture the NKT. From my POV it helps the article and reader to understand that there exist different angles on NKT and how NKT is described depends upon the angle one chooses.

I could not really follow why u:excellentone regulary deleted it and I did not understand her reasoning why she did it. (she talked about the differences of quotes and citations), see the last entries on the NPOV discussion: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:New_Kadampa_Tradition#NPOV" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:New_Kadampa_Tradition#NPOV" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:New_Kadampa_Tradition#NPOV</a> Also I ask myself if the quotefarm-template is right there anymore, it was put there by an anonyomous editor. What do you think? Thanks a lot. Here the Bluck citation for the case it is deleted once more:</p>

<p>Bluck offered different angles on how NKT can be viewed at. He suggested:</p>
<ul>
<li>The NKT could be viewed from outside as a movement aiming at what Titmus (1999: 91) called ‘conversion and empire-building’, with a dogmatic and superior viewpoint, ‘narrow-minded claims to historical significance’, intolerance of other traditions and ‘strong identification with the leader or a book’.</li>
<li>A more scholarly external view might emphasize instead the enthusiasm, firm beliefs, urgent message and ‘charismatic leadership’ which Barker (1999: 20) saw as characteristic of many <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_religious_movement.html" title="New religious movement">NRMs</a>.</li>
<li>An alternative picture from inside the movement would include a wish to bring inner peace to more people, based on a pure lineage of teaching and practice, with faith and confidence in an authentic spiritual guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>About the possibly ways how to picture the NKT he said: "Our choice of interpretation may depend on how we engage with the other viewpoint, as well as the evidence itself, and until recently the NKT’s supporters and critics have largely ignored each other.”<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Thank you for your contribution to the article <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geophysical_survey.html" title="Geophysical survey">geophysical survey</a>. I originally wrote that article to replace a rather poor article under the same title dealing with archaeologial geophysics. I was not happy with the title, however, because the narrow [archaeological] scope of the article poorly served the more general title. I have since moved the article to the title <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archaeological_geophysics.html" title="Archaeological geophysics">Archaeological geophysics</a> to better reflect the scope. That label is not universally used within the discipline, but it is more desriptive and will certainly be understood. In an archaeological context, the term "geophysical survey (or prospection)" generally refers to archaeological applications.</p>
<p>That said, your references to inverse problems and resistivity tomography touch on subjects that are rather exotic to archaeological geophysics. Although there is certainly research in these areas and limited practical applications, references to them might be confusing in this brief non-technical overview.</p>
<p>Moving the article has left a void begging for a more general article on geophysical survey. I would suggest that these topics might form a part of this article, or perhaps an article on frontiers in archaeogical geophysics. In either case, I think that these are topics that deserve to be better developed. --- Tapatio 08:22, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I have worked on ERT and inverse problems since 1985 I regret that I have not taken much interest in archeological applications. However I did see the technique used on <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Team_bfdc.html" title="Time Team">Time Team</a> once, so I assumed it was pretty much standard and well known. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilllion_8f6d.html" title="User:Billlion">Billlion</a> 17:38, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>ERT is certainly known, but it doesn't find a lot of application; unlike geological applications, res surveys in archaeology are usually concerned with horizontal patterning. I suspect this is largely because structures on the scale of most archaeological features really are not detectable at any great depth with resistivity methods, thus the deeper portions of tomographic imaging tend to lack adequate resolution to detect features of interest. There is some very interesting experimental work going on with inverse modeling, but established practical applications that I am aware of are mainly in GPR signal processing. This is likely to change in the near future, however. --Tapatio 19:30, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Youneed to go to <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a> and folloow the instructions (you need to add something like <b>{{lu|Put-your-id-here-without-square-brackets}}</b>. It was done quite quickly, and all I had to do was point out the problem in order to get it agreed. It may be worth a go for you both (I've duplicated this message on <a href="../../../j/f/b/User_talk%7EJFBurton_4782.html" title="User talk:JFBurton">JFBurton's talk page</a> aswell. Protecting one's talk page from vandalism is a bit more difficult and causes a few more problems. <a href="../../../d/d/s/User%7EDdstretch_3ca8.html" title="User:Ddstretch"><span style="border:1px solid DarkGreen;padding:1px;"><font style="color:White;background:DarkGreen" size="0">&#160;DDStretch&#160;</font></span></a>&#160;<a href="../../../d/d/s/User_talk%7EDdstretch_65ba.html" title="User talk:Ddstretch"><font color="DarkGreen" size="0">(talk)</font></a> 17:29, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Christopher Zeeman from Warwick Magazine.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_criteria_7a9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use criteria">first fair use criterion</a> in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the image description page and edit it to add <code>{{Replaceable fair use disputed}}</code>, <b>without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template</b>.</li>
<li>On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license</a>, or by taking a picture of it yourself.</p>

<dd>You say 'I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, ', but it does. And it came from our camera, not a website so your idea of referring to a source is irrelevant.

<dd>So you are saying that you are the author of these images. But how can one understand that it is so? Your user page doesn't say that you are Sarah Lionheart, nor the image page.
