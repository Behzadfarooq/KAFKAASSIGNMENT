<p>When I started adding quotes from Bill, I was not aware wikipedia had a section specifically for that.. So I propose moving all of Bill's quotes to there and then tidying, deleting doublers, etc. Maybe leave between 3 to 6 (at a maximum) of Bill's quotes on the main page&#160;?</p>
<p>I say, definitely this one.. IMO it totally defines what Bill, his philosophy, his beliefs and his entire career was about.</p>
<p><i>Bill- "I was told when I grew up I could be anything I wanted: a fireman, a policeman, a doctor - even President, it seemed. And for the first time in the history of mankind, something new, called an astronaut. But like so many kids brought up on a steady diet of Westerns, I always wanted to be the avenging cowboy hero - that lone voice in the wilderness, fighting corruption and evil wherever I found it, and standing for freedom, truth and justice. And in my heart of hearts I still track the remnants of that dream wherever I go, in my endless ride into the setting sun."

<li>When people keep adding quotes (IMO usually because they want to get involved without writing any useful, original content) until the article becomes ridiculous, something has to be done... I've had success with removing the quotes section entirely to the talk page (eg <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Vito_b77a.html" title="Don Vito">Don Vito</a>) and limiting the section to 3 quotes (eg <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitch_Hedberg_ce2e.html" title="Mitch Hedberg">Mitch Hedberg</a>).

<li>Another issue here is that listing a few quotes to illustrate the tone and content of Bill's work is great, this is turning into a script and as these are really "jokes" rather than quotes, which is how Bill made his living and therefore is Bill's intellectual property, having too many could possibly become a copyright issue. I recommend someone who has been editing this page for a while takes a bold step and slashes the quote section to the first or best 3 quotes, then we all pitch in with reverts and direct people to here. I'm a huge Bill fan but don't feel I've had enough input on the article to make major changes. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990099">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#9900CC">iz</font></b></a> 12:27, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Don't know about anywhere else, but I'm fairly sure that in the UK <i>Flying Saucer Tour Vol. 1</i> and <i>Love, Laughter and Truth</i> were released on 11 November 2002.

<p>In the intro I think we should mention that many people believe Bill Hicks to be a prophet of enlightenment, this is not only my view but also the view of many other people and a valid philosophical point. To say that the term prophet is synonymous with the term 'respected and well known religious philosopher' would be a fair definition; while defining Bill Hicks as a respected and well known religious philosopher would also (certainly by the opinion of many people) also be fair. Bill could be described as the first athiest prophet of internal enlightenment. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 87.115.224.60 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_87.115.224.60_2d7a.html" title="Special:Contributions/87.115.224.60">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>I agree with the points made above regarding Bill being a prophet of enlightenment, but he was not an athiest. He frequently spoke of us (all humans) being the holy children of God and also voiced his wishes for a new, less antiquated, religion being founded that was based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. (*If someone recalls which gigs he expressed these views, please add the details.. As I cant remember exactly what show of Bill's I heard these views from.) [Dirk Diggler Jnr]</p>

<p>Listening to his albums (addmittedly only 2) I've heard no clear proof that he was a Christian, at least during his years of comedy. Sure he may reference Christianity a fair bit, but hey, thats what a lot of atheists/agnostics do as well. Usually because we were raised in that faith and know it better than others, thus feeling able to criticise it with some knowledge of their doctrine. Also in Rant in E Minor he mentions having been raised Christian but does not say that he is still part of that faith. Nearly all the mentions of Christianity and faith in general in his work are usually accompanied by mocking humour, to me that would suggest that he probably wasn't a Christian. Of course it does not necessarily follow that he was an atheist, but it seems more likely. <a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuan_Incognito_13b6.html" title="User:Juan Incognito">Juan Incognito</a> 22:11, 19 March 2006 (UTC)Juan Incognito</p>
<p><b>Juan Incognito</b>, Bill wasn't Christian but he did hold Jesus in the same high esteem that he held MLK, John Lennon, et al in. If you <b>listen</b> to 08 - <b>Gifts Of Forgiveness</b> from <i>Rant in E-Minor</i> you will hear at least one clear statement where he confirms his belief in God, also listen to 24 - <b>Time To Evolve</b> which is also from <i>Rant in E-Minor</i> for a similar verification of Bill's belief in God. These tracks are indicators to Bill's philosophy regarding God. The many other tracks you speak of where Bill attacks Christianty with his acerbic wit demonstrate his righteous contempt &amp; anger for what religion has been twisted and mutated into and why this has been done (i.e. to screw ppl out of money and keep them in fear and raise children who will grow up to believe what their parents believe), it isn't God he is mocking.. it's the horseshit man-made propaganda that the Holier Than Thou's expound in the name of God he is mocking.. and very rightly so. I mean look at Catholicism, the fkn Pope sits in the Vatican like some kind of religious Tony Soprano with all the churches kicking back $$$ to him. And people think it's sinful to say the church is run by moneygrabbing cocksuckers. Do you think if Jesus returned to Earth today and was going about doing his Messianic deeds and benevolent, loving teachings.. that at the end of his day he would sleep in a humble, inexpensive dwelling - or do you think he would sleep in a fkn multi-million pound palace while so many human beings around the world are starving and freezing to death. Bill found organized religion to be repugnant, wicked, hypocritical, harmful and stupifying to degree where he would feel like vomiting blood-laced bile. I share these sentiments.

<p>Hi Dirk, I'll have a listen to that album you linked, and maybe check out the Rant in E minor chapters you cited. Thanks for the link/info. <a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuan_Incognito_13b6.html" title="User:Juan Incognito">Juan Incognito</a> 02:41, 23 March 2006 (UTC)Juan Incognito</p>
<p>Hey Juan, you can hear both of the Bill Hicks tracks I mention above at these two <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> sites.. one of them is officially Bills the other is by a fan (I think).<br />

<p>A few thoughts on Bill Hicks being a Christian or an Atheist. Reviewing his bootlegged work as well as his officially released audio and video, he was neither. Bill was a self-proclaimed preacher. In the documentary “It’s Just A Ride” there is a quick segment of Mary Hicks, Bill’s mother, speaking to that point: I said to Bill, you know you are just that far from being a preacher, and he said, 'I am a preacher.'</p>
<p>In the show “Relentless” (not the comedy album, but the video of the same name which was released in a “bootlegged” audio format as “Relentless in Montreal”) Bill asks if “the concept of the Devil still actually exists”. He then poses the question “What could oppose God’s Will?” Answering his own question, he screams “NOTHING! Nothing could oppose God’s Will!” Even with my very limited understanding of Christianity I’m fairly certain being a Christian means you believe in God as well as the Devil. Bill believed no such thing. He repeatedly denounced the idea of a Devil in his act (and interviews) and continually stated his belief that we are all the perfect and holy children of God.</p>
<p>With that in mind, “respected and well known religious philosopher” is a fairly accurate description of the man. -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Winston_3987.html" title="User:Doc Winston">Doc Winston</a> 21:38, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey Guys i'm just looking into the meaning of the word prophet. Wiktionary has prophet meaning 'someone who speaks by divine inspiration'. I dunno about divine but he is most certainly an inspiration. Dictionary.com says that prophet means: '2. A person gifted with profound moral insight and exceptional powers of expression', which I think also fits the bill (hahahahahh ha ah ha). I'm a newbie to Wiki, is this what is needed as a citation or does it need to be more substancial? i've seen some dodgy links to citations on wiki ie: 9/11 conspiracy sites claiming to be absolute truth etc.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheinnerexits_065e.html" title="User:Theinnerexits">Theinnerexits</a> 09:09, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Johnny, thanks for the info.... I read further on reliable sources and it kinda rules out most of the websites (blogs/reviews) that cite Bill as a prophet. Well at least I know many people hold him in the same high regard as I do... thanks again...Time to hear some of the gospel...

Christian no christian, prophet no prophet, I think Bill's message lies beyond that. He relates god to the oneness envelloping all, the one consciousness. Free thinking would be the only way to this transpersonal thruth. Bill tried to cause a stirup for people to figure out things on their own and to know that he knows as less as they. He wanted you to hate and love him at the same time. But to me he is kind of a prophet and he seems more a preacher than a comedian sometimes&#160;:). Could there be a valid citation coming from the band Tool? [luuk]</p>

<p>If the ideas of Bill Hicks are important...if his values are what we want folks to spend more time with...then we need to work on his legend in concert, a concerted effort...Howard, am I using this technology label right? You talk about orchestrated noise and this morning you posted about the book The Republican Noise machine, so I'm working on a Bill Hicks story to help folks have the "reasons to believe" Bill Hicks is legendary. I'm giving them what they might want to repeat to their friends...</p>
<p>Something to give a shit about...</p>
<p><br />
Bill Hicks (December 16, 1961–February 26, 1994) is considered one of the most influential comedians of the 20th century. However, he is far better known in Europe and Canada than in his homeland of America. His outspoken candor kept him from widespread fame and mass media attention. However, his legend is building.</p>
<p>Each year, on the anniversary of his death, fans around the world help his ideas evolve by asking, What would Bill Hicks say?</p>
<p>New material emerges that honors his memory. This year, some authentic new material surfaced. For many fans, this is a momentous find. While eBay offers hundreds of hours of his material...there were three hours that ardent Bill Hicks fans craved to hear.</p>
<p>On 1 October 1993, Bill Hicks did his twelfth gig on the David Letterman show. What the audience in the studio didn't know was that Bill Hicks had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Later that night, Bill Hicks became the first comedian censored from CBS' Letterman show. Perhaps fitting for the Ed Sullivan Theatre, where Elvis Presley was censored in 1956. But, while Presley wasn’t allowed to be shown below the waste, Hicks was made to disappear.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have censorship in America.</p>
<p>As reported in The New Yorker, Letterman greeted Hicks as he sat down on the couch with, "Good set, Bill! Always nice to have you drop by with an uplifting message!" But, there was trouble in the air and Letterman knew it. Letterman went to commercial with, "Bill, enjoy answering your mail for the next few weeks."</p>
<p>Back in his hotel, Bill stepped out of the shower to answer the phone. Robert Morton...the Letterman show was not running his set.</p>
<p>Bill was terminally sick and knew it. He imagined his Letterman show to be his swan song...what he would be remembered for. In many ways he might have been right. This debacle brought him more attention in The United States than his previous 11 Letterman appearances combined.</p>
<p>In the next few days after the censorship, Bill Hicks performed three shows ranting harder than ever before. These three "post-Letterman shows" as they've been called, have long been thought not captured. This last week, one of these three historic shows has just emerged, the middle show from 10/5/93, recorded by an audience member who happened to be an audio engineer. There is a brief gap in the recording at the one-hour mark when he switched tapes, but the quality is as high as can be expected from a covert recording.</p>
<p>This historic performance is available in its entirety as a completely free download from the art site Frequency23.org. The download can be found on the second page of Mutant Media Gallery entitled "The Lost Hour".</p>
<p>Bill Hicks has been popularized by such bands as TOOL and Radiohead, cartoonists Jeff Danziger and Martyn Turner; writers Neal Pollack, Robert Newman, and A.L. Kennedy; and essays by Thom Yorke of Radiohead.</p>

<p>I have a serious problem with the fawning tone of the article. The authors are obviously hard-core Hicks fans. Nothing wrong with that, but it should be a biography, not a hagiography.

<p>i suggest that all f you read between the lines on this bill hicks bullshit - saw he and denis leary perform together during one of their dual performances at caroline's in the eighties before either was famous and they were trying to prove clubowners who already thought their acts were too similar wrong and they did it in spades - hicks opened first show leary opened second they touched on exactly the same subjects with hilariously different takes on each and my party and everyone else in the room went home happy. i am a fan of both. one guy died. one lived on - if denis stole bill's act - where did denis get the rest of his material / talk show appearance material / hbo specials / comedy central specials / movie scripts / tv scripts. pointing fingers at the guy who lived is inane and easy. how about pointing one at a guy who didn't make it and was envious. there are tons of comedians thru the years who have done this. gene baylos - a famously funny comic of the clubs in the late forties accused jerry lewis of stealing his body movements - i forget the guys name but there was a black comic who accused pryor of stealing his attitude once he revolutionized his act and redid it in the early seventies - there's always a bitter comic in a comedy club - most times more than five or six - this one - bill hicks - just happened to die and become an icon. listen to the work. read between the bullshit journalism and 'eyewitness' accounts.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.96.22.227 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.96.22.227_5d41.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.96.22.227">contribs</a>) 04:37, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Bill Hicks was often asked to advertise products, only to turn down all offers. Bill did not believe that the art of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stand-up_comedy.html" title="Stand-up comedy">stand-up comedy</a> was only a jumping-off point to a larger career. Most other comedians at the time would start doing <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcoms</a> or commercials, but Bill believed in and practiced the art of stand-up. His goal was to educate the American public. He wanted to get people to understand that things were going on all over the world, not to trust everything that you hear on television, and to break the local masses out of their <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provincial.html" title="Provincial">provincial</a> ways of thought. Bill used <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stand-up_comedy.html" title="Stand-up comedy">stand-up comedy</a> as a medium because he said that "the truth is much easier for people to handle if you wrap it up in jokes." Near the end of Bill's life, Bill's mother started to understand and listen to Bill's work more. One day she told Bill that he was so good that he could be a preacher. To this Bill responded by saying "But Mom, I am a preacher, don't you see?"</p>

<dd>Well, Kevin Booth operates and maintains everything official to Bill Hicks. He's not mentioned it. Plus, Myspace has a lot of "official" web pages, that have proven to be fraudulant (I've had more than one instance of "official" Jello Biafra &amp; Alternative Tentacles myspace sites shut down). So to have a site claiming to be "official" on Myspace w/o some sort of validation doesn't mean too much. <a href="../../../r/s/m/User%7ERsm99833_7388.html" title="User:Rsm99833">Rsm99833</a> 16:42, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The biography it features on Bill Hicks (presently) has more scope and depth than Bill's entry at wikipedia and so is a handy cross reference place to compare wiki's details on Hicks against.<br />

<p>Has anyone heard of the play in London right now? Bill Hicks&#160;: A Slight Return. I saw it last week, its amazing. It's basically a play that lasts 1hr 10mins that imagines what Bill would say were he to return to earth now for one night only. It done with the upmost respect for Bill and his works, its well researched, well written, well acted and absolutely f**king hilarious. Surely this play must deserve a mention here somewhere or even its own wikipedia entry? Some1? Any1?</p>
<p>I'm not very adept at writing articles but I have lots of info and images is any1 needs any help? It's got alot of press over here in the UK and I was almost in tears by the end of it because its so heart-warming towards the end. It really does pay alot of respect to Bill.</p>

<p>hate to be a nit picker, but the song is Voodoo Child (Slight Return). On the same Hendrix album ([Electric Ladyland]), there's a 15 minutes blues jam called Voodoo Chile.

<p>I've read through the archived talk of "flamewar on criticism section" and think there's been sufficient time for a cool-down and to suggest that a new and fresh criticism section be included? This would need to be written with minimal bias either way, very matter-of-fact. I don't see why pro-Hicks would see this as such an affront as the man himself didn't seem afraid of criticism... should I source that statement? I'm "pro-Hicks" so maybe that counts. Anyway, I'd like to throw it out there that at least a brief list of who he pissed off, why and what sort of objections there were would do well to give it the balance an encyclopaedia entry requires. Has a criticism section been completely ruled out forever on this article? Judging from past reactions though, I think that we a mature discussion and fair amount of agreeance before bothering to put anything up there. - and you will know know me by the trail of dead. 04:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have made a couple of changes regarding the use of the word "drugs", as well as detail about Hicks Drug use.</p>
<p>I changed one occurance of "drugs" to "mood altering substances", partly for variety, as "drugs, drugs, drugs" gets boring, and partly because of the overuse/misuse/confusing use of the word by our culture. "Just say no to drugs!", but prescription drugs, oh, they're OK. Nasty substances like crack, PCP, and heroin are "illegal drugs", but so are potentially useful medicinal plants/fungi, like many psychedelics and marijuana. Even though Hicks denied using drugs in later years, he evidently considered psychedelics and marijuana useful, as he talked about them often in routines. --<a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhuston_3e3b.html" title="User:Bhuston">Bill Huston</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/u/User_talk%7EBhuston_5101.html" title="User talk:Bhuston"><font color="green">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:53, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anybody know what kind of association this <a href="http://www.billhicks.org/reports.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.billhicks.org/reports.htm" rel="nofollow">foundation</a> (which is also listed in the external links section) has with Bill Hicks (other than using his name and pictures to raise money)? Are they in any way authorized by him or his family? I couldn't find any real answers on their site (other than that he liked animals...) --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrescard_9f22.html" title="User:Frescard">Frescard</a> 18:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Everyone knows bill has always had a passion for music and started writing and recording his music later in his career.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any of the recordings? the lyrics? I would love to cover some of his stuff. 202.6.129.2 17:15, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
