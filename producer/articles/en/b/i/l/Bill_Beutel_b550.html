<p>The son of a <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dentist.html" title="Dentist">dentist</a>, Beutel had a lifelong dream of becoming a reporter. His boyhood idol was the late <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> newsman <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_R._Murrow_2f1e.html" title="Edward R. Murrow">Edward R. Murrow</a>. Beutel graduated from <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanover%2C_New_Hampshire_24bf.html" title="Hanover, New Hampshire">Hanover, New Hampshire</a> after a stint in the <a href="../../../u/2E/_/U._S._Army_671a.html" title="U. S. Army">Army</a> and studied law at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Michigan_Law_School_d853.html" title="University of Michigan Law School">University of Michigan Law School</a>, though he left Michigan with obtaining his law degree. While Beutel was in law school, he wrote Murrow a letter saying, "I very much wanted to be a radio journalist." Beutel received a letter back advising him to go to the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_University_Graduate_School_of_Journalism_3731.html" title="Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism">Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism</a>.</p>
<p>His first radio job was in Cleveland before moving to <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a> Radio in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957.html" title="1957">1957</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Beutel_b550.html" title="Edit section: Television career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Television career</span></h2>
<p>Beutel moved to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_22.html" title="October 22">October 22</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a> as a reporter with <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_News_2f7d.html" title="ABC News">ABC News</a> and as anchor at the network's New York flagship, <a href="../../../w/a/b/WABC-TV_f943.html" title="WABC-TV">WABC-TV</a>. The station had just opened up its first newsroom and created a one-hour 6:00 p.m. newscast called <i>The Big News</i>. WABC-TV was considered late to the game behind <a href="../../../w/n/b/WNBC-TV_f43c.html" title="WNBC-TV">WNBC-TV</a> and <a href="../../../w/c/b/WCBS-TV_0a03.html" title="WCBS-TV">WCBS-TV</a>. Beutel was doing both local and network news at a mere $20,000 a year. Among the hundreds of famous personages who were interviewed by Beutel was the <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_nationalist.html" title="Black nationalist">black nationalist</a> leader <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_X_92fd.html" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a>.</p>
<p>Beutel left his WABC duties for two years in April <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a> to join <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_News_2f7d.html" title="ABC News">ABC News</a> full time as their <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> bureau chief. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, he got a call from <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Primo_3e49.html" title="Al Primo">Al Primo</a>, who had taken over as news director at WABC after Beutel left. Primo had brought the <i><a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyewitness_News_21bb.html" title="Eyewitness News">Eyewitness News</a></i> format, in which the reporters directly presented their stories, along with him from <a href="../../../k/y/w/KYW-TV_1e2b.html" title="KYW-TV">KYW-TV</a> in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. He wanted Beutel to return to New York as co-anchor alongside <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Grimsby_360c.html" title="Roger Grimsby">Roger Grimsby</a>, who had succeeded Beutel as WABC-TV's main anchor. Primo remembered Beutel's solo anchor run in the early '60s. Since Grimsby had already established a powerful presence after just two years in New York, Primo wanted a co-anchor "who could be his own man." Beutel assured Primo he could be.</p>
<p>Beutel rejoined WABC-TV on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_28.html" title="September 28">September 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> as Grimsby's co-anchor on <i>Eyewitness News</i>. Within three months, Beutel and Grimsby became two of the most influential personalities in television news history. Together they made <i>Eyewitness News</i> the most talked about news program in the country. The two worked together for 16 years, most of which was spent going back and forth with WCBS-TV for first place in the New York ratings.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_6.html" title="January 6">January 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, Beutel was reassigned by ABC News and became the co-host (along with Stephanie Edwards) of a new morning show called <i><a href="../../../a/m/_/AM_America_e0df.html" title="AM America">AM America</a></i>. This show, ABC's first attempt at a morning news program to compete with <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Today_Show_8f75.html" title="The Today Show">Today</a></i> and CBS's combination of network news and <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Kangaroo_b3cd.html" title="Captain Kangaroo">Captain Kangaroo</a></i>, lasted only eleven months on the air. <i>AM America</i> was replaced on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> by <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Morning_America_4ee7.html" title="Good Morning America">Good Morning America</a></i>, originally anchored by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hartman_%28TV_personality%29_f4c4.html" title="David Hartman (TV personality)">David Hartman</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Dussault_cd84.html" title="Nancy Dussault">Nancy Dussault</a>. Beutel then returned to WABC-TV and <i>Eyewitness News</i>, though he maintained a presence on the network as the anchor of its 15-minute late newscasts on Saturday and Sunday nights through the late 1970s. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bonds_d16f.html" title="Bill Bonds">Bill Bonds</a>, from <a href="../../../w/x/y/WXYZ-TV_a864.html" title="WXYZ-TV">WXYZ-TV</a> in <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit.html" title="Detroit">Detroit</a>, served as one of Grimsby's co-anchors during Beutel's absence.</p>
<p>The reformed Grimsby-Beutel team kept <i>Eyewitness News</i> on top of the ratings through the middle 1980s, when it briefly fell to last place. Though the ratings drop was mostly associated with ABC-TV's poor primetime performance during that time, it led to Grimsby's firing in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>. However, within a year, WABC-TV had shot back to first place and has been the ratings leader in New York ever since. After Grimsby's firing, Beutel was joined at 6 p.m. by <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaity_Tong_6dfa.html" title="Kaity Tong">Kaity Tong</a> and later <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Johnson_%28reporter%29_49ac.html" title="John Johnson (reporter)">John Johnson</a>, followed by a lengthy stint anchoring alone before being paired with <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_Williams_c2c9.html" title="Diana Williams">Diana Williams</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>. When <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernie_Anastos_74ae.html" title="Ernie Anastos">Ernie Anastos</a> left <i>Eyewitness News</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Beutel returned to the 11 p.m. newscast and worked with several co-anchors, including <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaity_Tong_6dfa.html" title="Kaity Tong">Kaity Tong</a>, Susan Roesgen, and finally Diana Williams. Beutel was replaced at 11:00 and 6:00 in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, respectively, by ABC News correspondent <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Ritter_%28news_anchor%29_721a.html" title="Bill Ritter (news anchor)">Bill Ritter</a>. He spent the final two years of his career serving as a senior correspondent and occasional commentator. In all, Beutel served as an anchor at WABC-TV for a total of 35 years, the last 31 of those continuously--the longest run in New York television history. However WNBC Anchorman Chuck Scarborough could break that record, as he has been the lead anchor at WNBC since 1974. Bill's trademark sign off was "Good Luck, and be well." Beutel retired from television and ABC after 41 years in <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2003.html" title="February 2003">February 2003</a>.</p>

<p>Beutel was married four times, first to Gail Wilder (now Gail Beutel) for twenty years, who gave birth to all of his four children. His second wife was <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guiding_Light_3221.html" title="Guiding Light">Guiding Light</a></i> soap actress, <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Deerfield_585f.html" title="Lynn Deerfield">Lynn Deerfield</a>, in 1975, followed by a brief four month marriage to Cassie in 1977.</p>
<p>In 1980, Beutel married Adair Atwell, a former lobbyist for the tobacco industry. He has four children (all from Gail Beutel) and eight grandchildren.</p>
<p>He has one sister, Marylou Henley, of <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa_City%2C_Iowa_3574.html" title="Iowa City, Iowa">Iowa City, Iowa</a>. His son, Peter, is the president of oil industry analysis firm Cameron Hanover.

<p>Beutel died on the afternoon of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_18.html" title="March 18">March 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, in his home in <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinehurst%2C_North_Carolina_fcba.html" title="Pinehurst, North Carolina">Pinehurst, North Carolina</a> from complications of a progressive neurological disorder.</p>
