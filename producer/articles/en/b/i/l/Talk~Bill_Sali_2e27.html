<p><i>Bill Sali was born on Feb. 17, 1954 in Portsmouth, Ohio. His father Gregory Sali worked in the nuclear industry. In 1957 his family moved to East Granby, Connecticut where his father worked for Combustion Engineering.</i></p>
<p><i>In 1962 his family moved to Boise, Idaho when his father pursued the first of several mining ventures. Bill attended Hawthorne elementary school, then after his family moved attended Koelsch elementary, West Junior High and Capital High School, graduating in 1972. In school he enjoyed music playing drums with school marching, concert and Pep bands.</i></p>
<p><i>Boise State University was attended beginning with the fall semester 1972 studying engineering and industrial business up until the fall semester of 1974. He was a member of the student chapter of the Society of Professional Engineers.</i></p>
<p><i>While working for his father in American Triticale, Inc., a grain seed business, Bill met Terry Sue Petersen and they were married August 20, 1976 in Boise, Idaho and later raised six children together. They made their home in the Boise, Idaho area where he played music professionally and worked at various jobs, including farming and a Caterpillar dealership.</i></p>
<p><i>Bill then returned to Boise State University in January 1979 majoring in Economics. He was a member of Omicron Delta Epsilon, an Economics Honor Society.</i></p>
<p><i>After graduating from BSU in 1981, Bill and Terry moved to Moscow, Idaho where Bill began law school at the University of Idaho. While there Bill was a founding member of the U of I chapter of Delta Theta Phi, a law Fraternity and was elected the chapter’s first Bailiff. Bill continued performance in popular swing music with the Blue County band and also as a member of Willard and the Rats, a 10-piece classic rock band made of law students, spouses and instructors. He graduated in 1984 and they moved back to the Boise area while preparing for the bar exam. In September 1984, after passing the bar exam, Bill began a solo law practice.</i></p>
<p><i>While establishing his legal practice, Bill continued performing music. After winning local and regional levels of the True Value Hardware Country Showdown, “Idaho the band” became one of 6 national finalists and in December 1987 and performed live on nationally broadcast TV show Nashville Now on TNN. Bill continued to perform with two other Boise-based groups, Cimarron and Redstone. Redstone enjoyed success from Calgary Canada to Denver Colorado and the group shared the stage with a number of artists, including Billy Ray Cyrus, Waylon Jennings, Asleep At The Wheel, Doug Stone and the Gibson Miller Band.</i></p>
<p><i>In early 1990 Bill was asked to enter politics and in May 1990 won the Republican primary election to a seat in the House of Representatives in the Idaho Legislature. After the defeated incumbent resigned, Bill was appointed in August 1990 to fill the remainder of that term. The general election in November of that year was won handily as well. In December he was appointed to the House Health and Welfare Committee and in 1993 was appointed as its vice-chairman. Later that year he was also appointed to the Special Committee on Health Care. He served as Chairman of that Committee from 2003 to 2004. Bill served on the Commerce, Industry and Tourism Committee in 1991 and 1992, and then 2 years on the Human Resources Committees. Bill was moved to the Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee in 1995.</i></p>

<p>You're absolutely right, that can't be used. It's banned by Wikipedia, I believe. Wiki is meant to be an encyclopedia, not a propaganda machine. Besides, if you google Sali, all that will be on the first page that comes up. Why duplicate it when it's so easily available anyways?</p>
<p>I've severely overhauled the page, and included some of the same facts, with attribution. --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasmusician_aad1.html" title="User:Texasmusician">texasmusician</a> 3:51 PM, 06 November 2006 (Pacific)</p>

<p>I just severely overhauld the article, adding quite a bit of content and improving the layout. I admit that my additions are severely biased against Sali, highlighting criticisms, stupid statements, and controversies. As most Idaho residents know, there's not been a lot of positive things said about Sali - which is why a Republican is struggling in Idaho for once. Everything I've cited is accepted fact, and I've cited all my sources. Given their factual and accepted nature, I would appreciate it if my additions were not deleted. However, balance is important: I certainly hope a Sali supporter will add more to the article. It could use some details on his actual issue positions and on any bills he's sponsored in the legislature. I did try to put in some of that information, and I highlighted some of the national support he's recieved (Mehlman, Hastert, Cheney, Club for Growth, RCCC, National Right to Life, etc.). I've left out current poll numbers between Sali and Grant, since after tomorrow they'll be irrelevant.</p>

<p>So it would be too difficult for you to write a balanced article, but you will take the time to use a man's biography to push your own political agenda? Furthermore, your section on his career in the state legislature gives no explanation as to exactly what he has done. It mostly includes a collection of negative quotes, which should be under their own section. What if we described Bill Clinton's political career by using quotes from his critics? Would you consider this to be fair? This is exactly what Sali has done, it is the facts, so the bias agruement should be saved fro Faux News. --Anonymous</p>
<p>I didn't push my own agenda. I listed the groups I know of that endorsed him, and I added some info on his basic positions (pro-life, that sort of thing). I added what I know, but because most of the news surrounding the campaign was negative, what I know doesn't reflect well on Mr. Sali. If I was trying to push my own agenda, I wouldn't have come to the discussion page to encourage people who know other, more positive info to post it, as well. I would have stayed silent on the subject. You're right, I didn't include "exactly what he has done" - because I don't know. But if you do, please, post it. However, merely reposting non-encylcopediac copyrighted propaganada from an official website is not appropriate - not for this entry, and not for the entries of politicians I like, either. It's called plagiarism, and it's unacceptable. Also, thanks for staying anonymous, and not publishing your user name. Heightened mystery - or at least wasted time spent looking at the history page - brightens everyone's day. --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasmusician_aad1.html" title="User:Texasmusician">texasmusician</a> 8:19 PM, 15 November 2006 (Pacific)</p>

<p>I have reverted 66.233.250.90's most recent edits. This is the second time he has vandalized the page with his views. I'll admit that most of the FACTS I put in the article do not reflect well on Sali; I have put in few facts that do make him look good because I myself don't know those facts. But one thing I have not done is to try and charactize the information myself with unflattering adjectives and commentary, something 66.233.250.90 does often. Some of his edits - particularly to "religion" in the info box - were good ones, and I redid them. Most were not. For instance, he likes to change the line "The third place finisher, moderate Sheila Sorensen, said of Sali," to "said moderately." Her quote has nothing to do with liberal, conservative, or moderate. It's character-based, not issue-based. And it's wrong to use Wikipedia to mock her political stances. He also changed the line "Many of these papers, such as the Spokesman Review, typically endorse Republicans, giving their anti-Sali endorsments of Grant added weight." to "Many of these papers, such as the Idaho Statesman, rarely endorse conservative Republicans, giving their anti-Sali endorsments of Grant dubious credibility." First of all, "weight" is different than "credibility." How much credibility an endorsement has is not the same as its weight and its importance; credibility is an opinion issue, and does NOT belong in a Wikipedia ENCYCLOPEDIA article. It is also silly to delete the line about the Spokesman. Finall, 66.233.250.90 changed "anti-gay marriage" to "affirms the heterosexual definition of marriage" - another opinion. Unfortunately, I don't think 66.233.250.90 reads the discussion page, as suggested by his anonymity, so please keep an eye out for him. I'm unfamiliar with some of Wiki's editorial policies, so if you know an editor or whatever they're called, let him know. I'm certainly not against putting in facts that make Sali look good, such as a list of his legislative accomplishments, but personal opinion is a whole different story. --texasmusician 7:09 PM, 16 November 2006 (Pacific)</p>
<p><i>This article, in its current form, appears not much more than texasmusician's lopsided collection of the most negative quotes he could find against Bill Sali. The article content has less to do with Bill Sali and more to do with what his political opponents think of him. It reads like a Democratic op-ed piece. Rather than simply remove the quote by Sheila Sorensen (as the irrelevant opinion that it is), I decided to leave it in as a sample of the shameless bias of the entire article. Adding the adjective "moderate" next to Sheila's quote contrasts beautifully with the content of her statement, which is anything but moderate. If there were a list of <a href="../../../r/i/n/RINO_7684.html" title="RINO">RINO</a> politicians for the state of Idaho, Sheila would be at the top of it. As for the newspaper endorsements, there is no citation which supports the claim that any of them "typically endorse Republicans". The Idaho Statesman, in particular, is quite out of step with the political views of the state. If they ever endorse a Republican candidate, it is either because there is no Democrat running on the ballot, or because the endorsement of a <a href="../../../r/i/n/RINO_7684.html" title="RINO">RINO</a> is better than endorsing a real conservative. But rather than remove the irrelevant topic from the article, I simply inverted the erroneous statement to correctly indicate the fact that these papers rarely endorse conservative Republicans. I left the remaining (and also irrelevant) description of their coverage unchanged, as evidence of this fact. Sadly, it seems texasmusician is intent on hovering over this article to make sure that it continues to reflect his openly admitted bias.</i> --66.233.250.90 06:46, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--Her quote is not moderate, nor is it liberal or conservative - a description of someone's personal character has nothing to do with any of those labels. And if you think moderates are RINOs, fine, but she was a close third in the primary, so her comments do reflect a split within the state party on Sali, as do Vasquez's, the close second. And intra-party splits like that matter in election coverage. As to the Idaho Statesman, if you want to point out that it usually endorses Democrats, fine, but don't say it has no credibility - that's a matter of opinion. But cite a source when you point out who it usually endorses (for instance, dig up an older endorsement of a liberal and link to it). And I have known the Spokesman Review to endorse conservative Republicans numerous times - it's my local paper. But you're right, I should cite it. Mea culpa, I'll dig something up. So don't delete the line about the Spokesman when you add the line about the Statesman, as you did. Finally, you're right, there's not much more the article right now than the well-publicized quotes about Mr. Sali, but if you'd like to add info about his legislative record, go for it! The article needs it! I would add it if I knew it, but I don't. The article could certainly use more info on his stances (as long as it's not biased language like "affirms the same-sex definiton of marriage" - we could say he supports a Constitutional amendment defining marriage that way), what bills he's sponsored, and his committee work. I'd add it if I knew it - the article is biased only because of what I know, but at least it's not biased in how it words those facts. I'm happy to include facts that make him look good: I do have a bias, yes, but the article shouldn't reflect my bias. Find facts to cover up the bias. Your info is fine, the problem is how you word it. You should also set up an actual account (or log into one you already have) rather than remaining and anonymous IP address. Thanks for doing what you think is right as far as thje article goes. Maybe if we work together rather than wacking away at one another's edits, we can work something positive out. --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasmusician_aad1.html" title="User:Texasmusician">texasmusician</a> 16:28 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since this article more closely resembled a Democratic op-ed piece than an encyclopedia entry, I decided to separate the personal opinions about Sali and put them under their own heading (appropriately labeling them as opinion). I also added a hint of balance to the article by quoting some prominent Idahoans who have held opinions in support of Bill Sali. Not surprisingly, they weren't hard to find, assuming texasmusician even bothered to look for any. We'll see how long these updates last. --66.233.250.90 08:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I rearranged things to make more organizational sense, but I didn't delete anything. Do you agree with the way I relabeled them? If not, we can continue to tinker with it. And by "not hard to find," I see your source is Sali's webpage. Of course they weren't hard to find when you go the propaganda page (though I am leaving them in the article, quotes are quotes). And I point out I am the one who added info about which PACs donated to Sali and which national figures cam to stump for him, as well as info on which committees he sat on and that quote about the Founding Fathers. But I didn't look too hard for positive info, just as you didn't look too hard for negative info. That doesn't mean I'll delete the positive info (when worded objectively, as you finally did this time) when added by others. --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasmusician_aad1.html" title="User:Texasmusician">texasmusician</a> 14:04, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm wondering, why do you stay anonymous? If you were just tinkering with spelling and grammar, I'd understand, but since you're pretty active with at least one page, why not set up an account? --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasmusician_aad1.html" title="User:Texasmusician">texasmusician</a> 14:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, I don't agree with the relabeling. The usual pro-life vs abortion debate <i>is a debate</i>. People disagree strongly and say strong words in that fight. That's barely newsworthy, or deep controversy, let alone encyclopedia worthy. When that debate spills over into personal attacks, it's usually considered bad form. Yet you and the papers seem to be completely captivated by the ad hom statements against Sali's person. Why am I not surprised? Your chosen quotations do not inform us about Sali, and contribute zero insight into Sali's views or methods or tactics. What data indicates that Sali is an idiot? What did he lie about? Why should he be thrown out a window? There is no context here. As such it's just a collection of personal opinions. They should be labeled for what they are, assuming they even belong in an encyclopedia article. Also, Bill Sali's web site is already referenced more than once by the article-- or is it only a propaganda page when I reference it? These quotes are intended for public record anyway, they just happen to be conveniently available in one place, which simplifies citation. You say yourself that quotes are quotes, and I fail to see how the personal opinions that I quoted are any less relevant than the ones you quoted (assuming any of them are relevant to an encyclopedia article). So I'm not giving you any points for generosity. --66.233.250.90 18:23, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The attacks aganist Sali's person have little to do with the abortion debate - they come from other pro-life people (and this may come as a surprise to you, but I myself am pro-life). The reason I and the newspapers are "captivated" by these attacks are because of their sources. You won't find another Congressional race in the country this year where two former state speakers, same-party legislature collegagues, and numerous primary opponents criticized their party's nominee as much as Idaho's first. I deleted your line about Sorensen and Vasquez criticizng Sali BECAUSE they lost to him for two reasons: 1) in most states (CT is an obvious exception), party primary competitors endorse one another in the General. See the Maryland Senate race. And 2) The candidates themselves TOLD US why they wouldn't endorse Sali. I take them at their word on that score. I referenced Sali's webpage myself, in listing his Committee assignments. It's a propaganda page, but as I said, propaganda can be facts. Selective facts are still facts, which is why I didn't delete your quotes from that page. I never said your quotes were less relevant than mine - take a look, I left them in the article. I'm sure you noticed. Finally, I relabeld "public opinion" again because I don't think the people you or I are quoting count as the general public. Can we agree at least on that? Reread all my posts. I never once asked for "points for generosity." What I did ask was why you don't set up an account, and I noticed you chose to ignore me there.

<p>Our anonymous friend, 66.233.250.90, is right - if the abortion/breast cancer link quotes are to be mentioned, Sali should be credited for citing actual studies and not making stuff up. The other anonymous fellow was wrong to revert it, and I'm sorry I didn't catch the missing studies earlier. However, it is also true that the major cancer groups (particularly the American Cancer Society) all disagree with those findings, and that should be mentioned as well. BEcause Sali is so well nown for the remarks, and because they played such a role in the debate, I feel they merit their own special section. Thanks, 66.233.250.90, for inserting the links to the studies Sali cites. I hope you find the further changes acceptable as well. On another note, shame on Jidlla the Killa for the vandalism, and thank you Wknight94 for catching it. Lordkate, good minor edits. Hope you all had a happy Thanksgiving!</p>

<p>This enrty states that Sali is "in favor of immigration law overhaul". That's a rather vague description. Since the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_c7bf.html" title="Republican Party">Republican Party</a> is split between those who favor the <a href="../../../b/i/-/Bi-partisan.html" title="Bi-partisan">bi-partisan</a>, comprehensive approach and those who favor an enforcement-only approach, clarity is needed. The current language doesn't really tell the reader anything about the Rep.-elect's position. I'll do a quick edit to that section, if there's no objections.</p>

<p>If there are no objections, I'd like to remove the biased tag from the article. After my little back-and-forth with our anonymous friend, I think the article has balanced out a lot more. Our joint efforts helped that front, I think - he would add balancing information to my admittedly-biased knowledge; I would tone down his biased language. Does the article still seem one-sided? If not, let's get rid of that tag.</p>

Yes, still biased. It was pretty clever how you slipped the ad hominem remarks back out of the opinion section. Did you suddenly forget your own words above when you said, "The attacks aganist Sali's person have little to do with the abortion debate"? If the attacks against Sali's person have little to do with the abortion debate, why did you move them out of the opinion section and into a new section specifically on the abortion debate? Do tell. Although, I agree that it could be useful to have a separate section on the Abortion issue. It would be a good place to flesh out the details from the studies. Almost like what happened with Sali. Abortionists raised a fuss in the media and suddenly people became aware of the studies. Oops. The data got discussed and people started to ask questions. Maybe Sali isn't as dumb as you want to paint him. Or maybe he's dumb like a fox, even though the reasons for Sali's opposition to abortion go much deeper than breast cancer rates.</p>
<p>--66.233.250.90 19:47, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I posted about the abortion section on November 27. Why would you take this long to complain about it? And why are you griping about the quotes being moved? They're still there; they just have more context.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasmusician_aad1.html" title="User:Texasmusician">texasmusician</a> 01:02, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alright. Made some changes. I deleted much of the info you inserted explaining the studies and the details and numbers behind them. Although that's very valuable information, this is not the article for them. This is an article about Bill Sali - full in-depth analysis of everything related to his life or any particular issue doesn't actually belong in this particular article. This needs to stay focused on Mr. Sali himself. I didn't delete everything you inserted, nor did I insert such qualifying info about the pro-link studies. But I did shorten things to keep this a Sali article. I also moved the quotes about Sali's abortion stance back to the abortion section. That puts them in context. I don't understand why you moved them back to the opinion section - they're specifically relevant to the abortion section, and putting them in context doesn't hide them or make them more obvious to the reader.</p>
<p>If you'd like, start another article on the question about breast cancer-abortion and like this article to that article. Don't like that suggestion? Tough. You'll find that's generally the accepted ruled across Wikipedia - not that you would know that, since you hide behind the mask of anonymity and refuse to answer me when I ask about that, so my guess is you don't do much on Wiki beyond the Sali article. --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasmusician_aad1.html" title="User:Texasmusician">texasmusician</a> 01:20, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have no strong complaint with an abortion section, as such. But I do find it hilarious that you actually have no interest in factual information pertaining to the studies that Sali relied on for his abortion/breast-cancer (ABC) position. Rather you seem only interested in proudly placing the ad hominem personal opinions from Sali's detractors, as if they contribute any understanding of Sali's positions. Are you sure that your true calling is not in journalism? In any case, you can't have it both ways. You can't raise the ABC controversy and then try to censor factual information. If you didn't want to see this data, then you shouldn't have created a section for it. I'll remind you that you were the one who said that, "The attacks aganist Sali's person have little to do with the abortion debate", so it is odd that you still insist on pulling them out of the personal opinion section. When you publish your real name and address for everyone to see, then you can complain about others being anonymous. --66.233.250.90 03:48, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I moved the comments about Sali's abortion position BACK to the abortion section. The comments may not play a role in understanding Sali's actual position, but they do play a role in understanding how that position has affected his career, his effectiveness in state politics, and how he is viewed by the rest of the state, subjects this article is to address. Furthermore, most Wiki articles don't even HAVE "outside opinion" sections. Putting comments about a subject next to other info on that subject is a typical Wiki action, something I'm guessing you don't know since, again, you remain anonymous and refuse to even ackowledgethe existence of my repeated inquiries as to why.</p>
<p>Also, I again deleted most of the info on the abortion studies - both the studies you prefer and the studies I prefer - but did place a prominent link to that information. Your ad hominem attack (I love the fact that you keep critizing such quotes from others about Sali but repeatedly make them about me) that I "have no interest in factual information pertaining to the studies" is untrue; I just don't think an article on Sali is the same thing as an article on the studies. But it is relevant, a prominent link is appropriate. And thanks for the info on his committee requests and adding a link to the new official website. --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasmusician_aad1.html" title="User:Texasmusician">texasmusician</a> 16:47, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I erased changes earlier today, explaining myself. You changed it back, but didn't explain yourself here as I did, so I reverted. Why don't we seek a third opinion through the formal Wiki process? (Honestly, I don't see the problem with a prominent link and putting like with like, but I guess you do and just don't want to explain why. Did you file your rational for it away with your refusal to discuss anonymity?) --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasmusician_aad1.html" title="User:Texasmusician">texasmusician</a> 02:19, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't feel the need to keep explaining myself over and over, so this will probably be the last time. Before texasmusician yanked my edits, I had already explained why the ad hominem verbal attacks against Sali belong under a personal opinion section (assuming there should even be one). If someone wants to lose control and fly off the handle at Sali, that is their problem, not his. I also explained why the specific data is important to the ABC debate and the issue Sali is raising about the studies. Trying to censor the factual data after texasmusician made a section for the abortion controversy is just that, biased censorship. It's really too bad that Wikipedia is subject to such bias, and is too backlogged to deal with it. I guess that's the failure of this kind of medium. I already addressed the anonymity issue as well. Our anonymous friend can complain about others being anonymous when he posts his name and address for all to see.</p>

<p>I propose that this article on Sali be reformatted into a true biographical form, rather than continue on in some attempt to balance glowing praise from his allies and ad hominem outburts from his opposition. A list of opinions about Sali is not contributing much either way. I realize that texasmusician is in love with the nasty quotes that he's found against Sali, but I propose that those be moved off to other articles that could be linked from Sali's main biographical page. This is similar to how other political pages are handled, such as Ronald Reagan's page, where scandals during his administration are described and linked in a separate article. You'll also notice that even on pages like those of Bill Clinton and Dick Cheney, their controversies are discussed mainly in their own words, and do not become a free-for-all to quote every nasty outburst made against them in the media.</p>
<p>So I would be willing to drop the "Outside opinion" section entirely (or move it to other articles, assuming texasmusician is willing to compromise. What I'm not offering is to let texasmusicion scatter the irrelevant ad hominems throughout the article that should be a biography on Sali, not a stage for all the nasty remarks of his political enemies. The article should not be formatted as if it were a political campaign or op-ed piece. If someone is to be quoted, it should be mainly Sali, describing his own views.</p>
<p>If Newcomb wants to call Sali an idiot, put that opinion on Newcomb's article, not Sali's. If Vasquez thinks Sali is a liar, put that in an article for Vasquez. If Simpson wants to throw Sali out a window, put that opinion on Simpson's page. Their lack of self-control is not Sali's problem, and if they aren't worthy of their own wikipedia articles, then that might be a clue that their opinions aren't worth as much as texasmusician thinks they are.</p>

<dd>Curious, do you live in <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho.html" title="Idaho">Idaho</a>? 'Cause if you did you'd know that Rep. Sali didn't get much favorable press during his House campaign. And by the way, Speaker Newcomb and former Speaker Simpson's remarks <i>were</i> considered a big deal during the campaign. It was debated whether someone as polarizing as Sali could win, even in a district as Republican as Idaho's 1st. So those quotations are hardly irrelevent because they were quoted repeatedly and often during the race. That said I agree with your general premise that the article currently reads like an opinion page. It's sad my congressman, Rep. <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Simpson_b747.html" title="Mike Simpson">Mike Simpson</a> gets barely a paragraph and Sali gets an elongated list of quotations.</dd>
