<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Brasky_eb5c.html" title="Edit section: Format">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Format</span></h2>
<p>Three or four friends (known as the "<b>Bill Brasky Buddies</b>") gather in public places, (usually a bar or hotel restaurant and, on one occasion, in the bleachers at a <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_League_ac50.html" title="Little League">Little League</a> baseball game) to drink <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_whisky.html" title="Scotch whisky">Scotch</a>, smoke <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette.html" title="Cigarette">cigarettes</a>, and loudly reminisce about their mutual acquaintance, Bill Brasky. Most of their discussions focus on their admiration of Brasky's superhuman accomplishments, usually focused on his <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virility.html" title="Virility">virility</a>, celebrity connections, and reckless disregard for human life. The stories of Brasky's life and seemingly legendary accomplishments are exaggerated to absurd levels in the American tradition of <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tall_tale.html" title="Tall tale">tall tales</a>, similar to the "<a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Norris_Facts_d641.html" title="Chuck Norris Facts">Chuck Norris Facts</a>" <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a>, employed nearly a decade later (in fact, Bill Brasky quotes are regularly recycled as Chuck Norris facts). If their stories are to be believed, Brasky is ten feet tall, weighs two tons, and has cheated death on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>The Brasky Buddies are all apparently salesmen who worked with Brasky, as they frequently state that he was "the best damned salesman in the office". They all have red cheeks and red noses (apparently due to the large amounts of Scotch they consume) and extremely large, white teeth (for unexplained reasons). They appear to be coming from a sales conference or a business meeting, and by the time the sketch begins, they are extremely intoxicated.</p>
<p>Typically, the three cycle through the same genres of comment four or five times: one man will recount a tale about Brasky, the second will expound on the benefits of expense accounts, and the third will hit on a waitress, followed by the first drunkenly blurting out something embarrassing (e.g. "I am wearing a diaper!"). The cycle will then repeat, starting with the second Brasky Buddy, getting more outrageous each time around. At some point a man not party to the original conversation, usually played by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Meadows_c5e7.html" title="Tim Meadows">Tim Meadows</a>, will interject with "Are you guys talking about Bill Brasky? I <i>know</i> Bill Brasky!"</p>
<p>Some of the accomplishments recounted can be considered downright abhorrent (he has slept with all of their wives, and has apparently caused the deaths of several people) but are still celebrated with the same gusto. At regular intervals, they raise their glasses to toast him, shouting "To Bill Brasky!" They all seem to equally admire and despise Brasky.</p>
<p>The sketches usually end with Bill Brasky himself appearing, via a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forced_perspective.html" title="Forced perspective">forced perspective</a> shot, and either demanding or offering everyone Scotch.</p>
<p>Brasky's full name is William Robert Julian Brasky. He has a wife and a young daughter named Debbie.</p>
<p>The format of the sketches resembles the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Improvisational_comedy.html#Short_form" title="Improvisational comedy">short-form improv game</a> "Two Describe a Third".</p>

With Ana Gasteyer as a Parent. The original live broadcast of this sketch was severely truncated, with the last 2-3 minutes of the sketch being cut off. Shortly before the end-shot with the forced-perspective shot of Brasky, the three Brasky Buddies can be seen struggling through their lines, presumably due to lack of cue cards. After the sketch ended, there was an impromptu 45-second shot of the SNL band to fill time, before the last commercial break and goodnights. It is unknown why this sketch was cut short, but it is likely because there was a time discrepancy. There was only about 45 seconds in the goodnights, which would explain why the last few minutes of the sketch were abruptly cut off. In reruns, this edition of the sketch was replaced with the full-length dress rehearsal version.</p>
<ul>
<li>5. <b>Bar</b> (12/12/1998)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bill Brasky Buddies: Alec Baldwin, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Goodman_bdf8.html" title="John Goodman">John Goodman</a> (as Ted), <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Ferrell_2075.html" title="Will Ferrell">Will Ferrell</a> (as Hank). With Ana Gasteyer and Andy Murphy as patrons.</p>
<p>While there have been no further actual Bill Brasky sketches, a sketch called <b>Mr. Willoughby</b> appeared on the January 14, 2006, episode of <i>SNL</i> and followed a very similar format. Framed as a trailer for a movie based on a lost <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Austen_1c14.html" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a> novel of the same title, the sketch featured <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Dratch_a66a.html" title="Rachel Dratch">Rachel Dratch</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tina_Fey_71ce.html" title="Tina Fey">Tina Fey</a> and host <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarlett_Johansson_9d29.html" title="Scarlett Johansson">Scarlett Johansson</a> as a trio of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_era.html" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> sisters rhapsodizing about one Mr. Willoughby, "the most eligible bachelor in all of Upper Cornholeshire." Like the Brasky Buddies' stories, the sisters' descriptions of Willoughby steadily grow more and more bizarre, and they recount even the most repugnant facts ("Mr. Willoughby reeks of urine!") with an attitude of lovestruck awe. At several points the three sisters sigh, "Mr. Willoughby!" in unison, much like the Brasky Buddies' periodic toasts of "To Bill Brasky!"</p>
