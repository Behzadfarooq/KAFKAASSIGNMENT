<p>Ritter was born in Denver and raised on a farm in far eastern <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurora%2C_Colorado_0e17.html" title="Aurora, Colorado">Aurora</a> among his 11 brothers and sisters (he was born sixth). He went to <a href="../../../g/a/t/Gateway_High_School_660b.html" title="Gateway High School">Gateway High School</a> while he lived in Aurora. His father, Bill, was a heavy equipment operator in the construction industry. His mother, Ethel, was a homemaker until the family began to struggle economically and she found work as a bookkeeper when Ritter was a young teenager. At 14 years old, he went to work full time in the construction industry, and joined a local labor union. He continued to work in the construction field, which ended up financing his college education (along with <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_loans.html" title="Student loans">student loans</a>). He enrolled in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_State_University_c1d4.html" title="Colorado State University">Colorado State University</a> and completed a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelors_degree.html" title="Bachelors degree">bachelors degree</a>, and then pursued a degree at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Colorado_School_of_Law_3e65.html" title="University of Colorado School of Law">University of Colorado School of Law</a> in <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulder%2C_Colorado_8487.html" title="Boulder, Colorado">Boulder</a>.

<p>Controversy arose during the campaign over Ritter's use of plea bargains while in office. As DA, Ritter plea bargained 97% of cases which were brought to his office <a href="http://colorado.mediamatters.org/items/200609110004" class="external autonumber" title="http://colorado.mediamatters.org/items/200609110004" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (near the national average). However, controversy surfaced regarding plea bargains that prevented the deportation of both legal and illegal immigrants charged with drug, assault, and other crimes <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_4421679" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_4421679" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Both illegal immigration and drug use were hot topics in the race for governor, raising further controversy. Ritter has defended the plea bargains, stating that "Our priority was to try the most serious cases." <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_4421679" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_4421679" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>In the beginning of <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_2006.html" title="March 2006">March 2006</a>, Ritter's last Democratic opponent, State Rep. Gary Lindstrom, dropped out of the race, leaving Ritter to unite the party by default. Party leaders held a rally in front of the State Capitol in support of Ritter. Ritter selected child welfare advocate <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_O%27Brien_%28politician%29_d3ca.html" title="Barbara O'Brien (politician)">Barbara O'Brien</a> as a running mate, shortly prior to the rally, in <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2006.html" title="February 2006">February 2006</a>. Ritter was overwhelmingly nominated at the 2006 Colorado Democratic Convention in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greeley%2C_Colorado_6e93.html" title="Greeley, Colorado">Greeley</a> in <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_2006.html" title="May 2006">May</a>. Following both of the major political conventions, a weaker Republican candidate, Marc Holtzman, dropped out of the election. Ritter was left to battle Republican <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Beauprez_ca1b.html" title="Bob Beauprez">Bob Beauprez</a> in a critical election year for both parties nationally. Ritter went on to win the governorship with 56% of the vote.</p>

<p>As a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrat</a>, Ritter supports a semi-progressive agenda, emphasizing socialized medicine, environmental protection, housing subsidy and welfare increases and other stances aligned with the left wing of the Democratic Party. However, during the first campaign, more liberal state Democrats encouraged other candidates, such as Denver Mayor <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hickenlooper_1778.html" title="John Hickenlooper">John Hickenlooper</a>, to pursue the office of Governor, due to concerns over Ritter's pro-life stance. Others argued that Ritter would win more votes in the "purple state" of Colorado, as opposed to <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> opponents. Hickenlooper did not pursue the office in 2006, and eventually supported Ritter.</p>
<p>As governor, Ritter has pledged that overturning abortion laws would not be part of his agenda, and has stated that he would veto any bill prohibiting abortion that did not provide for an exception for rape, incest or fetal anomalies <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/elections/article/0,2808,DRMN_24736_4912737,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/elections/article/0,2808,DRMN_24736_4912737,00.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Ritter has further stated that he would restore state funding to Planned Parenthood for family planning, and would reverse the veto of a bill that would have allowed pharmacists to dispense the emergency contraception known as the morning-after pill.</p>

<p>Ritter is popular with rural Coloradans, who in the past have tended to vote for Republican candidates (particularly <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_Front_Range_1a56.html" title="Colorado Front Range">Front Range</a> voters). This may stem from Ritter's perceived rural roots. His popularity also extends to the Democratic strongholds in Colorado; the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_divide.html" title="Continental divide">continental divide</a> <a href="../../../s/k/i/Ski_resorts.html" title="Ski resorts">ski resorts</a> such as <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen%2C_Colorado_7311.html" title="Aspen, Colorado">Aspen</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vail%2C_Colorado_3c8b.html" title="Vail, Colorado">Vail</a>, as well as the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver-Aurora_metropolitan_area_ac0a.html" title="Denver-Aurora metropolitan area">Denver-Aurora metropolitan area</a>. Ritter's chief rival for office, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Beauprez_ca1b.html" title="Bob Beauprez">Bob Beauprez</a>, shares a similar background, but may have suffered from the lack of a widely recognized in-state political history, having only chaired the state Republican Party, and having served most visibly in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Congress_7589.html" title="U.S. Congress">U.S. Congress</a>.
