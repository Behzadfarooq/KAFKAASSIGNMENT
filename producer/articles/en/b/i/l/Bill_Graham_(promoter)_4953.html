<p>Bill Graham was born <b>Wolfgang Grajonca</b> in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, the youngest son of a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> family that had emigrated to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> prior to the rise of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>. Graham's father died when he was a baby. As it became increasingly difficult for <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> to survive in <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, Graham's mother placed Graham and his younger sister in an orphanage in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>. This turned out to be fortunate, as the orphanage sent them to <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a> as a pre–<a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> exchange of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> children for <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> orphans.</p>
<p>Graham's older sisters stayed behind with his mother. After the fall of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, Graham was among a group of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> orphans spirited out of France. A majority of the children – including Graham's younger sister—did not survive the journey.</p>
<p>Graham's mother died in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Auschwitz.html" title="Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a>. His sister Ester survived Auschwitz and later moved to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and was very close to Graham in his later life. His sister Rita escaped by working as a dancer, first to <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> and then, after the war, to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>Once in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, Graham was placed in a foster home in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bronx%2C_New_York_ae83.html" title="The Bronx, New York">The Bronx</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. After being taunted as an immigrant and being called a Nazi because of his <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_people.html" title="German people">German</a> accented <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, Graham changed his name ("Graham" was found in the phonebook, it was closest to his real surname "Grajonca". According to Graham, both "Bill" and "Graham" were meaningless to him) and worked to perfect a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York-New_Jersey_English_ff21.html" title="New York-New Jersey English">New York accent</a>. Graham graduated from <a href="../../../d/e/w/DeWitt_Clinton_High_School_37c3.html" title="DeWitt Clinton High School">DeWitt Clinton High School</a> and then went to business school. He was later quoted as describing his training as that of an "<a href="../../../e/f/f/Efficiency_expert.html" title="Efficiency expert">efficiency expert</a>."</p>
<p>Graham was <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription_in_the_United_States_5b7e.html" title="Conscription in the United States">drafted</a> into the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> in 1951, although he officially still wasn't a U.S. Citizen, and served in the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>, where he was awarded the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze_Star_Medal_c027.html" title="Bronze Star Medal">Bronze Star</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple_Heart_4dee.html" title="Purple Heart">Purple Heart</a> for bravery in combat. Upon his return to the States he worked as a waiter/<a href="../../../m/a/%C3%AE/Ma%C3%AEtre_d%27.html" title="Maître d'">maître d'</a> in the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catskill_Mountains_a8d8.html" title="Catskill Mountains">Catskill Mountain</a> resorts in upstate <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> during their heyday. He was later quoted as saying his experience as a maître d' and with the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker.html" title="Poker">poker</a> games he hosted behind the scenes was good training for his eventual career as a promoter. <a href="../../../t/i/t/Tito_Puente_9b33.html" title="Tito Puente">Tito Puente</a>, who played some of these resorts, went on record once saying that Graham was avid to learn <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> from him, but only cared about the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Profanity.html" title="Profanity">curse words</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Graham_%28promoter%29_4953.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>Graham moved from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> in the early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> to be closer to his sister, Rita. He was invited to attend a free concert in <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Gate_Park_61a6.html" title="Golden Gate Park">Golden Gate Park</a>, where he made contact with the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Mime_Troupe_ab11.html" title="San Francisco Mime Troupe">San Francisco Mime Troupe</a>. He gave up a promising business career to manage the troupe in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a> and produce concerts. One of the first concerts he promoted was in partnership with <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chet_Helms_e2f4.html" title="Chet Helms">Chet Helms</a> of the Family Dog organization and featured the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. The concert was an overwhelming success and Graham saw an opportunity with the band. The next morning, he called the band's manager, Albert Grossman, and obtained exclusive rights to promote them. Shortly after that, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chet_Helms_e2f4.html" title="Chet Helms">Chet Helms</a> showed up at Graham's office, asking how Graham could have cut him out of the deal. Graham pointed out that Helms would not have known about it unless he had tried to do the same thing to Graham and advised him to "get up earlier in the morning" in the future.</p>
<p>A magnetic but often difficult personality, Graham's shows attracted elements of America's now legendary <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterculture.html" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a> of the time such as <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Airplane_0cc6.html" title="Jefferson Airplane">Jefferson Airplane</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janis_Joplin_70f1.html" title="Janis Joplin">Janis Joplin</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_Joe_and_The_Fish_132e.html" title="Country Joe and The Fish">Country Joe and The Fish</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Ferlinghetti_56d2.html" title="Lawrence Ferlinghetti">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Committee_e208.html" title="The Committee">The Committee</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fugs_b323.html" title="The Fugs">The Fugs</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>, and, a particular favorite of Graham's, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Grateful_Dead_2a61.html" title="The Grateful Dead">The Grateful Dead</a>. His successes and popularity allowed him to become the top concert promoter in <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a>. He operated the famous venues the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Fillmore_West_df4c.html" title="Fillmore West">Fillmore West</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winterland.html" title="Winterland">Winterland</a> (both in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>) and the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Fillmore_East_8e16.html" title="Fillmore East">Fillmore East</a> (in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>), where the best up-and-coming acts would come to play. Graham promoted the West-Coast leg of the legendary <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_American_Tour_1972_3702.html" title="The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972">The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972</a>, a.k.a. Stones Touring Party, as well as parts of the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> tours. He would then promote the entire <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_American_Tour_1981_06d7.html" title="Rolling Stones American Tour 1981">Rolling Stones American Tour 1981</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_European_Tour_1982_a992.html" title="Rolling Stones European Tour 1982">Rolling Stones European Tour 1982</a>. When the Stones returned with touring in 1989 with the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel_Wheels_0495.html" title="Steel Wheels">Steel Wheels</a> tour, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Jagger_1896.html" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> took on the offer of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Cohl_eff8.html" title="Michael Cohl">Michael Cohl</a>'s The BCL Group (Ballard Cohl Labatt). Cohl made his reputation in 1989 by buying the concert, sponsorship, merchandising, radio, television, and film rights to The Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels Tour. The tour became the most financially successful rock tour in history. Graham later found out that Cohl had only offered a very limited amount more money, and Graham took Jagger's repudiation as a personal defeat, writing "Losing the Stones was like watching my favourite lover become a whore.".</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>'s, he closed the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Fillmore.html" title="Fillmore">Fillmores</a> on both coasts, citing a need to "find himself." He retreated to a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> island, but found the peace disconcerting and later admitted he had trouble with the fact that no one knew who he was there.</p>
<p>He returned to promoting, first putting on concerts at smaller venues, like the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley_Community_Theatre_6407.html" title="Berkeley Community Theatre">Berkeley Community Theatre</a> on the campus of <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley_High_School_98db.html" title="Berkeley High School">Berkeley High School</a>. He then leased the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winterland.html" title="Winterland">Winterland</a> Arena in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and promoted shows at the <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cow_Palace_3db2.html" title="Cow Palace">Cow Palace</a> Auditorium in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Daly_City_b5e8.html" title="Daly City">Daly City</a>. His first large-scale outdoor arena concert was a benefit for the San Francisco after-school programs, called the SNACK concert and starred <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, with <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Young_9315.html" title="Neil Young">Neil Young</a> and members of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Band_86d7.html" title="The Band">The Band</a>. He was careful to make sure everything ran smoothly at his events, fearing the unpredictable nature of large crowds, and became known for his explosive response to anyone deviating from procedure.</p>
<p>In the mid 1980s, in conjunction with the city of <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_View%2C_California_614f.html" title="Mountain View, California">Mountain View, California</a>, he masterminded the creation of the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoreline_Amphitheatre_b34b.html" title="Shoreline Amphitheatre">Shoreline Amphitheatre</a>, which became the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Peninsula_c793.html" title="San Francisco Peninsula">San Francisco Peninsula</a>'s major venue for outdoor rock concerts.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>He would go on to set the standard for well-produced large scale <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_concert.html" title="Rock concert">rock concerts</a>, such as the American portion of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_Aid_f42b.html" title="Live Aid">Live Aid</a> in <a href="../../../j/f/k/JFK_Stadium_0d25.html" title="JFK Stadium">JFK Stadium</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> on July 13, 1985, as well as the 1986 <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Conspiracy_of_Hope_Tour_e8c2.html" title="A Conspiracy of Hope Tour">A Conspiracy of Hope</a> and 1988 <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Now%21_Tour_bddc.html" title="Human Rights Now! Tour">Human Rights Now!</a> tours for <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty_International_6202.html" title="Amnesty International">Amnesty International</a>. In addition, he presented regular concerts in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Bay_Area_b47d.html" title="San Francisco Bay Area">Bay Area</a> stadiums, referred to as "<a href="../../../d/a/y/Days_on_the_Green_d61d.html" title="Days on the Green">Days on the Green</a>," and was known to aggressively challenge potential competition, referring to other promoters by the name "<a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Schlitz_Brewing_Company_dc26.html" title="Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company">Joe Schlitz</a>." He was often seen pounding his fist into his open hand and announcing that "Joe Schlitz will not come into this town."</p>
<p>For all his competitive nature and fiery disposition, Graham was recognized as an expert promoter who genuinely cared about both the artists and the attendees at his concerts. He was the first to ensure that medical personnel were on site for large shows and was both a contributor and supporter of the <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haight-Ashbury_f0db.html" title="Haight-Ashbury">Haight-Ashbury</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_clinic.html" title="Free clinic">Free Clinic</a>, which he often used as medical support at events. He also loved putting together groups onstage from different ethnic backgrounds—many of whom were ignored by other promoters—and he had an eye for pleasing his audience, while making an effort to educate them in styles of music they would otherwise not have been exposed to.</p>
<p>In management, Graham is credited with the early careers of groups like <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Santana_e8e5.html" title="Carlos Santana">Santana</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Money_493d.html" title="Eddie Money">Eddie Money</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beat_%28US%29_4680.html" title="The Beat (US)">Paul Collins' Beat</a>. He was also responsible for promoting the careers of virtually every other group that played the concert circuit between 1965 and 1991.</p>
<p>Graham's status as a Holocaust survivor came into play in the mid-1980s, during the presidency of <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. When Graham learned that Reagan intended to lay a wreath at the <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitburg.html" title="Bitburg">Bitburg</a> Cemetery in <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, where <a href="../../../s/s/_/SS_d53a.html" title="SS">SS</a> Officers were buried, he organized protests against the act. During the same month that Reagan visited the cemetery, Graham's office was firebombed by <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazi_5279.html" title="Neo-Nazi">Neo-Nazis</a>. Graham, in France at the time, meeting with <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Geldof_005d.html" title="Bob Geldof">Bob Geldof</a> to organize the first <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_Aid_f42b.html" title="Live Aid">Live Aid</a> concert, was informed of the fire via telephone. He responded as follows: "Was anybody hurt?" It was only after he was told that everyone was okay, he asked, "Is anything left?"</p>
<p>Graham also was instrumental in commissioning and marketing <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychedelic.html" title="Psychedelic">psychedelic</a> concert posters by designers including <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wes_Wilson_750f.html" title="Wes Wilson">Wes Wilson</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Griffin_c480.html" title="Rick Griffin">Rick Griffin</a>. These posters are now considered collector's items.</p>
<p>Graham had a lifelong dream to become a character actor, professing a great admiration for <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_G._Robinson_87cd.html" title="Edward G. Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a>. He appeared in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Ford_Coppola_16ad.html" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse_Now_a6a5.html" title="Apocalypse Now">Apocalypse Now</a></i>, as a promoter. In 1990, director <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_Levinson_b15f.html" title="Barry Levinson">Barry Levinson</a> and actor <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Beatty_c7a4.html" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> provided an opportunity for Graham to take a more substantive role by casting him as <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucky_Luciano_5d8b.html" title="Lucky Luciano">Charles "Lucky" Luciano</a> in the film <i><a href="../../../b/u/g/Bugsy.html" title="Bugsy">Bugsy</a></i>. During one scene, Graham is shown in a Latin dance number, a style of dancing Graham had embraced in later life. He also appears as a promoter in the 1991 Oliver Stone film "The Doors".</p>

Graham had attended the event to discuss promoting a <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefit_concert.html" title="Benefit concert">benefit concert</a> for the victims of the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Hills_firestorm_5e43.html" title="Oakland Hills firestorm">Oakland firestorm</a>, after a great portion of the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland%2C_California_0bc0.html" title="Oakland, California">Oakland</a>/<a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley%2C_California_6eb4.html" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley</a> Hills burned down.</p>
<p>Once he had obtained the commitment from the band to perform, he returned to his helicopter, but was stopped by the bass player from the News, Mario Cippolina, who, in a moment of foresight, pressed Graham to take his limousine. The helicopter crashed shortly after take-off, just 20 miles from the concert site.</p>
<p>Flying in weather reported as low overcast, rain and gusty winds, the aircraft flew directly into a 223-foot high-voltage tower along <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_State_Route_37_7428.html" title="California State Route 37">Hwy 37</a>, which runs between <a href="../../../v/a/l/Vallejo.html" title="Vallejo">Vallejo</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marin_County_e01c.html" title="Marin County">Marin County</a>.</p>
<p>Also killed in the crash was Graham's girlfriend at the time, Melissa Gold, ex-wife of author <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Gold_2adc.html" title="Herbert Gold">Herbert Gold</a>.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Graham was married one time (wife: Bonnie) and had several long-term relationships throughout his life. He was survived by his sisters and two sons: <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Graham_5fea.html" title="David Graham">David Graham</a> and Alex Graham.</p>
<p>Following his death, his company, Bill Graham Presents, was taken over by a group of employees. Graham's sons were not part of the new management team. The new owners then went on to sell the company to SFX promotions. SFX then sold the company to Clear Channel Entertainment. The BGP staff never embraced the Clear Channel name, and several members of the BGP staff eventually left the company, including former President/CEO Gregg Perloff and former Senior Vice President Sherry Wasserman, who went on to start their own company, Another Planet Entertainment. Eventually Clear Channel divested it's investment in concert production altogether. Bill Graham Presents, along with other independent promoters previously held under SFX, formed <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_Nation_effd.html" title="Live Nation">Live Nation</a> and are now the largest concert production/promotion company in the world.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Civic_Auditorium_cf6e.html" title="San Francisco Civic Auditorium">San Francisco Civic Auditorium</a> was renamed for Graham as a tribute and a memorial service held for him in <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Gate_Park_61a6.html" title="Golden Gate Park">Golden Gate Park</a> attracted one of the biggest crowds the park had ever seen and included many of the bands Graham had been instrumental in supporting.</p>

<p>Bill Sagan (Former CEO of EBP) of Minnetonka, MN bought the Bill Graham Presents archives and has organized hundreds of millions of dollars worth of merchandise and video/audio recordings of concerts collected by Graham. Sagan is now selling some of the collection at <a href="http://concerts.wolfgangsvault.com/" class="external text" title="http://concerts.wolfgangsvault.com/" rel="nofollow">Wolfgang's Vault</a>, named for Bill's given name at birth. Sagan is now being sued, by several of the artists, for alleged rights infringement. The law firm of Thelen Reid is handling the case.</p>
<p>The Wolfgang's Vault website is paying artist as if they were an Internet radio station. It provides all music for free and pays its bills with the sale of concert memorabilia. <a href="http://forums.wolfgangsvault.com/forums/thread/6973.aspx" class="external text" title="http://forums.wolfgangsvault.com/forums/thread/6973.aspx" rel="nofollow">More Info</a></p>
