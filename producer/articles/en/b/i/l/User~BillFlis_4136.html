</ul>
<p>Edward Shippen was born in Philadelphia, the son of merchant Edward Shippen III. The Shippen family had been central in the area's economic and political life. There was a large family network, and many of its members held multiple public offices simultaneously. Edward was no different. He learned law from <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tench_Francis_d4b1.html" title="Tench Francis">Tench Francis</a>, then Pennsylvania's attorney general and his future father-in-law; young Shippen married Margaret Francis in 1753, and together they had nine children. After completing his legal studies at the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Temple_a0a0.html" title="Middle Temple">Middle Temple</a> in London, Shippen was appointed judge of the admiralty in 1755. Three years later he was elected to the city's common council. He became a member of Pennsylvania's Provincial Council in 1770. He was also a member of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Philosophical_Society_9e83.html" title="American Philosophical Society">American Philosophical Society</a>.</p>
<p>Through the 1760s and early 1770s, the Shippens enjoyed broad political power, but when the American Revolution erupted, they were deposed. Edward, like many of his family members, tried to remain neutral in the conflict until it became clear which side would win. He assumed such a position because, although he was opposed to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stamp_Act_70a5.html" title="Stamp Act">Stamp Act</a> and other increasingly imperial measures, he also wished to retain his multiple offices, a practice outlawed by the revolutionaries. With the creation of the state of Pennsylvania in 1776, Shippen lost his appointments as judge of the admiralty court, prothonotary of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and member of the governor's council. Shippen feared the replacement of the provincial assembly with a radical provincial convention consisting of radical <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_Matlack_b240.html" title="Timothy Matlack">Timothy Matlack</a> and other such "violent wrongheaded people of the inferior class." That same year Philadelphia abolished the Common Council, the majority of which had been Shippen kinsmen.</p>
<p>As neither Tory nor Patriot, Shippen treaded carefully through the Revolutionary years. He was not arrested by the Revolutionary governments, but like many other royal government officials, he signed a "parole" promising not to interfere with the new government nor to flee the area. Shippen and his family retreated to the nearby countryside at the start of the war, and then returned to Philadelphia to protect his property when the British force was on the verge of taking the city. When the British evacuated in 1778, Shippen chose to remain, and cast his lot with the rebels. Two of his daughters were soon married off to prominent revolutionaries, Major Edward Burd, and General Benedict Arnold. When the latter was found to be a traitor, his young Shippen wife was forced to return to Philadelphia in shame.</p>
<p>After the war Shippen suffered from the loss of political appointments and endured difficult financial times, but eventually his skill as a jurist secured him judicial positions such as president of Philadelphia's Court of Common Pleas and judge of the orphan's court. Ultimately, in 1791, he regained some of his former prestige with an appointment to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, serving with Jasper Yeates and Edward Burd, both kinsmen and former students. Shippen became chief justice in 1799, but then, in 1804 he was impeached on flimsy, political grounds. The next year the Pennsylvania Senate acquitted him and his associates. Shippen retired to private life and died soon thereafter.</p>
<p>Shippen served as a Penn trustee for almost fifty years. He was first elected a trustee of the College and Academy of Philadelphia in 1758 when he was only thirty years old. He continued to serve in this capacity through the American Revolution and the early days of the Republic, including a stint as the board's treasurer in 1764 and 1765. Shippen did not serve on the board of the University of the State of Pennsylvania during its existence from 1779 to 1791. When the College and the University of the State of Pennsylvania were united to form the University of Pennsylvania in 1791, Shippen was elected by the College to serve on the University of Pennsylvania's board of trustees. He served until his death in 1806.</p>
<p>Edward Shippen, son of the second Edward, jurist, born in Philadelphia, 16 February, 1729; died there, 16 April, 1806, at the age of seventeen began the study of the law with Tench Francis, and, while pursuing his studies, drafted the first common recovery in Pennsylvania. In 1748 he went to London to complete his law studies at the Middle Temple, and, returning to Philadelphia, was admitted to the bar. On 22 November, 1752, he was appointed the vice admiralty, and in 1755 he became one of the commissioners to wait upon the "Paxton Boys," who were engaged in an insurrection, to persuade them to disperse, which mission was successful. He held several local offices until the Revolution. He took a deep interest in the provincial wars, and watched and recorded every occasion when the provincial troops were successful. In 1762 he was appointed prothonotary of the supreme court, retaining this post till the Revolution. He became a member of the provincial council in 1770, in which office he served for five years. During the war for independence he probably sympathized with the mother country, as he was, by order of the council, placed on his parole to give neither succor nor information to the enemy. He remained in Philadelphia during the British occupancy.</p>
<p>In May, 1784, he was appointed president judge of the court of common pleas, and in September of the same year he became a judge of the high court of errors and appeals, which latter office he retained until 1806, when the court was abolished. In 1785 he was chosen a justice for the dock ward of Philadelphia, and in the same year was appointed president of the court of quarter sessions of the peace and oyer and terminer. In 1791, at which time he was still at the head of the Court of Common Pleas, he was appointed an associate justice of the Supreme Court, in which office he served till 1799. Governor McKean then nominated Judge Shippen to be the chief justice, which office he resigned in 1805. He "was a man of large views," said Chief-Justice Tilghman. "Everything that fell from that venerated man," said Judge Duncan, "is entitled to great respect."</p>
<p>The best extant portrait of him is that by Gilbert Stuart, now in the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, and is represented in the accompanying vignette. To his pen we owe the first law reports in Pennsylvania. In 1790 he received the degree of LL. D. from the University of Pennsylvania, of which institution he was a trustee from 1791 till his death.</p>
<p>He died on April 16, 1806 at Philadelphia at age 77.</p>

<p>In 1684, Jeremiah Langhorne, with his wife, Grace, and his children, Jeremiah and Sarah, withdrew his certificate from the Friends Monthly Meeting at Kendal in Westmoreland and came to America, settling in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He represented Bucks County in the Assembly. His sister, Sarah Langhorne, married William Biles, Jr., the son of the settler.

<p>Of interest to Black History is the early land ownership of the town's very center. Jeremiah Langhorne, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and a substantial landholder in Bucks County, deeded approximately 300 acres from the present Hamilton Street, one block west of the main intersection, extending easterly along Court Street to East Street (outside the district) to his two slaves Cudjo and Jo to become free landholders after his death in 1742. Soon after this date the lands were sold to Isabell Crawford and subsequently divided into large lots to become the basis for Doylestown's development, including the location of Doyle's second tavern.</p>

</ol>
<p>Some sources cite Wm. Crispin as having married Ann Jasper rather than Rebecca Bradshaw; it has been determined that this was an error which has been perpetuated in the literature; Wm Penn's father, Admiral Penn, and Rebecca Bradshaw's mother, Rachel Penn Bradshaw, were brother and sister, making Rebecca Bradshaw Crispin &amp; Wm Penn, found of PA, 1st cousins - and their son, Silas Crispin, a 1st cousin once removed, in accord with the letters Wm and Silas exchanged, in which they referred to each other as cousins.</p>
