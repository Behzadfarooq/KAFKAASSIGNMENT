<p>I hope that this message is of interest to you, if not please accept my apologies. There is a poll in the talk page of the 'Macedonian Slavs' article here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Macedonian_Slavs#The_poll" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Macedonian_Slavs#The_poll" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Macedonian_Slavs#The_poll</a></p>
<p>Some people are lobbying for changing the article's name to Macedonians without any qualifier. As it seems, a number of these people come from the Macedonian/Macedonian Slav wikipedia project. It seemed only fair to attract the attention of people possibly from the other side of the story. Your contributions to the discussion and the poll are welcomed.</p>

<dd>I am sorry but I do not fulfill the requirements to participate in the poll. Most of my contributions were done after June 11th, as I still had my exams by that date and did not have the time or the chance to surf the Internet.

<p>I am having a lot of trouble since I've joined here. I've bee naccused to being a sock puppet by someone who I beleive to be a sock puppet. This has caused much consternation, and I was willing to write it off completely after getting the page at issue frozen. that was as far as I could take it. But now I've been branded a sock puppet, and a vanda- WHICH I AM NOT!!!!!!! It has affected my other edits. Now, the person causing this trouble for me has had some decent edits in the past. PLease don't let that mislead you to his torublesome pattern. He has now said my edits are not real or true. This is very hurtful, and makes others think that I'm not really trying, but if you go through my edits you will see that I've added to the articels, or cleaned them up signifigantly, or simply wiki fied them where they needed. I have done my fair share in the face of this onslaught that willmcw has launcheed against me. He is actually in cahoots with someone called Sojmabi Pinola, and that person is a sock puppet for the subject of the article at issue- Biff Rose.</p>
<p>I ask you to help me, as this libelous behavior by willmcw to my user page is wrecking my credibility on edits, and causing me unease. thank you..<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_espinola_f2ae.html" title="User:Steve espinola">Steve espinola</a> 06:35, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Upon <b>*much*</b> further research, I have determined that the operator of <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_espinola_f2ae.html" title="User:Steve espinola">User:Steve espinola</a> similiarly operates at least 5 different accounts noted at <a href="../../../b/i/f/Talk%7EBiff_Rose_909d.html" title="Talk:Biff Rose">Talk:Biff_Rose</a>; all accounts were created after 4th August and all accounts are involved in vandalism and/or very POV edit wars. — <a href="../../../h/o/p/User%7EHopeSeekr_of_xMule_05f3.html" title="User:HopeSeekr of xMule">HopeSeekr of xMule</a> (<a href="../../../h/o/p/User_talk%7EHopeSeekr_of_xMule_f439.html" title="User talk:HopeSeekr of xMule">Talk</a>) 17:19, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Another thumbs down about this guy calling himself "Steve Espinola." If you look closely at the content of his edits, on the Biff Rose page and elsewhere, they are generally destructive. He is posting on Wikipedia under a bunch of names, including the name "Biff Rose". On the other hand, my name IS actually Steve Espinola and has been so for 38 years (I can prove it), and I'm a friend of Biff's; he created accounts under those names in an attempt to needle us. He has also created a user name that differs from this one by one letter. Not only is he making destructive edits, he is spreading serious libel under some of those names. There is a consistent style and intent to his writing, in spite of all the different names. If you look closely at what he is writing, his story falls apart. Mine does not. <a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> 18:37, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Listen, Steve, I do not believe that a silly dispute can be a reason for you to withdraw from Wikipedia. I see all this accusing each other and, honestly, it doesn't feel at all good. I would suggest to all parties that we talk this out to find a solution. Cooperation is the key to the good function of this encyclopedia and cooperation will be what will solve this issue.

<dd>Anyway, I got the point. Thanks for your comments but I request that you stop posting more. I have retired from the case, so stop bugging me. (Although I have to admit that the whole thing is taking an amusing character - at least for a third party. I only hope that I am not accused of being one of Mr. Espinola's alleged sockpuppets.) --<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_the_Greek_6df5.html" title="User:Bill the Greek">Bill the Greek</a> 07:31, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear all,</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia was recently a subject of intensive research of an huge international human right organization. A team of people from different nationalities and ages were acting on Wikipedia for 20 days, investigating previously noted anomalities of Wikipedia free editing and forming a final report, which (between the others similar reports) will later be a guide to all future moves of the organization concerning Wikipedia. Acting under an account of a real person, their privacy is to be held private. Therefore, very few private information will be revealed.</dd>
<dd>Also, this is a result of the lack of final possition of the organization concerning Wikipedia and human rights, which was still not formed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The team's final post on Wikipedia, where they explain their actions can be found on the following addresses:</dd>

<p>Hi, I understand that you are either Greek Wikipedian or a Wikipedian living in/with an interest in Greece.</p>

<p>There are some editing anomalies appearing on the Fill Your Heat discussion page. An administrator named Will Beback is canceling any opposing statements and branding new users as sock puppets of someone else. This is highly irregular and very biased. Please help.Magri garou</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not Biff Rose... Not again!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will try to be clear with this one. The user under the name Magri garou has only one edit <i>at all</i> and this is the one above this paragraph. This is rather suspicious on its own. I also saw the name of <a href="../../../s/o/j/User%7ESojambi_Pinola_29c4.html" title="User:Sojambi Pinola">Sojambi Pinola</a> featuring prominently on the discussion page of the article. This name too brings to my mind last year's <a href="#Help.21.21.21" title="">"case"</a>, which left me very annoyed at the time. I just don't want to concern any more with this case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For which, by the way, you didn't exactly give me any accurate information: the article is not Fill Your Heat but <a href="../../../f/i/l/Fill_Your_Heart_644a.html" title="Fill Your Heart">Fill Your Heart</a>, and I had to do some digging to find that based on the only correct piece of information this post gave me (the administrator's name). It seems to me as common sense that I cannot really help anyone unless one actually gives me <i>something</i> to work on, you know.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Which will not happen this time. And it is a fact that I hadn't renewed my membership to the <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a> at the time this post was sent, even though I had updated my user and talk pages. Which means that someone found me from my small involvement last year. I really thought this whole matter was over. And I am tired of it. I am sorry but I cannot help. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_the_Greek_6df5.html" title="User:Bill the Greek">Bill the Greek</a> 08:07, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
