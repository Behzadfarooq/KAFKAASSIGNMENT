<p><b>Billy</b> (full name <b>William</b>) is a title character from the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animated_television_series.html" title="Animated television series">animated television series</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy_4065.html" title="The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy</a></i>.

<p>Billy is an astonishingly incompetent red-headed child with an absurdly oversized nose, and an I.Q. of -5, which is even lower than being <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_retardation.html" title="Mental retardation">mentally retarded</a>. However, in <i>Billy gets an A</i>, Billy's I.Q. rises tremendously, being able to solve math problems incredibly fast and defeats an advanced chess computer. However, at the end of the episode, he seems to forget it all and once again have an I.Q. of negative five. Like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_%28Billy_and_Mandy%29_4679.html" title="Harold (Billy and Mandy)">his father</a>, he has a number of unpleasant habits, including nose-picking, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatulence.html" title="Flatulence">flatulence</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chauvinism.html#male_chauvinism" title="Chauvinism">male chauvinism</a>, eating <a href="../../../f/e/c/Feces.html" title="Feces">feces</a>, and unapologetic idiocy. Prone to surprising (if nonsensical) fits of rage that scare Grim and even Mandy (<a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Peeps_4849.html" title="My Peeps">My Peeps</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Clowns_a772.html" title="Attack of the Clowns">Attack of the Clowns</a>!) He is extremely hyperactive, with a knack for causing all kinds of disasters and ending up in various parallel dimensions, usually by experimenting with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Grim%27s_supernatural_items_in_The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy_89b6.html" title="List of Grim's supernatural items in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy">Grim's various supernatural items</a> in Grim's chest. Billy was possessed by an evil sprit after reading Grim's "Bad Book".</p>
<p>The most obvious fact about Billy is his stupidity. Billy is so incredibly dull that a brain-eating meteorite couldn't find anything to eat (<i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Rock_of_Horror___Dream_a_Little_Dream_b94b.html" title="Little Rock of Horror / Dream a Little Dream">Little Rock of Horror</a></i>) and so sent him off as its servant to gather "those with brains in their heads"; in another episode, Irwin's grandmother goes so far to say "yo mama so stupid that she copied off of Billy's test"; he attempts to eat himself when he is turned into <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chocolate.html" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/h/o/Chocolate_Sailor___The_Good%2C_The_Bad_and_The_Toothless_db92.html" title="Chocolate Sailor / The Good, The Bad and The Toothless">Chocolate Sailor</a></i>) (which leaves him with only a head) despite multiple warnings not to do so; and he totally ignores a massive battle between a titanic, gargoyle-like Mrs. Claus and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mandy_%28Billy_and_Mandy%29_a259.html" title="Mandy (Billy and Mandy)">Mandy</a> while walking through to deliver an antidote to Santa (<i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_and_Mandy_Save_Christmas_2c9f.html" title="Billy and Mandy Save Christmas">Billy and Mandy Save Christmas</a></i>). Billy forgets what's happening in almost every episode, and he almost never knows what is going on around him. For example, he will often ignore bolts of magical energy flying around his head simply because he found something shiny, slimy, weird to play with, or something that slightly looks like <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candy.html" title="Candy">candy</a>; he has an extreme fear of trivial things like <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clown.html" title="Clown">clowns</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invertebrate.html" title="Invertebrate">bugs</a> or the mailman, but he can be calm when he is being kidnapped by the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> or a giant evil meteorite is trying to suck his brain. Billy sees the world around him in a very different way, meaning his behavior can be completely unpredictable.</p>
<p>Billy has many odd, meaningless, and often dangerous antics. He has a fondness for video games (as seen in <i><a href="../../../n/u/r/Nursery_Crimes___My_Peeps_d27e.html" title="Nursery Crimes / My Peeps">My Peeps</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/_/g/A_Grim_Surprise___Beast_and_Barbarians_aaaf.html" title="A Grim Surprise / Beast and Barbarians">Beasts and Barbarians</a></i>), a tendency to eat gut-busting junk food, and an incredible talent for absorbing things that he sees on television and video-games, often confusing them with the reality. For example, in the episode <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Zero___Sickly_Sweet_0325.html" title="Super Zero / Sickly Sweet">Super Zero</a></i>, after watching his favourite superhero's show, he imagines that he has superpowers and acts out finishing scene of the show (including the commercials for a strawberry yogurt). He can watch a turned-off TV, laundry washing machine or even a paint drying like he is watching a television show. Billy has a remarkable ability for getting into trouble and ending up in places as far away as the alternate universe in Mighty Moe's beard to the far depths of outer space (where he was a yogurt-shooting superhero). He has a propensity for digging into Grim's trunk, and his cat Milkshakes's "secret hut", a.k.a litter box.</p>
<p>It is also referenced in the Christmas special, Billy and Mandy Save Christmas, that Billy might be Jewish. In the ending credits, he says that he has Hanukkah at his house, and doesn't celebrate Christmas.</p>
<p>We also find out that he's part Asian in <i>Billy Gets an A</i>, when Grim and Mandy travel back in time and find an Asian ancestor of his father, Harold.</p>
<p>Also, in "Billy and Mandy Begins", Billy claims that the 'stork' delivered him to his parents just before they got married. According to this, Billy is an illegitimate child.</p>
<p><a name=".22Ignorance_is_Bliss.22"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_%28Billy_and_Mandy%29_1e34.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Ignorance is Bliss&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Ignorance is Bliss"</span></h3>
<p>His stupidity frequently leads to all kinds of disasters, but he often confirms that "ignorance is bliss" - Billy's blindness is surprisingly helpful to him, as it allowes him to ignore punishment (both physical and mental) that would be quite serious to anyone else. Because of it, Billy is surprisingly good in a fight, as he is durable and can do many strange things to survive violent and dangerous situations. It also gives him surprising insight into the nature of various things, and he can often suggest "dumbed-down" solutions that both Grim and Mandy would have ignored. His greatest contribution may be his ability to distract others; the sheer strangeness of Billy's actions (which includes pie-chasing, dog-running, and other bizarre pursuits) can often distract villains long enough for Mandy or Grim to enact whatever plan they are concocting. It should be noted that Billy is smart enough to recognize that, in <i>Son of Nergal</i>, Junior's impression of Mandy is wrong.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_%28Billy_and_Mandy%29_1e34.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Angry Billy&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Angry Billy"</span></h3>
<p>Billy had an irrational <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coulrophobia.html" title="Coulrophobia">Coulrophobia</a>, or a fear of clowns, which he overcame after a conversation with his "Inner Frat Boy" in the episode <i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Clowns___Complete_and_Utter_Chaos_1e4c.html" title="Attack of the Clowns / Complete and Utter Chaos">Attack of the Clowns</a></i>, leading him to attack anything even half-clownlike (including Grim and Mandy, who were wearing clown suits at the time) with extreme violence. In fact, violence is part of the core of Billy; his rages, surprising and bizarre as they are, seem to have a massive positive effect on his I.Q. and give him the ability to perform super-human feats. These rages, which can spark because he is afraid or for seemingly no reason at all, give Billy incredible endurance and a shift away from "happy" Billy (his normally idiotic self) to "angry" Billy (his voice even changes in the shifts, becoming lower and more guttural). He will attack the thing that makes him angry very violently. He possibly inherited this trait from his mother as she can be seen doing smilar things in episodes such as [[<i>Grim Vs. Mom</i>]]. "Angry" Billy may be Billy's way of keeping up with his two friends; Grim is Death and Mandy is, well, Mandy. To keep up with these two superhumanly-powered beings, Billy may well have decided to go nuts. When Billy gets seriously angry, we can sometimes see his nostrils flaring when most of the time they are not visible at all, and sometimes he emmites a clicking noise from his teeth when aggitated.</p>
<p>The "Angry Billy" can often be seen in episodes with <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_the_Spider_d9e5.html" title="Jeff the Spider">Jeff the Spider</a>, the supposed son of Billy. Billy is very violent towards him and attacks him on sight, smashing him with furniture and jabbing with big sticks. He behaves similar to any spider he sees, so it's safe to assume he has an extreme case of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arachnophobia.html" title="Arachnophobia">arachnophobia</a>.</p>

<p>Billy has or had many pets, and the way he treats them illustrates his incompetence to do anything. In the episode <i><a href="../../../k/e/e/Keeper_of_the_Reaper_b280.html" title="Keeper of the Reaper">Keeper of the Reaper</a></i>, Mandy referenced to many Billy's pets from the past, and brought several of them to testify how Billy treated them. <i><a href="../../../l/i/27/Li%27l_Porkchop_a1f0.html" title="Li'l Porkchop">Li'l Porkchop</a></i> (Who has an <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_088f.html" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> accent) said that he was Billy's pet for only 11 minutes (the length of the episode), and that he still has nightmares from them. She also referenced to Wiggy Jiggy Jed from the episode <i><a href="../../../d/r/e/Dream_Mutt___Scythe_for_Sale_4c55.html" title="Dream Mutt / Scythe for Sale">Dream Mutt</a></i>, but Billy said that it doesn't count - "I had a good reason! He bored me!" (even though he actually destroyed him because he made a doomsday machine to steal all the beds in the world).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Milkshakes</b>: Billy has a cute small pink cat called Milkshakes which is often a target for supernatural occurrences - she was possessed by Grim, and later Mandy (<i><a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_Out_of_My_Head%21_6ee8.html" title="Get Out of My Head!">Get Out of My Head!</a></i>), made intelligent by a bookworm (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crawling_Niceness___Smarten_Up___The_Grim_Show_7163.html" title="The Crawling Niceness / Smarten Up / The Grim Show">Smarten Up</a></i>), blown up by a living action figure (<i><a href="../../../t/h/a/That%27s_My_Mummy___Toys_Will_Be_Toys_4e6c.html" title="That's My Mummy / Toys Will Be Toys">Toys Will Be Toys</a></i>), eaten by a clown-monster (<i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Clowns___Complete_and_Utter_Chaos_1e4c.html" title="Attack of the Clowns / Complete and Utter Chaos">Attack of the Clowns</a></i>), and many other strange things. Her meow is done by <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grey_DeLisle_42a1.html" title="Grey DeLisle">Grey DeLisle</a>.</li>
<li><b>Daisy the Chupacabra</b>: In <i><a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck%21___Aren%27t_You_Chupacabra_To_See_Me__57ec.html" title="Duck! / Aren't You Chupacabra To See Me?">Aren't You Chupacabra To See Me?</a></i>, he had a <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chupacabra.html" title="Chupacabra">Chupacabra</a>, named Daisy, obtained from a cursed video tape. He couldn't control "Daisy", so Grim and Mandy had to convince him to get rid of her.</li>
<li><b>Li'l Porkchop</b>: In <i><a href="../../../l/i/27/Li%27l_Porkchop___Skarred_for_Life_475c.html" title="Li'l Porkchop / Skarred for Life">Li'l Porkchop</a></i>, he got a pathetically small fish Li'l Porkchop, which was hardly breathing. Grim turned Li'l Porkchop into a giant-mutant fish with his powers, which acted and shared the same accent with <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_schwarzenegger.html" title="Arnold schwarzenegger">Arnold schwarzenegger</a>.</li>
<li><b>Irwin the Werewolf</b>: In <i><a href="../../../t/w/e/Tween_Wolf_6ca4.html" title="Tween Wolf">Tween Wolf</a></i>, he adopted a werewolf, thinking that it is a puppy, even going so far as to naming him "Sprinkles". The werewolf was actually his friend <a href="../../../i/r/w/Irwin_%28Billy_and_Mandy%29_6f55.html" title="Irwin (Billy and Mandy)">Irwin</a>. Irwin, although a werewolf, behaved greatly, and Billy entered him on Endsville annual Dog Show.</li>
<li><b>Wiggy Jiggy Jed</b>: In <i><a href="../../../d/r/e/Dream_Mutt___Scythe_for_Sale_4c55.html" title="Dream Mutt / Scythe for Sale">Dream Mutt</a></i> he had a dog, which Grim created by combining four dogs (all females). He was named Wiggy Jiggy Jed, but his real name is Sir William Wexell Wingding Whizzlebang the Third. He was destroyed because he tried to steal every bed on Earth (though in <i><a href="../../../k/e/e/Keeper_of_the_Reaper_b280.html" title="Keeper of the Reaper">Keeper of the Reaper</a></i>, he says that he did so because Wiggy Jiggy Jed bored him).</li>
<li><b>Admiral Wolverine Lightning Bolt</b>: In <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_and_Mandy_vs._the_Martians_a259.html" title="Billy and Mandy vs. the Martians">Billy and Mandy vs. the Martians</a></i>, he got a calot (martian dog), named "Admiral Wolverine Lightning Bolt" because "those are the coolest words in the universe!". Admiral Wolverine Lightning Bolt helped Billy and Mandy to fight off the Martian zombies. At the end of the episode he stayed with them on Earth, but hasn't appeared since then.</li>
<li><b>Mr. Snuggles</b>: He had, and still has a sick old hamster Mr. Snuggles. In <i><a href="../../../m/e/e/Meet_the_Reaper___Skeletons_in_the_Water_Closet_4f02.html" title="Meet the Reaper / Skeletons in the Water Closet">Meet the Reaper</a></i>, the first episode, he and Mandy had a bet with the Grim Reaper over hamster's soul. They won, and the Grim Reaper is now their best friend forever. Since then, the hamster has been seen several times. By some weird means, even before Grim arrived on the scene, Mr. Snuggles gained an incredibly long life of over 10 years, or, as Billy put it in the first episode, "a gajillion in hamster years."</li>
<li><b>Winky</b>: Winky appeared in <i><a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Planter_And_The_Chamber_Pot_of_Secrets_16a1.html" title="Nigel Planter And The Chamber Pot of Secrets">Nigel Planter And The Chamber Pot of Secrets</a></i> while Billy was fooling around with a <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magical_wand.html" title="Magical wand">magical wand</a> on his nose. Only half of him was seen, the lower half. He was sent away by Mandy because Winky had <a href="../../../u/r/i/Urinated.html" title="Urinated">urinated</a>, but seemed to return later while Billy was <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistling.html" title="Whistling">whistling</a>. Since then, Winky has not been seen.</li>

<p>Billy is also a father; his "son" is a giant <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider.html" title="Spider">spider</a> named Jeff, who thinks that Billy is his father as Billy hatched his egg, thinking that he will get a giant duck (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Crawling_Niceness___Smarten_Up___The_Grim_Show_7163.html" title="The Crawling Niceness / Smarten Up / The Grim Show">The Crawling Niceness</a></i>). This is rather ironic, seeing how Billy suffers from extreme <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entomophobia.html" title="Entomophobia">entomophobia</a> (most notably <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arachnophobia.html" title="Arachnophobia">arachnophobia</a>). Jeff is quite soft-spoken, and nobody wonders why Jeff ended up so nice as the major role model in his life has been Billy. In the episode <i><a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffy%27s_Web___Irwin_Gets_A_Clue_665f.html" title="Jeffy's Web / Irwin Gets A Clue">Jeffy's Web</a></i>, it is implied that Jeff is both male and female as he gave birth to hundreds of baby spiders, despite having a rather masculine voice. Jeff's love for Billy is fanatic and he does eventually get Billy to be so scared of him he just continually says "I love you", and he can't realize or doesn't want to realize that Billy hates him to the point of madness. Mandy refers to Billy as "your dorko-dad" when around Jeff. In the episode <i><a href="../../../k/e/e/Keeper_of_the_Reaper_b280.html" title="Keeper of the Reaper">Keeper of the Reaper</a></i>, Mandy brought Jeff as a witness in the Underworld court to testify about his relationship with Billy, which illustrates Billy's incompetence.</p>
