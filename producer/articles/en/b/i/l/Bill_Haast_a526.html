	    <p><b>William E. "Bill" Haast</b> (born 1910) is the director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories, a facility near <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punta_Gorda%2C_Florida_6be5.html" title="Punta Gorda, Florida">Punta Gorda</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, which produces snake venom for medical and research use. Haast has been <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milking.html" title="Milking">milking</a> venomous <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snake.html" title="Snake">snakes</a> of their <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venom_%28poison%29.html" title="Venom (poison)">venom</a> since 1948. From 1947 until 1985, he operated the Miami Serpentarium, a tourist attraction south of <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami%2C_Florida_f9df.html" title="Miami, Florida">Miami</a>, Florida, where he milked venomous snakes for their venom in front of paying customers.</p>
<p>Haast physically extracts venom from venomous snakes by holding them by the head and forcing them to strike a rubber membrane covering a vial. As a result of handling these snakes, Haast had been bitten 170 times as of early 2003<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_bites"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haast_a526.html#endnote_bites" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haast_a526.html#endnote_bites" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></sup></span>, more often than any other known human.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haast_a526.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>Bill Haast was born in <a href="../../../p/a/t/Paterson%2C_New_Jersey_6d06.html" title="Paterson, New Jersey">Paterson</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> in 1910. He became interested in snakes while at a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Boy Scout</a> <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summer_camp.html" title="Summer camp">summer camp</a> when he was 11 years old. Haast was bitten for the first time at summer camp a year later, when he tried to capture a small <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timber_Rattlesnake_253a.html" title="Timber Rattlesnake">Timber Rattlesnake</a>. He applied the standard snake-bite treatment of the time (making crossed cuts over the fang marks) and then walked four miles to the camp's <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_aid.html" title="First aid">first aid</a> tent, by which time his arm was swollen. He was rushed to see a doctor, but quickly recovered without further treatment. His next bite, later the same year, came from a four-foot <a href="../../../a/g/k/Agkistrodon_contortrix.html" title="Agkistrodon contortrix">Copperhead</a>. Haast was carrying a snake-bite kit, and had a friend inject him with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antivenin.html" title="Antivenin">antivenin</a>. However, this bite put him in hospital for a week.</p>
<p>Bill Haast started collecting snakes, and after initial opposition from his mother, was allowed to keep them at home. He soon learned how to handle the snakes, and found one timber rattler so easy to handle that he posed for a photograph with the snake lying across his lap. He started extracting venom from his snakes when he was 15 years old.</p>
<p>Never a good student, Bill Haast dropped out of school when he was 16 years old. When he was 19 he joined a man who had a roadside snake exhibit, and went with him to Florida. While there Haast ended up rooming with a moonshiner on the edge of the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everglades.html" title="Everglades">Everglades</a>, and became proficient at capturing all kinds of snakes.</p>
<p>Bill Haast eventually returned home. His mother had leased a concession stand at a lakeside resort, and Haast added a snake exhibit to the business. There he met and eloped with his first wife, Ann. They moved to Florida so that Haast could pursue his dream of opening a <i>snake farm</i>. After Ann became pregnant, and Haast lost his job when the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speakeasy.html" title="Speakeasy">speakeasy</a> he was working at was raided by <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Revenue_Service_5a55.html" title="Internal Revenue Service">revenue agents</a>, they moved back to New Jersey.</p>
<p>While in New Jersey, Bill Haast studied aviation mechanics, and was certified after four years. With his certification, he moved to Miami to work for <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_American_World_Airways_c80c.html" title="Pan American World Airways">Pan American World Airways</a>. After the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> entered <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Haast served as a <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_engineer.html" title="Flight engineer">flight engineer</a> on Pan Am <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airliner.html" title="Airliner">airliners</a> flying under contract to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_Air_Corps_f227.html" title="United States Army Air Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a>. These flights took him to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, where he bought snakes, including his first <a href="../../../c/o/b/Cobra.html" title="Cobra">cobra</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haast_a526.html" title="Edit section: The Serpentarium">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Serpentarium</span></h2>
<p>In 1946 Bill Haast decided he had enough money saved to start his <i>snake farm</i>. He bought a plot of land facing <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Route_1_81e1.html" title="U.S. Route 1">U.S. Route 1</a> south of Miami, then sold his house and started construction on the Serpentarium. His wife Ann did not approve, and they were divorced. Haast retained custody of their son, Bill Jr. Haast continued to work as a mechanic for Pan Am while he built the Serpentarium. During this time Haast met and married his second wife, Clarita Matthews.</p>
<p>The Serpentarium opened at the end of 1947, still not completed. For the first five years Bill, Clarita and Bill Jr. were the only staff. Bill Jr. eventually left, having lost interest in snakes, but not before he had been bitten four times by venomous snakes. Haast constantly improved the Serpentarium. By 1965 the Serpentarium housed more than 500 snakes in 400 cages and three pits in the courtyard. Haast was extracting venom 70 to 100 times a day from some 60 species of venomous snakes, usually in front of an audience of paying customers. He would free the snakes on a table in front of him, then catch the snakes bare-handed, and force them to eject their venom into glass vials with a rubber membrane stretched across the top.</p>
<p>Soon after opening the Serpentarium Bill Haast began experimenting with building up an acquired immunity to the venom of <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Cobra_3a60.html" title="King Cobra">King</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Cobra_3e4b.html" title="Indian Cobra">Indian</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Cobra_0ef4.html" title="Cape Cobra">Cape</a> cobras by injecting himself with gradually increasing quantities of venom he had extracted from his snakes, a practice called <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mithridatism.html" title="Mithridatism">mithridatism</a>. In 1954 Haast was bitten by a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_krait.html" title="Common krait">common, or blue, krait</a>. He at first hoped that his immunization to cobra venom would protect him from the krait venom, and he continued with his regular activities for several hours. However, the venom eventually did affect him, and he was taken to a hospital where it took him several days to recover. A krait <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antivenin.html" title="Antivenin">antivenin</a> was shipped from India, but when it arrived after a 48-hour flight, Haast refused to take it.</p>
<p>Haast received his first cobra bite less than a year after he started his immunization program. During the 1950s he was bitten by cobras about twenty times. His first King cobra bite was in 1962. Haast has also been bitten by a <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamba.html" title="Mamba">green mamba</a>. On several occasions Haast has donated his blood to be used in treating snake-bite victims when a suitable antivenin was not available.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1949 Haast began supplying venom to a medical researcher at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Miami_4499.html" title="University of Miami">University of Miami</a> for experiments in the treatment of polio. The experiments gave encouraging results, but were still in preliminary clinical trials when the <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonas_Salk_5af0.html" title="Jonas Salk">Salk</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polio_vaccine.html" title="Polio vaccine">polio vaccine</a> was released in 1955.</p>
<p>Also, contrary to popular belief, Haast never "milks" snakes, as that presses on their venom glands: eventually that damages them and shortens their life span. Considering the fact that most of the snakes he handles are rare and quite difficult to procure, shortening their lifespan voluntarily would be ridiculous. He attempts to have the snakes bite the vial voluntarily, producing venom of their own accord.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
