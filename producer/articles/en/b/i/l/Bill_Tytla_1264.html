<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tytla_1264.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>Vladimir Peter Tytla was born on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">October 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1904.html" title="1904">1904</a> in <a href="../../../y/o/n/Yonkers%2C_New_York_1f11.html" title="Yonkers, New York">Yonkers, New York</a>. His <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukraine.html" title="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigrant.html" title="Immigrant">immigrant</a> parents reportedly recognized talent in their son and encouraged it. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, when Tytla was 9, he visited <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> to attend <i><a href="../../../g/e/r/Gertie_the_Dinosaur_ca30.html" title="Gertie the Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a></i>, an <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animation.html" title="Animation">animated</a> <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaudeville.html" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> act by <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winsor_McCay_2f8d.html" title="Winsor McCay">Winsor McCay</a>. He never forgot it, and some say it changed his life forever.</p>
<p>Tytla attended the New York Evening School of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Design_f46b.html" title="Industrial Design">Industrial Design</a> while still in <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a>. But eventually high school lost out to his interest in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">art</a> and he quit. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, at age 16, Tytla was working for the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramount_Pictures_156b.html" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount</a> animation <a href="../../../s/t/u/Studio.html" title="Studio">studio</a> in New York. His assignment was providing lettering for title cards. He was <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickname.html" title="Nickname">nicknamed</a> "Tytla the Titler."</p>
<p>His first animation experiences were on <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutt_and_Jeff_302c.html" title="Mutt and Jeff">Mutt and Jeff</a> <a href="../../../s/h/o/Short_film.html" title="Short film">short films</a> at the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronx.html" title="Bronx">Bronx</a> studio of <a href="../../../r/a/o/Raoul_Barr%C3%A9_80d5.html" title="Raoul Barré">Raoul Barré</a> and the <i>Joy and Bloom Phable</i> at the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich_Village_91fa.html" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a> studio of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Terry_9c0c.html" title="John Terry">John Terry</a>, later creator of the <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviation.html" title="Aviation">aviation</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_strip.html" title="Comic strip">comic strip</a> <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scorchy_Smith_1fb2.html" title="Scorchy Smith">Scorchy Smith</a>. His brother <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Terry_e04d.html" title="Paul Terry">Paul Terry</a>, founder of <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrytoons.html" title="Terrytoons">Terrytoons</a>, soon hired Tytla to work on his <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesop%27s_Film_Fables_00f8.html" title="Aesop's Film Fables">Aesop's Fables</a>.</p>
<p>Within three years he was earning a very good salary as an animator and supporting his family. The simplistic nature of cartoons at the time did not challenge Tytla who dreamed of becoming a fine artist. He took up his studies again at the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Students_League_of_New_York_3afe.html" title="Art Students League of New York">Art Students League of New York</a> and studied under <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boardman_Robinson_88d2.html" title="Boardman Robinson">Boardman Robinson</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> he sailed for <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> with some of his school friends to study <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painting.html" title="Painting">painting</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. There he not only studied painting, but <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculpture.html" title="Sculpture">sculpture</a> with <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Despiau_a229.html" title="Charles Despiau">Charles Despiau</a>. To this has been attributed the weight and three-dimensionality of his work. In Europe he was able to see first hand the masterpieces he had only read about. True to his nature of never wanting to be second best, Tytla came to the conclusion that he could never top these masters and destroyed most of his work.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tytla_1264.html" title="Edit section: Back in America">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Back in America</span></h2>
<p>Tytla returned to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> with the attitude that he could become a great master of animation by incorporating his rich knowledge of art. Now animated shorts had sound which in turn brought a new enthusiasm and a need for talented animators. Paul Terry offered Bill a job right away. There he met animator <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_Babbitt_594e.html" title="Art Babbitt">Art Babbitt</a> who became his close friend and roommate. Art eventually left to work for <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> because of the challenging work and good working conditions. For two years Art tried to entice Bill to come out to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, but Bill did not want to leave his family and a well paying job during the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. Finally in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> Tytla flew to Hollywood. He was very impressed and accepted the job even at a lower salary than he was being paid at Terrytoons.</p>
<p>During his "probationary" year in 1935 Tytla worked on three shorts:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Cookie Carnival</i>, a <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silly_Symphonies_3d89.html" title="Silly Symphonies">Silly Symphonies</a> short, first released on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">May 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>.</li>
<li><i>Mickey's Fire Brigade</i>, a cartoon featuring <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefighter.html" title="Firefighter">firefighters</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Mouse_6607.html" title="Mickey Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goofy.html" title="Goofy">Goofy</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Duck_14d1.html" title="Donald Duck">Donald Duck</a> attempting to rescue <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarabelle_Cow_c872.html" title="Clarabelle Cow">Clarabelle Cow</a> from a burning <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boarding_house.html" title="Boarding house">boarding house</a>. First released on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">August 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>).</li>
<li><i>Cock o' the Walk</i>, a Silly Symphonies short, first released on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_30.html" title="November 30">November 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Tytla in <i>The Cookie Carnival</i> was responsible for animating the <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gingerbread_man.html" title="Gingerbread man">gingerbread boy and girl</a> as well as the rivalry between the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_cake.html" title="Angel cake">angel-food</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_food_cake.html" title="Devil's food cake">devil's food cakes</a>. He animated the broadly comic <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarabelle_Cow_c872.html" title="Clarabelle Cow">Clarabelle Cow</a> in <i>Mickey's Fire Brigade</i>. In <i>Cock o' the Walk</i>, Tytla animated his first "heavy," a <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bully</a> <a href="../../../r/o/o/Rooster.html" title="Rooster">rooster</a> dancing the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carioca_%28dance%29.html" title="Carioca (dance)">Carioca</a>. The great <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grim_Natwick_5b6a.html" title="Grim Natwick">Grim Natwick</a>, creator of <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Boop_1d61.html" title="Betty Boop">Betty Boop</a>, remarked, "Bill hovered over his <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drawing_board.html" title="Drawing board">drawing board</a> like a giant <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulture.html" title="Vulture">vulture</a> protecting a <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nest.html" title="Nest">nest</a> filled with golden eggs, he was an intense <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worker.html" title="Worker">worker</a>—eager, nervous, absorbed...Key drawings were whittled out with impassioned pencil thrusts that tore holes in the animation paper."</p>
<p>His work did not go unnoticed by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_627d.html" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> who soon came to realize what he had in Tytla. Consequently both his responsibilities and his wages increased dramatically. Tytla and Babbitt quickly became two of Disney's top-salaried artists, and again shared a residence—this time a Tuxedo Terrace house complete with a maid. He continued to send money home and purchased for his family 150 <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre.html" title="Acre">acre</a> (607,000&#160;m²) of farmland in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Lyme_636c.html" title="East Lyme">East Lyme</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connecticut.html" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. Babbitt started after hours "Action Analysis" classes and brought in <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Graham_0401.html" title="Don Graham">Don Graham</a> to teach. Tytla was an eager participator in these classes (later to become officially sanctioned by Disney) which have been credited with the some of the phenomenal leaps in the quality of animation during this period.</p>
<p>Tytla was on of the first animators assigned to <i><a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_%281937_film%29_1582.html" title="Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></i>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Moore_e6f4.html" title="Fred Moore">Fred Moore</a> and Tytla were responsible for much of the <a href="../../../d/e/s/Design.html" title="Design">design</a> of the film and the definition of the personalities of the seven <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf.html" title="Dwarf">dwarfs</a>. One of Tytla's famous scenes from the film (as described by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Canemaker_3b05.html" title="John Canemaker">John Canemaker</a>) is where <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misogyny.html" title="Misogyny">woman-hating</a> Grumpy is <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiss.html" title="Kiss">kissed</a> by <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snow_White_9d83.html" title="Snow White">Snow White</a>. As he brusquely walks away, an internal warmth generated by the kiss gradually slows him, bringing a soft <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smile.html" title="Smile">smile</a> and sigh to his <a href="../../../l/i/p/Lips.html" title="Lips">lips</a>, revealing his true feelings of love. Grumpy's inner feelings are portrayed solely through <a href="../../../m/i/m/Mime_artist.html" title="Mime artist">pantomime</a>—in his telling <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facial_expression.html" title="Facial expression">facial expressions</a>, his <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_language.html" title="Body language">body language</a>, and the timing of his reactions.</p>

<p><i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i> was eventually completed and released on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_21.html" title="December 21">December 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>. Tytla was next assigned to animate <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stromboli.html" title="Stromboli">Stromboli</a>, an explosive <a href="../../../p/u/p/Puppeteer.html" title="Puppeteer">puppeteer</a> and <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidnapper.html" title="Kidnapper">kidnapper</a> in <i><a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinocchio_%281940_movie%29.html" title="Pinocchio (1940 movie)">Pinocchio</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>). Larger-than-life, a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monster.html" title="Monster">monster</a> of mercurial <a href="../../../m/o/o/Mood.html" title="Mood">moods</a>—comic and menacing by turns—Stromboli is one of Disney's most three-dimensional and frightening <a href="../../../v/i/l/Villain.html" title="Villain">villains</a>.</p>
<p>"Bill was powerful, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscular.html" title="Muscular">muscular</a>, high-strung and sensitive, with a tremendous ego," wrote Disney animators <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Thomas_%28animator%29_fd87.html" title="Frank Thomas (animator)">Frank Thomas</a> and <a href="../../../o/l/l/Ollie_Johnston_a99f.html" title="Ollie Johnston">Ollie Johnston</a> in their book <i>The Disney Villain</i>. "Everything was 'feelings' with Bill. Whatever he animated had the inner feelings of his characters expressed through very strong acting. He did not just get inside Stromboli, he was Stromboli and he lived that part."</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../b/r/a/Brave_Little_Tailor_4375.html" title="Brave Little Tailor">Brave Little Tailor</a></i> was a <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> short featuring <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Mouse_6607.html" title="Mickey Mouse">Mickey</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnie_Mouse_3782.html" title="Minnie Mouse">Minnie Mouse</a>. Tytla animated the giant who was as dumb as he was huge. The character "became the model for all giants throughout the industry from gags to personality," according to Johnston and Thomas. The short was nominated for the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Animated_Short_Film_53e9.html" title="Academy Award for Animated Short Film">Academy Award for Animated Short Film</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>. But it lost to <i><a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_the_Bull_d059.html" title="Ferdinand the Bull">Ferdinand the Bull</a></i>, another Disney short, directed by Dick Rickard, animated by <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milt_Kahl_f34f.html" title="Milt Kahl">Milt Kahl</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Kimball_380e.html" title="Ward Kimball">Ward Kimball</a>.</p>
<p>Early in 1938, Tytla animated <a href="../../../y/e/n/Yen_Sid_9a37.html" title="Yen Sid">Yen Sid</a>, the old <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magician_%28fantasy%29.html" title="Magician (fantasy)">magician</a> in "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice_38d6.html" title="The Sorcerer's Apprentice">The Sorcerer's Apprentice</a>," which would eventually become a segment in <i><a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasia_%28movie%29.html" title="Fantasia (movie)">Fantasia</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>). However the character from <i>Fantasia</i> which Tytla is better known for is <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chernabog_%28Disney%29_f4c3.html" title="Chernabog (Disney)">Chernabog</a>, his own version of <a href="../../../c/r/n/Crnobog.html" title="Crnobog">Crnobog</a> the Black God, from the "<a href="../../../n/i/g/Night_on_Bald_Mountain_e906.html" title="Night on Bald Mountain">Night on Bald Mountain</a>" sequence.</p>
<p>It is often said that Chernabog was based on actor <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bela_Lugosi_59d1.html" title="Bela Lugosi">Bela Lugosi</a>, and Walt did bring him in to do live action reference for the character. However, Bill already had a pretty good idea of what he wanted to do and did not like Bela's <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpretation.html" title="Interpretation">interpretation</a> of the character. Instead he had Wilfred Jackson (who is credited for the music of <i><a href="../../../s/t/e/Steamboat_Willie_f6aa.html" title="Steamboat Willie">Steamboat Willie</a></i>) act out the part for him, and that is what he used as live action reference. The scene is pure pantomime, but shows the full emotional range of the character, from unabashed glee to profound despair, expressing physical pain at the sound of the church bells at dawn. Chernabog is considered Tytla's supreme achievement in personality animation and marks the zenith of his career.</p>
<p>By 1940 Tytla was tiring of animating heavies. Not one to want to be typecast Tytla requested as his next assignment <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumbo.html" title="Dumbo">Dumbo</a> (namesake star of the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a> film), the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby.html" title="Baby">baby</a> <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">elephant</a> ridiculed and rejected because of his big <a href="../../../e/a/r/Ear.html" title="Ear">ears</a>.</p>
<p>This time his reference was his own infant son, Peter. The intent was to do something untheatrical and sincere, to try to put the personality of a human child into that of an elephant so that it rings true. The happy sequence of Dumbo splashing and blowing bubbles in a bathtub, or playing hide-and-seek between his mother's legs contrasts with the later scene in which Dumbo visits his mother in prison. Dumbo, climbing onto his mother's trunk shows a slight apprehension as she begins to swing him gently back and forth. He relaxes, yet his sadness over the temporary nature of this maternal solace always there. When they finally must part, the slow reluctant pull of Dumbo's trunk away from his mother's is heartbreaking.</p>
<p>His son, Peter Tytla, has grown up to become a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collage.html" title="Collage">collage</a> artist focusing on images made from photographs of junk cars.</p>

<p>While <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i> was hugely successful the following films had a hard time making money due to the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Theatre_of_World_War_II_1dd8.html" title="European Theatre of World War II">war in Europe</a> cutting of nearly 50% of their <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenue.html" title="Revenue">revenue</a>. This led to <a href="../../../e/m/p/Employee.html" title="Employee">staff</a> <a href="../../../l/a/y/Layoff.html" title="Layoff">layoff</a> and broken <a href="../../../p/r/o/Promise.html" title="Promise">promises</a> with regard to <a href="../../../e/m/p/Employment.html" title="Employment">job</a> <a href="../../../s/e/c/Security.html" title="Security">security</a>, raises and bonuses.</p>
<p>While the top animators like Tytla and Babbit were highly paid, they were all too aware of the low <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wage.html" title="Wage">wages</a> being paid to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assistant.html" title="Assistant">assistants</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_production.html" title="Film production">production</a> people. Babbit even went as far as paying his assistant out of his own pocket. But in early 1941 Babbitt was fired for <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_union.html" title="Labor union">union</a> activities. The day after Babbit led over 300 Disney studio employees in a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_animators%27_strike.html" title="Disney animators' strike">strike</a>, demanding union representation. To Disney's surprise and dismay, Tytla joined the strike line. "I was for the company union, and I went on strike because my friends were on strike," said Tytla. " I was sympathetic with their views, but I never wanted to do anything against Walt." The strike lasted over two months and was so divisive that it profoundly altered the course of American character animation. As the strike ended, America entered <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> and the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Golden_Age_of_Hollywood_animation_e2c0.html" title="The Golden Age of Hollywood animation">Golden age</a> was effectively over.</p>
<p>Tytla returned to the studio, but "there was too much tension and electricity in the air," according to Adrianne Tytla. With Vladimir, "everything was instinctive and intuitive, and now the vibes were all wrong." Due to the economics of the studio at the time, assignments were less challenging.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../s/a/l/Saludos_Amigos_3475.html" title="Saludos Amigos">Saludos Amigos</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>) Tytla animated Pedro (a baby airplane) and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Jose_Carioca_7e6e.html" title="Jose Carioca">Jose Carioca</a> (a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazil.html" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parrot.html" title="Parrot">parrot</a>). His small but juicy final portrayals at Disney were a witch and a Nazi teacher in the short <i><a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_for_Death_81f5.html" title="Education for Death">Education for Death</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>) and the climactic battle between a giant <a href="../../../o/c/t/Octopus.html" title="Octopus">octopus</a> and an American eagle in the feature <i><a href="../../../v/i/c/Victory_Through_Air_Power_65dc.html" title="Victory Through Air Power">Victory Through Air Power</a></i> (1943).</p>
<p>Tytla's perception that he was unwelcome at the studio; less challenging work, his wife's three-year long illness with <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tuberculosis.html" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, fear of <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_of_Japan_4a4a.html" title="Empire of Japan">Japanese</a> attack, and a desire to live on his Connecticut <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farm.html" title="Farm">farm</a> eventually led him to the decision to leave the studio.

<p>After leaving the Disney studio Tytla returned to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrytoons.html" title="Terrytoons">Terrytoons</a> for a short while.

<p>Tytla left <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famous_Studio_6fd4.html" title="Famous Studio">Famous Studio</a> during the early <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a> to work for Tempo Productions. Tempo was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> as a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partnership.html" title="Partnership">partnership</a> between David Hilberman and Zack Schwartz. They were both former Disney colleagues of Tytla. David had notably served as an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_director.html" title="Art director">art director</a> for <i><a href="../../../b/a/m/Bambi.html" title="Bambi">Bambi</a></i> and Zack for "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice_38d6.html" title="The Sorcerer's Apprentice">The Sorcerer's Apprentice</a>." They were among the founders of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Productions_of_America_331a.html" title="United Productions of America">United Productions of America</a> but later sold their shares to their <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partner.html" title="Partner">partner</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Bosustow_2a7e.html" title="Stephen Bosustow">Stephen Bosustow</a>.</p>
<p>At first the two indended to produce educational films but soon found there was only a limited market for them. However Jack Zander, head of the animation department of Transfilm Inc., which produced <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_commercial.html" title="Television commercial">television commercials</a>, approached them with an offer to produce animated <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertisement.html" title="Advertisement">advertisements</a> for his company. They were at first assigned to advertise <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camel_cigarettes.html" title="Camel cigarettes">Camel cigarettes</a>. Later their assignments included Standard Brands, <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth_automobile.html" title="Plymouth automobile">Plymouth automobile</a>, National Dairy Association, <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tide_%28detergent%29.html" title="Tide (detergent)">Tide</a> and Clark Gum Company. Zack Schwartz had left the company in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>/<a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> but assignments continued. David Hilberman decided to expand the staff. The expansion included hiring Tytla as advertisement director.</p>
<p>The squared-off stylized designs reportedly frustrated Tytla. But he produced some good work there including some <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stop_motion.html" title="Stop motion">stop motion</a> animation. His animated advertisements though are perhaps the least well-remembered part of his career. When the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_animation_of_the_United_States_4a91.html" title="Modern animation of the United States">revival of interest in classical animation</a> started in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, they were long unavailable to audiences, presumably lost. A reason for this was that Tempo proved short-lived, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blacklist.html" title="Blacklist">blacklisted</a> during the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Red_Scare_cc7f.html" title="Second Red Scare">Red Scare</a> of the early 1950s.</p>
<p>Tytla, however took time to visit his former colleagues at Disney in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>. Unlike Babbitt he was welcome to do so and even had his picture taken with his old boss Walt. In a letter to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Davis_d7f0.html" title="Marc Davis">Marc Davis</a> written in December, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> Tytla said "What a <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">helluva</a> swell time I had, It did me a world of good".</p>

</ul>
<p>He also took time to create one last short for Terrytoons, <i>First Flight Up</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>). His last work on a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feature_film.html" title="Feature film">feature film</a> with full personality animation was <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Incredible_Mr._Limpet_bf62.html" title="The Incredible Mr. Limpet">The Incredible Mr. Limpet</a></i> (<a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>).

All three of them are better known for their <a href="../../../l/o/o/Looney_Tunes_dcd6.html" title="Looney Tunes">Looney Tunes</a> work.</p>
<p>Following this Tytla suffered many small <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stroke.html" title="Stroke">strokes</a> which left him <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blindness.html" title="Blindness">blind</a> in his left eye. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_13.html" title="August 13">August 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>, the opening night of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expo_67.html" title="Expo 67">Expo</a>'s World Exhibition of Animation Cinema, featured a screening of <i><a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumbo.html" title="Dumbo">Dumbo</a></i> as part of an <i>Hommage Aux Pionniers</i>. Tytla was invited, but worried if anyone would remember him. When the film finished, they announced the presence of "The Great Animator." When the spotlight finally found him, the audience erupted in "a huge outpouring of love. It may have been one of the great moments of his life," recalled John Culhane.</p>
<p>Tytla did try to return to Disney. In a letter dated <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_27.html" title="August 27">August 27</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, Disney productions vice president W.H.

And as late as <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_11.html" title="October 11">October 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>, less than three months before Tytla's death, Disney director <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Reitherman_d707.html" title="Wolfgang Reitherman">Wolfgang Reitherman</a> responded to story material Tytla submitted explaining "...I'm sorry to say that your story ideas don't fit into our present program.. We have not forgotten that you are anxious to animate here at the studio, but...So far, we can just barely keep our present crew of animators busy...rest assured you have many friends here at the studio who are pulling for you."</p>
