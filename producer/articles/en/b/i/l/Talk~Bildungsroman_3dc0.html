<p>Well I'm not a pro on this but what i learned about bildungsromans is right. It is a story in which <b>any</b> character in the story becomes a whole lot smarter than he or she was at the beginning of the story.

<p>Most definitely so.</p>
<p>Not really. I had to smile at the notion that Harry Potter is a bildungsroman. Very funny.

<p>I came to this page to dispute the very same thing, Catcher is not a bildungsroman on many grounds but one can pithily sum it up in the fact that it all takes place at one point in his life, indeed over the course of a few days, whereas a bildungsroman should cover a lengthy span of life to see the character realised as a fully grown adult. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony2Times_e6f7.html" title="User:Tony2Times">Tony2Times</a> 13:01, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have drastically altered the content of this article.</p>
<p>It consisted of one short paragraph defining <b>bildungsroman</b>, looking like a Wiktionary definition, followed by about two dozen examples and yet two dozen further "more contemporary" examples. I added a couple more myself, and then added the "Film" section.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I soon realised that the article was getting overwhelmed by the examples. Instead of being illustrations of the genre, they were rapidly turning the page into listings of contributors' favorites. On reflection, it seemed best to reduce the number dramatically. Four per section appeared to be a reasonable number. However, I certainly did not wish to merely erase other people's work. So I created two subsidiary articles, moved the lists there, and added the links. I left the film list at six because it made no sense to create an extention list for just two items.</p>
<p>Considerations and recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>My prime consideration in selecting the examples that I have left here is that they are actually read. It makes no sense to use as illustrations of the genre, books, no matter how well-written, that are not being widely read now.</li>
<li>The dividing line between the two lists is 1930. There is nothing critical about that date, merely that, with two exceptions which I moved, that's how the two lists were divided up before I did anything.</li>
<li>If you wish to add more examples, please place them on the extention lists. Also, having gone through the "donkey-work" of alphabetizing the lists by author, I urge you to insert additions in order, not just at the bottom of the list.</li>
<li>I am of the opinion that not all the items listed really <i>are</i> examples of the genre. Still, <i>someone</i> did, or they wouldn't be listed. So unless it really upsets you to find a particular entry on the list, I'd urge that you leave other folk's items untouched.</li>
<li>It's better to have a title redlinked than typed in black. It may prompt someone to add an article about the book.</li>
<li>I have specific rationale for the examples I left on this page. Dickens' works almost <i>define</i> the genre, Twain's is a classic example, and the term was almost coined just to type Goethe's book. The second group takes place in the 1790s, the 1900s, the 1930s, and the 1990s, which is a nice spread. In two the central character is a boy and in two, a girl, which is also to the good. I would ask that if you are considering replacing any of them (<i>and moving it to the extention list</i>), that you only do so if you have personally read the one you are replacing.</li>
<li>Just add any films to the list here. If it gets unwieldy, I can always add an extention later. The film list should not be used for cinematic versions of novels (except in cases like <i>Gigi</i> where the movie is overwhelmingly better-known than the Colette novel).</li>
<li>I hope that someone will expand the actual article.</li>

<p>Firstly, Bildungsroman is specifically defined as a novel, stretched perhaps in the case of Kafka to a short story. Der Roman is German for novel after all. As such, I find it a bit of a misapplication of the term to add a film section. However, I'd definitely like to get more opinions on this. Or, if we do include a film section, why not a drama section?</p>
<p>Secondly, I think some effort should be made to distinguish in the article (and its appendices) whether a novel chronicling the simultaneous development of more than one person should be considered a bildungsroman. Technically, I would say no; a bildungsroman is traditionally limited to the development of one character who dominates the entire novel. As such, the Harry Potter series and War and Peace ought to be left off, as should The Seven Samurai and Star Wars, regardless of whether the film list stays or goes. Or else we should throw in just about anything that has a character or characters developing—Lord of the Rings, for instance.</p>
<p>I personally think we should make every effort to keep the definition of bildungsroman and its examples as narrow and specific as possible. This will insure clarity and prevent dilution of the term into some meaningless notion of some character learning something at some point in some story.</p>

<dl>
<dd>1) On the specifics of <i>Seven Samurai</i> and <i>Star Wars,</i> I think that they are rather <i>good</i> examples. Katsushiro is a wealthy young man who has never seen poverty, suffering, or a real fight, never kissed a girl, or been made responsible for anything. Luke Skywalker is hardly the same naive farmboy he started out as.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) Regarding the larger issue of films in general, please note that I used the phrase "bildungsroman form." I do not disagree that, strickly speaking, bildungsroman refers to a novel. However, I had a straightforward rationale for adding the section. The reality is that more readers, particularly <i>young</i> readers, are more likely to have seen the movies than read the books. As the lists are only illustrative, it appeared to be a good idea to list items that they would actually know.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If a consensus forms one way or the other, it will not make that great a difference to me. The only notion that I am wedded to is that this article not revert to being mostly a list of examples. I still hope that the text will be expanded. <a href="../../../b/0/0/User%7EB00P_a30c.html" title="User:B00P">B00P</a> 10:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>B00P, I feel you didn't really understand my point about The Seven Samurai and Star Wars. It's not that they don't have a character developing in them, it's that this development is merely a facet of the work, not the whole thing as it is in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man or in The Magic Mountain. Saving the galaxy is a pretty big part of the Star Wars saga, and while it coincides with Luke's maturation, there is still an enormous amount of content aside from such "education." I feel that using this type of work, which has its focus scattered around many different characters and many different issues, dilutes the understanding of what a bildungsroman is. And I don't care if young readers are wholly unfamiliar with our examples; if they're bright enough to look up bildungsroman, they'll probably be inquisitive enough to look up our examples.</p>

<dd>No, I do understand your point and concede that it's obviously so. It is also clear that one can't get the depth of a novel when boiled down to a film. The point that I was trying to make is that these films <i>illustrate</i> what a bildungsroman is. That's all.</dd>

<p>There are a great many poor examples, as well as non-examples, on these "Bildungsroman" pages and lists.

<p>Can anyone here support Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire as a Bildungsroman? The series thus far has both old/young protagonists, and contains little of maturing or growth for most of them, with about one exception. I don't feel it belongs in this category. Anyone agree?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. There are too many things being added that aren't examples at all. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCD_4f74.html" title="User:DanielCD">DanielCD</a> 18:36, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why is it that the book/novel examples were split out and then excised from this article, and the films (many of which are not good examples) are left in as the primary examples? If anything, this should be reversed, but I'm more inclined to re-include <i>bildungsroman</i> examples from books and films <b>that can be cited as such</b> in this article, and redirect the two book articles here. Please comment or note any objections to such a course of action. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 17:42, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I teach a class on the Bildungsroman; very few people agree on what exactly is one or isn't one--as this discussion indicates, you can really get bogged down arguing about whether something is or isn't. For example, the definition from Buckley on the page doesn't describe a ton of novels that are typically considered examples of the genre. I like the lists and discussions about particular items as a means to provoke thought, but maybe we should assume that it really is a loose and baggy genre and no definition is going to nail down all possible examples.Klbrewer 22:35, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
