<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ricky Ray Rector</span></h2>
<p>I was wondering if mentioning Clinton presiding over Ricky Ray Rectors' execution would be signifigant enough/NPOV material. It made a big impact on the 1992 Presidential Election and Clinton personally. <a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZenosparadox_602c.html" title="User:Zenosparadox">Zenosparadox</a> 03:56, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Impeachment Spin-off article?</span></h2>
<p>I just started to edit the Ken Starr/impeachment section, as it seems to me to lack several important elements. However, I realized that the section could easily become longer than the rest of the article combined. On the other hand, the entire impeachment section is at present shorter than the discussion of typefaces in the <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killian_memos.html" title="Killian memos">Killian memos</a> article. Does anyone object to spinning off a longer subarticle on impeachment, to be linked from the main Clinton article. This would have the advantage of removing some detail from the main page, while more fully exploring the issue elsewhere. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 22:39, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Same with the pardons. This level of extreme detail is simply not appropriate for an overall biography of Bill Clinton. The detail is appropriate for an article on the FALN pardons, and in fact more detail would be useful in that case. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 19:25, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Pardons of FALN</span></h2>
<p>Since it keeps being taken down from the Pardon section of this page, I thought I'd throw it up here. Now prove that any of the statements in it are factually incorrect. In <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">August 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Clinton pardoned 16 <a href="../../../f/a/l/FALN_607d.html" title="FALN">FALN</a> <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorists.html" title="Terrorists">terrorists</a>. FALN had been responsible for 130 bombings in the United States between <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. Although he held meetings with supporters of the prisoners, he refused to see any of the victims or survivors of the terrorist bombings. Because of these actions and the FBI publicly stating that the 16 people were "terrorists", U.S. House Committee on Government Reform held an investigation on the matter. The <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice_Department_5912.html" title="Justice Department">Justice Department</a> prevented the FBI from testifying at the hearings. The White House also invoked <a href="../../../e/x/e/Executive_privilege.html" title="Executive privilege">executive privilege</a> during the hearings.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you had a list of names, and some sort of documentation for this charge, it could be included, but this bald statement with no proof raises suspicions. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a>`</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I tried. I expanded the FALN, named names and sourced it. I tried to keep it a short little note, with no opinions (notice that I did not point out that it stategically helped Sen. Clinton when she ran for her office since that is an opinion, not a fact). But apparently, you people are so pro-Clinton that facts that he pardoned 16 terrorists should not be heard by anyone. No I didn't make the story up (in fact, it was big news at the time, if you people ever opened up a newspaper). So here's the full section that I put up this morning and has been removed once again, even though nothing has been disputed as a fact, except that it sounds suspicious (note that at least three of the sources are <i>GOVERNMENT</i> websites): <b>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_11.html" title="August 11">August 11</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Clinton pardoned 16 <a href="../../../f/a/l/FALN_607d.html" title="FALN">FALN</a> members (a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorist.html" title="Terrorist">terrorist</a> organization responsible for 130 bombings in the United States between <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>): Edwin Cortes, Elizam Escobar, Alberto Rodriguez, Alejandrina Torres, Ricardo Jimenez, Carmen Valentin, Carlos Alberto Torres, Juan Segarra Palmer, Antonio Camacho Negron, Luis Rosa, Oscar Lopez Rivera, Dylcia Pagan, Adolfo Matos, Alicia Rodriguez, Ida Luz Rodriguez, Oscar López Rivera and Antonio Camacho Negrón.<a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/1999/August/352dag.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/1999/August/352dag.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Of the 16, eleven of them were immediately released from prison, with nine returning to <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and two returning to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Roberto Maldonado-Rivera and Norman Ramírez-Talavera were already free, but had their fines removed. Oscar López Rivera and Antonio Camacho Negrón rejected their commutations, which included a written statement to swear off violence. Although he held meetings with supporters of the prisoners, he refused to see any of the victims or survivors of the terrorist bombings. These victims and survivors felt that this violated the Victim's Rights and Restitution Act of 1990. Because of these actions and the FBI publicly stating that the 16 people were "terrorists", U.S. House Committee on Government Reform held an investigation on the matter.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Chiefs of Staff</span></h2>
<p><i>As president, Clinton was characterized as being a much more "hands on" president than some of his Republican predecessors. While Bush and Reagan had operated under what some critics dubbed an Imperial Presidency of bureaucratic "courtiers," Clinton had much more fickle relationships with his aides, and did not delegate them significant powers. He went through four White House Chiefs of Staff — a record number of men in a position that had once been the epicenter of the Imperial Presidency.</i></p>
<p>For the record, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> also had four chiefs of staff. This strikes me as a weak support - although I wouldn't necessarily disagree with the characterization. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> 18:51, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I first checked this site out, Bill Clinton had an extensive foreign policy section. I come back some time later for some research, and it's all gone. So from memory, I tried to piece together what I knew of his foreign policy, and now it's gone too. Partisan politics? Einlanzer</p>

<dd>I have no idea. What exactly got removed that you are concerned about, and when?

<dd>Oddly enough he appears to be the 3rd in recent generations with that name, but his father went by III, and his grandfather by II. His great-grandfather was named Henry. I'm guessing that there's another William Jefferson on up the line somewhere, accounting for the grandfather's 'II' rather than 'Jr.' <a href="http://users.legacyfamilytree.com/USPresidents/6131.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://users.legacyfamilytree.com/USPresidents/6131.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> There appears to be lots of evidence on Google that he was born a IV, and his father was a III. It's not necessarily the case that he even knows the book says III. Lot's of it is probably ghost-written, and then editors and factchecker and typesetters have a go at it. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 00:19, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most logical solution would be to create a The Bill Clinton Presidency (or some similar name) article, that constituting about half of the current article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clinton v Jeffers</span></h2>
<p>I'm not really sure what the point of including the link to the Supreme Court decision is, without discussing Clinton's involvement (or lack thereof) in the case. The case stems from a 1981 reapportionment in Arkansas - a reapportionment which took place when Clinton was not Governor of Arkansas. His name is on the case because it was filed after he was elected Governor the second time, as far as I can tell. I know that the Freepers tried to make a fuss about it, but I don't see any evidence that Clinton was involved in any way other than formally; it might be helpful if <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs_0127.html" title="User:Nobs">User:Nobs</a> could explain a bit more why this link's being included. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 03:11, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>actually you will note the Supreme Court ruling was an action filed by Governor Clinton; the Courts rulings regarding the Appellants speak for themselves.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Do they? Then please explain for those of us not completely knowledgeable about Clinton's involvement in this case. The Court ruling is silent on this matter. In Arkansas, the Governor does the redistricting; hence, the actual offense was by Governor Frank D. White in 1981. Did Governor Clinton have the choice to not appeal the Arkansas Supreme Court decision? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 03:56, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>From the text:</li>
</ul>
<p>the three-judge district court held in December 1989 that appellants {Bill Clinton, et al} ' state-wide legislative reapportionment plan violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. 1973.</p>
<p>appellants {Bill Clinton, et al} do not dispute here -- that "violations of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment justifying equitable relief have occurred (in Arkansas)." 42 U.S.C. 1973a(c); see J.S. App. A23-A24. /11/</p>
<p>. In May 1990, the district court turned to those claims, holding that "the State of Arkansas has committed a number of constitutional violations of the voting rights of black citizens." J.S. App. A5. In particular, the court determined that the "State has systematically and deliberately enacted new majority-vote requirements for municipal offices, in an effort to frustrate black political success in elections traditionally requiring only a plurality to win." Ibid.</p>
<p>(d)evotion to majority rule for local offices lay dormant as long as the plurality system produced white office-holders. But whenever black candidates used this system successfully -- and victory by a plurality has been virtually their only chance of success in at-large elections in majority-white cities -- the response was swift and certain. Laws were passed in an attempt to close off this avenue of black political victory.</p>
<p>J.S. App. A23-A24. /6/ The court therefore concluded that</p>
<p>(t)his series of laws represents a systematic and deliberate attempt to reduce black political opportunity. Such an attempt is plainly unconstitutional. It replaces a system in which blacks could and did succeed, with one in which they almost certainly cannot. The inference of racial motivation is inescapable.'<a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/osg/briefs/1990/sg900402.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usdoj.gov/osg/briefs/1990/sg900402.txt" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, we can all read. Now, can you please explain what his actual involvement in the case was, other than being the sitting Governor when the original lawsuit was filed (as opposed to when the offense the lawsuit was about was committed)? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 05:17, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The document speaks for itself. Perhaps the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_35ae.html" title="Supreme Court">Supreme Court</a> and Eastern District of Arkansas pages needs to be edited if they are hearing cases involving disinterested persons and finding them in violation of Federal Statutes. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs_0127.html" title="User:Nobs">nobs</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If it spoke for itself, I wouldn't be asking these questions. Please tell us what Clinton's involvement in this case was, other than being Governor (and thus defendant in the original case, and apellant in the appeal). Or do you simply not know? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 05:30, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>My knowledge is limited to the facts of the case. Both courts, in both court findings established the facts;</li>
</ul>
<p>for example:</p>
<p><i>Laws were passed in an attempt to close off this avenue of black political victory.</i></p>
<p>legislation other than reaportionament, i.e. a system to do away with plurality wins</p>
<p><i>(t)his series of laws</i></p>
<p>likewise does not refer to reaportionment. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs_0127.html" title="User:Nobs">nobs</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Then what does it refer to? What exactly did Clinton do? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 06:15, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>{Bill Clinton, et al} do not dispute here -- that "violations of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment justifying equitable relief have occurred (in Arkansas)." <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs_0127.html" title="User:Nobs">nobs</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What exactly did Bill Clinton do? Which violations of those amendments did Bill Clinton commit, and in what way did he commit them? (Strictly speaking, stating that Clinton et al do not dispute that violations have occurred does not imply that Clinton committed the violations.) --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 06:39, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is common practice that when a government official is displaced in the course of a lawsuit, the new official will take his or her place in the style (name) of the case. The subsequent opinion will often (but not always, it usually depends on the writing style of the opinion's author) refer to the current parties, regardless of whether they were they were the parties at the suit's inception. Thus, the quotations from the language of the opinion do not mean that Clinton, personally, had anything to do with the case, but only that he is (was) the current appellant, in his official capacity as governor.</p>
