<p>Hi Bill, I noticed your infobox at <a href="../../../d/u/f/Duffus_Castle_5e26.html" title="Duffus Castle">Duffus Castle</a>, and thought it would make a good start for a template for use across the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Scottish_Castles_776b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Scottish Castles">Scottish Castles Wikiproject</a>. I started a discussion on the subject on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Scottish_Castles_5b77.html#Infobox" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Scottish Castles">talk page</a>, please do let us have your thoughts.

<dd>hello again. Thanks for adding the {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Scottish_castle_f12a.html" title="Template:Infobox Scottish castle">Infobox Scottish castle</a>}}, a very useful template. however, you may not be aware of a parallel development of {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Military_Structure_2259.html" title="Template:Infobox Military Structure">Infobox Military Structure</a>}}, which is being discussed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Castles_f5e0.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Castles">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Castles</a>. That template has now been improved to suit all castle articles, although there are some differences to yours - I have suggested the possiblity of merging the two, mainly for continuity reasons. Please stop by the project talk page and let us know your thoughts.

<p>Hey. I will look into it. You see, that map was based on the map on page 196 of McNeill and MacQueen (eds.), <i>Atlas of Scottish History to 1707</i>, and in it Forres was not given a castle. Likewise, there is some reason to believe that Inverness may have existed in this period (with a castle), but this is not certain and is omitted from the aforementioned map.

<p>Thank you for your praise. If medieval Scotland is going to be one of your main editing interests, we shall prolly encounter each other quite a bit. Keep in mind that I started most of those articles just to get them started, and there is a large scope for improvement and copyediting. Anyways, since you're interested, can you do me and wikipedia a big favour and give <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_of_Dunblane_f620.html" title="Clement of Dunblane">Clement of Dunblane</a> a quick copyedit (sentences structures, unclear info, etc). I'm personally happy with it, and so's Dave Souza now. But it's up for FA and needs as many eyes as possible. This is in response to <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">User:Tony1</a>'s comments on <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Clement_of_Dunblane_d491.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Clement of Dunblane">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Clement of Dunblane</a>. I myself will go over it again soon, but others need to look at it first. You're own thoughts on how it can be improved are also highly welcome.

<dd>Hey. Thanks for your help. Now I'll just have to wait for Tony1 to tell us what he thinks. Do you think the article is now of FA quality?

<p>This whole area is very sensitive, and often downright confusing, especially in sporting contexts for example. As an aspirant encyclopedia we have to be explicit and crystal clear when we say "Ireland" - are we referring to the whole island, or just to the state?</p>
<p>Like all Ireland-related questions, symbols are important. Currently (and somewhat confusingly) Wikipedia uses 3 different flags, in different contexts, to refer to the entire island:</p>
<ul>
<li>the St Patrick's Cross (which I personally consider a tad daft, but there you go... )</li>
<li>the shamrock (eg rugby, hockey etc)</li>
<li>the "four provinces" heraldic banner</li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever one is used, please note that <a href="../../../i/r/e/Portal%7EIreland_f493.html" title="Portal:Ireland">Portal:Ireland</a> deals with the entire island, <b>not</b> with the Republic. --<a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMais_oui%21_a53d.html" title="User:Mais oui!">Mais oui!</a> 10:42, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you; and to you, Bill. I hope you have a great 2007, both in your wikilife and in the real world. And for me, I hope I can do some work on Northumbrian towns &amp; villages that even starts to resemble some of your more accomplished pieces. (I'm reading an industrial archaeology book on the ports of Northumberland right now which might help. I'll probably see you in pages on obscure ship types of the east coast...)

<p>Do you know of any bishops between Alexander Lindsay and George Haliburton?

<dd>The source of that info for me was Ian Ross-Harper, <i>Notable Bishops and Ministers of Dornoch Cathedral</i>, a little booklet I got in Dornoch Cathedral. For the info about Gilbert's genealogy he says he's using a source called the "Ancestry of St Gilbert of Dornoch"; sounds like some Sutherland clan tradition, but I can't find out any more info; if it is this, then Gilbert's veneration as a saint would have encouraged grafting of genealogies. Was just reading the ODNB article, by Barbara Crawford, and she implies that all relationship to the Murray family is a possibly a product of later accounts from the 16th century onwards, but doesn't expand on that. The problem is that <i>de Moravia</i> in the early 13th century need suggest nothing more than coming from Moray. Anyways, hope that helps. Are you thinking of expanding the article? <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 01:24, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The guy who attacked Elgin was Alexander of Lochaber (alias Alasdair Carrach&#160;?). The Oram article in the <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domhnall_of_Islay%2C_Lord_of_the_Isles_9d9b.html" title="Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles">Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles</a> page does not mention this, but Boardman does (pp. 246, 260). He was the third youngest of the sons of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_of_Islay%2C_Lord_of_the_Isles_0f48.html" title="John of Islay, Lord of the Isles">John I</a> with Robert II's daughter Margaret, his older brothers being Domhnall and John Mór Tanister. There's a family tree on Oram, p. 124. It doesn't help that Alexander of Lochaber is referred to by about 5 different names ... "Alexander of the Isles", "Alexander MacDonald" (with Alasdair, Alistir, etc, variants), Alasdair Carrach, etc, etc, so I wasn't sure myself there. In appendix D of the <i>Acts of the Lords of the Isles</i>, the Munros list Alexander of Lochaber and Alexander Carrach as different people, basing this on some argument made in a paper for the <i>Society of West Highland and Island Historical Research</i>. Oram obviously didn't know about this, as here "Alisdair Carrach" is the son of John I, rather than the grandson. Sorry for this tangent ... it's just to alert you. Thanks for the tip about the notes btw ... I usually paste mine anyways, but that's still helpful. <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 18:59, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBillreid_5802.html" title="Edit section: William,  Lord of Douglas">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">William, Lord of Douglas</span></h2>
<p>My main source for information about this time relating to the Douglases, outside of the National Library, is in the 1902 edition of "A History of the House of Douglas" by Sir Herbert Maxwell. Maxwell was a President of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and not given to make many panegyrics towards the contemporary Douglases, unlike Hume of Godscroft etc.</p>
<p>Maxwell does not give much away about William other than "He attended the court of William the Lion, and his name often occurs in very good company witnessing the charters of that monarch". He also states "Freskin dying before 1171, left three sons, Hugh, William and Andrew. Hugh was ancestor to the Earls of Sutherland. Of Andrew, the descendants, if any, have not been traced; but William, the second son, is believed to have left three sons also Hugh, William and Andrew, Hugh owned the lands of Duffus and Strabrock;William owned Petty, Brachlie, Boharm and Arndilly, and founded the line of the Morays of Bothwell;Andrew became a priest. During the lifetime of the sons of Freskin, between 1174 and 1199, a certain William de Douglas (<i>Will. de Dufglas</i>) appears on the scene, witness to a charter granted by Jocelyn, Bishop of Glasgow, in favour of the Monks of Kelso." Now it is purely educated conjecture but Bothwell is none too far from Douglas, and the habit of using the name of an estate as a surname still exists to a certain extent today.(eg Keppoch, for the MacDonald that lives there). Furthermore the three stars argent on a field azure are on both the Moray and Douglas Arms.</p>
<p>The mythological origin of the house of Douglas according to Godscroft talks about a certain Sholto Douglas doing a great deeds for his King in battle and receiving the lands of Douglas as an award. Maxwell further suggests that the fact that the first recordable instance of William of Douglas was synchroneous with the uprising of Donald Ban, is the grain of truth within that myth.</p>
<p>The theory is however, that because of the (as yet unproven) connection between William of Douglas and the Morays, is that when Brice and his brothers went north they were taking up positions with their vey close kin, uncles and first cousins etc. If one goes by traditional chronologies, Brice has to be the son of William. Maxwell also goes on thatof the six sons of William de Douglas, five went on to become clerics: Brice; Alexander, a canon of Spynie and vicar of Elgin; Henry and Hugh, also canons at Spynie; and another Freskin, first parson of St. Bride's Douglas and later Dean of Moray. Brice's older brother Archibald, 2nd of Douglas is first recorded on another charter of Jocelyn's as <i>Erkenbaldus de Duuglas</i> (note the flemish name) granting a toft in Glasgow to the monks of Melrose.</p>
<p>Phew! I hope that is of some help. If there is any thing else I can dig out, I'll let you know. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendandh_25f1.html" title="User:Brendandh">Brendandh</a> 21:11, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
