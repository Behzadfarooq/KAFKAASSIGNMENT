<h2><span class="mw-headline">O'Reilly claims he doesn't make personal attacks "here"</span></h2>
<p>Media Matters is a partisan outlet...references from there should be carefully observed. Rarely is the democrat attacked by Media Matters.</p>
<p>O'Reilly saying "i don't do personal attacks here" might not be an accurate statement on his part but it was a sound bite with Mike Farell on the program...it is not a controversy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anonymous, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_Matters_for_America_d902.html" title="Media Matters for America">Media Matters for America</a> is indeed partisan. As clearly noted on their website, they are "dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media." Since they do this with carefully reproduced transcripts and direct links to unedited video, I'm not sure why you believe references from them should be "carefully observed." Their facts and sources are reliable and accurate. That said, I agree with you completely that the "personal attacks" addition was ludicrous as written and had no place here.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 21:57, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He always says he doesnt do personal attacks on the radio. Insofar as that means he doesnt dig dirt on peoples personal lives, that is generally true (although he has threatened to dig up personal issues on some reporters who were reprting on OReilly's personal life). Insofar as calling someone a pinhead or stupid is a personal attack he does do personal attacks at least several times per show. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 13:15, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure why Bill O'Reilly's alleged iq is a controversy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">American Red Cross</span></h2>
<p>I've added a request for citations for this section. To be clear, what I want are sources showing that 1) O'Reilly "constantly pressured" the American Red Cross and 2) this pressure led to the Congressional hearings. The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Red_Cross_30ae.html" title="American Red Cross">American Red Cross</a> article, which was used as a source for this controversy, doesn't even mention O'Reilly's name. If O'Reilly has made a claim to being responsible, partially or otherwise, for the hearings, a quote indicating that should be included here.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 19:13, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">User:Hal Raglan</a>, I changed "constant pressuring" to a more objective description of what O'Reilly did and provided some sources. I think this should satisfy your first source request but let me know if you feel it needs to be further changed. Regarding your second request, when I wrote that section, I didn't mean to imply that O'Reilly's actions directly led to the congressional hearings. A subsequent congressional investigation on the issue O'Reilly trumpeted, though, did occur, so how would you suggest it be written about? <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 14:22, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Now that you've rewritten the section and provided adequate sources, I have a question for you. Can this really be considered a controversy re: O'Reilly? Certainly it was a controversial issue for the Red Cross. The rest of the article deals with quotes or actions by O'Reilly that people found offensive or controversial in some way. If this section is indeed accurate, I would say O'Reilly's involvement here was undeniably a <i>good</i> thing, definitely putting him in a favorable light, especially the info about O'Reilly's subsequent assistance in writing Red Cross policy. As such, shouldn't this be removed from here and placed somewhere in the O'Reilly main article? It seems really out of place here among all the negative stuff. (I had originally requested that this be moved from the O'Reilly article, but now that you've written it in a much clearer way -- without the previous POV trumpeting about O'Reilly's "victory" -- I think it should be moved back.)<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 19:46, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Encyclopedia or encyclosmearia</span></h2>
<p>I know this is an article about "controversies", but quite frankly this is a series of O'Reilly-bashing rants and second-hand versions of Al Franken (haha didn't leftwing talk radio really take off!) O'Reilly bashings.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of O'Reilly. But I am a fan of Wikipedia because, by and large, we fiddle around and ultimately end up with something that is, to coin a phrase, fair and balanced.</p>
<p>This article is not fair or balanced, and frankly it's unsalvagable.</p>
<p>However, I would imagine that those who create, "expose", write on Wikipedia about, and ultimately read about on Wikipedia, O'Reilly "controversies" are the same small number of interested ideologues. I don't wish to deny them either the privilege of serving themselves the red meat of O'Reilly "controversy" or the pleasure and humour that they understandably derive from it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm a pretty big O'Reilly fan but I haven't seen anything glaring this page that is not factually accurate, unsupported, and/or written in a non-<a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. If you can point it out, I'll be happy to help fix it. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 18:11, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For example, "This deliberate misrepresentation by selectively editing Sen. Biden's responses and in turn representing them as his own shows O'Reilly's lack of credibility and journalistic integrity.[24]". Of course, it is referenced, but presenting second-hand polemic or smear doesn't stop it from being polemic or smear. As it reads, the reference is presented as proving the self-evident conclusion that O'Reilly lacks credibility and journalistic integrity. I actually find him rather pious and arrogant, but I do believe he has integrity and credibility and I COULD write a Wikipedia article outlining how his coverage of specific stories proves this fact. However, MY assertions (whether attributed to someone else by way of footnote or not) wouldn't make it so, and neither does this one. I understand that this page is supposed to lay out "controversies" as viewed by his critics, but often this article doesn't even do that. For example, "All the while O'Reilly remained silent over Pepsi's endorsement of the Osbourne family, which made people cry racism". People? Which people? Not even an Al Franken or hard-left smear-blog reference for that one. But as I said, I think this page is pretty much by/for the same small group of people. But it is regrettable that, for example, there is no Al Franken controversies page -- not that I think either that OR a Bill O'Reilly one is valid Wikipedia material, but it does add a certain weight of credibility to the critique of O'Reilly that is not given to any pro-O'Reilly statements on the main article on him. I haven't edited anything because I don't begrudge the rights of his critics to get it off their chest in this way and I don't have the arrogance to come to massacre someone's hardwork whether it is, in my opinion, skewed or not.</dd>

<dd>I think you are dead-right with your two examples and I'm embarassed that I didn't catch them, especially since I try to keep an eye out for liberal POV on Wikipedia. I <b>will</b> edit those entries, though and encourage you to do the same because not just people who enjoy reading O'Reilly smeared will read that article. People whose opinions are open to influence will as well and I think they (and those who enjoy smearing O'Reilly as well) deserve to read as much an unbiased presentation as possible. In addition, I'm a believer in what wikpedia is trying to do and a biased POV in any article detracts from its overall goal. You obviously have a excellent critical eye and hope you will edit in the future or at least continue to point out ways to remove bias and/or improve articles in the future. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 12:37, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That whole Sen Biden stuff should be snipped. Its so poorly written that its almost incomprehensible, and what little does make sense reads like a POV editorial. Most importantly, the section is devoted to the ongoing Franken/O'Reilly "feud", and this barely relates to that.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 16:53, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't had a chance to check out the sources for this yet (one is a video that I can't access right now). I agree that the Biden paragraph is poorly written and has a fair amount of POV, the last sentance being particularly bad. My impression at the moment is that this paragraph is not strong enough to deserve it's own section and the article may indeed be just as well off without it. I might change my mind after consulting the sources though. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 22:52, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Glick interview</span></h2>
<p>Regarding this section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>O'Reilly has since maintained that Glick remarked during the interview that George W. Bush orchestrated or had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks. While available transcripts do not support O'Reilly's claim...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>According to a partial transcript <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/pundits/bill-oreilly/" class="external text" title="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/entertainers/pundits/bill-oreilly/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, Glick's words were:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>GLICK: The people in Afghanistan --</i></dd>
<dd><i>O'REILLY: Who killed your father!</i></dd>
<dd><i>GLICK: -- didn't kill my father.</i></dd>
<dd><i>O'REILLY: Sure they did! The al Qaeda people were trained there!</i></dd>
<dd><i>GLICK: The al Qaeda people? What about the Afghani people?</i></dd>
<dd><i>O'REILLY: See! I'm more angry about it than you are!</i></dd>
<dd><i>GLICK: So, what about George Bush?</i></dd>
<dd><i>O'REILLY: What about George Bush? He had NOTHING to do with it!</i></dd>
<dd><i>GLICK: The Director -- senior -- as Director of the CIA.</i></dd>
<dd><i>O'REILLY: He had NOTHING to DO with it!</i></dd>
<dd><i>GLICK: So the people that trained a hundred thousand Mujahadeen who were...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think it doesn't take much analysis or guesswork to realize whom Glick was referring to. "The Director - senior - as Director of the CIA." George W. Bush, Junior, was never Director of the CIA. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, Senior, was. Glick seems to have been referring to Bush, senior.</p>
<p>Are there any objections to correcting the information in the article? <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 23:02, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>About the rollinstone.com political blog/article, leading to the article quote "<i>Glick admitted to having baited O'Reilly with insults about his show before O'Reilly's alleged outburst</i>." this is on the edge of source credibility. Mostly because this writer isn't actually interviewing or quoting Glick. The source is probably an okay source as a whole, but an entertainment news source doesn't exactly have peer-reviewed journals. This in particular is a little far away from the horse's mouth, so to speak. I am asking for opinions to keep the source or remove it. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 21:36, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, we seem to be using everything from Rolling Stone to livejournal (!!) as sources at the moment... The writer of the Rolling Stone piece seems to claim Glick had been interviewed and had made such an admission, but isn't very clear about when or how that happened. I don't object to its inclusion. Frankly, if I had been on O'Reilly's show and been treated so offensively and shabbily, there would have definitely been some insults coming out of my mouth during the commercial break. So I don't find it hard to believe. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 21:42, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about addressing my points? Was this in print, or is this just a blog? Rolling Stone is an entertainment rag and as such not peer reviewed. This observation wasn't from a Glick interview, it wasn't a quote, and quite far from the horse's mouth. This is the only place I can find mention of this information.

<dd>I originally started the Malmedy section in the main Bill O'Reilly article and it along with the sexual harassment section were moved here. I notice the main Bill article controversies section keeps getting smaller, and then noticed the Malmedy section was reworded to say Bill made "factual errors" rather than my original wording of "false claims". When or how does repeating the same mistakes, failing to correct them, and then having the transcripts altered to deflect unwanted attention become "factual errors"? Bill repeated these claims twice, and on the second occasion, when a reader pointed it out to him, Bill dismissed it and continued to profess he was correct. At this point I believe it moves from "factual errors" to "false claims". If anyone rewords it again to "factual errors" please provide your reasoning here, and be willing to vote for it. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 23:29, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that "false claims" is appropriate especially for the second event, the first one was where it could (or was) considered a "factual error". Whoever changed my ameliorate to extenuate thanks for that amelioration, I will blame my illiterate ignorance on re-editing my sentence mid-thought and not reconsidering the verb, I think I was going more with O'Reilly was trying to ameliorate the US military's culpability. In a way O'Reilly's defense assumes the Iraqi account but assigns the marines a light-weight form of guilt, by saying it's business as usual, to be expected at times, or as an adolescent might say 'but everyone else does it'.

The reason for the removal is that the article was made long before Bill made the following statemnt on his primetime TV program, "General, you need to look at the Malmedy massacre and the 82nd airborne who did it." This is a demonstrably false. The controversy is that Bill made this statement on air and has not yet issued a retraction. It does not include a web page article written before he made the false claim, unless you want to use it as evidence that Bill knew his facts and then misused them when it came time to dress down a retired four star General on air.

<dd>I readded the article because O'Reilly did provide even within the Olbermann segment his intended meaning which was that he was trying to use the revenge killings of the US Military. The quoted column does support that O'Reilly has used that approach before. However, I provided a list of reasons why this statement is still controversial, it is both is inability to admit a mistake and his illogical approach and comparisons, while for all intents in purposes maligning the US military as having these injustices as part of their normative operations.

If you check its history you will see I am its original creator. There were many American units active in the Malmedy region at the time after the massacre. Its been suggested that order were sent out to various units, but the Chenogne massacre involved only one of the rumored actions against German soldiers. Taking that into consideration, we cannot assume to say exactly what named actions Bill had in mind. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 19:42, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lacking it makes this section seem like it is here just to throw fud at O'Reilly.

O'Reilly's claims are similar of those made concerning the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chenogne_massacre.html" title="Chenogne massacre">Chenogne massacre</a>, in which case 60 German POW's were reportedly killed ...")? It seems to me this is very likely and undoubtedly the incident O'Reilly was pointing to - and to throw that out on a technicality is just ridiculous, so I hope you can agree to this. In second, what are your comments on the transcript? It still stands that Clark is the only one who says "Normandy", and that whatever may have been edited cannot be proven at this time. --<a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrmiscellanious_802d.html" title="User:Mrmiscellanious">Mrmiscellanious</a> 19:59, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stanley011, check my comments at the top of this section regarding the useage of "false claims", as agreed upon by another Wikipedian. It was left in the article with that wording for quite some time. Now, if you contest the wording, take into accout the previous discussion and that the Malmedy section appears in the disputes of accuracy section. The lead in sentence to first paragraph should state the controversy. So was the quote "<i>General, you need to look at the Malmedy massacre in World War Two, and the 82nd Airborne who did it</i>" a mistatement or a false claim.

<dd>"Made false claims" is poorly worded, and does not give any indication as to what the paragraph is about. The first sentence should read: "In an interview with Wesley Clark, O'Reilly incorrectly asserted" or something along those lines.

<dd>You have confused me. You say "made false claims" in the first sentence doesn't give any indication as to what the paragraph is about, yet turn around and provide an example of a first sentence saying the same thing with "incorrectly asserted" in its place. How does replacing "made false claims" with "incorrectly asserted" make a sentence with a lack of any indication turn into a sentence with proper indication? For that matter, precisely how is "made false claims" poor wording? Fact: Bill said that US troops commited the massacre. Do you reject this fact? If so refer, back to your conceeded discussion in the "82nd airborne quote" section below. I'll even go so far as to say there is no assertion. I challenge you to find the assertion in "General, you need to look at the Malmedy massacre in World War Two, and the 82nd Airborne who did it". Find the assertion please. About the profesional part, are you claiming that stating what is true versus what is false makes for unprofessional editing? If I said, "American President John F Kennedy died in 1999" would you say that's an incorrect assertion or a false claim? <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 20:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">The 82nd airborne quote</span></h3>
<p>Regarding Bill's October 28 Malmedy statements, I reviewed the video and Bill most definitely said "General, you need to look at the Malmedy massacre in World War Two, and the 82nd airborne <b>who did it</b>" <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL7m8x-Ie_I" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL7m8x-Ie_I" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. There was no break in his Bill's breath, all of his words were clearly audible, and when he finishes saying them his mouth was closed. Regardless of wether Bill might wanted to say more or not, those are the exact words that came out of his mouth. Please, leave his quote complete and let's not continue parse words. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 21:40, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

If it's the one on the site you linked to, listen closesly again, because that is exactly what Bill said. There is no alleging, in the video again you can clearly hear Bill say all those words. If you are saying you can't hear those words, in all seriousness I am sorry for you and maybe you should get your hearing tested.

<dd>I listened to the same clip to which you referred and it appears to me that you are PROBABLY correct, though it is not as clear as you make it seem because as I stated, Clark cuts him off in mid sentence--also explain to me why the accompanying Media Matters transcript does not have O'Reilly saying "that did it." <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 03:31, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm now convinced that <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> is correct about the quote, but I can certainly see why there is confusion. I downloaded both the windows media and the quick-time file. The quick-time file is a much larger download but the sound and video are both more clear. Throughout the segment the video runs just ahead of the audio. This makes it appear that O'Reilly's mouth stops moving before the sentance is complete, meanwhile Clark's mouth begins to move before you can actually hear him begin to speak--thus the ambiguity. It appears to me that you both have been editing in good faith and are trying to get the facts right.

<p><i>[comment below repositioned 16:34, 15 June 2006, by Sysrpl]</i></p>
<p>Someone tell me why Media Matters, that infallible organization that comprises over 50% of the citations in this article, does not have O'Reilly saying "who did it" at the end of the "General, you have to look at... quote." I listened to the tape and certainly acknowledge that O'Reilly did say something after the "82nd airborne" that sounded remotely similar to "who did it" or "that did it" but he was cut off in mid-sentence by Wesley Clark. Don't you think that should at all be noted in the article, especially in light of the fact that the God-sent organization Media Matters doesn't even have O'Reilly saying anything after "82nd airborn?" <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 23:19, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Biased much?</span></h2>
<p>I think the Malmedy section is kind of ridiculous, especially considering that is it true that American forces did kill German POW's, not by one source but by two. O'Reilly used an "authortarian" tone? That's how he always talks.</p>
<p>"First, O'Reilly incorrectly recounted the Malmedy incident to a decorated, four star general using a scolding, authorative tone and wording; no apology from O'Reilly, a professional commentator, has been given to Clark or the viewers for allowing what he considered to be a heated exchange to cloud his ability to relay important facts correctly."</p>
<p>Who cares that Clark was a "decorated, four star-general?" The author here is clearly trying to make the point that O'Reilly was harassing a man above his credentials about something he wasn't qualified to talk about. This has no place in an unbiased article. And I still argue that O'Reilly wasn't wrong about the incident, just inadvertantly misleading. And what place does the author of this article have to say that O'Reilly owes ANYBODY an apology?</p>
<p>I think this particular article should be marked as disputed neutrality since the original author of the section obviously has much against Bill O' Reilly. He really didn't say anything false. American troops did kill German POWs. I don't think he should issue a retraction or apologize the statement, what he should have said is "immediately following the events at Malmedy, American forces killed German POWS." To be honest with you, I think he was somewhat set up, as there is no name for the event considering the killing of the Germans, so the nearest event to it would be Malmedy. Either edit the section, mark it as disputed neutrality or get rid of it altogether. -C</p>
<dl>
<dd>I will review the article and remove language that might seem biased that doesn't take away from important facts to allow others to form opinions (e.g. I'll remove decorated, although not four star general, even though both are true facts). However, a controversy implies a public dispute with opposing sides; Olbermann is the lead for making this a "public" dispute. There are four reasons given for listing it as a controversy, it would be good to tackle that reasoning. Because a controversy is a controversy, whether O'Reilly is right or wrong, being unfairly judged or not... the issue is that we are trying to record a public dispute. In fact, in this article there is an attempt to help explain how there might be a misunderstanding, but the fact is that it is still a controversy. Whidbey 05:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A blog, not an article</span></h2>
<p>This one has really gotten out of control and is unencyclopedic, lengthy crap. It is 64 KB; in contrast the article on Edward R. Murrow (not just "Edward R. Murrow controversies") is 32 KB. Few of the controversies here seem significant enough to mention. Suggest reducing this to a list with links to controversies that are notable enough to deserve their own article. The following controversies should have their own article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual Harrassment Case--cause celebre widely covered</li>
<li>War on Christmas--commonly used term among conservative commentators</li>
<li>Arguments with Al Franken (including Peabody Awards) (borderline)--generated lawsuit, widely covered</li>
<li>Jeremy Glick--Should be covered in article on Glick</li>
<li>Controversy about boyhood home--Seems trivial, but has received attention in press and mentioned by Franken in related controversy</li>
<li>Ludacris--barely notable, but did (arguably) contribute to cancellation of Pepsi endorsement deal</li>
</ul>
<p>The following items have not received much attention outside of O'Reilly's own show, where he uses them to create a sense of outrage among his viewers that seems to drive his ratings. They are either not controversies, should be mentioned in other articles to which they relate or are not important enough to be worthy of discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Malmedy massacre--Exhibit A in the case that this article is blog-like. It is an overextended, speculative essay rather than an encyclopedia article.</li>
<li>Hubcaps incident--Appears to have been mentioned once in "Reliable Sources."</li>
<li>Alleged liberal bias in the media--which conservative doesn't believe this exists?</li>
<li>Citizen boycott of French goods--More something for him to talk about on his show than anything real</li>
<li>Opposing the ACLU--He and a lot of other people criticize this organization; why is his opposition especially noteworthy?</li>
<li>Penalties on child sex offenders--Details fight with editor of Dayton Daily News, <s>which</s> who does not even have an article here.</li>
<li>Weapons of mass destruction--Like lots of other people, he thought Iraq had WMDs. The fact that he felt he had to apologize for this shows that he has a high opinion of his own importance but is not notable.</li>
<li>Jane Fonda--repeated common, but mistaken, belief about Jane Fonda and then admitted he was wrong</li>
<li>Military recruitment in San Francisco schools--Criticized San Francisco for not allowing military recruiters in the schools, to which a San Francisco supervisor (city council member) responded.</li>
<li>Cindy Sheehan--Like other conservatives he has criticized this woman.</li>
<li>Brown University SexPowerGod party--Criticized party at university. That's about it.</li>
<li>David Letterman--One appearance on late-night show. What's next, a separate article about Drew Barrymore flashing Letterman?</li>
<li>Shut-up--Not really a controversy, belongs in his article because it describes his interview style.</li>
<li>Neal Gabler--He and someone else at FOX exchanged criticism.</li>
<li>Keith Olbermann--Nonnotable feud with other "news personality;" seems mostly designed to prop up each other's ratings</li>
<li>American Red Cross--Like many others, criticized Red Cross</li>
<li>Stephen Rogers--O'Reilly gave contact info for a nonnotable reporter who was dead; how does this even remotely qualify as a controversy?</li>

<p>I propose a new article called "Critics of Bill O'Reilly." Some of the entries here could be moved there since this article has become bloated. I think it will help manage NPOV. It is not controversial, in essence, to be critical of someone. This way we can identify those who criticize O'Reilly and state their accusations and people can decide for themselves what to believe. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 23:29, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of "Neal Gabler" section</span></h2>
<p>I am removing the following text from the article.</p>
<p><i>Known for his heated interviews and clashes with other media personalities, O'Reilly has entered into a feud with a fellow Fox News personality <a href="../../../n/e/a/Neal_Gabler_dd4c.html" title="Neal Gabler">Neal Gabler</a>, a member commentator on <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_News_Watch_d817.html" title="Fox News Watch">Fox News Watch</a>. In December of 2005, during the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Christmas_1f94.html" title="War on Christmas">War on Christmas</a> commentary by the network, Gabler attacked O'Reilly as well as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Gibson_f949.html" title="John Gibson">John Gibson</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Hannity_4353.html" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a> for what he perceived as their overzealous demagoguery. O'Reilly initially ignored Gabler with a few simple remarks, but has since called for Gabler to be fired and referred to him as a "smear merchant" and a "rabid dog".</i><a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200602210007" class="external autonumber" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200602210007" rel="nofollow">[14]</a><a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200512060002" class="external autonumber" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200512060002" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>
<p>I do not believe this incident constitutes a controversy and part of the reason can be found in the first sentence. O'Reilly <b>is</b> known for clashes with other media personalities and therefore the other personality needs to be more of a celebrity to generate controversy (e.g. <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Franken_2e2d.html" title="Al Franken">Al Franken</a>, or <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Olbermann_9105.html" title="Keith Olbermann">Keith Olbermann</a>) There has been virtually no discussion of this incident in the media at all and even the media matters supporting links are neutral, simply confining themselves to detailing what Gabler said that upset O'Reilly and what O'Reilly said in his response. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 22:00, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(or, How <b>not</b> to change an article you don't like...) It looks like the result of the AfD will be that the article will be kept on a permanent basis, at least based on the consensus of opinion expressed there. I still don't think this topic lends itself to a single, well-written encyclopedia article that hangs together well, but will support MrMurph101 if he wants to rewrite this (as he says above). I don't feel comfortable editing this article because any edit I would make would involve deleting major chunks of text. As I support deleting the article (eventually), it would probably be inappropriate for me to delete large parts of it after a <b>Keep</b>. --<a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 00:31, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The baseline version to be edited could be Dcflyer's last edit at 00:18 (UTC) on 13 June 2006. In my opinion (as I discuss in more detail above), the major problems with this version are that the article is overly long, contains a lot of trivial information and has some anti-O'Reilly POV (esp. the Malmedy section). --<a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 00:31, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The strong <b>keep</b> emerging from the AfD may indeed make your plan more difficult, but most of the voices there still recognize that something needs to be done here. If you want to again revert to the "baseline version" you mention, I'll support you (or even do the edit if you wish). I hate to admit it, but I agree with some of the cuts that <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> has made, but unfortunately he has inserted a new POV slant into a few places and in general gone about business in a very negative way. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 03:43, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Franken book controversy</span></h2>
<p>I just watched the video of the ABA event discussed in this section. The section has several problems. To wit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Franken did not speak first, Ivins did. O'Reilly spoke second and Franken spoke last.</li>
<li>Franken and O'Reilly argued after Franken talked about O'Reilly's Peabodys; Franken did not interrupt O'Reilly's talk.</li>
<li>The fact that Franken exceeded the time limit is mentioned twice in section: Franken spoke for 20 minutes. O'Reilly claims the time limit was fifteen minutes but there is no other indication that this is the time limit.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am going to make changes to the section accordingly.</p>
<p>The Peabody Awards controversy seems to have been largely instigated by Franken (who called the Washington Post about it) and this could be integrated here. --<a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 04:40, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed the following sentences from the Franken Book controversy section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Franken spoke first and discussed the Peabody issue at length, exceeding the alloted time limit. Franken then interupted O'Reilly's speech and was told by O'Reilly to "shut up" twice. O'Reilly then noted that while Franken interrupted O'Reilly's speech, O'Reilly did not interrupt Franken's speech even though Franken exceeded the designated time limit for each speaker.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Reason, factually incorrect premise. Franken did not speak first. Ivins first spoke, O'Reilly speach followed, and Franken's speach was last. In addition, Franken did not interrupt O'Reillys speach.

<dd>Stanley011, I apologize for my earlier statements in the Malmedy section. Having said that, I hope we can be respectful and analytical. In case of your latest edit, I am going to have to disagree. I don't believe we need a play by play psuedo-transcript of the incident. The complete video is linked as a reference and does more far justice than an interpretation. I understand it's diffcult to write a even description of the exchange. For example, you wrote the Bill tried to defend himself and Franken interrupted him, whereas I could point out that Franken was still standing at the podium wrapping up his speach when Bill began his verbal attack on Franken. Those type of point of view arguments could go on endlessly. For these reasons and I am reverting the section. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 07:09, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's perfectly ok with me--however, I think we need to have the link to the video, in full, in a prominent place in the description itself, (something like: a link to the full video can be seen here) rather than just a footnote that links to the video. I also think we should avoid pov terminology like "potshots" which I think we can do if we work together on improving the description. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 13:24, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If we do manage to, then we can linke to that in the article, but if not, I think we should have a complete description, as I have provided. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 13:27, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem, as I pointed out, is that this, and most any play by play, is it's gratutious point of view. I contend Franken was still speaking at the podium when Bill began to verbally assault Franken, while you say O'Reilly attempted to make statements defending himself and Franken kept interrupting. You give O'Reilly the last word, and I want to give Franken the last word. See how that works? It doesn't capture the spirit of the debate, it ignores the mounds of relevant dialog before and after whatever segment you describe, and it's all point of view. As I said before, the full two plus hour video is already linked to as source. If someone wants to watch it to form their own opinions, without an encyclopida entry guiding them along the way, they can. The video is a free resource, and extremely entertaining to watch. As far as accomidating deaf Wikipedia's users goes, I empathize with their condition, but we can't use them as an excuse to violate Wikipedia's non-point of view principles. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 14:05, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I believe it was JChap who wrote the part about potshots, and also who has been for reverting your edits. Though I did the most recent revert. Reason, Franken "told a story" is more desciptive and accurate than "discussed". Franken's speach was a monologue, not a discussion, and he presented himself saying he had a story to tell about an incident with O'Reilly. With regards to the potshot sentence, I believe is accurate and adds to the article without violating point of view. Google's word dictionary <a href="http://www.answers.com" class="external text" title="http://www.answers.com" rel="nofollow">answers.com</a> defines potshot as a "<i>A random or easy criticism</i>" and gives the example "<i>reporters taking potshots at the mayor</i>". Since Bill is a reporter, and was criticising Franken without him present before the conference, I believe it's a fair non-point of view descriptive statement. Also, since I haven't been reverting you, and you have been busy reverting this section. I'd like to direct your attention to the <a href="../../../3/r/r/Wikipedia%7E3rr.html" title="Wikipedia:3rr">WP:3RR</a> rule. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 15:07, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the article, the term "potshot" describes statements in O'Reilly's speech behind the lectern: "I'm not calling anybody a 'Liar.' ... Not doing that... Don't call people 'big fat.' Not doing any of that. ... I don't get [talking points e-mailed to me]. I'm sure Al does. ..." Potshot seems the best description for them. "Criticism" implies a sustained logical argument. That being said, O'Reilly's potshots were actually not all that important unless they caused Franken to tell the Peabody story and there's no indication that they did. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 15:19, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's be fair here, Franken's story was about O'Reilly denying erronious statements, not the other way around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guy says about me, couple weeks ago, "O’Reilly said he won a Peabody Award." Never said it. You can’t find a transcript where I said it. You-there is no one on earth you could bring in that would say I said it. Robert Reno in <i>Newsday,</i> a columnist, writes in his column, calls me a liar, all right? And it’s totally fabricated. That’s attack journalism. It’s dishonest, it’s disgusting, and it hurts reputations.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Keith Olberman</span></h2>
<p>Regarding <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Olberman_332b.html" title="Keith Olberman">Keith Olberman</a>'s "Worst Person in the World" (WPW) television segment, I removed the following wording from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>In this segment, Olbermann designates an individual, mostly public personalities (usually a conservative), who, some time in the week prior to that night's segment of Countdown, engaged in conduct or speech with which Olbermann disagrees, as the "worst person the world.</i>"</dd>

<p>Reason, these statements are not factual. It is true <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_c07d.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (commentator)">Bill O'Reilly</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> often make the list because they are public personalities that grab attention by making controversial statements, but the majority of the people highlighted in WPW though are random newsmakers (e.g. the woman who left her kid at Chuck E Cheese). All of this is handled with a humorous zeal as evidenced by the Keith's dramatic reading of the WPW title and the upside-down yellow smiley faces garbed in jailhouse uniforms that permeate the segment. This suggests that WPW are canidates are selected for their humorous effect and not because Keith disagrees with them. Either way, Keith's motivations for whom is picked is speculative, not factual, and as a consequence it doesn't belong in the article. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 22:27, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A lso, the time frame from when an event occurs to when it makes to WPW is arbitrarily based on when the news breaks. In the case of the many felons highlighted in WPW, that is when the media picks up the story which is sometimes months after the incident occured, and not necessarily "sometime in the week prior".

It is not necessary (we already make it clear that Glick alone claims this) and it is unseemly editorial bias. The note that a particular claim has not been supported by others could be added to hundreds of different claims made by public figures cited on Wikipedia. Would it be appropriate to go around adding this claim to every one of them? If O'Reilly, or anyone else who was present, has denied what Glick claims, then add the denial. Otherwise, leave it alone. It is clearly marked as something Glick alone claims. There is no need for unsupported notes about it. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 14:55, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>An allegation as strong as the one Glick alleges deserves a qualifying note <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 15:13, 22 June 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Hmm. You think that it's strong. Isn't that a POV? The qualification is unneccessary. If you're worried a reader will somehow mistakenly <i>assume</i> someone beyond Glick has claimed it, that's not our fault and not our worry. The article says exactly what it needs to say: "person x claimed y." There is no basis for providing unsupportable notations such as that. Its only purpose is to attempt to get the reader to disbelieve Glick.</dd>
<dd>Claiming the remark is "strong" is POV. There are a lot of "strong" remarks in other articles which could have such a notation added, but they don't, because it's extraneous.</dd>

<p>I read the reference to O'Reilly's retraction of the Plano, Texas school not allowing red and green clothes. It was really "plates and cupcakes." I put the example in the article but it was, admittedly, awkardly added to the sentence. This seems pretty trivial to me.

<p>I will address these point by point. First: I am not attempting to imply Franken is a liar. He IS a comedian--that is primarily what he is known for and is therefore not superfluous. Also, how do you know that he performed a Nexis search? Were you there when he did it? Even if you were, you couldn´t phrase the sentence like that because then it would be original research. The only way the public was made aware of Franken´s alleged Nexis search was that he claimed it. Second: re Alex Jones. Please look at the source. His site was the only source provided for questioning the legality of oreillys claims--just look at the footnotes on the bottom of the page. And according to his wiki entry, he is a conspiracy theorist. A google search does not turn up a single source, other than his, that has questioned the legality of oreillys threats. If you can find one, please feel free to cite it in the article. Also, stating the source that is provided, such as "Jones has disputed" etc. is stylistically superior to using the passive voice, as in "is disputed" etc. Consult any style guide. Third: What on earth was Glick talking about when he said Bush´s father was responsible for situating geopolitically and training the parties involved in the alleged assassination of my father, etc. etc. What does that even mean? Bush´s father had NOTHING to do with the Afghan Soviet War in which the CIA allegedly trained the mujihadeen--that was during the Carter administration and Bush Sr. was CIA director in the Ford administration. Shouldn´t a disclaimer be provided to the reader that Glick was very mistaken, so that the reader is not under the faulty impression that what Glick said was true (assuming he was even talking about Búsh´s father as CIA Director)? Perhaps we can work on the wording. Fourth: Condeded. I will add the cite tag and leave the line in. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the context of doing research of diligent fact checking I see the placement denoting Franken the comedian as an attempt to undercut his credibility. If not, why do you object so much to it being removed? Also, you state that you are not attempting to imply Franken lied, but to what other conclusions are you leading the reader? Either he performed a Nexus search, or he didn't and lied about it. Those are the only two conclusions, therefore I find your whole reasoning to be quite disingenuous.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About the FOX security changes, I dispute the legality of O'Reilly's usage of FOX security to apprehend callers he disagrees with, as do many others including Keith Olbermann. Style doesn't come into play here if you insist on using conspiracy theorists and web blogs to contravene O'Reilly's practices. A dicta need not be cited to be valid. Injecting such material seeks to inflame the discussion with far stretching opposition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About your myopic comprehension of Glick's statements, it is not the position of wikipedia to translate arguments into unnecessary more simplified speak. If you cannot understand what Glick is talking about, or the ramifications of his statements, I'm not really sure I can help you. Perhaps you should try reading more about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan from 1980 to 1989. This was during a point when Bush Sr. was the Vice President and later President. Specifically read up on the funding and training the U.S. provided the Mujahideen, then read up on how the Mujahideen became al-Qaeda.</dd>

<dd>I don't have the time to play Sherlock Holmes with all your edits. So many of them are clearly superfluous and off-topic as evidenced above. I want to remind the people that this controversy section was removed from the main Bill O'Reilly article. That you personally took the lead trying to have this article deleted, the result of which was a strong vote for keep. After a brief 3RR account suspension you are back making these hyper fast edits, and accuse people that revert your changes of sending you threats and vandalism. You were notified of this by an administrator. It's for that record and the examples cited above that I greet your edits with alarmism, skepticism, and potential irresponsibility. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 18:22, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Al Franken is a comedian, Sysrpl--an encyclopedia seeks to present facts, not disguise the truth. Just referring to Franken as a political commentator is EXTREMELY misleading, because it ignores what he is most, or at least equally known for...a comedian. Second, he claimed that he performed a Nexis search--should we just assume it is true because he said it? That´s a logical fallacy--just because someone says something is true, doesn´t mean it is. To get around that problem, we word sentences like "Franken claimed," etc. which you seem to have no trouble doing for OReilly. Third, the CIA allegedly trained the mujihadeen, not the Vice President--Bush Sr was Vice President during the war--not CIA Director. Therefore, what Glick said was misleading and a disclaimer should be offered, as Media Matters has done, the wording of which I would be more than happy to work on with you, so the reader does not assume that Bush Sr was CIA director during the Afghan Soviet War, which Glick´s words imply. Fourth, you write,"I dispute the legality of O'Reilly's usage of FOX security to apprehend callers he disagrees with, as do many others including Keith Olbermann"--however, an encyclopeida is not the place for personal biases--you are an editor, your opinion should not make its way into the article. The source cited for disputing the legality of Oreilly´s threat is Alex Jones´s website, www.prisonplanet.com--just see the footnote. So I simply noted that in the sentence, much as you suggested that I do, and in fact I did, for the Rolling Stone source. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>

This goes hand in hand with the points I made which you haven't redressed. You say you aren't injecting wording to imply people are liars, but I directly showed that you were. You say you aren't trying to uncut people's credibility, but I again showed that is what you are doing. You changed your argument from Carter was the President to Bush Sr. was the Vice President. This was after I pointed out you were wrong. You even put in the wrong template as per my suggestion.

<dd>By this reasoning, you would I'm sure also be willing to include a disclaimer to the reader after every O'Reilly quote in which he was very mistaken? The only trouble with such a laudable plan of action is that I think the sheer number of such disclaimers would rapidly increase the article's size to unmanageable levels.

<p>For the record, I did NOT introduce the prison planet site--Sysrpl seems to be under the impression that I did--just check the page history. I simply noted that that was the source used for the footnote--my own google and nexis searches do not reveal any source, other than blogs and conspiracy sites like prisonplanet.com, which was introduced in this article by another editor, that has disputed the legality of Oreillys threat.

<p>Sysrpl, our dialogue is clearly visible to anyone visiting this page, and in fact I encourage all editors to go back and take a look at who is evading the issues. I am perfectly satisfied with that. What I would like to note here, mainly for the benefit of the larger wikipedia community but also (I hope) for your benefit, is something that you stated earlier in one of our previous exchanges. In the aforementioned exchange, I stated that we should note that prisonplanet.com was the source introduced (though not by me) in the footnote to back up the sentence noting that the legality of O´Reilly´s threat was disputed. I therefore submitted to you that the sentence should not be worded so generally so as to suggest there are others who have disputed the legality of his threat, for the simple reason that no other sources were supplied. I wrote ``A google search does not turn up a single source, other than his, that has questioned the legality of oreillys threats. If you can find one, please feel free to cite it in the article.`` Your response, which I would like to draw all wikipedians to, was the following ``About the FOX security changes, I dispute the legality of O'Reilly's usage of FOX security to apprehend callers he disagrees with, as do many others including Keith Olbermann.´´ By stating this, you attempted to justify wording the sentence in such a way that would suggest there is a group of others, besides Jones, who dispute O´Reilly´s threat. I am afraid, sir, that you committed an enormous error by including yourself in that group: you admitted in that one sentence, by writing ´´I dispute the legality of O'Reilly's usage of FOX security to apprehend callers he disagrees with´´, to the wikipedia community, that you intend to inject your personal biases into the article. I addressed your infraction in my next response. I wrote ´´you write, ´I dispute the legality of O'Reilly's usage of FOX security to apprehend callers he disagrees with, as do many others including Keith Olbermann´--however, an encyclopeida is not the place for personal biases--you are an editor, your opinion should not make its way into the article.´´ You could have appologized, you could have admitted your error and stated that you will change your outlook or that you didn´t mean that, but instead, you failed to respond, which means that you have every intention of continuing to inject your personal biases into the article. This is a far more serious situation than occasional POV lapses: you admitted that you have no intention of adhering to the cardinal wikipedia policy of maintaining an objective point of view. Therefore, my fellow wikipedians, when noting a change by Sysrpl, please keep that one sentence of his in mind. And Sysrpl, please understand that I harbor no ill-will towards you. I believe you will soon come to grasp wikipedia´s policies, and I look forward to continuing to work with you on this article <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>

<p>Two logical fallacies that you and Sysrpl seem to have adopted--just because you say something is true, doesn´t mean it is true. For example, just because you say I am trying to poison the well, does not mean that I am. In fact, I am simply trying to point out to readers that Franken is a comedian, in addition to a political commentator. Another example--just because Franken says he performed a Nexis search, does not mean that he actually did--he might have, but we, as editors, cannot assume that what somebody says, without written, documented evidence that is clearly provided is true. Therefore, we write: ´´he claims he performed a Nexis search´´ and we provide documentation for that attribution. Both you and Sysrpl have not yet responded to this argument. You and Sysrpl have instead offered angry, personal attacks in place of reasoned responses to my arguments. Therefore, you still have not discussed your changes but the anger of your responses, and the absence of logic contained therein, have not remained unnoticed.

<dd>You say that it is nessecary to qualify Frankens statement about performing a search, but you do not think sucha qualification is nessecary for the Rolling Stone article regarding Glick.

<dd>Why is this neccessary? You can't prove either way if someone performed a search on their own computer. Such things don't have this kind of qualification elsewhere. The only purpose would seem to be to poison the well for Frankens statements. Furthermore, nobody contests that he performed this search. It isn't a contraversial issue. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamburger_ba66.html" title="User:Damburger">Damburger</a> 15:38, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually, if you read the article every statement has this qualification: OReilly claimed, according to Rolling Stone magazine, according to Media Matters, etc. Why does Franken deserve preferential treatment? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Incorrect example. The things you've mentioned are contentious - that Franken used his computer is not. Thats why its poisoning the well. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamburger_ba66.html" title="User:Damburger">Damburger</a> 16:13, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The fact that these issues are contentious has nothing to do with their wording--we use wording such as ´´he claimed´´ ´´she claimed´´ ´´media matters claimed´´ etc etc, or ´´according to´´ not because an issue is contentious, but because that is the fact of the situation. The only verifiable fact is that Franken claimed he performed a Nexis search--that is absolutely indisputalte--Franken claimed (or stated, or asserted) that he performed a Nexis search. You cannot possible deny the truth of that sentence. That is why we word things that way--if you find the word ´´claimed´´ to be distasteful, I´ll change it to ´´stated.´´ I, just as you do, want to find consensus at every point possible and as such, would appreciate if you would refrain from assertions such as I am ´´poisoning the well.´´ It´s really quite silly and does nothing to advance your argument. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This Article need Expansion</span></h2>
<p>This page isn't very helpful on documenting all the major controversies O'Reilly has been in, I'm trying to expand it and it seems that alot the information here doesn't really mean anything: Boyhood controversy, Malmedy Massacre, and the Red Cross &amp; United Way section is on TWO diffrent pages. I understand that the Malmedy Massacre was probably O'Reilly confused between to events and the boyhood home was rezoned and was used just make something out of nothing, but the Red Cross Section is not a real controversy reguarding O'Reilly. I moved it the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_9983.html" title="Bill O'Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a> article a while ago, if anyone wants to read it they can get there by the link at the bottom of the page. Anyway, I think that this article fails to mention O'Reilly's use of unrelated events to create stories and controversies (War On Christmas) or his down right false claims (Paris Business Review, False Ratings Information, &amp; University of Oregon Newspaper Controversy). Why is there all this reluctance to mention this information and expand this page?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some of the incidents you mention have been in the article, but Stanley011 keeps removing the sections. I'm afraid you've stepping into a bit of an edit war <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamburger_ba66.html" title="User:Damburger">Damburger</a> 16:22, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Media Matters reports do not constitute controversies in and of themselves. We must find other sources that have mentioned these incidents as controversies. Otherwise, this page will become a mirror site for Media Matters, rather than an independent entity. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>
<p>Stanly 011, I don't mind if you change the language to be more neutral, but removing important sections is not going to make the article better. Besides the reguarding the newspaper- The Insurgent which O'Reilly cited as university run is according to a quote in this article <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCampus.asp?Page=/Campus/archive/200605/CAM20060526a.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCampus.asp?Page=/Campus/archive/200605/CAM20060526a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewCampus.asp?Page=/Campus/archive/200605/CAM20060526a.html</a> is run by the students. <a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPheoinixflame_824f.html" title="User:Pheoinixflame">User: Pheoinixflame</a></p>
<p>Fair enough--the language will have to be changed dramatically, but the source you have provided convinces me that it is a controversy. This sentiment may not be shared by other editors, however. I would like more people to join in this discussion. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>
<p>What about the other source? It seems fine to me. Here is the quote from that article: University President Dave Frohnmayer released a statement, indicating to Students of Faith that he shared their concern "about the offensive nature of the content contained within the publication."</p>
<p>"I understand why it may seem as if the University should have prevented publication or should take some action against those responsible for the publication. The Student Insurgent is not owned controlled or published by the University of Oregon and is funded with student fees. Therefore, the University cannot exercise editorial control over its content," Frohnmayer stated. Two Sources confirm it and Media Matters is a video of O'Reilly claiming that the newspaper was university run, that in my opinion is not a real controversy.</p>
<p>I have not found another source about the profanity yet. <a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPheoinixflame_824f.html" title="User:Pheoinixflame">User: Pheoinixflame</a></p>
<p>That´s fine--feel free to re-add the sections to the article and we´ll work together, along with the other editors, on the wording <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>
<p>I went back to the Media Matters article, there I found a link to the discplinary code: <a href="http://docs.nycenet.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-101/Discipline%20Code%20%28English%29.pdf" class="external free" title="http://docs.nycenet.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-101/Discipline%20Code%20%28English%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://docs.nycenet.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-101/Discipline%20Code%20%28English%29.pdf</a>. I am going to add those sections again since everything seems well supported, Ok? <a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPheoinixflame_824f.html" title="User:Pheoinixflame">User: Pheoinixflame</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I had resolved to ignore this article as a waste of time, but I find myself being sucked back in.....</dd>
<dd>&lt;rant&gt; EXPANSION?!?! WTF?!?! O'Reilly generates these tempest-in-a-teapot "controversies" (which are the obvious result of his provocative on-air comments) to bump up his ratings. Media Matters knows a good promotional tool when it sees one ("We need money to buy a sword to fight Grendel.") The whole thing's just a dog and pony show. Olbermann is using the old morning radio trick of going after your highest rated competitor. Few of these "controversies" deserve mention on Wikipedia. &lt;/rant&gt;</dd>
<dd>As I discussed in more detail previously, a few of these sections should be turned into articles, most discarded and "Bill O'Reilly controversies should be a list linking to those controversies that are significant enough to have their own articles. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 18:05, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The boyhood home article is needed because it is a source of controversy. About once per month someone tries to alter the birthplace of Bill O'Reilly on the main Bill O'Reilly article owing to the Washington post article which confusingly states his family has a Leavitt-built home in Westbury. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 18:26, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, I see the need for the section but does it really needs to be that long? Couldn't someone just write something like:</p>
<p>O'Reilly often cites his Levittown boyhood home as part of his working-class roots. However some critics have doubted this, and the Washington Post claimed his boyhood home was actually in Westbury- an more affluent neighborhood. This is true but at the time O'Reilly lived in his home it was part of Levittown and it was rezoned later on.</p>
<p>I believe this would be better and shorter than what is currently posted. <a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPheoinixflame_824f.html" title="User:Pheoinixflame">User: Pheoinixflame</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A Suggestion</span></h2>
<p>I see that over the last couple of days this article has become rather busy. If I might make a suggestion: instead of immediately changing the article, let's commit to resolving the editorial differences here first. You will find that it will actually save you all a lot of time and effort. But a couple of pointers: (a) this is a content dispute so far, there is no vandalism (on the part of the registered users thus far participating) taking place. Differences of style and opinion do not constitute vandalism; (b) Please be mindful of the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">Three-revert rule</a>; (c) While it is not appropriate to change a section of an article that is currently being discussed on the talk page, not every edit to the given section needs to be immediately reverted as "undiscussed". It is possible that a change might have been made for reasons other than circumventing the discussions. Hopefully, this will help to get this situation resolved quickly and without incident.

<p>Redux, I suppose you already looked back at the edit history and comments detailing the conflict. I, as well as at least three others, believe this single user's remarks to be snarkey and sometimes plain false. He insists on presenting sources to the audience prefaced with negative information, the intention of which is to discredit or ridicule what that source is about to say. When pressed to stop this activity and discuss it further his arguments go in circles and he endlesly reverts leaving comments that are quite disingenuous. For example, he says he isn't attempting to imply a source is lying, but if a source works with a research group to prepare his case, what does saying the source "claims" to have researched the subject do other than imply he is lying? He says he didn't create statements for the audience which labeled sources as "conspiracy theorists" and linking to blog website, but an examination of the edit history clearly shows he did. I find this all quite disingenuous.</p>
<p>Finally, I wanted to remind you that this user initiated a campaign to have the article deleted, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies&amp;oldid=58243856" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies&amp;oldid=58243856" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> the result of which was his initiative's massive defeat. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 16:32, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and this user, freshly back from his suspension, is doing the exact same reverts again without regard to what was said. He didn't attempt to discuss this further than leaving "rv to last version by JChap due to pov insertions " in the edit history line.&#160;:( <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 16:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to agree that Stanley is a problemmed editor. He ultimately works against his own goals. A little history: I first happened on this article and analyzed it on the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies#A_blog.2C_not_an_article" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies#A_blog.2C_not_an_article" rel="nofollow">above</a>. My concern was that the article had grown to be way too long and contained a lot of cruft. It also had some history of POV-pushing and in its state at that time had some anti-O'Reilly POV. I had been getting some positive feedback on this and I think the article was well on its way to being improved (my preference was to make some of the sections into articles, <a href="../../../8/6/_/86.html" title="86">86</a> the rest, and turn "Bill O'Reilly controversies" into a list) when Stanley nominated it for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies&amp;oldid=58243856" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies&amp;oldid=58243856" rel="nofollow">AfD</a>, which went down in flames. When it became clear that the AfD would fail, Stanley became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">way too personally invested</a> in this article, spending a lot of time edit warring. The concerns that I expressed about this page have only, in my opinion, become worse</dd>
<dd>I would ask that other editors on this project not allow Stanley's behavior to cause them to lose sight of the big picture: producing a tight, well-written article about the subject with an nPOV.</dd>
<dd>I myself have not often edited this article after the AfD because, as I was a proponent of deletion, it would have been inappropriate for me to try to advocate for removal of large chunks of it after a keep and I did not want to spend time on material that, in my opinion, was too trivial for inclusion at Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> <a href="../../../j/c/h/User_talk%7EJChap2007_4f8b.html" title="User talk:JChap2007">(Talk)</a> 17:37, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Stanley, I made an edit since it now seems the most likely way to get your attention. Please read all of the above. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 21:09, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been reviewing the discussions that took place here recently, and this is what I can say: it seems that Sysrpl and Stanley started out in a legitimate discussion over content and how it should be presented properly. As the discussion progresses, I observed that both sides did not compromise to a meaningful extent, and as a result, frustration grew, leading both sides to lose patience with one another.
<ul>
<li>Stanley: I do believe you are trying to make a legitimate point, but you are not going about it the right way: engaging in revert wars will not convince those disagreeing with you, if anything it will make them more resistent to your arguments. However, I'd like to make it clear that the fact that Stanley nominated the article for deletion and that he was blocked for a 3RR violation here do not make him a vandal or a bad-faith editor <i>per se</i>.</li>
<li>Sysrpl:I can see that you are making valid points as well, and that you are educated on the topic at hand. But even if Stanley was not acting ideally, engaging him in a revert war will not help you in convincing him to either agree with you or move on. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADamburger&amp;diff=63441738&amp;oldid=63417314" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADamburger&amp;diff=63441738&amp;oldid=63417314" rel="nofollow">This</a> is completely inappropriate. It is called "gaming the system" and it alone could earn you a block.</li>
<li>Damburger: Obviously, you agree with Sysrpl on this particular topic. However, raining personal attacks on Stanley is not helping. Whatever mistakes Stanley might have made here, he is not a vandal.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>You see, this is one of those situations where, <i>from the point of view of behavior and procedure</i> (I'm not talking about the issue per se), no one is completely right, and no one is completely wrong. The best way I see to resolve this, at this point, is to go back to the root of the problem, and that is that Stanley and Sysrpl have reached a deadlock on a few issues. JChap has already made a few comments on the issue, but - correct me if I'm wrong - none was in unrestricted support of all the points being made by either party.<br />
So here's how this can be solved: bring more people in. What we do is we start a new thread here, with both sides exposing <i>the issues</i> (only) that have been brought to the table. We will post a request for other users to participate at <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_opinion_ae73.html" title="Wikipedia:Third opinion">Wikipedia:Third opinion</a> and we will see how third parties with a fresh perspective interpret the situation.<br />
While this is ongoing, I will request that you refrain from editing the contentious parts of the article. And finally, and most importantly, I need everyone to compromise in the sense that whatever consensus is reached from this, that is what will stand. Failure to respect the outcome of this discussion would be grounds for a block, although I'm certain it would not come to this. Is that acceptable? <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedux_c670.html" title="User:Redux">Redux</a> 23:09, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stanley011 Has just reverted sysrpl's edits with the explaination "undiscussed edits". Given that sysrpl supplied a length explaination of why he was doing this in the talk page and Stanley011 did not respond, the eexplaination is clearly nonsense. Stanley011, you can't call an edit undiscussed simply because you refuse to discuss it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The prison planet link</span></h2>
<p>I've removed this contentious link (in the section regarding O'Reillys on air threats) in order to try and help resolve this particular conflict. The text has remained the same, saying the legality of the threat is disputed, because the MSNBC link that remains does contain a dispute of the legality of the threat. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamburger_ba66.html" title="User:Damburger">Damburger</a> 10:33, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A simple majority vote</span></h2>
<p>This seems the only way to handle the matter in dispute. From what I gleaned, there are three major issues at hand: 1) Whether the reader should be aware that Franken is a comedian, or if he should only be described as a ´´political commentator´´ when he is first mentioned. 2) Whether the sentence should be worded as ´´Franken performed a Nexis search´´ (or some derivation thereof) or ´´Franken claimed he performed a Nexis search´´ (or some derivation thereof) 3) Whether the Prison Planet link should remain at all, and whether the sentence should include the source of the disputed claim, or just be worded as ´´the legality of his threats are disputed.´´ I will yield to whatever the majority votes on for each of these issues.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>

<dd>There is already a clear consensus, so I doubt your sincerity when you claim you will submit to a vote, however I will play along for the time being.
<ul>
<li>The reader will be aware that Franken is a comedian when they click on the link and read his bio. What you have done in analogous to describing Albert Einstein as a patent clerk in an article about relativity. So I vote that blatant attempt to poison the well goes</li>
<li>The sentence should not be worded like that, because there is no controversy over whether or not he performed the sentence. Its a subtle attempt at POV</li>
<li>The prison planet link I'd be willing to see go, but the wording should remain as <i>the legailty of his threats are disputed'</i></li>

<p>Why don´t you explain your last point? Also, isn´t the fact that he is a political commentator also apparent from his wikipedia bio? So why include that? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>

<dd>OK, here's my stab at your three points.
<ol>
<li>Well, Franken is a tough case. He blurs the line; he mixes political commentary and humor, and it seems rather hard to decide which to call him if we can use only one. But "liberal pundit and comedian" is simply way too cumbersome. I suggest we leave him un-prefaced. If the reader is interested in what Al Franken does for a living, let them click on his name and read his article.</li>
<li>I have no problem with "claimed he performed" etc. If all we have is Franken's word to go on, then it should definitely be noted that this is his claim. If we have a source from someone else affirming that Franken performed the search, maybe we wouldn't need it.</li>
<li>Re: the prisonplanet link. My browser does not support the video plugin, so I'm unable to watch the Olbermann show excerpt which prisonplanet claims to take these allegations from. Can anyone else here watch it and report back on whether it shows what prisonplanet says it shows? Furthermore, I'm a little upset by prisonplanet's rhetorical excess. That and their website seems somewhat tawdry (but then, so do Rush's and Savage's... these pundits, none of 'em know how to write a readable web page!!&#160;:P) It might be better for <i>us</i> to link directly to the Olbermann video that prisonplanet is using as its source. Then we can state the case in an NPOV way and bypass prisonplanet's POV, while still maintaining whatever facts the video has to offer. <i>That is to say, let's bypass the secondary source and go straight to the primary source: the video.</i> How does this sound?</li>

<dd>My two cents
<dl>
<dd>1. It looks better that now that their are no labels. There is a section here about Franken and he has his own article. There is no need to add any labels.</dd>
<dd><strike>2. I think the best wording could be: "Franken stated he performed a LexisNexis search..." I see Stanley's point about verifiability of Franken's claim but also see the others' points.</strike></dd>
<dd>3. My own belief is that a biased secondary source should be labeled as such if it is going to be cited. It is always better to have a primary source if possible but if a secondary, even biased source is used it can be ok. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 19:17, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I tend to agree with MrMurph... "Franken stated he had a team of researchers" is definitely being fair to Franken.

<p>The statment of claimed, or stated, research is not bogus--it is fact and I am therefore putting it back into the article. Saying Franken performed a search, without an independent source verifying this claim (and no, Alex Jones has not verified this claim), may be sufficient to convince certain people of its truth, but is not suitable for wikipedia because wikipedia requires third party sources to verify claims, which have not yet been provided. Kasreyn and MrMurph have already implied that they agree with this change. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citizen boycott of French goods</span></h2>
<p>I don't think years prior to 2003 were impacted either way by O'Reilly's 2003 French boycott. Also I think the unpublished poltiical blog appearing on an entertainment oriented website is more hearsay and a bit too far removed from the controversy to count as a reliable source. What do you guys think? <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 12:38, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree. Its impossible to verify the reliability of the provided Caterer and Hotelkeeper source, as it not available online. Although the source supposedly claims that "43% of U.S. citizens reported they were "less likely" to buy French products because of France's opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq", the headline reads "<i>New Yorkers</i> Shun French <i>Restaurants</i>", which seems to be a completely different thing altogether. And the political blog is clearly a biased source. However, the Census information is obviously a reliable source and it notes that during 2004 and 2005 the amount of dollars spent on French imports to the U.S. went up. O'Reilly's boycott was well under way during those years.--<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 14:03, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you should note that Hotel and Caterer directs the reader to the result of the Weber Shandwick poll, which is EASILY verifiable. As far as the ´´political blog´´ is concerned, I do not know what you are discussing. To what blog are you referring?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, regarding your interpretation of the US Census--what relevance does the trend in dollars spent on TOTAL imports have to the section? Notice the row right above total--(50040) Other (movies, misc imports, and spec transactions) actually declined during the period of O´Reilly´s boycott, then bounced up shortly from 2004-2005. That should also be noted in the article. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 11:21, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Is the Weber Shandwick poll you mention available online? I've done a Google search but couldn't find anything. Like I said, I find it strange that the poll says "43% of U.S. citizens reported they were "less likely" to buy French products because of France's opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq" when the headline of the referenced article reads "<i>New Yorkers</i> Shun French <i>Restaurants</i>". It would be nice to read the actual poll and see exactly what questions were actually asked.</dd>

<dd>Also, I don't understand how you can't see the relevance of noting US Census figures indicating total French imports went up during O'Reilly's boycott. How can this NOT be relevant?

<dd>The total French import figure is absolutely irrelevant. The boycott was implemented against French products and goods sold in the United States--the products most likely to be affected by said boycott would be French movies, food, entertainment, restaurants, etc. The total column includes items that are used for heavy industry and the like, items of the sort that would not likely be affected by a ´´citizen boycott.´´ Also, I refer you to Kasreyn´s comments: we are not here to play economists (even if we are economists). Wikipedia is not the place for original research--if you conduct a study that shows that O´Reilly´s boycott had a positive effect on French imports, and then publish it, you may cite it here. Otherwise, you are including original research, and that is absolutely forbidden.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 11:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that the Rolling Stone <b>magazine</b> in many cases can be a reliable source, but believe you have to look at the context of the whatever quote you want to reference against the type of Wikipedia article you are editing. I think a blanket rule of saying a source is reliable if it appears on the Rolling Stone website, without regard to its context, is wrong. In this particular case the source is a web based entertainment political opinion article that editorializes without the same journalism standards of other referenced articles. The author neither interviewed Glick, nor sourced where he heard his rumors. Editorials like this in general need not be researched, factual, or even correct. The piece is opinion for enterainment purposes only. I think confusing it as a reliable source is wrong.

<p>I'm not sure if it's exactly appropriate for us to be trying to either prove or disprove the effectiveness of O'Reilly's proposed boycott. Either way, we are essentially engaging in original synthesis. We should simply cite the fact that O'Reilly called for such a boycott, cite whatever facts we have on how many people joined him, cite any sourced responses / rebuttals from notable sources, and <i>that's it</i>. It's not appropriate for us to put on our "economist" hats and attempt to wring a boycott success or boycott failure by torturing various statistics. I've listened to some of the best economists alive admit their incomprehension about why the economy does what it does. <i>Even they don't really know</i>. So let's leave out our speculation over whether random econ statistic x proves the boycott worked or not. We're not qualified. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 05:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>O'Reilly threatened the Aruba government with a boycott noting that "We hurt France, but it took, you know, millions of Americans to say, 'I'm not gonna buy French stuff.'" Also O'Reilly claimed boycott had cost France billions of dollars, citing the non-existent <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Business_Review_4d6d.html" title="Paris Business Review">Paris Business Review</a>. The data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau rebutts O'Reillys claims, as it shows the imports of French goods actually did increase during the fiscal year in which the boycott took place. That is pretty darn solid evidence the boycott didn't work the way O'Reilly claimed. What do you guys think? <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 05:40, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added a small sentence text from the main Keith Olbermann article to the FOX News security section. I noted that it was because Olbermann contested the legality of O'Reillys stated threats that people latched onto the issue. What do you guys thin? <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 06:09, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please explain how "The U.S. census reveals that the amount spent on total French imports to the United States increased during the period of O'Reilly's boycott." is point of view? The topic of the section it appear's in is the controversy surrounding O'Reilly's boycott. The quoted statement is as fact driven as possible. Imports before the boycott are one value, during the fiscal year the boycott took place French imports increased. I don't see any point of view there. If anyone does could they please explain?</p>
<p>Also, the prior wording of "The U.S. census revealing the amount spent on total French imports to the United States from 2001-2005 can be accessed at the following footnote" doesn't make much sense. It talks about the census document revealing the amounts spent, but doesn't reference any information pertaining to the document. That's like writing an article about <b>economics</b> and saying "economics is defined as this entry (external link) in the American Heritage dictionary".</p>
<p>Finally, for the longest time that entry was "Others argue French imports actually rose during the period of the boycott" with the line first remove, then added back again with the cite tag added. When solid evidence of this claim was later cited (the census document), then it became edited to remove the original intent of the line. The "The U.S. census reveals that the amount spent on total French imports to the United States increased during the period of O'Reilly's boycott" seems like a valid compromise.

<dd>I respectfully disagree.

In addition you stated that the claim was made in the above supporting link, when what I gave was a <b>new</b> cited reference; i.e. a different document.

From the documentary "Two years after the start of O'Reilly's boycott, US-France trade had actually increased -- a statement supported by data released by the U.S. Census Bureau. The data shows that in February 2004, the United States imported $2.26 billion in French goods and services, up from $2.18 billion in February 2002." <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 13:31, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I changed the wording to reflect the variety of sources that you diligently found and provided. How does it sound now? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 13:49, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed the wording that the sources are using the Census Bureau figures as proof to support the notion that imports increased during the boycott period. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 14:38, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do you honestly think O´Reilly is so powerful as to have any effect on trade from one nation to another? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 14:47, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please let's constrain the discussion to the facts on hand and not our personal opinions. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 15:58, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>´´Proof´´ is POV because it gives a truth value to the sources provided. Our job here is not to decide that the sources are right or wrong, but to report what they said. Therefore, I changed it to ´´to support their claim.´´ What do you think? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 16:27, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you just editing the article with your opinion? That French imports did indeed rise is black and white. The census figures say the imports increased, and I have provided multiple reliable sources that agree with this. What's is left to dicuss? Are you saying the figures from the U.S. Census are questionable? You seem to be dismissing every fact and publication presented on the matter without providing one reliable source to the contrary.</p>
<p>You said you actually agree with my edits, then went ahead and changed it anyways. What's going on? <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 16:56, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No I am not questioning the truth of the census figures. I do question the relevancy of the VALUE of total French imports to the US to this whole discussion. The value of French imports can be affected by numerous factors: inflation being chief among them. I do agree with your edits in general--the sources you provided are good. However this does not mean that we still cannot work on the wording to come up with the best possible solution.<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 17:15, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
