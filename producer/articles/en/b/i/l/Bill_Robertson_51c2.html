<p>Robertson is a native of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batesville%2C_Arkansas_193b.html" title="Batesville, Arkansas">Batesville</a>, the seat of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_County%2C_Arkansas_3a73.html" title="Independence County, Arkansas">Independence County</a>, in northern <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>. His parents divorced, and he was reared primarily by his mother, a clerk in a shoe store. He too became a shoe salesman. He and his wife, Barbara G. Robertson, moved to Minden in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> from <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnolia%2C_Arkansas_992f.html" title="Magnolia, Arkansas">Magnolia</a>, the seat of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_County%2C_Arkansas_2e71.html" title="Columbia County, Arkansas">Columbia County</a>, Arkansas, where he had managed an outlet of the chain shoe store called Talbot's. The Robertson purchased the Minden outlet and renamed it "Robertson's Shoes".</p>
<p>For a time, the couple had two stores in Minden, one in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homer%2C_Louisiana_4386.html" title="Homer, Louisiana">Homer</a>, the seat of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claiborne_Parish_182c.html" title="Claiborne Parish">Claiborne Parish</a>, and a fourth in <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shreveport.html" title="Shreveport">Shreveport</a>, the seat of <a href="../../../c/a/d/Caddo_Parish_b9d0.html" title="Caddo Parish">Caddo Parish</a> in the northwest corner of the state. Robertson put forth a budget for each store based on the past year's sales with growth projected in the totals.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Robertson also became involved in local politics: he was elected to the Webster Parish Police Jury (the governing body of the parish, usually called the county commission in most states), and to the Minden City Council.</p>

<p>Robertson ran unsuccessfully for mayor in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a> <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_election.html" title="Special election">special election</a> held to fill the remaining months of the term of his fellow Democrat Noel Eugene "Gene" Byars, Jr. (born <a href="../../../1/9/3/1939.html" title="1939">1939</a>). Byars was recalled from the position in a "Yes" or "No" vote after a citizens' audit revealed that he had charged personal expenses to his municipal credit card. Robertson and two preceding Democratic mayors, J.E. "Pat" Patterson (<a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>) and Jack Batton (1978-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>), contributed money to the recall against Byars. Byars hence left Minden and took a job in educational administration in <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beaumont%2C_Texas_7800.html" title="Beaumont, Texas">Beaumont, Texas</a>, the seat of <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_County%2C_Texas_c337.html" title="Orange County, Texas">Orange County</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> City Councilman Robert T. Tobin filled in temporarily after Byars vacated the mayoral office and became Minden's first black mayor since <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconstruction.html" title="Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a>. Tobin was unseated, however, in the <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_7.html" title="November 7">November 7</a>, 1989 special election by the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> newcomer <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_A._Brown_0a73.html" title="Paul A.

Brown had been the chamber-of-commerce executive director in Minden after coming to the city as a counselor to <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholics.html" title="Alcoholics">alcoholics</a>. Robertson hence ran unsuccessfully against both Brown and Tobin that year.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census.html" title="Census">census</a>, Minden was declared 52 percent African American in population.</p>

<p>Robertson entered the race for a full term as mayor in 1990. He and another Minden businessman, Billy Sherman Cost (born <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>) challenged Brown, who was seeking his first full term in the position. Cost and Thomas L. Hathorn (born <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>), another Minden businessman, had led the successful recall of Byars. Brown nearly won in the first round: 2,630 ballots (48 percent) to Robertson's 1,729 (32 percent), and Cost's 1,064 votes (20 percent). Robertson and Brown therefore advanced to the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_election.html" title="General election">general election</a>.</p>
<p>Before the primary, Brown was seriously injured in an accident on the Minden High School <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> field -- he was moving the yardage chains. As fears mounted that the disabled Brown could not discharge his duties in a full term, voters handily elected Robertson, 2,529 votes (59 percent) to Brown's 1,758 (41 percent). Brown hence polled 872 fewer votes in the second round of balloting than he had in the first.The 1990 general election launched Robertson into a long career as his city's chief government official.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, Robertson won a second term over his fellow Democrat Douglas "Doug" Frye and the Independent Lydianne Vulliamy Scallorn Hammons (born <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a>). Robertson received 2,019 (55 percent) to Frye's 1,285 ballots (35 percent), and 369 votes (10 pecent) for Mrs. Hammons, a former city clerk who had certified the recall petition signatures against former Mayor Byars.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, Robertson overwhelmed the Minden businessman, Benjamin Franklin Wright, Jr. (born <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>), a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claiborne_Parish_182c.html" title="Claiborne Parish">Claiborne Parish</a> native who ran for mayor as an Independent. Robertson polled 2,697 votes (89 percent) to 331 votes (11 percent) in a low-turnout election.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Wright was convicted and sentenced to ten years imprisonment for video voyeurism. He was found to have filmed female customers using the dressing room in his clothing store in Minden. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit_d261.html" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> in Shreveport upheld the conviction in <a href="../../../j/u/n/June.html" title="June">June</a> 2006 but vacated the sentence because of error. Wright was also arrested on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_18.html" title="March 18">March 18</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, on an allegation of having threatened to murder a child protection agent in connection with a child custody dispute. City police stopped Wright to arrest him for public <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intimidation.html" title="Intimidation">intimidation</a>. They found videotapes inside his vehicle and later <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a> on Wright's computer disks. He was found guilty on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_14.html" title="November 14">November 14</a>, 2006, of twenty-three of twenty-four counts of possessing <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of his strong showing in the election of 1998, no opponent filed against Robertson in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>.</p>

<p>Robertson faced three challengers in his 2006 reelection bid. <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographer.html" title="Photographer">Photographer</a> John Edward Quade, a <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a> graduate of Minden High School (born <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>) and a Democrat, was eliminated in the primary. Republican Al Hortman ran sufficiently strong to force Robertson into a general election. Hortman (born <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>) graduated from Minden High School in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959.html" title="1959">1959</a>. He lived away from Minden for many years in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas%2C_Texas_2045.html" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>, and <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta%2C_Georgia_4e3e.html" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta</a> but returned to care for his ailing mother, Katherine F. Hortman (<a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>), a former Webster Parish elementary school teacher. Hortman sported an impressive resume: service in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Air_Force_e341.html" title="U.S. Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a> as an intelligence operative. As part of his training, he attended <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Haven%2C_Connecticut_109e.html" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>, where he completed an intensive eight-month course in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese language</a>. He thereafter earned a bachelor's degree in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematics.html" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, with a minor in Chinese, from <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Tech_University_638c.html" title="Louisiana Tech University">Louisiana Tech University</a> in <a href="../../../r/u/s/Ruston%2C_Louisiana_6073.html" title="Ruston, Louisiana">Ruston</a>, the seat of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Parish_78fa.html" title="Lincoln Parish">Lincoln Parish</a>. He also received a <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master%27s_degree.html" title="Master's degree">master's degree</a> from Tech in education as well during the time of the mayoral campaign.</p>
<p>Hortman was the president of a concerned group of citizens who drafted the Minden 2020 Visionaries Master Plan, a 20-year proposal for long-range community progress. The plan was developed over a two-year period prior to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>. Although some 150 Minden citizens worked on the project, it was Hortman who spearheaded the effort.</p>
<p>Hortman said that his work on the Visionaries Plan demonstrated that he understood what the people of Minden want and need. A former peace officer and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodist</a> pastor, Hortman said that he could work with all aspects of the Minden community. Though Hortman signs dotted the landscape, Robertson emerged a fairly easy winner in a national Democratic year though there was no overt partisan ramifications in the mayoral race. Meanwhile, Hortman teaches math and coaches <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">soccer</a> at Huntington High School in <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shreveport%2C_Louisiana_c251.html" title="Shreveport, Louisiana">Shreveport</a>.</p>

<p>Robertson said that his first step in his pending fifth term will be to "regroup and sit down with the council, the department heads at city hall and lay out our plans for the next four years."</p>
<p>During Robertson’s tenure, some 85 percent of the city streets have been overlaid, and major upgrades were been completed on the electrical, wastewater and water systems. Many of the projects were funded through state and federal grants. Robertson has pledged to keep electrical rates -- the city operates its own power plant -- among the lowest in Louisiana.</p>
<p>Recently, the city partnered with the Minden/South Webster Chamber of Commerce to establish an office to conduct economic development services. A new director has been hired to work on the expansion of local businesses and to attract new employers. Robertson said that the city will seek to attract new industry and entice such new businesses as a movie theatre, skating rink, bowling alley, and new restaurants. At one time, Minden had two sit-down theaters and a drive-in as well. The last theater closed in the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>. Studies show that communities which cannot sustain a theater have difficulty with growth and development.</p>
<p>Robertson is active in the Louisiana Municipal Association, having been elected second vice-president at the 2006 LMA convention. As mayor, Robertson is also an <i>ex officio</i> board member of the Louisiana Energy and Power Authority. LEPA was established by the Louisiana legislature in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a> as an action agency for the eighteen Louisiana cities and towns which maintain their own independent municipal power system.</p>
