<p><b>Billy Smith</b> (<b>William John Smith</b>; born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_12.html" title="July 12">July 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fremantle%2C_Western_Australia_228d.html" title="Fremantle, Western Australia">Fremantle</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>) was the leading halfback in Australian <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> during the late 1960s and early 1970s and one of the keystones of the latter part of the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George_Dragons_53bb.html" title="St. George Dragons">St. George Dragons</a> eleven consecutive premiership victories between 1956 and 1966.</p>
<p>He represented Australia in 18 Tests and 8 World Cup games between 1964 and 1970. He captained Australia in one World Cup game against Great Britain.</p>
<p>Small in size compared to most rugby league players, Smith was renowned for his toughness. He was capable of challenging any opponent head-on on the field, and his organising and kicking skill was a vital part of St. George's success during his career.</p>
<p>Smith grew up in Mortdale in St. George's district and, after playing <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a>, took to junior league early in his life playing with Mortdale and the Renown club. He was recruited by St. George in 1960 as a centre.After a few games in 1961 and 1962 he established a permanent pace in 1963 when <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reg_Gasnier_9fce.html" title="Reg Gasnier">Reg Gasnier</a>'s first- and second-choice partners were both forced out by injury.</p>
<div class="floatleft"><span><a href="../../../s/t/g/Image%7EStgeorge_1988.jpg_e2c2.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/a/a6/Stgeorge_1988.jpg/100px-Stgeorge_1988.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="131" longdesc="../../../s/t/g/Image%7EStgeorge_1988.jpg_e2c2.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>In 1964, Smith was shifted to halfback and adapted quickly as a result of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norm_Provan_fce2.html" title="Norm Provan">Norm Provan</a>'s constant coaching and on-field practice. He made his Test debut against France that same year in his first season as a halfback. In 1966 Smith won the Harry Sutherland Medal as Australia retained the Ashes at home for the first time. His tackling of the heavyweight English forwards was the decisive factor in this win, and was praised heartily by the press.</p>
<p>In 1967 Smith won the Harry Sunderland Medal again (this time against New Zealand), and was an automatic selection for the Kangaroo tour late that year. Misbehaviour on that tour threatened his international career but he was chosen in Australia's World cup squad in 1968, toured New Zealand in 1969 and picked against Great Britain in 1970.</p>
<p>In spite of having been fined half his 1967-68 tour bonus, when it came time to pick the 1970 World Cup squad Smith was selected as vice-captain and after injury to captain <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Coote_962d.html" title="Ron Coote">Ron Coote</a>, Smith enjoyed the honour of leading his country in October 1970.</p>
<p>By 1967 the St George pack had lost many of its stars and all of its pack of fearsome forwards. Smith's abilities and his uncanny partnership with <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graeme_Langlands_36ae.html" title="Graeme Langlands">Graeme Langlands</a> are credited with enabling the club to remain competitive run through to the mid seventies.</p>
<p>He featured in Australia's victorious 1970 World Cup "Battle of Leeds" 12-7, then due to injury missed half the 1971 season. His three vital field goals in the final won St. George a place in the grand final only to be beaten by South Sydney.</p>
<p>Further injuries prevented Smith retaining his Test spot despite his 110% effort every time he took the field. Halfway through 1972 he was injured and played in 3rd grade when he returned. By 1976 Smith was suffering from severe leg problems and his formerly brilliant kicking game was gone. He captained the Reserve Grade side to a Grand Final win in 1976 and spent most of 1977 in reserve grade. At the end of the 1977 season he was cut from the club after a prank on a sponsor's bus trip to the Penfold's Vineyard went wrong. Smith was 35 and had played a record 296 games in all grades with St. George.</p>
<p>Smith coached at Cronulla's reserves to two grand finals in 1979 and 1980. He left controversially when Norm Provan, his long-time mate, left that club after they failed to reach the finals in 1980 (though it was suggested he should have had a go at coaching first grade).</p>
<p>Smith was named in Australia's best team from 1970 to 1985 by <i>Rugby League Week</i>, and gained two votes in 1995 as best halfback of the limited-tackle era.</p>
