<p>Hi, I left a suggestion in the new project's talk page, but since you are the one who started it, I want you to know that if widened to include all film crew biography articles (directors, screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors and film music composers), it would become a very important addition to our needs. Also it will draw a lot more participation than if it stays specific only for screenwriters. I will be very glad to help personally and by bringing more editors to participate. <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> <small><a href="../../../h/o/v/User_talk%7EHoverfish_2aee.html" title="User talk:Hoverfish">Talk</a></small> 15:16, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm still looking into this, but just wanted to point out existing Featured Articles <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Newman_bcb4.html" title="Sydney Newman">Sydney Newman</a> (with <a href="../../../s/y/d/Image%7ESydneynewman.JPG_9064.html" title="Image:Sydneynewman.JPG">Image:Sydneynewman.JPG</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/o/Kroger_Babb_9535.html" title="Kroger Babb">Kroger Babb</a> with <a href="../../../m/o/n/Image%7EMonikamovie.JPG_93af.html" title="Image:Monikamovie.JPG">Image:Monikamovie.JPG</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_T._Aubrey%2C_Jr._6c26.html" title="James T.

Or uh, potentially it may lead to someone pulling the images from those articles too. (I don't think that comparison with FAs on actors and TV series is going to fly due to their inherent visual nature - producers and network executives are closer to the screenwriter role.).

<p>No, I haven't contacted that user. If you'd like to contact him to see if he'll allow commercial use, feel free (and in case he's concerned about his picture being used commercially, you may want to read <a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_Noncommercial_9093.html" title="User:Fastfission/Noncommercial">User:Fastfission/Noncommercial</a> for ideas). If you'd like, I could contact him since I already have a Flickr account and have gotten a couple people to change the license before. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 19:55, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Before anyone does contact him, you're sure that's Sorkin, right? I wouldn't want to use a picture of someone else because of an incorrect comment someone made on the page. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 19:58, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Alright, I'll flickrmail him to see if he'll release it. The second picture cannot be used here though since it's a <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derivative_work.html" title="Derivative work">derivative work</a> of a copyrighted work. Taking a picture of a copyrighted picture will not make it free. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 20:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>He said yes. I'll upload the picture to the Commons and add it to the article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 15:57, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've never really considered writing anything about that because there's a lot of information at <a href="../../../e/r/p/WP%7EERP_691c.html" title="WP:ERP">WP:ERP</a>. I usually just ask if they'd be willing to change the license to make it as easy for them. I think you have to have an account to upload files, so I don't want to put up any barriers to contributing a picture. I never present myself as an official or even as a regular contributor. Usually it's something along the lines of "Hey, I really like the picture you took. I'd like to put it on the article about him on Wikipedia" and then briefly explain that Wikipedia needs it under a free license because it lets other people use its content. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 16:16, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I combined one of the messages I sent with yours:
<dl>
<dd>Hello, I really like the photo you took of William Monahan and yourself (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bmt/260317916" class="external free" title="http://flickr.com/photos/bmt/260317916" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/bmt/260317916</a>). I'd like to add it to the article about him on Wikipedia, but this would violate your copyright on it. Would you be willing to license it under either the Creative Commons Attribution or Attribution-ShareAlike license to allow others to use the picture? If so, you can go to edit next to "All rights reserved" on the picture's page and select one of those two from the menu bar.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It's important to provide a link so that they can get to the image easily and know which picture you mean. Also, Flickr allows people to select a Creative Commons license, so it's better to go with that than the public domain since you don't have to forward the permissions to anyone. It's also good because most people like to be attributed in the credits and the CC license requires that. If the person does say yes, tell me so I can give you a few pointers on uploading Flickr images to the Commons. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 16:52, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Awesome. I believe you need a Commons account to upload, so make sure you do that. I would recommend uploading the original file first so that other people can work from the original if they want. You can use the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Flickr" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Flickr" rel="nofollow">Flickr template</a> to add information about the picture, including a link to the original picture and the person's Flickr account or homepage. Both of the <a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Sorkin_b315.html" title="Aaron Sorkin">Aaron Sorkin</a> pictures use the Flickr template, so feel free to take a look at what's there. The search feature on Commons doesn't work well, so you'll need to categorize pictures (I forgot to do that with the second one). I'd recommend using Category:Writers from the United States and Category:Men. As far as cropping, I'm not quite sure if there's any way to do it losslessly, but the image is <a href="http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=260317916&amp;size=o" class="external text" title="http://flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=260317916&amp;size=o" rel="nofollow">large enough</a> that it shouldn't be a big problem. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 21:24, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, there is. Just pretend the image is on Wikipedia and it'll work. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 22:08, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I noticed you uploaded the image from the Flickr page itself. If you look above the picture, there's a button that says "All sizes" which will take you to higher resolution versions when available. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 22:11, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Keep in mind that "a lack of images does not in itself prevent an article from achieving Good Article status" (from <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">WP:WIAGA</a>). If there's an image in the infobox and the article's text is good, then you don't need to wait to add more images to nominate it for GA status. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 22:42, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why do you keep deleting very appropriate refernces to an excellent new book on The Barbary Pirates, William Eaton and the history of the US Marines. I have watched these references continually be removed from numerous pages by you. You removed the references that I put up there and sited "popups" there were no popups used in the edit.</p>
<p>In response to your reply to me. No I am not the author of the book. I also don't see why that would be of any concern. Surely if you had written a book, you would be allowed to point out its relevance to subjects within the Wiki.</p>
<p>Remember also that just because you "wrote" an article on someone - BTW - that sort of ownership goes against the entire sprit of Wikipedia - doesn't mean that you have the right to unilaterally decide what is appropriate.</p>
<p>I looked at the case file you mentioned. The point you had was that the book had nothing to do with a writer but only to his screenplay. This does not address the 10 other edits you made to a single contributers edits (now two contributers) based on a suspicion that the author was actually adding their own book and that references to barbary coast, William Eaton, etc. etc. (Central Characters in the Book BTW) were somehow "willy nilly" additions to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Remember the spirit of Wikipedia edits is to improve an article, not to judge and single out users for what seem to be jealousy, flimsy interpretations of Wiki etiquette, and your own misguided feelings of ownership over the contents of this wonderful resource.</p>
<p>Also, I would have rather contacted you via e-mail so that this could have been handled as a conversation, but since you have not seen fit to include contact information, here we stand.</p>

<dd>All of your contributions to that particular page have been abrasive and abusive of other editors. You could have chosen to express yourself differently without incessant personal attacks on editors with whom you disagree. I don't mind you disagreeing with others but the manner in which you chose to do it is unacceptable. Calling other editors "whiners" and "babies" is not how we work in a collegial manner. That you continued to do so even after other editors asked you to stop is what made me request someone take action against you. I don't know if anything will come of this but I hope you understand that how you reacted was contrary to our principles and harmful to the community.

<p>Thanks for the compliment. I copy-edited the article, I hope you like. I would suggest shortening the opening a little - some things - like the plot summary of Tripoli - don't really sum up the article (the Tripoli line is basically the same as the one later on down in the article).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Done. I have to briefly mention what <i>Tripoli</i> is about, but I significantly shortened it.-<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDeanCarter_644b.html" title="User:BillDeanCarter">BillDeanCarter</a> 02:07, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed "intensley" from header (intensely being an opinion/POV). "voraciously" in the first paragraph reads nice, but it's also a slightly POV term (maybe put it in quotes and cite a source if a source used that word to describe it). Same goes for the subsequent "remarkably" (which I removed), "by chance" (removed), "in any event" (rm'd), "arduous" (removed). Also removed "over breakfast" (too much information&#160;:-)), as well as "Monahan met with Scott to discuss <i>Tripoli</i> on the day the 9/11 attacks took place" - sounds like too trivial a piece of info - I mean the 9/11 mention.</p>
<dl>
<dd>All fine. I changed "voraciously" to "frequently".-<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDeanCarter_644b.html" title="User:BillDeanCarter">BillDeanCarter</a> 02:49, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I find "year after year he secured work at a clip plentiful enough to fill out a classic Hollywood montage sequence" to be a grossly self-indulgent sentence, not really in encyclopedic style (and violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> - i.e. can you verify that the pace was "plentiful enough to fill out a classic Hollywood montage sequence"?) Definitely should be removed. The same probably goes for "transitioning staccato-like".</p>

<dd>Okay, removed. I was trying to find some way of giving a sense of the "taken off" nature of those years. I went overboard, but pared down it hopefully reads nice. But actually please feel free to copyedit it further because I can't be trusted anymore on this paragraph.-<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDeanCarter_644b.html" title="User:BillDeanCarter">BillDeanCarter</a> 23:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also "with no final cut on his career in American cinema in sight", which I removed, too blatant a POV. "was truer to Monahan and Scott's vision" - how so? "considerable praise" - considerable probably out to be removed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm... It's a director's cut that is Scott and Monahan's vision. It's clearly Scott's vision because it's a director's cut. It's more Monahan's vision as well because his shooting script is now full intact. I'll have to give this more thought.-<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDeanCarter_644b.html" title="User:BillDeanCarter">BillDeanCarter</a> 23:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Tackled. I wanted to inform that parts of Monahan's shooting script were in the director's cut, and so I basically said that.-<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDeanCarter_644b.html" title="User:BillDeanCarter">BillDeanCarter</a> 01:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Monahan captured the city's blue-collar speech with remarkable authenticity, no doubt owing to his youth spent in the many <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighborhoods_in_Boston%2C_Massachusetts_8d69.html" title="Neighborhoods in Boston, Massachusetts">neighborhoods of Boston</a>." - this is cited, and without checking the ref I'm guessing that a review of the film mentions it, so to avoid a POV you should put it in quotes and mention that it is the opinion of whichever newspaper.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I reworded it and made it known this was the description given by <i>The Boston Globe</i>.-<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDeanCarter_644b.html" title="User:BillDeanCarter">BillDeanCarter</a> 00:49, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"prolonged vegetable state" - don't understand - probably POV or someone's opinion.</p>

<dd>Hmmm, this is Monahan's POV, and I'm basically talking about his POV using his POV. I guess paraphrasing is the thing to do here.-<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDeanCarter_644b.html" title="User:BillDeanCarter">BillDeanCarter</a> 00:49, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nope. Removed. I'm not even sure what he means here. It sounds like he's saying he doesn't like to sit on his ass for the amount of time it takes to write a novel. But even though screenplays take less time, I think he's still cooped up in an office.

<p>The "Awards and honors" section - kind of weird - probably needs to just be removed - since you mentioned most of this elsewhere. What you didn't mention already just add to the article at the appropriate moment.</p>

<dd>Seems good, I tweaked that Marco Polo sentence. Tell me if it seems clearer now. By "truer to Monahan and Scott's vision"/director's cut, I just meant that you ought to have explained what Monahan's lost vision was in this case - a longer film, more detailed characters, a lost sub-plot, etc. things along those lines. If Monahan used "prolonged vegetable state" you could just quote him if you want to use it and if it makes sense in the context of the paragraph.

<p>Looks like by the time I'm seeing the article, it's come a long way! Looks pretty good to me - I made some minor copyedits. I noticed you're trying to create a unified format for all the screenwriter articles (I saw questions about the Controversy and Marriage and children sections). I wonder if you've considered having the Screenwriter project under the auspices of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Biography_9928.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography">Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography</a> (maybe it already is?) That way you could use the standards they've already set, and add new ones for sections specifically applicable to screenwriting. That way it's not just "well, I did it this way last time." &lt;shrug&gt; Hope this and the edits help.

<p>Thank you for your contributions to the <i>Gladiator</i> article, I have nominated it for GAC yesterday, so I'm waiting on that (I will soon move on to get Leslie Nielsen to GA). I don't think I'm ready to review articles for FA status yet as I don't know the guidelines that well, and have just recently become accustomed to the GA standards. I read the article and I don't see it having a problem reaching FA, but there are other reviewers that will have to determine that. I have a few suggestions: (ignore them if they go against the FA standards) add more wikilinks to some of the terms (such as Catholic and Hollywood). I believe you are able to wikilink items more than once throughout the article, so once in the intro, and at least once more in the article would probably be beneficial. In the Working scripts through production and after section, there is one statement that stands alone about the pre/sequel for <i>The Departed</i>. If you can, either incorporate it into another paragraph or expand it some more if possible. In the Becoming a producer section: "Nevertheless, as a producer Monahan would have obligations alien to a screenwriter, such as..." Although FA articles are supposed to have compelling prose, I don't think alien should be used here, as the article is meant for readers of all ages, and they may get confused of the wording. Maybe consider "unfamiliar" or "foreign". So again, ignore these if you don't think they apply, these are just similar issues I sometimes see when I review GACs. I hope the article passes, and if it does, I will mention it as one of our film-related articles in the WP:Films monthly newsletter. If you haven't already, consider joining the WP:Films project, we'd enjoy having you as a member. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 04:26, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was not clear that you were making a reference to Mamet or anyone else for that matter. I wrote a concise, clear comment about what I thought of Essjay's intellectual dishonesty (in contrast to some people who expounded on notions of truth in philosophical essays), and I found your comment flip and glib. At that point, it was not even clear that Wales knew/cared about what was going on, and Essjay had not apologised (he still hasn't).

<p>I beleive you have done some significant work in proposing your article for a feature? I see you are from WIkiproject Screenwriters. I am soon going to propose and start the WIkiProject Film Makers project - which should become a major project to look after articles on all actors, directors, cinemtographers, producers wtc. Do you think it would be a great idea if your project became a sub project within this framework.E.g actors would be a sub project also. WikiProject Screenwriters would be a part of the wider WikiProject Film Makers.

<p>Hi BillDeanCarter,</p>
<p>I created the "State University of New York at Purchase Alumni" category to categorize all of the people listed in the "Famous Alumni" section of the article "<a href="../../../s/t/a/State_University_of_New_York_at_Purchase_f177.html" title="State University of New York at Purchase">State University of New York at Purchase</a>" article. I don't know anything about Aaron Sorkin, I was only going by the claims of the person who added him to the famous alumni section.</p>
<p>You can remove him from the category if you want to, but I suppose it's possible to take classes or graduate from more than one college. <a href="../../../b/o/y/User%7EBoy_Cool67_bfb7.html" title="User:Boy Cool67">SquareShot97</a> 03:17, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
