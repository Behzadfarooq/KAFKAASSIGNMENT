<p>Hey howya doin. Love you website, great resource for those works that for whatever reason don't show up on Perseus. I think you'd be amused to know that the kids in my class on the Roman Principate have taken to citing you as a source in their last paper on Augustus. Just wanted to get the word from you as far as what degrees or academic positions or whatever you may have under your belt before explaining how they need to cite sources found on your website.

<p>You have already been told that this has been discussed in detail and produced bitter debate. The agreement was to leave articles as theu are for the moment until things have calmed down. That means articles will styles should have them left in, those that don't shouldn't have them put in. Since you don't don't seem to be bothered to check the archives, here are just some of the most recent bitter debates on the topic. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28biographies%29/Survey_on_Style-Prefixed_Honorary_Titles" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28biographies%29/Survey_on_Style-Prefixed_Honorary_Titles" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28biographies%29/Survey_on_Style-Prefixed_Honorary_Titles/Ratification" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28biographies%29/Survey_on_Style-Prefixed_Honorary_Titles/Ratification" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Please stop trying to trigger off this edit war and let things calm down, please!

<dd>Umm, thanks for the obscure link. I&#160;tried finding some such discussion, and just couldn't. Mind you, from what I've read of it so far, I&#160;find a bunch of people arguing, quite rightly, about an absurdly complex system of voting, rather than the question itself.... The fact that X is supposedly a troll should not have us all scurrying to do weird stuff because X doesn't like it; if Osama bin Ladin likes bananas, should&#160;I deny myself a banana split? One of the cardinal principles, supposedly, of Wikipedia, is that this is an encyclopedia, not an exercise in democracy. Since it's quite impossible to avoid the latter — see for example the POV that passes for consensus under <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Schiavo_9996.html" title="Terry Schiavo">Terry Schiavo</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/l/Split_infinitive.html" title="Split infinitive">split infinitive</a> and many other articles, complete with virulent aspersions on the minority and constant reverting, suggests that it is not — it all boils down to the fundamentally American myth that everything is solvable by democracy at the lowest denominator. Here we have a question requiring very very little specialized knowledge (everyone knows the Pope is "Your Holiness") therefore everybody feels we can chip in usefully. Majority voting on this kind of thing leads to stuff that is just plain wrong (a very large majority of people refer to ancient theaters as "amphitheaters" — it's still wrong). Wikipedia's credibility is at stake; and something this obstinately stupid, held to as policy, you tell me, to spite some poor schmuck in Canberra — doesn't make me feel good about editing anything; I&#160;mean, what good am&#160;I doing? <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 09:52, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hmm, this Jtdirl's recurring accusation vendetta against a "schmuck in Canberra" has already received overescalated measures. It has emerged that Jtdirl shoots before asking. If I heard it correctly, Jrdirl has told that he succeeded in getting some sort of long-term ban against the "schmuck" partially on basis of the "schmuck" having stalked "poor" Jtdirl. Also, our short-fused user colleague has now blocked a new user on basis of that being someone banned's sockpuppet. Of the veracity of that I do not know enough, but I realized that Jtdirl did it also clearly because they have different opinions, and I realized from earlier discussions that Jtdirl has been reprimanded for more-or-less unfounded blocks. I have seen Jtdirl's general behavior, and I can easily believe that he does things without deeper consideration, without prudent caution, hastily, without proof, often on basis of his own error, and generally in midst of hotness. (It could be proper if Jtdirl is asked not to made any admin actions in situations he has himself been involved, nor to users he himself feels to have been victim to. In such situations, it would always be better if a more objective admin makes the findings and decisions, not the one who "feels threatened" or "wants revenge".) Also this discussion here, but as well some in other cases, have alerted me to undertand that Jtdirl easily starts to enforce something he wants to think (or believes) as a decision (be it originally even not his own opinion) and is all too overeager in enforcing, even in cases where a decision has not been reached. In my opinion, styles (be they as "important" as majesties and holinesses) should not be USED by Wikipedia, but rather such should be explained in the text of the article. Having checked the referred earlier talks about the sort of great style war, I did not find anything clear as decision, as consensus. Rather, I found a number of eager proposals (from several quarters) apparently all shooted down by a dissatisfied majority, as it seems that always there could be a combination of opinion-wings to form a majority against any tangible solution. That means that all solutions will remain intangible (and impossible)&#160;:)) <a href="../../../2/1/7/User%7E217.140.193.123.html" title="User:217.140.193.123">217.140.193.123</a> 10:30, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Believe it or not I too am uncomfortable with using styles in the manner in which they are used. I strongly urged against it at the time. But it was adopted as policy. Re-opening the issue right would be akin to throwing petrol on a fire. All the protagonists would go full force into yet another nasty row, leaving no end of ill-feeling. My guess is that it is better to leave the stalemate option alone for a while: those articles that have them should keep them. Those that don't have them should not have them added. In a couple of months tempers will have cooled, some of the protagonists may have left and a calm debate may become possible. But right now doing anything that might provoke Round II of the wiki-wide edit war should be avoided <i>at all costs</i>. The bitterness is still too raw. People are still waiting for an opening to <i>get back</i> at the other side. It was a thoroughly nasty debate that descended into chaos — not helped by a disastrously mishandled vote and an attempt to interpret the results (or rather the non-results) is a very questionable way. I simply reverted the pages because I don't want to give either side the opening to say <i>oh look. If they are breaking the 'lets do nothing' rule, we'll do it too</i>. I don't want, like last time, to have my entire watchlist full of simultaneous edit wars. My strong advice is to leave things as they are <i>for now</i>. Right now if we tried to have another vote, even with a proper voting system, I doubt there would be a consensus on anything, just a reopening of old battles and scores to be settled.</dd>

<dd><i>I too am uncomfortable with using styles in the manner in which they are used</i> — Yes, I&#160;read one of the things you posted to a Talk somewhere, where you said as much. Now by temperament, I&#160;usually steer far clear of any kind of controversy, as well as the endlessly unproductive dullness of such things as that vote page you sent me to (Condorcet methods and politics and hoo-ha, yipes). Unfortunately, here the sheer eccentric stupidity of the hypercorrection — omigosh, we're dissing Queen Victoria, let's all dive in and defend her against the Ostrogoths — casts Wikipedia in such a patently foolish light that I&#160;thought it worth trying to get back to standard practice. I'm currently using the excuse that (on a <i>Memorial</i> page for the recently dead, but I'm overlooking, I'm overlooking) there does exist a page at the British monarchy site where some dead people get their styles, to keep me out of it. But it's making me rethink what the am&#160;I doing on Wikipedia.... In sum, faced with this kind of stupid stubbornness out there, it's back to work on my own site and let them all slug it out — Best, <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 23:04, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bill Thayer, bless my soul. You and I last communicated about the time of 9/1/1, when you were feeling bad. Subsequently I reinstalled my system and lost everything, and then moved and changed my address. I have only just now arrived on Wikipedia, in the midst of a storm. First of all, Bill, thank you so much once again for your most excellent LacusCurtius site. Second, you work harder than anyone I know or have known. Third, it seems to me this Wikipedia site is democracy in action. Democracy is nothing if not controversy, bickering, recrimination and negotiation. You make deals. You keep at it. In ancient studies, where's the line between original and non-original, fact and speculation? Who said what when and was he/she the first? It isn't so easy to determine. Personally I'm glad there are some monitors here and some rules to follow. Best of wishes, you wonderful man.<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Botteville</a> 17:02, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, bless your soul indeed David; I still have your e-mails by the way! (What are antiquarians for if not to collect and keep old stuff?) Yes, Wickedpedia is democracy in action, even if this is vociferously denied by its luminaries (Jimbo Wales: "Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy"); methinks they do protest too much — Anyhoo, there's not much I&#160;have enough of a stomach to bicker or be bickered at for, I&#160;just find it all depressing, to say nothing of horrific grammar-inducing.

<p>Greetings, and thanks for your edits and interest in wikipedia. Regarding the article, I thought it best to let you examine the article to see if it now merits removal of the cleanup tag that you included, as the article has been is substantially improved since your edit.</p>
<p>Regarding your placement of the <i>cleanup</i> tag in the marble sculpture article, this took a while for me to find as you had tagged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marble_sculpture&amp;diff=7611197&amp;oldid=7154644|your" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marble_sculpture&amp;diff=7611197&amp;oldid=7154644|your" rel="nofollow">edit</a> as <i>slight copy edit</i>, rather than <i>add cleanup tag</i>, so I had to do a binary search to find it (perhaps there is a faster way, if you know how to do this please let me know).

<p>Hi Bill, you helped me out once on a language issue. I'm still no native English speaker, but embarked on another round of policy-writing. I'd very, <i>very</i>, much like if you had a look at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28people%29_db33.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (people)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (people)</a>. It's new, and should be able to streamline a few issues. I haven't the slightest idea whether policy-writing interests you. But I'd think it sad this one would only get discussed on language flaws. So that's why you would do me a great favour to open the page and improve the language where you think appropriate!

<dd>Very little to improve on, unless people are being very picky; I&#160;did it, though. The two most important items are <i>seldom</i> (<i>*seldomly</i> does not exist, it is a barbarism); and, even more important, you meant <i>advisable</i>, not <i>advisory</i>: <i>advisory</i> means, speaking of a notice or panel of people, <i>that takes on the function of advising</i> (as in an Advisory Board), but <i>advisable</i> means, speaking of a course of action, <i>to be recommended or preferred</i>.

<p>To keep the attribution reasonably visible to administrators, I did move it to the talk page. Worst case should be a casual editor slaps the copyvio tag on the main page without checking the talk page and an administrator notes the talk page and quickly reverts it back. Of course, the ideal solution would be to rewrite the article so that it doesn't duplicate text found elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sorry you got caught in the crossfire, there's another editor who does the same as what you did there, but sticks it on every single page they start (pages which are much more dreadfully written than Treia and thus likelier to be spotted as copies) which is why I called it a "vanity" signature. When I came across that page doing the same, I applied the same medicine. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 15:45, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, <i>de borealis sol</i> is ungrammatical; but I think you are prescribing more than Latin does: the ablative of <i>i</i>-stems is variable; compare <i>turris</i>/<i>turre</i>. Also, while I cannot think of a compact way to put this (or I would have) the intention of the anagrammatist <i>may</i> be to use <i>borealis</i>, correctly, as a genitive (although there is also the dreadful possibility that this is dictionary-Latin, ignoring inflexions entirely). <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 16:30, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was a slip which the Wiki software just would not let me correct in the little box! What I&#160;meant was not that <i>-is</i> words had ablatives in <i>-i</i> (as you point out, of course), but that <i>-alis</i> words did (without exception); the grammatical expression would have been "de sole boreali". For what any of this is worth, of course, because of the making of silly pseudo-anagrams to bolster even stupider theories there is no end, either in this connection or in others.... <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 18:15, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I noticed your advanced understanding of Italian, and was hoping you could help. I'm trying to finish creating all the articles from the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911_Britannica_b1c3.html" title="1911 Britannica">1911 Britannica</a> that we still don't have. The 1911 Britannica has an entry for <a href="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/APO_ARN/ARIANO_DI_PUGLIA.html" class="external text" title="http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/APO_ARN/ARIANO_DI_PUGLIA.html" rel="nofollow">Ariano di Puglia</a>, but I couldn't find it in the Italian Wikipedia or on Italian websites. The closest I can find is <a href="../../../../it/a/n/z/Anzano_di_Puglia_a92d.html" class="extiw" title="it:Anzano_di_Puglia">it:Anzano di Puglia</a>. Can you figure out if these are the same place? Or maybe Ariano is called something new now. Thanks. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-10-12 15:40</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>The place is almost certainly <a href="../../../../it/a/r/i/Ariano_Irpino_4b29.html" class="extiw" title="it:Ariano_Irpino">Ariano Irpino</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(1) Ariano Irpino is in the province of Avellino, in Campania, and its former name, according to at least one webpage (<a href="http://www.asmez.it/arianoirpino/goto.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asmez.it/arianoirpino/goto.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>) was "Ariano di&#160;Puglia"; but Anzano di Puglia is (now) in the province of Foggia, in Puglia. On the other hand quite a few provincial borders have been adjusted since 1911.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(2) Ariano Irpino is something like "24&#160;miles" (about&#160;39&#160;km) E of Benevento. Anzano is about 60&#160;km E&#160;of Benevento.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(3) Ariano Irpino is a sizable town, currently 22,000 people. Anzano di Puglia is (now) about a tenth of that, 2200. Allowing for population trends, Ariano is a better fit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(4) Aequum Tuticum, mentioned in the 1911, is (now) thought to be S.&#160;Eleuterio, near Ariano Irpino. But then the 1911 states (my italics) that "should probably be sought at S.&#160;Eleuterio <i>51 M. north</i>." Now 51&#160;miles S of S.&#160;Eleuterio would put the article's town somewhere around Eboli — hardly E&#160;of Benevento: therefore "51" is a scangarble, probably for&#160;"5".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But:</dd>
<dd>(1) The altitude given in the Britannica article seems to be — allowing for the scangarble — around 1500 feet, which converts to about 450‑500 meters. Anzano di Puglia is at 776 (2546&#160;feet), Ariano Irpino is even higher, at 809&#160;meters (2654&#160;feet). Neither one fits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(2) Neither one of them is (now) on a rail line. But in fact the rail network has shrunk since&#160;1911. Then again, loosely speaking, Ariano — but not Anzano — has a station not far off, about 7&#160;km away, calling itself "Ariano".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>Why?

I'm slowly writing my in-depth article about history of Rome (I'm from Rome), but, as English is not my first language, users have banned it (I think they're right) as badly written. Could I ask you to check it and correct freely my Bad English? My idea is: I put the infos, you improve tha article after I've written... if you've time, of course.

<dd>I don't know. I'm one of the least political of animals, and that applies to Wikipedia as elsewhere, so I&#160;haven't the faintest idea. Maybe the Village Pump or some other place to air the question; would you believe I don't even know where the Village Pump is?? My hope is that by attaching my plaintive bleat to every reverted vandal edit of mine, someone will come along who can focus those who think it's a good idea. (By the way I'll be mostly offline Nov.&#160;17‑29, so will almost certainly not be tracking anything here during that time.)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I&#160;know! But, shouldn't you at least mention the Atratinus mausoleum for example (I&#160;know that's real, since I&#160;have photos of it, as well as a xerox of a very detailed city guide that talks about it, both provided by a frequent visitor who loves the place), and carry over the dimensions of the Mausoleo di Planco? One of these days by the way I&#160;do hope to go to Gaeta myself: the town is on my "B"&#160;list, along with about two dozen other places in Italy like Loreto, Stilo, Pentema, Modena, S.&#160;Leo.... (My "A"&#160;list still includes such places as Venice, a number of places in Puglia, Labro, Cerveteri, it's an endless process!)

<p>Hi - I edited <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> last night to remove some excess astrology stuff, including the listing of astrology as a <i>field of study</i> under astronomy. My changes were quickly reverted by a self proclaimed <i>judicial astrologer</i>.

<dd>I&#160;saw a lot of rewording, much of it rather poor writing, but nothing much to quibble over one way or the other. The style of the anti-astrology editors is better than that of the pro-astrology editors. As for the meat of the subject, on balance, the article <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">Astronomy</a> should reflect what is now called "astronomy", with only a tip of the hat to the history of the discipline, in which astronomy and astrology were more or less fused; the astrology/astronomy connection would be best explored on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_astronomy.html" title="History of astronomy">History of astronomy</a> page, but I&#160;notice that that article has been taken over by the anti-astrology camp; the official POV — Wikipedia NPOV being utter nonsense, of course, and each article having its own POV determined by local majorities, the majority riding rough-shod over the minority — is anti-astrology in both. I&#160;won't step into this mess again, mostly because it is doomed to be an endless revert war; with a 5000-page website of my own, I&#160;got better fish to fry, I'm afraid. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 15:30, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do in a way appreciate your experiment with watching a random act of vandalism to see how quickly it is reverted (or not-quickly, in the case), but I think, for the good of the project, it's about time to fix it, or tell someone about it. Consider it proved that vandalism often does <i>not</i> get reverted in minutes, and remember it as an example of one of wikipedia's problems, but letting vandalism go for so long only hurts the project and aids the vandals. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Freedom_of_speech&amp;diff=23221649&amp;oldid=23067709" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Freedom_of_speech&amp;diff=23221649&amp;oldid=23067709" rel="nofollow">This edit</a>, while it didn't last for months did stay until I fixed it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Freedom_of_speech&amp;diff=24741469&amp;oldid=24738691" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Freedom_of_speech&amp;diff=24741469&amp;oldid=24738691" rel="nofollow">here</a> more than two weeks and 16 edits later.

<p>Thanks for your help with the French stuff. Are you certain about no accent on Denis? I have two references listed that include it. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 15:15, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, he just conceivably might have had some peculiar spelling of <i>Denis</i>, idiosyncratic to his family — and that I don't know — but the standard name <i>Denis</i> is accentless. (Google confirms this, if very curiously: the spelling <i>Denis</i> gets , the spelling <i>Dénis</i> — but then almost none of these latter pages in fact have <i>Dénis</i>, rather <i>Denis</i> — a Google mystery. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 15:32, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your help with the Greek. I was having problems with your literal polytonic letters, but found a way to see them using a &lt;span&gt;, copied from {{<a href="../../../p/o/l/Template%7EPolytonic_2c4e.html" title="Template:Polytonic">polytonic</a>}}.</p>

<dd>Yes, I&#160;do a lot of polytonic Greek for my own site <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/8*.html#3.21" class="external text" title="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/8*.html#3.21" rel="nofollow">(sample here)</a>, and type the stuff — aided by a polytonic keyboard — regularly. Your ref may have decided to transcribe Greek as monotonic, which is either post-1982 or .&#160;.&#160;. understandably, because all the jots and titles, to coin a phrase, get very tedious indeed .&#160;.&#160;. <i>lazy</i>; we've all done it. Still, the citation is from the Septuagint, and thus monotonic Greek is an anachronism.

<p>I read your message on my talk page. My native tongues are both French and English. I know from years of listening to French news or reading French newspapers that the article is not used. Only with US states in the masculine is the article used, so you find État du Maine, État du Maryland. For states in the feminine, the article is not used: État de Californie, État de Louisiane. Don't try to identify grammatical rules, it's just usage, a special rule for formal names I guess ("État de"). Likewise, people say "le Land de Bavière" or "la Communauté autonome de Catalogne" (no "la" article). On the other hand, of course people would say "l'économie de la Louisiane", "l'histoire de la Louisiane", etc. Compare this with French régions. People say "Région Bretagne" or "Région Picardie", that's official name, but they would say "l'économie de la Bretagne", "l'histoire de la Picardie". To make things more confusing, people say "le soleil de Provence" or "une ville de Provence" (no article), but they say "l'économie de la Provence" or "le passé de la Provence" (article). Go figure! It's just usage. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHardouin_7fc4.html" title="User:Hardouin">Hardouin</a> 00:20, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know who wrote the "la" in the first place, and if it's you please do not feel offended. My comment was mainly addressed to people with little knowledge of French who frequently butcher French on the English Wikipedia, which is irritating. Once, at the Detroit article I saw a guy who wrote that the name of the city comes from French "d'étroit"! In fact I get upset anytime I see people butchering foreign languages, be it French, Chinese (often butchered on English Wikipedia too), or any other language. About Gironde, French people say "département de la Gironde" (article). Don't ask me why! lol. Now that I think about it, most feminine départements keep their article, but there are exceptions ("conseil général de Loire Atlantique", no article). Why? Why? Why? French is the craziest language on earth. I wonder how foreigner can learn it. Anyway, for Louisiana, you can also check this French wikipedia page (<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroisses_de_l%27%C3%89tat_de_Louisiane" class="external autonumber" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroisses_de_l%27%C3%89tat_de_Louisiane" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>).

The orientation page does state, however, "The book contains 65&#160;engravings and 28&#160;photographs. Some of them relate directly to the text, others illustrate it only loosely; I've reproduced all of them." — and, at the foot of every one of my pages, it is stated that anything with a single asterisk in the URL is public domain, and that explanation links to further details on copyright. At any rate, your particular item is public domain. My own photographs, when I&#160;add any, are very clearly set off, but I&#160;admit that that's a negative indication. <i>I&#160;may need to add to that page and similar orientation pages that unless stated otherwise, all illustrations come with the text.</i> And so, by input from others, especially careful readers, we all progress.

<p>Hi Bill, I say you making some improvements to 'Roman' articles lately. Have you noticed that <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> is currently being reorganized (and hopefully improved), on <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_reorganization_b900.html" title="Roman Empire/reorganization">Roman Empire/reorganization</a>? Maybe you would like to join the effort. Cheers,--<a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHippalus_4c45.html" title="User:Hippalus">Hippalus</a> 06:58, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll take a peek, but I've kinda stuck to pointing the way to improvements that someone else can make. I've been, as usual, busy very much fulltime with my own site. Sorry, <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 12:18, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bill, When you are tagging articles (or other miscellany on Wikipedia} for speedy deletion, you shouldn't mark the edit as minor. Secondly, you might like to archive your talk page, it is very long and on some browsers this causes problems. --<font color="green"><b><a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarykirk_bfbb.html" title="User:Garykirk">Gary Kirk</a></b></font> <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarykirk_63c7.html" title="User talk:Garykirk">(talk)</a> 12:57, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
