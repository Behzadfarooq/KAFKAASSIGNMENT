<p>Why is there a page for Bill White? Does Wikipedia allow just anybody to have a page? I have my own website, I am politically active, and I have an IQ over 150, just like Bill. Does that make me eligible for a page on Wikipdia?</p>
<p>Shouldn't this page be taken down? In what way is Bill White significant enough for a Wikipedia site (aside from the adulations of his ex-girlfriend, below)?</p>
<p>I suggest we consider this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can you cite numerous appearances of yourself in the media? As objectionable as he may be, White is a figure who frequently garners the public eye. - <a href="../../../n/1/h/User%7EN1h1l_1b37.html" title="User:N1h1l">N1h1l</a> 12:53, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am also into politics and have my own website. I had some friends place my listing on wikipedia to help keep information current as I am also an officer of my party to help record additional information for history. I guess they only let in nazis and not democratic socialist at wikipedia.

<p>Wikipedia has lost criteria these days. Any piece of shit can have a page now, if 2 or more people visit their website or give a shit about opinions.--200.222.3.3 18:36, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not only that but Bill White is such a common name that I have people asking me if I am the same Bill White. I am Bill White (formally William J. White), Synchronicity Expert and can be found at <a href="http://www.successradio1111.com" class="external free" title="http://www.successradio1111.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.successradio1111.com</a> I am in no way a bigot or a socialist. I find this Bill White's views not only repugnant but an insult to the name.</p>
<dl>
<dd>To you and all the other <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_dd3b.html" title="Bill White">Bill Whites</a> in the world please be assured that we took great care and discussed at length about what to name this article, what to include in it, and even whether to retain it all. We also had a similar debate about a similar person with a similarly common name, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Black_cc55.html" title="Don Black">Don Black</a>. Having a common name, you must surely face mistaken identities more than most other people (though at least you don't have to spell your names over the phone every time!) Hopefully, confusion due to the coincidence of name will be unlikely due to the title of the article, the photograph of the subject, and the detailed biography. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 08:53, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand that this page is written entirely by anti-racists for the purpose of smearing me, and that Wikipedia is a bad joke all around, but please stop inserting false information -- and then repeatedly enforcing the insertion of false information. -- Bill White <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.10.35.153 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.10.35.153.html" title="User talk:68.10.35.153">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.10.35.153_3708.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.10.35.153">contribs</a>) 15:21, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>Mostly, this article consists of things I've said taken out of context, negative news articles on me quoted without regard to positive news articles, and is a generally professional smear job that can't stand up to scrutiny but can probably be BS'ed as meeting Wikipedia's "standards". Given that the chief moderater, "Willmcw", has a stated personal dislike of me, this is not a surprise. Unfortunately, my real world life doesn't afford me the luxury of being able to edit this page every few days to add back in the untrue statements that are made.</p>
<p>However, I have changed a lot of the specific lies that I see being made here:</p>
<p>First, there are a number of comments about how I "describe myself" that are untrue -- they are dated and they are conflated with current comments in order to create a deliberately misleading picture.</p>
<p>Second, I have run for office several times in Montgomery County, Maryland in nine and seven way races and won, pretty consistently, 7% of the vote. I have never run as a write in and I have copies of the old news articles showing the election results, even if they are no longer available on the Montgomery County Board of Election websites.</p>
<p>Third, White Web Publishing, Inc, did not go "bankrupt" (if it did -- source the bankruptcy papers. I've never filed a bankruptcy in my life). I sold it off to a friend of mine when I moved from Maryland in later 2003.</p>
<p>Fourth, I own thirty three housing units in Roanoke Virginia, but renting housing is a secondary business for me. My primary business is the construction and the re-construction of abandoned houses.</p>
<p>If there is anything that is really notable about me, other than my publishing ventures, it is the amount of hatred I engender from anti-racists.

<p>Personally, I do not like this article. Any middle of the road, average American who might happen to read it would automatically gain a negative image of William (Bill) White due to his past affiliations and current beliefs. If I had to write a mini-bio on White, I certainly wouldn’t have chosen anus.com as a website. It just doesn’t sound like a very credible source of information for anything other than anal activities. While this article is full of information about White, it is severely lacking in who the person behind the name and semi-notorious fame is.</p>
<p>Many things, both good and bad, can be said about Bill White. Luckily, I had the opportunity to get to know White outside of his activism and can speak of the person. When I first met him, I too thought he was just another shallow and egotistical person with a very warped view of society and life. I continued talking to White and found him to be very educated, very well polished, and very passionate about his beliefs. No goose-stepping. No white robes hanging in the closet. No empty beer cans littering the front lawn.</p>
<p>As a friend White will have no problems speaking his mind with you. White does not coddle. He will not sugar coat things to make you feel better and this has upset some of those who used to be included in his close circle of friends and loved ones. For those people, I say this: grow up and listen to him. You might hate to hear what he has to say, but his advice comes from wisdom and concern. I know that if I ever face troublesome or confusing times, I can go to White and he will give much needed advice, friendship, and guidance. I frequently find myself saying “why didn’t I just listen to him?”</p>
<p>After a brief romance with White, I learned even more unimaginable things about him. Although it might later be denied, there is escaping the fact that White has a heart the size of Rhode Island. He is extremely compassionate, fun-loving, and an all around good guy. I thoroughly enjoyed the time that I spent with him. Plus, White’s pictures just don’t do him justice; he is an awfully attractive young man with amazing eyes. He just has to beat the women off of him with a stick.</p>
<p>In today’s age, it is hard to find people like Bill White. Instead of obsessing over the latest “in” thing, White spends his free time cultivating himself and trying to improve the world. I for one am impressed that he is so passionate about his beliefs, stands up for them, and tries to spread them. Far too many people have not even a tenth of the courage that White has. I feel lucky that I have been able to call this great man my friend. --Jmr2005 04:51, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As long as he's a self-identified Nazi, then I don't see the problem using that in the title (I didn't like "fascist" because its meaning is different, and it wasn't obvious to me that he fitted it; he doesn't seem bright enough to be a fascist, which is a genuine political position, whereas being a Nazi doesn't take any intelligence at all). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 15:59, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone had written that White received 7% of the vote for school board in 2000. Based in info from the <a href="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/eletmpl.asp?url=/content/elections/previouselectionsNEWz.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/eletmpl.asp?url=/content/elections/previouselectionsNEWz.asp" rel="nofollow">Montgomery County Board of Elections website</a>, I changed that to 0.7%, based on the write-in total for the general election.</p>
<p>Looking a little deeper at the pages, however, it seems White -- or someone with the same name -- did receive 6.6% of the vote in the primary election that year. However, White is also listed as a write-in candidate for the general (run-off) election, the one in which all write-ins combined got 0.7%.</p>
<p>I am unfamiliar with Maryland election law here. Is it possible for someone to run as a write-in in the general election after losing in a nonpartisan primary? <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 13:56, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anyone who considers the ADL, the SPLC, and the Jewish press "accurate, neutral" sources is a retard. Frankly, all of Wikipedia is a sick joke -- do read the articles on this site?

<p>While I am no fan on this guy, I'd have to say that the changes Bill White made on November 16th aren't really unbalanced. They are partially sourced, though not by third party sources. However, the previous version that it has been reverted to is equally unsourced. I think that Bill's changes should be put back in, to some degree. When I get some downtime, I'll review them, remove anything too biased, salvage anything worthwhile from the current revision, and put up a new compromise version.</p>

I have gone through and merged all the edits. I have removed many unsourced statements by <b>both sides.</b> While Bill's recent edits were revereted as being unsourced, I was amazed to see how many unsourced allegations were in the pervious version as well. Once you go over it line by line that is.</p>
<p>So I've cleaned it up, balanced it out, and thrown a dozen <b>citation needed</b> tags in it. <b>Please do not revert this rewrite en masse.</b> Please address the specific points, add citations, etc. I'll be going over this again in a month, and if the citations don't turn up I'll start pruning, from <b>both sides.</b></p>

<p>Bill White is not a racist. Anyone who bothers to read his past accounts and activism can see that he does what he does for the attention he receives -both from the media and general public. His constant failed attempted take overs of several different racist organizations and his close friendships of media people like Isis, show his real intent.</p>
<p>He talks of waving a pistol in the face's of his enemies and has recently published a grand story of beating five bikers up all by himself.</p>
<p>Maybe you didn't notice -- White was picked up for brandishing in late 2005 and the video of him fighting the bikers appeared on TV news in Maryland in 2003. &#160;;-D</p>
