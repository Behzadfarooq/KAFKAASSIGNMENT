<p>The wilderness is a barren area in the game RuneScape. It was originally the only place for players to fight each other, and is still the most dangerous method of player versus player combat in RuneScape.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>[edit] Special Wilderness Rules The wilderness consists of levels. As players proceed further north, the level of the wilderness increases. As this level increases, a player may attack enemies that are that many levels below or above them. (ex. in level 20 wilderness, a lvl 90 can attack anyone up to level 110 and as low as level 70) In the wilderness, players who have attacked another player within the last 20 minutes are identified with a skull shown fixed above their heads. Players killed with this status normally lose all the items they are carrying rather than retaining their three most valuable items.</p>
<p><br />
[edit] Wilderness combat</p>
<p>A player observes the Demonic Ruins, a popular area for PvP combat. [edit] Pures Many player-killers spend hours developing and training their characters known as "pures". Pures can be either pure rangers, pure mages, or pure strength. The concept of a pure is to keep the character’s combat level relatively low while raising the level in the specialization skill to unexpectedly high levels, thereby allowing the pure to inflict large amounts of damage on non-pures of a similar combat level. As the combat level is calculated from all seven of the combat skills (attack, strength, defense, hitpoints, prayer, ranged, and magic), some skills must be sacrificed to keep the combat level low. For example, a pure ranger might have a combat level of 40, with ranged of 60, prayer of 1, and defence of 1, sacrificing prayer and defense to keep the combat level low.</p>
<p><br />
[edit] Teams and clans Many players travel the Wilderness alone; however, some prefer to travel with a team that may include one or more of each type of combat pure along with regular players. In some cases, teams include players at different combat levels. In this manner, the team can effectively player-kill virtually any other lone player they encounter.</p>
<p>Many team members on member servers purchase and wear team capes, which cause other players on their team (i.e. wearing the same cape) to show up as blue dots, rather than the normal white or green dots, on the minimap. More importantly, team capes cause the default action not to be 'attack' if team members accidentally click on members of their own team in the middle of battle. However, this does not prevent players from overriding the default and attacking their own teammates if they choose to do so.</p>
<p>Carrying the concept of teams to the next level, some players who travel the wilderness join large RuneScape clans, which consist of armies of players who enter the Wilderness together on joint missions. Clans are usually well organized, and the combat levels of the players involved can vary greatly, though many clans have regulations for minimum levels.</p>
<p><br />
[edit] Non-Player Characters The Wilderness, like the rest of RuneScape, contains a population of non player characters, or NPCs. Many of the NPCs in the wilderness are high level enemies capable of easily killing an unprepared player. Monsters deeper in the Wilderness tend to be stronger. In addition to the monsters, there are shopkeepers, traveling merchants, and bankers.</p>
<p>A wizard named Kolodion can be found close to the end of the Wilderness. He challenges players to defeat him, giving a reward of special items which enhance magical abilities. Capes and staffs are rewarded to the people that defeat his many forms. Closer to the edge is a cave containing the King Black Dragon, the highest level dragon in RuneScape. Another creature who inhabits the edge of the wilderness is the chaos elemental, a monster who uses magic to unequip his foe and teleport him randomly, to someone unequipped he is quite dangerous, and ranks third highest level of any monster in the game.</p>
