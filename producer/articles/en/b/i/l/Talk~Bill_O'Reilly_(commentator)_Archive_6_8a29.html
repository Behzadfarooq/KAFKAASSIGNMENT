<h2><span class="mw-headline">I can't change this page but..</span></h2>
<p>the opening paragraph should say "conservative commentator". the common consensus on all sides is that oreilly is a conservative commentator. it seems misleading to not identify him as such. even his website asks visitors "Do you disagree with Bill O'Reilly's conservative point of view?"</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversy Section should just be a summary paragraph.</span></h2>
<p>Since there is an entire article devoted to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies_bce5.html" title="Bill O'Reilly controversies">Bill O'Reilly controversies</a>, I believe the controversy section in his main article shouldn't be any more than a summary paragraph and should refrain from listing details of any of the controversies. This is per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_forking#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_forking#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" rel="nofollow">wikipedia's recommendation on how to handle article spinouts</a>. I had previously moved the sexual harassment and malmedy controversies to his controversy page where they are listed #1 and #2, respectively. If you disagree, please explain why. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 19:54, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I had started the Malmedy massacre section of the controversies section, and noticed you moved it and the sexual harassment section shortly thereafter. I believe at the very least the controversies section section should be expanded to more than one paragraph. Bill is and has been cited many times for his controversional rhetoric, and in light of his high perched fair and balanced no-spin claims, the main article deserves a slightly more thorough overview of his controversies. Otherwise it may seem the to majority of casual readers as if the articles caretakers are bias in further widdling down points critical to it's subject. This caretaker bias seems more imbalanced when you view the full history of the article and see how the controveries section has become smaller and smaller over time. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 23:17, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you think the summary can be rewritten to give a more thorough overview of his controveries than it currently does, have at it. Keep it to an overview, not a list of them, though. The more that is listed, the more people are going to think "why isn't this other controversy listed in the summary? Hey, let me go add it," and that's how it starts growing again. I could care less whether something appears biased to casual readers as long as it really isn't. All we're doing is following wikipedia's good recommendation on how to handle article spinouts -- something that should have been done awhile ago. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a>
<dl>
<dd>I understand and agree, though I know you understand I may not the actual person to add the expansion. Is there a way to sticky this information up top so that future editors don't delete a concise and on point expansion of the controversies? Or also so that the opposite doesn't happen where it grows beyond an overview into a litany of controversies? <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 02:16, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't worry too much about it. If the new summary is good it's less likely to get modified and if it does, it will be easy enough to revert.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 02:31, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the cited policy, the summury must be npov and avoid be in favor of some viewpoints over others. The current summary has almost no content (just 1 argument is cited), so is hiding the O'Reilly criticts viewpoints. I think it should include some more of the most notables (i.e. making neocon propaganda). --Lau 16:15, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sexual Scandal section in Personal background section.</span></h2>
<p>I don't think it is appropriate to make a "sexual scandal section" in his personal background. That section is a a good personal bio/history and any great detail of recent events (good or bad) would be out of place there I think. There is a whole page devoted to his <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies_bce5.html" title="Bill O'Reilly controversies">controversies</a> where the scandal is already listed and somewhat fleshed out. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 02:51, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>disagree--- Even Bill called it "a chapter of my life now behind me", so it is a chapter of his life.

<p>It is incorrect and in violation of Wikipedias policy to label O'Reillys taped remarks as lewd-- There is no context to O'Reilly's taped remarks, nor are his specific words quoted, so describing them to them as 'lewd' is without citation-- in violation of Wikipedia's policy on articles about living persons. Sean7phil 17:41, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>His specific words are quoted in the complaint, which is cited. The complaint also describes the contexts in which the remarks were made. These remarks clearly fit the definition of the word "lewd". Moreover, the complaint specifically uses the word "lewd" to describe his remarks. The statement as written is undeniably factual and verifiable. <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELagringa_18d2.html" title="User:Lagringa">Lagringa</a> 20:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Why is there so little about the scandal? This could have been written by O'Reilly himself! It emphasizes the extortion suit (which appears to be baseless) and leaves out any of the detailed allegations in Mackris's suit. Why is there no mention of falafel? <a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELagringa_18d2.html" title="User:Lagringa">Lagringa</a> 20:03, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The rules are pretty stringent on bios of living people. Adding details of the sexual discrimination suit such as "falafel" runs the risk of violating WP:NOV. In addition, there are problems with verifiability and sourcing of those claims. Granted the accusations were made, reprinted heavily, and was widely disseminated, there is still the issue for Wiki editors to come up with a reliable source discussing this stuff. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 20:31, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ann Coulter</span></h2>
<p>I researched the O'Reilly criticism of Ann Coulter and found on his June 8 2006 talking points memo Bill said the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"On The Radio Factor today, some callers supported Ann. 'Talking Points' believes most Americans reject that kind of vitriol because it is mean and counterproductive.

<p>This is hardly the categorization of Ann Coulter as a far-right extremist, as some have suggested. He goes on in a later segment saying "Miss Coulter has a good point about these women". <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 13:25, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I read the article you cited he definitely calls her a far right extremist. I think its a little disingeniuous to suppose the part of COulters statement he agrees with is that these women are harpies rather than the criticism of when political leaders (on either side) pick sympathetic characters to push politics. The wiki article already states Bill Oreilly claims Michael Moore, Al Franken, and the DIxie chicks are far left. the article you cited shows he thinks the same of Ann Coulter. paragraph 4: " O'Reilly likened Coulter to liberal Air America host Al Franken, stating that Coulter risked becoming "the right-wing Al Franken" because both "smear" others in their books." paragraph 5 "O'Reilly has also compared Coulter to Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines, stating that both women spout "rhetoric" that is "extreme." " Bill Oreilly once had michael moore on his show and they agreed on several points even though he considers moore far left. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 16:55, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, so getting down to brass tacks, where in the article did Bill state that he thinks Ann Coulter is on the far right?

<dd>Okay great, if you know he has on a number of occasions mentioned her name as an example of someone on the far right, just site the source and put it in the article.

<dd>About the same-sex marriage amendment, Bill said on the subject that tradional marriage is between one man and one women, and then went on to add that traditionalists like himself believe the government should protect traditional marriage.

<dd>Bill said on the subject the gay marriage amendment that "heterosexual marriage is a stabilizing force is a strong one", then lots gay marriage in with polygamy, as if polygamy were a human condition. He said he believes America is strong because of traditional marriage (i.e. same-sex marriage), and redirects the attack to whom he sees as the real issue "a bunch of liberal judges". At the end of his piece, Bill said the case of gay marriage has already been decided after having quoted a majority opinion 58% against allowing gays to marry. So after all of this arguing in Bill's piece, does it sound he like supports gay marriage or is against it? Finally, please have the courtesy to refrain from attacking me with your newly found concept of logical fallicies before I have spoken, or were you attempting to criticise Bill O'Reilly? <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 06:42, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that Bill O'Reilly doesnt like gay marriage but that doesnt mean he wont tolerate a law allowing gay marriage. People tolerate Pat Robertson, etc. and support Free speech (although pornography laws, hate speech legislation, etc.). I think in this case the overarching principle is equality under law or discrimination.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 15:48, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>O'Reilly is actually apathetic to gay marriage in principle. He'll sarcastically say something like not caring if "Lenny marries Squiggy."</dd>
<dd>He usually uses the slippery slope argument against the idea of gay marriage. He supports gay adoption but qualifies that by usually asking a proponent of it to say that a stable, hetero couple is the optimum choice. In other words, gay adoption is ok if there is no stable hetero couple available. That is my understanding. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 21:34, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Mrdthree, in your last edit you said:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>I think this is open to interpretation. You must have a quote that says he is for or against the amendment.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
<p>I will use a little example here to prove the above statement wrong. One need not say explicitly, "I support democracy" in order to be labeled a supporter of democracy. All that is required is a record (perhaps long) of loudly publicly touting only the positive benefits of democracy, and at the same time negatively attacking other forms of government. This person might also for example positively mischaracterize the popular aspects of democracy and negatively do the same for the other side in their speaches. By doing these things they have added their credence to the cause of democracy, furthering it's acceptance. Now even though this person may not have said explicitly the magic phrase "I support democracy", it's still certainly fair to state that this person is a supporter of democracy.</p>
<p>With this in mind, in the case of the gay marriage amendment argument, Bill has followed this kind of support. When recently talking <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198343,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198343,00.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> on the subject of gay marriage amendment Bill said America has been made strong by same-sex marriage, the rights of the 58 percent of Americans who want gay marriage banned is paramount, there is no question what the people want, and the decision against gay marriage has already been made and should be respected. He also said activist liberal judges (i.e. an amendment protects us from activist liberal judges) might impose gay marriage on Americans, the people don't like that, and lots gay people that want to marry in with polygamists.</p>
<p>For this reason it's fair to say Bill supports the gay marriage amendment. Do you disagree? State your case here before reverting. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 07:20, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Suppose he were against the legalization of gay marriage there are many state and federal mechanisms for this beyond a federal constitutional amendment. Second, this is a flip flop from his stated positions on the issue in the past (see our earlier discussion on conservative, moderate, liberal) and that should be newsworthy among bloggers but only you have interpretted this column that way, third in order to make your generalization you broke your own rules of evidence (in the section on Coulter) you can criticize but you are also inventing and discarding rules so you can post your opinion about what Bill O'Reilly's opinion on an issue is.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 15:14, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The topic of the Bill's most recent statements was a constitutional amendment protecting same-sex marriage aptly opening with:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The proposed constitutional amendment supporting traditional marriage: that's the subject of this evening's 'Talking Points'Memo.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So to suppose his statements were directed at other "federal mechanisms" is wrong.</dd>
<dd>With regards to flip-flops, I see no changing of position here other than Bill's timely reminder that the people have spoken, decision time is over, and it's results should now be respected.
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The folks decide that by voting and, in the case of gay marriage, the folks have decided. And that decision should be respected.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Further, evidence of a change of position (which I don't see, and you haven't presented) does not negate Bill's most recent statements. Either way, people can change sides. What is important is his record now.</dd>

<dd>Finally, I don't understand what rules you say I am inventing. The concept of supporting a position by speaking out publicly in favor of it, while decrying the opposition is nothing new. Many case studies and laws have been passed to this effect through the world. In China you can and will be found guilty for speaking against the government and using speach to support democracy. In America you can be arrested for decrying the US and speaking and passing out books in support of terrorism. Also, here in America you can be found guilty of speaking out against an organization and speaking in support of violence against that organization. Although I disagree with all of these laws, they share a common thread that links to a single fact. A person's support of any concept is not dependant on a single "magic phrase", rather we factually say you support it when you loudly speak postively about it, and speak negatively about the opposite side. I didn't make the rule, logic did long ago.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for copying and pasting my comments to you back to me. It goes to show how deeply you considered what I have said. The truth is there is a considerable difference between the burden of proof in showing what someone has <b>done</b> versus what someone <b>thinks</b>. There is universal consensus in that regard. To say that someone thinks something is true, you cannot simply use their comparison of two things and draw a conclusion from that. In your example you said Bill believes the Dixie Chick were far-left extremists, he compared Ann Coulter to the Dixie Chicks, therefore he must think Ann Coulter is an extremist. That kind of logic doesn't fly when proving what someone thinks. You must have a statement close or near to a synonym of "Ann Coulter is an extremist" to prove that point, so to just throw that same logic at me doesn't make sense.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now since I have factually explained with several clean examples the fallacy the "magic phrase" argument, which you have yet to respond to, I will instead take on your Bill O'Reilly alledged contrary statements.
<dl>
<dd><i>"Look, I couldn't care less, to tell you the truth," he says eventually of same­sex marriage.</i> - This is an apathetic (look the word up) position on the subject where Bill reveals his personal beliefs when pressed on the subject.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"If you can get that changed, I'm not going to jump up and down and say I think it's wrong, because I don't"</i> - Another apathetic statements about his beliefs.</dd>

There's no chance to get a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in this country."</i> - Taken from his show his as a piece of hard interviewing with conservative columnist Michelle Malkin. A hard interview is a journalism technique and does not suppose support of a position on the part of the interviewer. Are you saying Bill is not a journalist?</dd>

<dd>So what you have are two statements of Bill's apathetic (i.e. non supporting indifference) beliefs towards gay marriage. Bill's non supporting beliefs aside, the debate isn't about what's in Bill's mind, rather it's about what Bill does. I provided a very clear argument you keep dodging, and instead you respond by pasting my statements back. This shows an amout of laziness (and also plagiarism) on your part. I was nice enough go along with that and even demonstrated difference in the required burden of proof.

<p>I see a great description of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America" class="extiw" title="w:Media_Matters_for_America">Media Matters for America</a>'s opinion on this commentator, and an even greater amount of descriptions on the controversies page. While this is generally considered "counterweight" to the opinions that this commentator professes, I believe there is a line between counterweight and promotion. Between the two articles, the watchdog group is mentioned 20 times, and has over 24 links in the articles. I believe this is quite excessive for a group that isn't even associated with O'Reilly - these instances should be reduced down to a mention or two (we don't need to know their position on everything), and the rest moved to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_Matters_for_America_d902.html" title="Media Matters for America">their article</a> for reading. --<a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrmiscellanious_802d.html" title="User:Mrmiscellanious">Mrmiscellanious</a> 03:26, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So Mr.Misc, you're probably sitting there at your computer, examining the legitimacy of every single link sourced in the article, and deleteing or editing with zeal the negative statements made about O'Reilly when the websites alibi isn't airtight. Then the editors find a website that has rock solid sourcing information about Mr. O'Reilly and you decry it because these videos all comes from the same place. I have a proposal for you. Why don't you go out and find an identical video to those from Media Matters somewhere else on the web? Anywhere else, google, YouTube, whatever. You'll probably find a couple, or a few, but until you find them all and do what you signed up on wikipedia to do, we can all see your complaint for what it truly is. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpazik007_dc57.html" title="User:Spazik007">Spazik007</a> 02:24, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Polls</span></h2>
<p>For a variety of reasons it is not the position of an encyclopedia to create a storehouse of conservative, moderate, and liberal categories based upon an eclectic set of informal polls. First, the public's stance in relation to the separation of church and state, abortion, social security, welfare, and other issues change over time. As such, any attempt to maintain a set of encyclopedic entries based upon popular opinion is doomed to fail. Secondly, the might makes right aphorism should not enter into play when dissecting political opinions. A majority opinion must be opposed if there is to be any state other than an oligarchy; that is to say calling any 51% poll a moderate position is in error. Using such logic, any government official (having been majority elected) should be called a moderate.</p>
<p>No, the proper thing to do is to base positions of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">conservatism</a> on analysis and discussion using comparisons against their traditional definitions.

<p>I think there are two options here. One is remove contested issues from the conservative, liberal, and moderate bin and place them in a fourth bin of independent views. Second option is if anyone is bored and wants to argue about moderate and centrist using polling data. A nice website full of free polls is:</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think maybe we should discard the "liberal, conservative, centrist" views since editors will continue to shuffle them around. Maybe it would be a better idea to have "confirmed views" and "perceived views." Confirmed views would be those that no one disputes and contains proper citations, preferably primary sources that are direct and not taken out of context. "Perceived views" would be those that are not agreed upon or those that have been believed in error. The perceived views could be moved to confirmed views once there is no dispute.</dd>

<p>Someone categorized belief in global warming as a liberal position. Global warming is a scientific fact. There have not been any scientists since 2001 who express the opinion that evidence of global warming is inconclusive or who are skeptical that temperatures have risen.

<dd>Don't put words in my mouth. I'm not on the same premise as you here. Global increase in temperature is fact, but the causes and concerns are highly debateable, otherwise it obviously wouldn't be listed as a POLITICAL VIEW. The solution is to clarify that his viewpoint on "global warming" is consistent with liberal viewpoints on <b>causes and concerns</b>, rather than simply the observation of temperature increase.

<p>Only a very small minority of scientists discount the role that humanity's actions have played in recent warming. Almost all scientists have stated that the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities. <a href="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> <a href="http://www4.nationalacademies.org/onpi/webextra.nsf/web/climate?OpenDocument" class="external autonumber" title="http://www4.nationalacademies.org/onpi/webextra.nsf/web/climate?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> Perhaps you should read more about the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change.html" title="Scientific opinion on climate change">scientific opinion on climate change</a>.

<dd>First of all, Global warming is not a scientific fact. If you understood science you would understand that it is a method. THERE ARE SCIENTISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT HAPPENING. All you are doing it appealing to authority and claiming that if most scientists believe it, it must be true. Before a reply, I urge to research and look into the history of theoritical science and how many theories have come and gone. In all of those research articles, fact and certainty were words frequently used. Science is a very broad subject and and many scientists believe that earth is cooling down. In fact, I was just reading an article by a Dr. Peter Dorman. I quote, ".. Dr. Peter Dorman and his team of scientists have determined that since 1986, temperatures have been dropping an average of 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit per decade and similar downturns have occurred since 1978 in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of east Antarctica. When the scientists noticed that 'glacial ice wasn’t melting, streams weren’t flowing, lakes were shrinking and microorganisms were disappearing, they decided to expand their data collection and discovered that “Antarctica as a whole had gotten considerably colder." Science shouldn't claim anything as fact unless it can be empirically tested. If you can show that the earth AS A WHOLE, NOT SECTION MEASUREMENTS, is warming up and is doing so more and more, then it will verify at least that the theory holds much merit. Much more testing has to be done and for a much longer time. I am pretty sure that I was taught in Biology class that the early earth was much warmer than today. Anyway, I am not debating you or even disagreeing with you, I am just showing you that you could be wrong, and learn not jump the gun in science. All we can do right now is gather clues and try to make sense of the whole picture. We don't have the full story. --RyanDaniel 03:59, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am pretty much a scientist (will defend in a few months), know a bunch of scientists and I am very pro-business and I gotta say I know no one that would try to argue that mean global temperatures are decreasing. There is a very powerful argument that mean global temperatures are rising. THe data as you point out shows local variabilty such that antarctica is colder and much of the US is warmer than average. Points of debate are whether the greenhouse effect is the determinant of current and future global temperature trends . Science folks from poor countries seem to discount it too (their predisposition is not probusiness but more like the trouble ahead couldnt match the trouble I've seen). My position is that there is room for doubt regarding the human impact on global warming because historical fluctuations from causes other than the greenhouse effect have led to temperature variations that exceed currently observed variations, suggesting these variables exert greater control over the climate (<a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_variation_theory.html" title="Solar variation theory">solar variation theory</a>). <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 20:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>To Ryan Daniel, apart from the fact that my original post was on the topic of believing scientists does not constitute a liberal position, I would point you to this quote with regards to the <b>non-debate</b> "<i>There have not been any scientists since 2001 who express the opinion that evidence of global warming is inconclusive or who are skeptical that temperatures have risen.</i>" Read that again and tell me which part you disagree with, and be prepared to present some non original research from the scietific community disproving that statement. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 07:24, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your statement implies much more than what it actually says. "Heat island effect" is a well known man-made warming. Growing cities get hotter. Except it has nothing to do with CO2 or greenhouse gasses or fossil fuels. What is disupted is the correction factor applied to heat island warming to arrive at global warming. What is also disputed is the role CO2 and greehouse gasses have on overall warming as well as what effect increased moisture will have (will it warm or will it cool?). The models for warming have been useless (witness the Hurricane predictions for just this year). What is not debated is that Media, Politicians and established Environmental Thinktank/fundraising orgs have a vested interest in maintaining a <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Fear_532b.html" title="State of Fear">State of Fear</a>. We are in the middle of a lexicon switch because Global Warming is about to peter out (because glaciers are, on average, growing and ocean levels are not rising). The new lexicon is "Abrupt Climate Change". It will become the new "fear" word just as Global Warming replaced New Ice Age from the 1970's. What has not changed is the culprit (man) or the solution (wealth redistribution as is the case with Kyoto). --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 03:43, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The only reason I added this is because I had heard rumors from watching the Factor and whatnot that there was a harassment suit and I never really knew the details of it. As I normally do, I went to Wikipedia to get the facts. To my surprise it wasn't there. The "reference" cited is 26 some-odd pages long, and I had to plow through it to piece togther the facts. Also, the source uses a lot of legal jargon which makes it that much more difficult to decipher the facts. I analyzed it, broke it down, and summarized it in layman's terms to put here on the page, so others would not have the same problem (in terms of finding out what happened) as I did. If my analysis is wrong/biased/inaccurate, I would be more than welcome to criticism, but I think it needs to be there in fairness of keeping users of this site informed. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyd782_9283.html" title="User:Crazyd782">Crazyd782</a> 13:46, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I made some changes to the bullets conservative, moderate, and liberal bullet points. Please use this section to discuss changes to those bullet points.</p>
<p>I contend that supporting a George Bush blitz of stump speeches is <b>NOT</b> a liberal position. If the Republican President Bush decides to tackle immigration coming up with a half baked plan, to label that plan as liberal simply because it's nutty is wrong. If anything, support of that plan is to stand behind the Republican President in spite of what the public wants.</p>
<p>I contend that opposition to prostitution is still opposition to prostitution. Anyone can rationalize your opposition to a policy, but it doesn't change the fact that you are against it. It's with this in mind that I moved <b>opposition to prositution</b> out of the liberal column.</p>
<p>Opposing a flag burning amendment is not a liberal position. Republicans control both the houses and the Presidency and attempts to pass this legislation failed again. So it would seem that Republicans decided not to pass this ammendment, which by the way was pushed by a liberal Senator. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 07:13, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Everybody knows Bill O'Reilly is a conservative and I don't see any reason why anyone would consider him liberal. Sharing a few liberal point of view about economy doesn't make him a liberal.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Journalist?</span></h2>
<p>I would like to determine the consensus of Wikipedia's editors on whether or not this article should explicitly describe Bill O'Reilly as a <b>journalist</b> in its very first line (as it currently does). Please clearly state your vote, and a brief justification for it.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>No</b> -- The work Bill O'Reilly has done over the past decade both on his television program and in print (books, newspaper columns, etc) cannot be described as <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalism.html" title="Journalism">journalism</a> based on the definition of this term. A <a href="../../../p/u/n/Pundit_%28politics%29.html" title="Pundit (politics)">pundit</a> is not a journalist. The fact that O'Reilly started his career as a journalist should be mentioned <i>elsewhere</i> in the article, not in the very first line. --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 23:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Yes</b> -- His work is journalism just as Dan Rather's work is journalism. So is George Stephanopoulous. It's a different brand of journalsim than straight reporting but it is journalism nonetheless. He does newsworthy interviews and has a degree in broadcast journalism. He does magazine style reporting and this is well within the realm of being a journalist. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 14:02, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>Yes</b> -- His shows are a mixture of news, commentary and analysis. His reportage and commentary are more balanced and more highly researched than that of other uncontested journalists such as <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Goodman_d736.html" title="Amy Goodman">Amy Goodman</a> of <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_Now%21_2a47.html" title="Democracy Now!">Democracy Now!</a>. His program involves analysis (talking points), interviews of experts on topical issues (Top Story or factor follow-up usually addressign crime waves, science or social issues, facts of Sudan crisis, facts of bombings, etc.). FOllowing these there is usually some a pundit-style interviews (Impact Segment) and more variable or topical segments. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 01:15, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There is no reason to have a dubious tag or remove the journalist label. He does journalistic work and he has a degree in broadcast journalism. His program is a cable news program that has in depth coverage of current events. He is historically a journalist as well. There is no reason to remove it or tag it dubious as it is easily verfifiable that he is a journalist. Dan Rather is also a journalist yet he has no job in journalism. It is also in the first line of his bio. Journalism is a broad field. Andy Rooney has been doing commentary for many years and guess what? He is a hjournalist and it says so on the first line of his bio. Your personal feeling that O'Reilly is not doing journalism now does not mean that he shouldn't be described as a journalist. He considers himself a journalist among other things including commentator, author, etc. I removed the dubious tag after supplying the reference that he has a degree in broadcast journalism. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 23:05, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it this is about the title. This is whether he is a journalist at all. There is no doubt that he is a commentator. That may even be his main job. But he is also an author, radio talk show host, columnist and journalist. We don't need to rename the disambiguation title, but the reality is that he is more than just a commentator and that should be reflected (as it has been) on the first line.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 02:59, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The "dubious" tag stays until there is concensus. Please stop removing it. I have removed the term "journalist" before, only to have you revert that edit. So, in an attempt to be fair to your opinion, I'm no longer removing this term because at least SOME people (namely, you) oppose the term's removal. I have taken the next logical step in an attempt to re-concile this matter: I added the "dubious" tag to draw attention to the fact that this term is disputed (you cannot doubt that it is disputed, because I'm telling you right now that it is -- by me) and urging people to see the TALK page and participate in this very discussion, in an attempt to reach a concensus. Once the concensus is reached, I propose that one of these two actions be taken: 1) The removal of the "dubious" tag, or 2) the removal of the term "journalist" from the article's introductory sentence. You voted for choice 1, I voted for choice 2. I don't see a third choice here. You can't "win" this debate by deleting people's complaints to make it seem as if there is no disagreement among Wikipedia's editors. There is disagreement. Until more editors express their views and a clear majority concensus is reached, the "dubious" tag stays. --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 19:57, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

You cannot simply claim dubious because of your personal belief. It seems there is no evidence you will see that will change your mind which implies an improper use of dubious. Do you have a problem with the reference? Regardless, I also came up with a third choice. It simply changes "is" with "has been". It conveys all the same information yet it whould remove your complaint about the term journalist as he certainly has been one even using your logic that he isn't currently a "jounralist." I believe he certainly qualifies as a journalist as a descriptor of who he is and this is the normal way a bio references someone. Again, Andy Rooney is journalist. I haven't seen any "journalism" from Rooney in a long time. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 02:38, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All the sentinals of this page guarding the sacred holy name of Bill O'Reilly are more concerned with protecting his reputation than they are with building an online encyclopedia. Instead of deleteing every single negative sentence that isn't sourced ("The good ones are ok, but the bad ones, no, THOSE have to be sourced), why don't you get on the internet, do some research, and see if MAYBE you could find a source. If this was a page about, say, the pollinating habits of North American Tulips, I'm pretty sure you'd be going out and researching an unsourced questionable fact instead of simply deleting it. You people really need to take a step back and leave your bias at the door when you edit Wikipedia. I personally think Bill O'Reilly is an evil man, but I recognize that there are those that don't feel that way, and feel his page should fairly represent both of those views.

<p>That's what I'm trying to say to you. Wikipedia isn't (at least it shouldn't be) a competition. "Ha-ha that source violates section 32AB-1 and now I get to delete it sweet awesome!" Isn't going to build a better encyclopedia.

"Removing poor or unsourced negative material" is a priority per what Blue Tie and Ramsquire have already stated. This does not necessarily mean all positive things must remain. There are some people, who are subjects of an article, that want their article about them to be purely a promotional page for them with any example of criticism about them removed. This is also unencyclopedic and should not be accepted. Since you are new, I would recommend reading the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy and going from there.

<p>Well the thing is that you guys don't practice what you preach. "The O'Reilly Factor offers O'Reilly's point of view on national and international events through his self-described "no-nonsense" commentary and interviews." How about a source showing Bill O'reilly said that? "His views are frequent sources of controversy in various media outlets, including his own programs" Unsourced. "After graduating from Chaminade High School in 1967, O'Reilly attended Marist College, a small, co-educational private institution in Poughkeepsie, New York." Unsourced. "While attending Boston University, he was a reporter and columnist for various local newspapers and alternative news weeklies, including The Boston Phoenix. O'Reilly did his broadcast journalism internship in Miami during this time, and was also an entertainment writer and movie critic for The Miami Herald." Unsourced. "At WFAA-TV in Dallas, Texas, O'Reilly was awarded the Dallas Press Club Award for excellence in investigative reporting" Unsourced. Unsourced, unsourced, unsourced. You guys now have three options: 1) Go out and find dozens, maybe hundreds of sources for the Bill O'Reilly page. 2) Shorten the Bill O'Reilly page to perhaps 10% it's current length. 3) Admit your bias and concede to my reasonable arguement. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpazik007_dc57.html" title="User:Spazik007">Spazik007</a> 23:41, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that you're finally starting to grasp the concept I'm soliciting. Like I said earlier, I'm a human being with biases and I don't like Bill O'Reilly. But it's also within my intellectual capacity to understand what Wikipedia is and that there are people who don't share the same view as me. The point I was trying to make is that I could go through the article and delete pretty much anything I wanted per the "Wikipedia Rules", yet I don't. People only seem to invoke those rules when it's convienent to them. "ZOMG they're talking shit about Bill O'Reilly *finds bullshit reason to delete*" isn't going to build a better encyclopedia. You can sit here and cite these hoytie-toytie lists of rules to me but you aren't getting down to the nitty-gritty that I'm trying to convey to you. You hide behind these Wikipedia policys to further your own agenda, and quite frankly I feel that that is even more disingenuous then using Weasel Words or NPOV. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpazik007_dc57.html" title="User:Spazik007">Spazik007</a> 19:19, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, when editors are simply following the rules, and you come in and accuse them of bias and/or lying they have every right to respond by telling you the rules they are following and try to explain said rule to you. If you don't like the rules here, you are free to request a policy change. But to throw around words like "disingenious" and "bias" when no one is doing anything of the sort, is a violation of <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a>. Sorry to give you another guideline, but this is Wikipedia and these are the rules here that everyone must follow. And what you're suggesting in your post is a form of wikilawyering and that is also frowned upon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've been through the article and all the stuff that needs tagging is tagged. Once more, people are not invoking a rule that is convenient for them or showing a bias when they delete negative edits. Unsourced negative info must go immediately. That is not the same as someone not citing that he went to Marist. I'm sorry if this is a problem for you but perhaps you should take it up with Jimbo Wales. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 19:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So unsourced negative material needs an airtight alibi but if it's positive you're allowed to write whatever the hell you want?

<dd>Can you come up with any examples where fans of O'Reilly are exploiting the BLP policy? If you can, maybe you have a point. Right now you just sound bitter about a supposed hypocrisy that you can not give any good examples for. Unsourced negative edits are going to deleted for everyone that's living, not just O'Reilly. Al Franken and Michael Moore deserve the same treatment too. The examples of unsourced material that you brought up were just dry facts. Sure they need a source, but are they controversial? If someone were to put in "O'Reilly is the only one who knows how to solve world hunger" that would be deleted pretty fast. The issue with negative comments are mainly for legal reasons. Any editor could be liable for putting in something negative in to an article about a person so it is really for your protection that you make sure you back these things up. Maybe you should propose a <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_Review_9c12.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer Review">peer review</a> for this article and get other's input. That might not be a bad idea in the long run anyway. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 19:55, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My problem was with the way the page is being edited. I have a term I use. On Wikipedia people often refer to "Weasel words". Well what's going on on this page and many others is "Weasel editting". I've never contended that you can't site Wikipedia rules to justify your edditings. Of course you can. Many already have in this section. But you are still editting with bias. Do you investigate the unfounded positive claims of Bill O'Reilly and delete the ones with broken links or quasi-sourced material? I highly doubt it. If you were truly commited to bulding an online encyclopedia instead of defending your own point of view you wouldn't edit with such bias, or at the least agree to work with the people of another viewpoint instead of against them. You can cite all the Wikipedia rules you want, but you aren't invoking those rules because you truly want to make Wikipedia better, you're abusing them to defend your own point of view. I understand I may have come on a little strong in my debate we're having now. But think about it. Is what I'm saying really that unreasonable? <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpazik007_dc57.html" title="User:Spazik007">Spazik007</a> 22:56, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here are some key points taken verbatim from the body of the policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biographies of living people should be written responsibly, conservatively, and in a neutral, encyclopedic tone.</li>
<li>The writing style should be neutral, factual, and understated, avoiding both a sympathetic point of view and an advocacy journalism point of view.</li>
<li>Information available solely on partisan websites or in obscure newspapers should be handled with caution, and, if derogatory, should not be used at all.</li>
<li><i>(For non-public figures such as family members):</i> Editors should exercise restraint and include only information relevant to their notability. ...Material from primary sources should generally not be used unless it has first been mentioned by a verifiable secondary source.</li>
<li>In borderline cases, the rule of thumb should be "do no harm." Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a tabloid. It is not our job to be sensationalist, ...</li>
<li>If someone appears to be pushing an agenda or a biased point of view, insist on reliable third-party published sources and a clear demonstration of relevance to the person's notability.</li>
<li>The views of critics should be represented if their views are relevant to the subject's notability and are based on reliable sources, and so long as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article or appear to side with the critics' material.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not familiar with Crooks and Liars but I think it is pretty clear from the above policy, that MMFA has serious problems as a reliable source in this article. I've deleted all of their reference points and have asked for third party citations. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 18:41, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a very real problem with your claims about MMFA. Yes, they are partisan, in that they monitor the media for what they consider to be conservative misinformation. But from what I've seen they always back up their claims with transcripts and/or audio/video recordings. All of the MMFA references you deleted contained actual recordings taken from O'Reilly's radio program. I understand and agree with wikipedia's policy regarding "information available solely on partisan websites or in obscure newspapers" but in the case of MMFA, whenever they provide evidence of their claims, the information should remain in the article. Unless you are seriously claiming that MMFA hired an O'Reilly imitator and completely faked all of these comments, I believe all of your edits should be reverted.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 19:42, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What he said. Also, the reason this article takes notes of particular comments by BOR is because they have produced criticism or some kind of outcry. The link to MMfA substantiates the fact that there was criticism and that what is included in the article is not some random list of arbitrarily chosen comments. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 19:45, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Instead of arguing wholesale, I'll itemize my complaints. In most of the MMFA links, I kept the information in the article and asked for a another (hopefully more neutral) source. I would think an actual transcipt of his remarks from FOXNews or his radio program would be sufficient. I know Wiki discourages primary sources but if we're just quoting from the transcripts then there should not be the concern about original research, which is the main basis for the rule.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The other part of my edits were that I deleted information not because it came from MMFA but because the editor attempted to summarize the real quotes based on MMFA's and Crooks and Liars characterization of the quotes. I'm not sure we can do that with a quote. I'f I'm wrong, I apologize.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, specifically to Gamaliel, the purpose of the quotes was not clear to me based on the current format of the article. After the biographical stuff, to me, there is just a list of stuff he said, so it isn't really clear why MMFA is being used. It seems like it's just to point out that BO has said some far out things. Maybe if we moved the MMFA stuff to the controversy section, it would be more clear. Just a thought.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To sum up, I have no problem with MMFA, I check it out everyday, and I know they do provide evidence in the form of transcripts. When I said "third party citations" that was one of the things I had in mind. My concern is that secondary publishers of libelous info, can be just as liable as the original publisher. I'm not saying that MMFA or we have committed libel in any of the stuff in the article. I'm pretty certain we haven't. However, if we get too comfortable adding stuff from partisan sites, without doing the appropriate background research, Wiki can get into trouble as well as the editor.</dd>

<dd>MMFA is a tertiary source. If they source everything so well, it should be easy to use their secondary sources so that WP can form it's own text.

Is Newshounds considered a reliable source for this?</p>
<p><i>Believes the people of Iraq are a pre-historic group and says he has no respect for them.</i> This may belong in the controversies section because a) it is two things taken out of a long diatribe, that although controversial is summarized to be more sensational than it is in context of the entire speech and b) it is not clear if it is a personal view or is simply BO blowing hot air for attention.</p>
<p><i>Has claimed that "many of the poor in New Orleans" did not evacuate the city before Hurricane Katrina because "they were drug-addicted" and "weren't going to get turned off from their source." O'Reilly added, "They were thugs."</i> Same argument as the one above.</p>
<p>Finally does anyone know if Westwood One publishes transcripts of their radio programs?</p>
<hr />
<p>&gt; O'Reilly's remarks about the people of Iraq and the Katrina victims are exactly as described by the source. I watched the show the same days and you could easily find videos of them on YouTube. They are simplified exactly as the other remarks on personal views, only difference being that they present a very negative side of O'Reilly. If one of his admirers keep trying to hide the informations from the general public, I will keep putting them back on their place unless someone comes with a better argument than the quotes being "taken out of context"&lt;-----George Pedrosa</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do not particularly consider the comments negative or positive. However, the import of what he was saying is different than the quotes portray. They need a full context and such a lengthy quote is simply inappropriate for an encyclopedic article. Quotes in general are not such a great idea for an encyclopedia but are better at wikiquote. You should also be aware that just because something may be true, that is not the same thing as saying it should be included. Simply listing every odd thing he said or did would not be correct according wikipedia rules.--<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 01:44, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I said, the quotes are not out of context, they present exactly what Bill O'Reilly was trying to say. Every single personal view on the article is also simplified. If you don't like quotes, change the article to exclude them, but don't remove the information.--George Pedrosa</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And as I said, the quotes are out of context. For example, when he said he did not have respect for the Iraqi people, he explained why. That explanation, being left off, changes the meaning and intent. When it comes to the people in Katrina, that was one, relatively minor comment in an overall statement regarding problems that dysfunctional people cause in society. Removing that statement from the overall statement substantially changes its tone and intent. It's almost the same thing as if I quote the Bible as: "Judas went out and straightway hanged himself" and "Jesus said, go thou and do likewise". Sure I am quoting the bible. Word for word. But I am getting the meaning messed up. The same is true for these snippets of rants that he was on. If you miss the context the sense of the quote is gone. It is simply wrong to do that. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 02:49, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The <b><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_c07d.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (commentator)">Bill O'Reilly (commentator)</a></b> page is used by hundreds and edited by dozens daily.

As there are only 2 bill oreillys, I question whether the disambiguation page is necessary at all and I am going to change the subtitle to link to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28cricketer%29_8189.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)">Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)</a> if there is confusion.

<p>I've noticed the article contradicts itself in regard to O'Reilly's views of President Clinton.

The cite to the criticism is mainly about O'Reilly's views regarding John Ashcroft.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">far right?</span></h2>
<p>I have removed Ann Coulter and the Ayn Rand Institute from O'Reilly's list of "far right" people/groups as the current grouping is quite misleading. The way it was structured, it looks like O'Reilly grouped Ann Coulter and the Ayn Rand Institute with David Duke and Neo-Nazis, whereas he actually used the term "far right" in different contexts. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 06:32, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Both the "far right" and "far left" lists just chronicle each time he used those labels. Using your logic, the "far left" list should be truncated also. I would say to take out the nazi's and put back Rand and Coulter since they have both been cited as O'Reilly proclaiming them "far right." It might be good to go over the lists and keep what is really notable and weed out the ones that aren't so notable or ones that may be put out of context. With the length of that far left list, it looks like something like that would be quite an undertaking. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 18:47, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Opinions on Others Politics</span></h2>
<p>It looks like the spinoff article is going to be deleted. I'll put the entire section here for now for comments on what to do. Should we keep it, review it first, truncate it, or just get rid of it all together. Editors outside of this interest mostly do not believe it is encyclpedic based on the afd discussion. Here is the section in question:</p>
<p>O'Reilly is generally critical of the "<a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">far left</a>" and "<a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing_politics.html" title="Right-wing politics">far right</a>" in American politics. However, much of his focus is on far left individuals and organizations. When asked why he rarely addresses the far right, he believes the far right have much less influence in the mainstream American media as opposed to the far left.</p>
<p>Whom he considers far right:</p>

<dd>This list is too inclusive for the article and not particularly useful. Take some time to go through the references and comment on each individually. I did that with the article a while back (before this list was added) and it works better than just listing links. It is also POV because the reference may actually say something different or specific about his thoughts on the individual or organization. Although I applaud you for your effort in colaborating this list, it is lazy just to lump it into the article. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 01:31, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to set the record straight I did not write this. I don't know who did although I believe it was probably a collaboration among editors. I once reworded it and put the content into a spin-off article (which was promptly afd'd) so I put it here for now. I was just asking what to do about it. I'm not editing much for the moment so I don't really have time to go through all that but if anyone else wants to deal with it go right ahead. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 02:59, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not really vandalism. It's true, but it does need a citation. Just as an example, he argued that the economy of France had been affected by a personal boycott of his and when challenged, he cited the "Paris Business Review" confidently and unequivocally. It was later found out that there is no "Paris Business Review".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>David Letterman has accused O'Reilly twice of fabricating information in his last two visits to the show. In particular, it was found that the examples he cited regarding "the war on Christmas" were also made up. He also accused U.S. American troops of torturing and executing POWs in Malmedy in support of his argument, when the opposite was actually true.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Media Matters has transcripts of these incidents and Bill O'Reilly's "The O'Reilly Factor" does, too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, if you do a search on Google for "Bill O'Reilly fabrications" you get 300,000 results, most accusing Bill O'Reilly of fabrications. When you do the same search for another journalist say, Wolf Blitzer, you get only 2,000 results, and the fabrications are attributed to people <i>other</i> than Wolf Blitzer (namely guests).</dd>

<dd>He also claimed multiple times to have received a Peabody award for his show Inside Edition, which at the time had never won a Peabody award.</dd>

<p>I'm sure your intentions are noble but your arguments are filled with assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) It is at best a leap of faith go from acknowledging that the "Paris Business Review" doesn't exist to stating "and O'Reilly fabricated the idea of its existence." Perhaps he did and perhaps he was just misinformed. Until there is uncontrovertible proof, any charges leveled at him of "fabrication" are POV and probably inappropriate for the article.</li>
<li>2) Well if David Letterman accuses O'Reilly (twice!), that's good enough for me. NOT! Re the Malmedy controversy, again, there needs to be proof before labeling what could have been an honest mistake as outright fabrication.</li>
<li>3) Unfortunately, I don't think the sheer number of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> results is good indicator of their validity.</li>
<li>4) I'm starting to see a pattern here. If I recall, one time O'Reilly told me it would rain over the weekend and it <u>didn't</u>. <b>LIAR!</b></li>
</ul>
<p>You should really read up on <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_Sources_f4fe.html" title="WP:Reliable Sources">WP:Reliable Sources</a>, etc. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b-blp_dd60.html" title="User:Lawyer2b-blp">Lawyer2b-blp</a> 04:43, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you should sue Bill O'Reilly for falsely telling you it would rain over the weekend, you have my deep sympathy for your loss. As for (1) he either made it up or was misinformed. There aren't many other options. (2) David Letterman is one of several people who have accused him of this, and it happens regularly on his show, where he is regularly called a spin doctor. (3) No, the number isn't the only factor, he's a statistical outlier when it comes to internet statements about his fabrications, and the number of sources attributed to his fabrications within those results.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally keep in mind the number of times he repeats such statements before he corrects himself. How do you honestly believe that you've won a Peabody award if you didn't, tell everyone about it incessantly, then deny that you ever claimed it, and then tell people you misspoke each time?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Seems like an outright lie to me. So don't take Letterman as an isolated incident.

<dd>The uniform "requirement" is found in several places of the 1977 revisions, particularly Protocol I. However it is irrelevant whether it is found there or not. The article says it is Bill O'Reilly's reason. Since the article is about Bill O'Reilly rather than about the Geneva Conventions, it is Bill O'Reilly's interpretation (which is pretty much the common interpretation) that is important. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 16:19, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please don't suggest that Bill O'Reilly's interpretation is "the common one". If the uniform requirement is a matter of interpretation, we need to make that clear. If it isn't, we should clarify that. So which is it? -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 16:32, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why shouldn't I say that if it is true? It is the common interpretation. The Geneva Conventions specifically mention uniforms. However, recognizing that some more impoverished combatants may not have "regular" uniforms, the Conventions also allow for insignias and other such items "recognized at a distance" as being functionally equivalent. However, the most common phrasing when describing this requirement is to use the term "uniforms". Why is this a problem? --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 17:06, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To get a clearer picture, I have re-read the source. The reference cited has three significant quotes from O'Reilly:</p>
<ul>
<li>"According to the Geneva Convention, to be a POW and to get protections under it, you've gotta wear a uniform, Judge. They don't wear uniforms."</li>
<li>"I don't think that was torture. Torture is takin' off a limb. Torture is takin' somebody's eye, somethin' like that."</li>
<li>"Military tribunals, yes. Geneva Convention, no."</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these statements, do we need to determine that the convention explicitely states "you've gotta wear a uniform"? Or can we rephrase it so that it talks about his interpretation that uniforms are required? I will play with the wording and let me know what you think. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 21:48, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
