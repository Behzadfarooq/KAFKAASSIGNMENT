<p>Shouldn't an encyclopedia article about "Big Bill" Haywood tell the reader how big Haywood was? How tall was Haywood and roughly how much did he weigh? Can a Wikipedian add this information?</p>

<dd>The article is looking good. Bruce Watson's <i>Bread and Roses</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-670-03397-9</a>) is all about the Lawrence strike and has a lot of information about Haywood (including his early life), though I haven't finished reading it yet. My main problem with the article as it stands is the "Labor philosophies" section, which seems a rump. If it's going to be in the article, it should at least mention <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_unionism.html" title="Industrial unionism">industrial unionism</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndicalism.html" title="Syndicalism">syndicalism</a> and <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Big_Union_4d51.html" title="One Big Union">One Big Unionism</a>, though some of that details may fit more comfortably in other articles. I'll see if I can add to it before too long. -<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schaich_eeca.html" title="User:David Schaich">David Schaich</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Schaich_3ea0.html" title="User talk:David Schaich">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Schaich_5354.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Schaich">Cont</a></sub></small> 20:02, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have added an industrial unionism section to the (slightly renamed) "Haywood's labor philosophy" section. Because this touches upon socialism, and upon the IWW, the article now has a couple of repetitive themes. I think it isn't too bad, perhaps even necessary to cover all the given territory, but some feedback on this question would be helpful. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Myers_1e40.html" title="User:Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a> 01:12, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It looks good for the most part (all nicely sourced). I tried to clean up a few links (you don't need to worry about capitalizing the first letter -- that's taken care of automatically, so [[Craft unionism|craft unionism]] can just be [[craft unionism]]), but kept getting edit conflicts. (You can use the "<a href="../../../p/r/e/WP%7EPREVIEW_c158.html" title="WP:PREVIEW">show preview</a>" button to get more done without having to save so often.) My main concern is that the tone of some of your additions may not be what one would expect from an encyclopedia ("General Bell, it just happened, was..." jumped out at me), but that can be corrected in time. -<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schaich_eeca.html" title="User:David Schaich">David Schaich</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Schaich_3ea0.html" title="User talk:David Schaich">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Schaich_5354.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Schaich">Cont</a></sub></small> 06:56, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The intro mentions,</p>
<dl>
<dd>"the Colorado Labor Wars (which culminated in the Ludlow massacre)..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is flat wrong. [NOW FIXED] The Ludlow Massacre involved the UMWA, which was not Haywood's union. Haywood was not in any way involved. (In fact, he had a long-running ideological dispute with the leaders of the UMWA, for they undercut the WFM on occasion, and were much less militant. In fact, after buying rifles for the Ludlow era strikers, as a response to Baldwin Felts agents machine gunning the Forbes colony-- even during the most intense days of fighting after the Ludlow colony was burned, the UMWA held the miners in check to the extent that they were able.)</p>
<p>The "wars" between Colorado miners and the Colorado authorities also did not "culminate" with the Ludlow Massacre; they "culminated" with the Columbine Massacre in 1927. Yet the expression "Colorado Labor Wars" as a specific term refers most often to the bloody struggles of the WFM from approximately 1903 to 1905.</p>
<p>I will remove the Ludlow reference. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Myers_1e40.html" title="User:Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a> 01:29, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Under section "Western Federation of Miners involvement" we find:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The WFM initiated a series of strikes to combat the brutal working conditions and starvation wages."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is actually not true [AND STILL NEEDS ATTENTION]. The Cripple Creek miners certainly faced dangerous conditions, but they were far from starving. They had the most powerful union organization in the country at that time, and their wages were quite respectable. The strikes were actually called for the purpose of extending WFM membership to the mill workers who processed the ore. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Myers_1e40.html" title="User:Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a> 01:40, 31 January 2007 (UTC) [REMOVED "starvation wages" FROM ARTICLE, HOWEVER, THIS IS WITHIN SOMEONE'S REFERENCE, SO I HAVE NOT ADDED EXTENDING WFM MEMBERSHIP TO MILL WORKERS] <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Myers_1e40.html" title="User:Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a> 19:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I considered adding a citation for this text:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Foundation of the Industrial Workers of the World</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Late in 1904, Haywood along with over 30 other prominent labor radicals, met in Chicago to lay down plans for a new revolutionary union.</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, my quick research suggests that this information is wrong. In "The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years", by Fred Thompson, i find that there were six men at the November 1904 conference, all named on page 6 of that book, and none of them were Haywood. Big Bill did, however, attend the January 1905 meeting, along with 22 others.</p>
<p>I check Haywood's autobiography, and it does not mention a 1904 conference (other than that for the WFM,) and does mention the January conference, but states that about 30 were invited to that. So i'll plan to change these details later. But if anyone in the meantime has a source for a gathering of 30 in 1904, with Haywood in attendance, please let us hear about it so we will know to get additional confirmation. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Myers_1e40.html" title="User:Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a> 04:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Thank you to everyone who has helped improve this article; I've been imploring the Organized Labour project to help out, but it was a one-man show for a long time. I eventually just ran out of steam (I'm not a professional writer, as you can probably tell).

<p>I like this article a lot, but I'd like to see more in-line citations, particularly in the opening paragraphs. "Never one to shy from conflict ..." ought to be cited or it could be seen as original research, for instance. Someone in one of the bios must have expressed that opinion so you can cite a page number. For a featured article, there really should be an inline citation after pretty much every sentence. If some of that can be fixed, I'll gladly pass this as a GA.--<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookworm857158367_aed8.html" title="User:Bookworm857158367">Bookworm857158367</a> 15:50, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I note that Boyce is introduced twice, with somewhat similar text. Does this seem redundant, or is it OK considering that some readers will jump in to the article at different points?</p>
<p>Also, the section <b>Socialist Party of America involvement</b> needs some attention.</p>
<p>This is part of the original text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, the aggressive tactics of Haywood and the IWW, along with their call for <b>the overthrow of capitalism and existing governmental institutions</b> created tension with more moderate members of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics.[7] In a party opposed to violence and dedicated to respectability, Haywood baldly advised socialists and workers to practice sabotage and risk imprisonment to foster revolution. This conflict eventually led to Haywood's recall from the National Executive Committee in January of 1913;[8] thousands of IWW members left the Socialist Party with him.[7]</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have made a slight change, and anticipate another:</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, the aggressive tactics of Haywood and the IWW, along with their call for <b>abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism</b> created tension with more moderate members of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_action.html" title="Direct action">direct action</a> and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics.&lt;reference Siitonen&gt; In a party opposed to violence and dedicated to respectability, Haywood baldly advised socialists and workers to practice sabotage and risk imprisonment to foster revolution. This conflict eventually led to Haywood's recall from the National Executive Committee in January of 1913;&lt;reference Zinn 341&gt; thousands of IWW members left the Socialist Party with him.&lt;reference siitonen&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<p>In spite of the common assumption, the IWW actually did not call for the overthrow of the government. In fact, the IWW has been criticized by Marxists and others because it has ignored government in its official statements, preamble, and constitution. This is a curious circumstance, considering that overthrowing the government would seem a necessary precondition for overthrowing capital. But that's the way it is, the idea of changing the government is implied by other announced goals but never officially stated as a goal.</p>
<p>The socialists who were part of the IWW for the first three years had believed that they could capture the government at the ballot box. When the workers in the IWW, disgusted with the machinations of the socialist politicians (particularly <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_De_Le%C3%B3n_d1e4.html" title="Daniel De LeÃ³n">Daniel De LeÃ³n</a>) during that three years, eschewed political action in the preamble and constitution at their convention in 1908, thus effectively expelling the socialists, they were determined to focus on industrial struggle rather than political struggle.</p>
<p>However, the IWW did specifically advocate abolition of the wage system in the preamble, and they were always anti-capitalist.</p>
<p>Now, all of this is complicated a bit by the fact that in his private and public pronouncements, Haywood sometimes went beyond what the IWW's official position was. He was persuaded that the Bolshevik revolution was "the IWW all feathered out!" But that was several years after he had left the socialists. So i opted to change the statement about government, rather than remove IWW from the statement and let it stand as Haywood's own view. I haven't read Siitonen, so i cannot absolutely verify the change matches the source, but i do know that the change i've made is historically accurate.</p>
<p>The other change that i'd like to make involves the sentence,</p>
<dl>
<dd>Haywood baldly advised socialists and workers to practice sabotage and risk imprisonment to foster revolution.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think that is worded very accurately, nor well. But i need to think about how to fix it, and also check the given reference (if i am able.) <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Myers_1e40.html" title="User:Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a> 22:03, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've incorporated that quote, smoothing the chronological transition with some slight re-arranging. It is a good quote, interesting, and i like the addition. I have, however, shifted the emphasis slightly back toward direct action, for that was what animated him the most ever since the failure of the 1903 strike. Haywood openly criticized DeLeon's philosophy of socialism in his autobiography. Of course that was the SLP, and Haywood always felt closer to Debs. On the other hand, he mentioned a couple of times in his autobiography that Debs didn't seem to "get it" ("it" being the concept of revolutionary industrial unionism), either.</dd>

<dd>An interesting side note to Haywood's participation with the Socialist Party-- from the period 1908-1910, the IWW constitutionally prohibited any support for any political party by the IWW. Of course, this didn't rule out private participation on the part of members that was not in the name of the union. But, officials of political parties were also banned from IWW membership. (Not sure what year that became part of the IWW constitution.) <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Myers_1e40.html" title="User:Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a> 00:25, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm trying to clean up some of the references/inline citations (because I know that's something they'll point out in the peer review), and I was hoping I could get some more complete information for a couple of the sources. I would appreciate it if whoever used the references listed below could fill in more of the information (publisher, ISBN, etc). Or even just tell me the ISBN of the book; if I have that, I can fill in the rest myself (I don't mind).</p>

<p>Bill Haywood on detectives:</p>
<dl>
<dd>A detective is the lowest, meanest and most contemptible thing that either creeps or crawls, a thing to loathe and despise. ... That you may know how small a detective is, you can take a hair and punch the pith out of it and in the hollow hair you can put the hearts and souls of 40,000 detectives and they will still rattle. You can pour them out on the surface of your thumbnail and the skin of a gnat will make an umbrella for them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When a detective dies, he goes so low that he has to climb a ladder to get into Hellâ and he is not a welcome guest there. When his Satanic Majesty sees him coming, he says to his imps, "Go get a big bucket of pitch and a lot of sulphur, give them to that fellow and put him outside. Let him start a Hell of his own. We don't want him in here, starting trouble." &lt;Carlson, 146-7.&gt; <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Myers_1e40.html" title="User:Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a> 19:16, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I admit that i'm not fond of the title "Racial unity," because it doesn't describe how Haywood viewed racial unity, or why. I haven't come up with a good replacement, but something like "Haywood's belief in the unity of the working class," or "Haywood's belief in the racial unity of all workers" seem to me to capture the essence of the text better.

<dd>I agree; when I added the section, I mainly just wanted to get something in there. Haywood's view on racial unity was enlightened at the time (and sadly, still more enlightened than many people today), and I had some good quotes, so I wanted to make sure it was noted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I like where you're trying to go with those section titles, but I think the suggestions are too long. The next level up, "Haywood's labor philosophy" takes care of the first part of your suggestions, so how about something like <b>Racial unity in the working class</b> or <b>Racial unity in the labor movement</b>? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryOrr_9af6.html" title="User:JerryOrr">JerryOrr</a> 00:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've requested a specific resource citation for the Boyce statement, here: <a href="../../../t/i/m/User_talk%7ETim1965_16fd.html#Ed_Boyce_resource" title="User talk:Tim1965">User_talk:Tim1965#Ed_Boyce_resource</a></p>
<p>The original statement is in the Ed Boyce article:</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Boyce_d0f7.html#Public_service" title="Ed Boyce">Ed_Boyce#Public_service</a></p>
<p>I know that Jameson covered this territory â that the WFM (at least in the Cripple Creek area) had a heritage of Asian exclusion â but she doesn't tie it directly to Boyce in her book about Cripple Creek, <i>All That Glitters</i>.</p>
<p>Jerry, i like both of your suggestions about the <i>Racial unity</i> section title. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Myers_1e40.html" title="User:Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a> 00:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hopefully we'll get a source regarding Boyce; I think you are correct in not using <i>All That Glitters</i> as a source for Boyce's thoughts on racial unity. By the way you describe it, I think it would constitute <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTR_8ce7.html" title="WP:ATTR">original research</a> to state that Boyce was adverse to racial unity due to the WFM's exclusion of Asian workers. If we can't get a source for Boyce, we'll just have to make the statement more general. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryOrr_9af6.html" title="User:JerryOrr">JerryOrr</a> 02:01, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Interesting to see Haywood's history promoted this way:</p>

<dd>That is interesting; good link. I'll have to read it when I have the time. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJerryOrr_9af6.html" title="User:JerryOrr">JerryOrr</a> 02:02, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
