<p>12/22 - The edit war between <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> and Poker players who want the truth to come out continues. He continues to delete all mention of Bill Frist's leadership in banning Online Poker to United States citizens. After he deletes the information he claims that it wasn't properly sourced. To him CNN, Newsweek, and Time are more reliable sources that the Cato Institute (think tank). Jasper23, wasn't it CNN and Time that told us that Saddam had WMD's? The bottom line is your censorship will not stand. Within 24 hours of you trying to whitewash the truth it will return. One question tho', do you work for Bill Frist or the Republican Party? If not, why do you enjoy covering up the truth?</p>
<p>What is wrong with you? Just source it! Cardsquad.com is not a legitimate source and the sourcing does not match the text. This is a widely known and well reported on controversy. Seriously, that is all you have to do. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 20:23, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>12/04 - Who at Wikipedia keeps removing the truth about Bill Frist's support of the anti-gambling bill? The sourcing is there, yet the facts are removed on a daily basis. It doesn't matter how hard you try to supress the truth, someone will continue to repost what really happened (on a daily basis if needed).</p>
<p>All you need to do is source it. It's been months since this occurred and it still isn't sourced! Why would I want to suppress the truth? I am no fan of Frist. However, this needs to have proper sourcing or it will not stay in the article. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 02:48, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bill Frist's 09/30/2006 underhanded attachment of his pet anti-gambling bill to a must pass Homeland Security bill MUST be included as part of his biography. This is a spit in the face of some 20 million voters that can't be glossed over by some Republican party blogger.</p>

<p>Not much of a war as of yet. I agree now that "fraudelently" is not the right term to describe the cat incident, though Ollie's new compromise needs a grammar rewrite. I don't see any reason why the information on his sons' DUIs should be removed, and I've yet to check on the tsunami-trip thing, to be honest. If there's an honest-to-goodness controversy there, so be it, but as of now I don't see how he's different from the thousands of other visitors to the disaster areas who took photos. As for the book thing, what's the problem with including it? I remember his Clarke criticisms quite well, and if he's done the same thing he maligned another person for, it should be included. Anything I missed? <a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhanartist_5a5c.html" title="User:Khanartist">Khanartist</a> 10:15, 2005 Jan 16 (UTC)</p>
<p>This again? I remember OlliePlatt being angry because the article on Russ Feingold mentioned that people want him to run for President in 2008. Apparently that was POV because "anyone" can run for President. I hope this isn't going to happen any time anything positive is written about a Dem senator or anything negative is written about a GOP senator. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 17:57, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the sentence about his sons' drunk driving convictions as these have little relevance to Frist himself.

<p>What about the following paragraph?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Senator Frist has refused to answer reporters' questions about the drunk-driving arrests of Harrison (21 years old at the time of his arrest, May 2004) and Jonathan (17 years old at the time of his arrest, May 2003). Through a spokesman, Frist called the charges against his sons a "personal matter." <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/local/archives/04/05/51600159.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tennessean.com/local/archives/04/05/51600159.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.wbir.com/printfullstory.aspx?storyid=18056" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wbir.com/printfullstory.aspx?storyid=18056" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>

<dd>I think it should go. It belongs in an encyclopedia article about the children, but not in Frist. A perfectly parallel example: <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>'s son <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_III_0e63.html" title="Al Gore III">Al Gore III</a>'s marijuana and DUI arrests are nowhere to be found in the father's entry, and nor should they be. Until Frist proposes arresting parents for their children's crimes, the fact that he refuses to answer questions about his family is just good judgment, and has nothing to do with his political or medical career.

<p>I concur that the issue of Frist's children being charged with drunk driving is a cheap shot. He has no control over his adult children. He is not responsible for their decisions. If there were a showing that he supplied them with the alcohol prior to their driving, there might be some case.</p>

<p>A 17 year old is not an adult. In my view, parents are responsible for teaching their children moral standards (like not putting innocent people's lives at risk by drink driving). This duty is especially strong if the parent wants to be a moral policeman for the rest of their country. I believe that these details are not a cheap shot, but part of a pattern of hypocricy, and should remain in the article.</p>

<p>With regard to the parenthetical reference to the Schiavo autopsy, I edited the article to reflect the fact that although Ms. Schiavo's brain's condition was consistent with a diagnosis of PVS, it did not actually prove that she was in a PVS. SS451 17:41, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll do some digging to this effect regarding the statutes, but as a health care practitioner I can state as a fact that it is unethical (and in several cases, illegal) nationally to put forth a diagnosis without first performing a thorough history and examination. In cases such as this independent imaging studies would also be required along with other specialized tests before a PVS diagnosis can either be made or disputed. In this case I feel the issue at hand is that Frist made his comments without the benefit of ever seeing Schiavo face-to-face, let alone performing the above requirements to make or refute a diagnosis. Either way, he knew better than to make such comments based on such fleeting information, any health care practitioner worth his or her salt would understand the nature of reflexology and know that the few minutes of videotape seen by both Frist and the public are wholly insufficient to refute the diagnosis of an examiner. -CAB</p>

<p>Some of my edits concerning Dr. Frist's experimentation on cats were agressively edited out. I have reinserted a portion of the edit regarding the Animal Welfare Act, although I have deleted the portion which is under dispute, and have modified the language somewhat to molify the editor who originally deleted the passage. I will need to look into that editors claim that the Massachusetts Animal Cruelty statute was not in effect in 1970. I have my doubts about that claim given the statute's extensive references to overworking farm animals. I don't believe that all of the sudden became a great cause of concern in the years since Frist was the Dr. Mengele of animal experimentation. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhitfield_Larrabee_846d.html" title="User:Whitfield Larrabee">Whitfield Larrabee</a> 04:18, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The animal-cruelty laws were amended well after 1970 as part of the animal rights movement to permit pounds to restrict donations. When Frist went to medical school, many states permitted educational institutions to demand that pounds surrender animals. Indeed this is still true in some states today. Harvard supplied Frist with many of his cats, and he went to the pound after he ran out of cats. The same is going to be true of any 20th century surgeon (and the early-20th-century surgeons were experimenting on grave-robbed corpses), and I don't understand why a legal discussion about laws that were amended well after his education are to be such a huge chunk of Frist's biography. I fail to see why animal experimentation is more problematic because Frist directly acquired the animals himself after HMS ran out, and a political biography is not the place to be making arguments about the morality of animal experiments. Are you going to demand that every scientist biography have a paragraph about their use of animals? Every cook? FRCP11 20:27, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My grandfather was a surgeon. He did not experiment on animals obtained under false pretenses from the humane society. These claims that you about the circumstances of Frist's actions and the prevailing practices in 20th century medicine are are unsubstantiated. If your unsubstantiated claims about the context of Frist's actions were to be substantiated, they might lend context to the article and could be appropriately included.

<p>The cited laws appear to have prohibited the type of behavior Frist engaged in at the time he engaged in the conduct under discussion. Subsequent amendment to the Mass. law increased the penalties for animal cruelty. Frist is a lawmaker. If he violated laws or committed crimes or engaged in unethical and illegal behavior, this is directly relevant to a discussion of his character. Your claims and his claims about Harvard running out of animals are not substantiated in this article. The claims I have made about his violating laws are well substantiated. Frist himself described his acts as dishonest and heinous. Inducing an entity or person to enter an adoption contract through knowingly false representations is at a minimum civil fraud, and may rise to the level of criminal fraud. That the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker may also have engaged in illegal and unethical conduct is irrellevant to our consideration of Frist. The legal context in which Frist engaged in his actions in informative for the reader and will assist the reader in . I don't know that Harvard supplied Frist with cats. If Frist was on the up and up, why didn't he just ask Harvard for more cats? Why did he lie and cheat to get them? If his purposes were legitimate, why does he describe his own conduct as heinous? Rather than skimming over this incident, and in depth analysis of the circumstances and context of the behavior is preferable.<a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhitfield_Larrabee_846d.html" title="User:Whitfield Larrabee">Whitfield Larrabee</a> 03:39, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It may be that you should ad sections to the article making these points. As long as your information is factually based, I have no objection to it. Likewise, if I incorporate factual information in the article that appears sound, I don't see why you should object. Today I reviewed a copy of Massachusetts General Laws from the relevant time period, and I can tell you that there has been no relevant change in the animinal cruelty statute between then and now. The statute was amended in 1969, but only to increase the fine from $250 to $500. The penalty of one year in prison was the same then as it was until 2004. I don't propose including the Dr. Mengele reference in the article. The evidence that Frist engaged in cruel behavior can be inferred from his own conduct and admissions. His use of the word, "heinous" suggests cruelty. Massachusetts anti-cruelty statute references unneccessary killing of animals as being cruel. I did not know that Dr. Mengele killed your relatives...a surprising coincidence. Given that my grandfather died in 1969, it will be difficult for me to consult with him per your suggestion. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhitfield_Larrabee_846d.html" title="User:Whitfield Larrabee">Whitfield Larrabee</a> 21:51, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Massachusetts has the oldest anti-cruelty statute in the United States. It dates back to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, whose 1641 legal code protected domestic animals from cruelty. <a href="http://www.animal-law.org/library/aplw_v.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.animal-law.org/library/aplw_v.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.animal-law.org/library/aplw_v.htm</a>. The editor who claimed that the statute was not passed until after Dr. Frist's "heinous" experimentation of cats is contradicted by the text of the statute and its history. These statutes are "directed against acts which may be thought to have a tendency to dull humanitarian feelings and to corrupt the morals of those who observe or have knowledge of those acts." Commonwealth v. Higgins, 277 Mass. 191, 194, 178 N.E. 536 (1931). See also, Commonwealth v. Turner, 145 Mass. 296, 300, 14 N.E. 130 (1887). I am therefor modifying this entry correct the false suggestion that Massachusetts statutes did not prohibit cruelty to animals during the relevant time period.</p>

<p>It's utterly POV and insane that the experimentation-on-animals section is now the largest part of the encyclopedia article. In the calculus of Frist's life, given the number of lives he's affected for good or ill as a surgeon and a senator, the six weeks or less spent as a twenty-something collecting cats who were about to be euthanized from a shelter for medical research probably doesn't even make the top hundred incidents. It's like making George W. Bush's drunk driving incident or Al Gore's marijuana usage the largest part of their articles. Too, the reference to the federal law is entirely inappropriate, because <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhitfield_Larrabee_846d.html" title="User:Whitfield Larrabee">User:Whitfield Larrabee</a> still hasn't given a cite for anyone who claims that Frist violated this law.

<dd>How is it POV for someone to carefully document something about the character of a politician? If this activity that he engaged in was unlawful, it's important. If this activity that he engaged in was inhumane, it's important. It openly demonstrates that at least at some point in his life, he believed that the ends justify the means. The details surrounding what he did to the animals and how he obtained them is very important. Did he boast about it to his friends? Did he enjoy killing the animals? I don't want to be represented in any way or part by someone like that... and the information surrounding the facts is important to many people who are interested in politics and politicians. POV would be your cleaning it up and deleting facts from it because you are a republican who supports this man. I personally don't care which party the guy is from. I accidentally found out about his actions researching animal cruelty, NOT politics. People who have intentionally harmed domestic animals in the past when it was not an absolute necessity for them to do so really don't belong in office, in my opinion, and I'm sure in the opinion of many others. Since this opinion is probably quite widespread, information that would govern candidate selection based on this opinion... information that is FACTUAL... could easily be the largest factor of importance in this man's life, and from what I have read about him, IS the most interesting thing about him. -JX</dd>

<dd>"And I was totally schizoid about the entire matter. By day, I was little Billy Frist, the boy who lived on Bowling Avenue in Nashville and had decided to become a doctor because of his gentle father and a dog named Scratchy. By night, I was Dr. William Harrison Frist, future cardiothoracic surgeon, who was not going to let a few sentiments about cute, furry little creatures stand in the way of his career. In short, I was going a little crazy." He went on to describe why he conducted animal experiments: "It can even be beautiful and thrilling work, as I discovered that day in the lab when I first saw the wonderful workings of a dog's heart.... I spent days and nights on end in the lab, taking the hearts out of cats, dissecting each heart, suspending a strip of tiny muscle that attaches the mitral valve to the inner wall of the cat heart and recording the effects of various medicines I added to the bath surrounding the muscle." "I lost my supply of cats. I only had six weeks to complete my project before I resumed my clinical rotations. Desperate, obsessed with my work, I visited the various animal shelters in the Boston suburbs, collecting cats ....It was a heinous and dishonest thing to do."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The deleted quote is "Frist admitted that it was "a heinous and dishonest thing to do" and indicated that he "was going a little crazy" at the time." It seems to me that just using those twelve words, out of context, are unfair; it doesn't add anything to the fact that he doesn't defend the action today, but makes it seem that he did it purely out of insane malice. (It's more proof that Frist is a bad writer prone to hyperbole than anything else.) But once you put in the full context, we're back to the problem that the already overlong section becomes ridiculously long. I'm open to your experienced judgment on how to resolve these problems. If your judgment is that the quote belongs and other things should go out, I'd probably defer if the end result is NPOV; but Whitfield has had a lengthy history of POV and original research edits and reverts, of failing to respond to criticism of his edits or suggestions he observe the style requirements in the FAQ, and of making sloppy edits in articles he disagrees with that disrupt the flow of the article, so I'm more aggressive in editing when I see him reverting multiple people's corrections, especially when the subject is being debated in the talk page and he's not participating in that conversation.</dd>
<dd>The answer may be, as loathe as I am to suggest it, a separate article, though Frist's current troubles make it seem like he's going to be a forgotten footnote in four years, which makes me question the utility of a separate article for an issue that doesn't seem especially relevant even when Frist looked like a plausible presidential candidate. -- FRCP11 15:23, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Prior to my adding any kind of edit to the page, there was a quote from Frist from his book regarding Frist's actions. Frist's characterizations of his own actions are highly relevant to the issue. That he described himself as crazy, schizoid and his actions as heinous and dishonest is highly relevant to his character to hold public office. Frist's own description of his actions is not POV. The complete deletion of Frist's admissions regarding his admittedly reprehensible behavior would blatently skew the article away from the undisputed truth. That other users may join in to agree that FRCP11's POV should prevail in the article should make not difference. This can be accomplished through the use of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_puppet.html" title="Sock puppet">sock puppets</a> and other techniques. Although I think the extensive quote's that I originally posted most fairly address this issue, I acquiensced to a shorter version of the quote to capture the essense and allow the reader to explore the issue in more depth through a link to an article in tne New York Observer containing relevant excerpts from the book. I also have a copy of the book, Transplant, and I can affirm that the New York observer quotes are quite accurate.</dd>

<dd>Whitfield Larrabee's comments illustrate the problem I've been having with him, even aside from the entirely typical sloppy spelling and punctuation errors in his talk comment. Why on earth would he think that <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">User:Carbonite</a> is my sock puppet, when Carbonite's been on Wikipedia longer than I have? The record will show that my edits have not been POV: I was the first to mention the SEC and U.S. Attorney investigations of Frist, and I modified Carbonite's edit of the animal welfare section so that it fairly acknowledged the crux of the criticism of Frist. See, e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Frist&amp;diff=23828551&amp;oldid=23760137" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Frist&amp;diff=23828551&amp;oldid=23760137" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Frist&amp;diff=24192686&amp;oldid=24186561" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Frist&amp;diff=24192686&amp;oldid=24186561" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Frist&amp;diff=24166404&amp;oldid=24161325" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Frist&amp;diff=24166404&amp;oldid=24161325" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. As WL admits, he's performing original research. Once again, he has reverted, even though this is being discussed here. The revert contains original research that is both unsupported and false. It's also a sloppy edit that has extraneous punctuation. The edit summary is affirmatively misleading. Is there something we can do when an editor just steadfastly refuses to follow Wikipedia rules? -- FRCP11 16:35, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, the claim that I'm a sockpuppet is absurd. In addition to having been here for nearly a year (previously as <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">User:Carrp</a>) and making over 3,000 edits, I've also been an admin for 6 months. This article should address the matter of Frist's animal experimentation, but it must remain unbiased and adhere to the policy of NPOV. Quotes are often very difficult to present in an unbiased manner due to lack of context. Since this is a summary of the animal experimentation matter, there really isn't a need to include such quotes. It's possible that this should be broken out into a sub-article, in which case much more detail (including quotes) could be included. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 17:01, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that, as FRCP11 suggests, a subarticle might be a reasonable solution, with a link and a judicious summary in the main article. The problem is that the cat thing really is a significant part of his public perception, at least among detractors. That's not to say it's necessarily fair, but lots of people have heard about it. And it does get thrown around an awful lot as an easy way to dismiss him in general, see <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_attack.html" title="Personal attack">personal attack</a>. To an extent, I can understand this; some of those animals may well have been beloved but lost pets; it hits a visceral chord among pet owners. I do think a thoughtful sub-article would serve a useful purpose as neutral reference. For another, this stuff is going to keep on being added back to the article as new editors who think it important come along; a daughter article provides a release valve for that kind of editorial pressure. (See also my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Paul_Klenk&amp;diff=23610589&amp;oldid=23587184" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Paul_Klenk&amp;diff=23610589&amp;oldid=23587184" rel="nofollow">comments</a> to Paul Klenk regarding this issue). Also whatever his current troubles, which I think are overblown, Frist is still an extremely important public figure. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 15:59, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a lack of consensus on this. Although I have no objection to the sub article, to discuss this issue in great detail, I do object to all but a minor reference to this issue being deleted. Heck, I can barely find this issue in the article. It must be an important issue since it has generated a substantial amount of controversy. The elimination of addequate discussion in the main article is a POV and the removal of the material was done without consensus. Three does not make a consensus. The controversy under the current edit has been shunted aside where it will not be noticed. I think a compromise can be worked out here. I will restore a less controversial version of the piece on animal experimentation and include a reference to the Main article that can discuss the controversy in more detail. --<a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhitfield_Larrabee_846d.html" title="User:Whitfield Larrabee">Whitfield Larrabee</a> 01:23, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, one stubborn editor who repeatedly reverts multiple editors does not create lack of consensus or a "substantial amount of controversy." There's no point in a sub-article if the entire crux of it is included in this article. PETA issues press releases at the drop of a fur hat, so the fact that they issued one here is hardly noteworthy, and the arcane legal argument is too much detail. --FRCP11 01:55, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The same editor continues to try to revert the article, despite two RfCs and several editors telling him his position is not defensible.

<dd>Mediation shouldn't really be viewed as "escalation", it's just a way to work things out.

<p>Whitfield, what is your objection to the current handling? What specific details do you feel need to be in the main article that aren't there now? In my view, we need just enough details so that the reader understands the nature of the controversy. Then, interested readers can click on for a far more comprehensive exposition than is suitable for the main article. So, what extra details do you feel are necessary for a basic understanding? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 20:35, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whitfield continues to revert without participating in the discussion. I object to the characterization "Frist also made controversial statements about his mental state at the time he was conducting the experiments"--I haven't seen anyone claim that his statements were meant as an accurate assessment about his mental state rather than hyperbole or that there's any controversy at all about them. The other changes just make the section more verbose without adding data. -- FRCP11 02:57, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I note that there are other sections that have not been shunted off to a side article where the text is just as long as it was when this section was sent off into the wild blue yonder. Quite clearly, the minimization of information has connotations for point of view. Nonetheless, I am willing to compromise on this point if there is a fair summary of the controversy in the main body of the article. A fair summary doesn't mean sugar coating what happened or offering an inaccurate, incomplete and confusing recitation of what happened. There are three elements that need to be summarized in the main article to fairly put reader on notice as to what the controversy is about. 1) Frist repeatedly lied to animal shelters to obtain the cats. This is relevant to Frist's character for truthfulness. 2) Frist killed the cats in his experiments. This is relevant to Frist's level of humane compassion. 3) Frist admitted that his acts were dishonest and heinous. 4) Frist said he was crazy and schizoid at the time of the experiments. If the reader is not given a fair summary of the controversy, the reader has no reason to look further and the parties who moved the article have effectively censored the subject. Although I think a short quote of Frist's statements is the best way to summarize this, I made a shorter statement since quotes seem to be controversial. FRCP11 deletes any reference to the actual statements or any summary of the statements concerning Frist's actions. The NPOV fact is that the statements were made and FRCP11 wants to censor this to advance his agenda.</dd>

<dd>Whitfield doesn't even begin to address the criticisms of his edit. Who's claiming that Frist was literally diagnosing himself as "crazy" and "schizoid", as opposed to using hyperbole? The Boston Globe sure didn't. There's also no controversy that Frist killed animals in experiments, because there's no controversy over the fact that he was also killing animals that Harvard provided, as was every other Harvard Medical School student at the time. The only controversy was that Frist also performed experiments on animals that he obtained from shelters under pretense of adoption. That's indisputable, it's mentioned, and that's all that's needed to let people know that there's an issue; anything else reintroduces the original problem of imbalancing the article with a gigantic debate over a minor incident from Frist's schooldays.</dd>

<dd>Whitfield is making this about me, but the current version was written by Derex and Carbonite, neither of whom appears to be a Frist fan. I don't like Frist, so I don't understand what agenda I'm advancing, other than wanting to see a useful Wikipedia article that isn't overwhelmed by trivia, and being annoyed at a particular editor's habit of carelessly editing articles without regard for whether the result is readable, accurate, NPOV, or conforming to Wikipedia style and standards, and then engaging in revert wars without participating in the talk pages when someone dares to disagree with him.

<dd>Before you go there, can I get some comments on my current version? I think this includes all 4 of Whitfield's details in a fair way. It also provides context for the 'crazy' comment, which I don't think he truly mean literally.

<dd>The only problem I have with the edit is that it still makes it seem like that he obtained the animals for purposes of killing them, rather than for purposes of legitimate experimentation for a medical school project. It would have been crueller not to euthanize the cats after they'd been subjected to open-heart surgery, so that they were killed was a byproduct of the experiments, rather than the point. But I'll abide by whatever judgment you make about my argument. -- FRCP11 04:42, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>hmm, i don't really see that. it says he did experiments, in which he killed the cats. that's undoubtedly true, and to me it clearly indicates the point was the experiments. i mean he, did pull their hearts out, apparently while they were alive, so there's no need to soft-pedal it with 'euthanize'. he killed them, but for what many regard as a good purpose. would it satisfy you if we said something like experiments as part of a 'school research project' to more clearly indicate he didn't do it just for funzies? <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 13:02, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The animal experimentation controversy is currently section 1.1, so it's not exactly hidden in the article.

<dd>Including only two phrases (a total of nine words) from an entire book <i>does</i> bias the summary. It doesn't matter whether those are Frist's own words because it lacks any context.

<dd><i>In a 1989 autobiography, Frist described his deception in obtaining these shelter cats as "heinous and dishonest"</i>.
<dl>
<dd>It's already been established (in the first sentence of the summary) that Frist used deception to obtain the animals. There is no question as to the factual accuracy. Using the "heinous and dishonest" quote adds nothing to the summary.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>He attributed his behavior to the pressures of school, stating "I was going a little crazy"</i>
<dl>
<dd>This quote is especially inappropriate to include since it comes from a medical doctor. Does he truly mean that he was becoming mentally ill or does he just mean he was going too far? Again, this is much better explored in the sub-article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I'm very open to alternative versions of the summary, but I do believe that quotes are unnecessary and have more drawbacks than benefits. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 14:10, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Carbonite, I agree I got a little hot, and I apologize. I didn't mean 'spin' as in bias; I think that anytime anyone chooses a particular description that is inherently spin. "wrong", well wrong how: morally, legally, ethically, politically, medically. and how wrong: evil, naughty, rude, shocking, traffic-ticket wrong, or wife-beating wrong. it could mean just about anything across the spectrum. sometimes that can't be avoided, we do have to say something. in this case it can be avoided, by using the senator's <i>own</i> description; we know <i>precisely</i> how he viewed it, what kind of wrong and how wrong. "heinous and dishonest" adds more than that though, it is a marker to the reader that this was a serious controversy about a serious matter, at least one the senator himself viewed as a serious ethical breach. as i said below, i'm open to removing the 'crazy' thing. i think he probably meant it colloquially, and my sentence was structured to provide that context. however, i'm not absolutely sure of that interpretation from reading the longer quote. so, i thought whitfield's request that it be included in some manner was reasonable. i don't think there's any more or less room for interpretation in my short quote than in his longer one. but, i don't really care about this one so much; if anything i think it's fair to include it in frist's defense ... we all go a little crazy (i.e. lose perspective) under pressure. now, as to civility, no excuses, but part of the reason i got hot was the wholesale reversion. i had put a fair bit of effort into structuring that, and had made several improvements regardless of the quotes. instead of working within my overall improved version to remove the quotes, you zapped the whole thing. and that ticked me off ... human nature. but still, i should have been more temperate in my response. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 16:04, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Though I don't disagree with Derex's point that quotes are usually better than the alternative, I think Carbonite is right here that the <b>selective</b> use of the quotes presents some bias problems that make the Carbonite version preferable, and that the place for the context is the sub-article. That said, I think Derex's version is acceptable, except for the emphasis of killing over experimenting; adding "school research project" would likely solve that problem, but would like to reach a consensus on the talk page with the other three editors before I start monkeying with the text. -- FRCP11 13:27, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>i don't really find them selective. the first one is simply how he describe it, that seems a lot more clear than before where we said "wrong". the second is actually his defense, that seems favorable to him. i certainly would strongly object to the inclusion of "schizo" because that suggests more strongly the possibility that he seriously meant a mental illness. i'd be content though to remove the second quote. i put it in there in an attempt to assuage Whitfield. the first one is the quote i feel strongly about. if there's another brief quote to balance the first, so you don't view it as selective, that would be fine with me. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 13:31, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ok, i've tried to adress the criticisms above. based on comments above, i think everyone is probably satisfied, with two exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>"heinous and dishonest" included -- objectors: carbonite, frcp11 to a weak extent</li>
<li>"crazy" excluded -- objectors: whitfield, derex to a weak extent</li>
</ol>
<p>am i missing anything else? this seems to me a fairly reasonable compromise, one that i can live with. does anyone object strongly enough to revert? or can anyone suggest a mutually acceptable improvement? i'd like to at least suggest this version as a baseline for modifications, because it addresses many of the other issues that have been raised. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 16:57, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think this is a reasonable compromise. I can see someone complaining that the "pressures of school" sentence, by itself, may arguably be soft-pedaling too much; I wouldn't object if someone deleted it entirely if they thought it would make the description more NPOV, but I don't have an objection to it staying in, either. -- FRCP11 17:40, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have seen the edits by Derex with compromise summary. I would agree to that summary provided that there was also a summary statement concerning the controversy over his statements that he was schizoid and going crazy. I would suggest, "Frist said that he was "going a little crazy" and that he was "schizoid" over the whole thing, he may have been using hyperbole to describe his actions." Alternatively, we could say that "Frist made controversial statements about his mental state at the time of these incidents." --<a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhitfield_Larrabee_846d.html" title="User:Whitfield Larrabee">Whitfield Larrabee</a> 21:49, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>can you direct me to a source that makes an issue of the "crazy" or "schizoid" thing? did anyone notable truly interpret this as possibly describing a mental illness, or did everyone take it in the colloquial sense. in other words, was it <i>actually</i> controversial, or does it just sound like it might have been. if the former, citing a source might help provide a way to frame the issue. if the latter, i don't think it belongs. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 21:58, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In the New York Observer article published on the subject, the writer made the following analysis of Frist actions, "'It was, of course, a heinous and dishonest thing to do,' he wrote. 'And I was totally schizoid about the entire matter. By day, I was little Billy Frist, the boy who lived on Bowling Avenue in Nashville and had decided to become a doctor because of his gentle father and a dog named Scratchy. By night, I was Dr. William Harrison Frist, future cardiothoracic surgeon, who was not going to let a few sentiments about cute, furry little creatures stand in the way of his career.</dd>

<dd>I concur with Derex, who's repeating what I've been saying for days now. "Going a little crazy" and "schizoid" is affirmatively misleading without context, and the place for context is in the sub-article, so it doesn't belong in the main article. The problem that I have with "Frist made controversial statements" is that it's <b>false</b>. There's no controversy about these statements except that that has been stirred up by a single editor. I've repeatedly ask for a single verifiable instance of controversy (as opposed to humorous jests) over the terms "crazy" and "schizoid" in Frist's biography. The best Whitfield can come up with is Ron Rosenbaum's humorous jest about Frist's use of the term; one cannot bootstrap a controversy by being the only person in Western civilization taking those statements as literal medical diagnosis.</dd>

<dd>just to repeat, i thought including the quote i had made some sense, but more as a defense of frist than the suggestion of instability. in other words, he was <i>really</i> stressed and <i>really</i> overwhelmed: "a little crazy", so he exercised poor judgement. that's different than having serious mental problems. i think "schizo" was similarly meant in a non-medical sense. the advantage of having the sentence <i>attributed the stress to pressure, stating "I was going a little crazy"</i> is that it gives the same impression as his lengthy quote. however, it also leaves open the <i>possibility</i> that he was being more literal, just as the extended quote does. without an explicit citation of a controversy ... oh my god, frist might be nuts ... i think that is the closest i'm willing to go to whitfield's desired language. i don't think the cited observer article seriously questions his sanity. but even if it did, one minor remark in one not-major newspaper doesn't make for a "controversy". <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerex_a544.html" title="User:Derex">Derex</a> 22:50, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Item currently states: "There has also been controversy regarding the "nuclear option," under which the Republicans would change a rule in the Senate to prevent the filibuster of judical nominations."</p>
<p>Suggest a correction, as this is not a change to Senate rules. The filibuster is covered under Standing Senate Rule XXII, and clearly spells out that a filibuster can occur for any reason (other than budget reconciliations), and requires a cloture vote of 60 votes (a 3/5ths majority) to end the filibuster, with one exception: if the filibuster is to prevent a vote on a Senate Rule change, cloture requires 67 votes (a 2/3rds majority). Obviously, if the GOP are unable to get 60 votes to end the filibuster of a judicial nominee, they'll never get 67 to end a filibuster of a Senate Rule change. See <a href="http://rules.senate.gov/senaterules/rule22.htm" class="external free" title="http://rules.senate.gov/senaterules/rule22.htm" rel="nofollow">http://rules.senate.gov/senaterules/rule22.htm</a></p>
<p>In fact, the nuclear option involves raising a point of order that the option to use the filibuster on judicial nominations is unconstitutional, which the chair (presumably the Vice President) will rule correct. Democrats can appeal, but it only takes a simple majority to affirm the chair's decision, effectively bypassing both Senate Rules and the procedures to change rules. So it isn't just a rule change. 68.13.104.230 07:43, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed the statement in the very beginning of the article about Sen. Frist's flip-flop on use of stem cells taken from aborted children. Saying that embryos used for stem cell research = aborted children is not a NPOV (neutral point of view). The mention of this issue is also out of place - the beginning of the article should introduce basic information about Sen. Frist, and his stance on specific issues should be written later in the article. The stem cell issue is indeed mentioned later in the article.</p>

Fact: an embryo is a child(duh!?). Also, why are we mentioning a staw poll at the start of this thing? Im sorry but it doesnt seem like it belongs there.</p>
<p><br />
Sexington7 07:19, August 2 2006</p>
<p><br />
The lack of agreement over whether embryos = children or not is why this whole debate exists in the first place, so each side ends up representing a particular non-neutral, or not-agreed-upon, point of view. I felt the aborted children statement was getting into the debate and straying away from the topic of the article, which is Sen. Frist. It's more appropriate for the purposes of the article to just describe Frist's opinion on the issue and leave it at that without additional commentary. The actual debate itself is better left in a separate article altogether. And yeah, I also thought it was pretty weird when I read the straw poll thing at the beginning (I didn't write it), but just decided to let other users figure out whether to leave it in or not.</p>
<p>-JerryKong2000 02 August 2006</p>

Agreed, we can leave the abortion thing out, lets just keep the straw poll thing somewhere else.</p>

<dd><i>After numerous challenges by Stephanopoulos, Frist said that "it would be very hard" for someone to contract AIDS via tears or sweat.

This is the official position of wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, predicting what will happen in the future. As the Senator is still in office, the article should be left as it is.

<p>This section has been on the page for quite some time. I have tried to edit out the poor sourcing but it keeps getting reverted back to this. This needs better sourcing. This is a well known and heavily reported controversy. Cardsquad.com will not work as a source. Section is below. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 17:36, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In September 2006, working with Arizona Senator <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Kyl_6e28.html" title="Jon Kyl">Jon Kyl</a>, Frist was a major Senate supporter of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 aka the <a href="../../../s/a/f/SAFE_Port_Act_522f.html" title="SAFE Port Act">SAFE Port Act</a>. The Act was passed at midnight the day Congress adjourned before the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_general_elections%2C_2006_457b.html" title="United States general elections, 2006">2006 elections</a>. Prior to it being added to the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_%28proposed_law%29.html" title="Bill (proposed law)">bill</a>, the gambling provisions had not been debated by any <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congressional_committee_4543.html" title="United States Congressional committee">Congressional committee</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>This was seen by liberals and libertarians alike as pandering for the support of the Evangelical <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Right_7ce0.html" title="Christian Right">Christian Right</a> base just prior to the 2006 mid-term elections<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. 80% of Americans were against the bill.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>It seems to me that some of the "controversies" listed in this article are overblown and do not merit mentioning (specifically Medical license renewal and Comments about transmission of HIV). Neither of these seem to be that important or that controversial, but simply an obvious misstatement on a show and a failure to comply with a state's requirements for application renewal. Unless someone can explain to me why these are relevant enough to include in the article, I believe that they should be removed. <a href="../../../m/b/c/User%7EMbc362_848b.html" title="User:Mbc362">Mbc362</a> 05:24, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Both points have received enough public attention to be included. For a politician, public perceptions are more significant than for someone else, regardless of whether those perceptions are soundly based. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 05:53, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the two controversies should stay, but since they're both in one-paragraph sections, perhaps a minor change: put them together into a new section titled "Other". That would then be a two-paragraph section, with none of the text deleted. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 14:39, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Done. I still don't think they're really that relevant, but perhaps you two are right.--<a href="../../../m/b/c/User%7EMbc362_848b.html" title="User:Mbc362">Mbc362</a> 20:18, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If Frist does stay out of politics for at least a couple of years, then probably the relevance of these will fade. On the other hand, if he ends up (say) as Secretary of HHS in the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCain_2b79.html" title="John McCain">John McCain</a> administration in 2009, then at minimum his unwillingness to (warning!!! POV wording follows!!!) acknowledge some realities related to AIDS/HIV would become much more relevant. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 02:37, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By NPOV standards, dealing with controversial articles (and by extension "controversy" sections of articles) should not be done with one-sided facts. By limiting the reader to the accusations and not the explanation, a NPOV is not maintained. Equal weight should be given to each side of the controversy, something which has not been done. Clean-up is needed. RBPierce 16:48, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that you (re)read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Nowhere in that policy does it say that "equal weight" should be given to each side of the controversy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for "cleanup", you're using the wrong word (I realize it's in the title of this section, but that had to do with the overall extent of the section, not with pro and con facts and sources). If you want to <i>add</i> information that is missing, fine (ideally, with footnotes to the source, if you're not using a source already there). If you want to <i>add</i> links to sources (meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) that defend Frist, fine. No one here is in favor of <i>limiting the reader to the accusations and not the explanation</i>, as far as I know, and I certainly welcome your pointing out any examples where an editor has (incorrectly) removed explanatory information or reliable sources providing such information. -- <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;"><a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a></font> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">(☎☎)</a> 16:07, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
