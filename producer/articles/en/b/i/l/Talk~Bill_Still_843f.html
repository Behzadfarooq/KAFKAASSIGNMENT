<p>Ok, well, Bill Still has been quoted a lot in popular literature. Ok, maybe not POPULAR, per se, but as you said in your standards doc, fame does not equal noteworthiness. Please note that Still's first book, "New World Order: the Ancient Plan of Secret Societies" has sold over 250,000 copies worldwide and has been translated into 3 additional languages. That's more books sold than anything Henry Kissinger has written.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is not the man Bill Still, although he does have a good teaching style, but his economic principles.</p>
<p>The Fed is authorized to create money not print it. It creates it by several methods, including buying bonds on the open market and paying for them with what is essentially a rubber check, thereby pumping money into the system which they merely create out of thin air. They create additional money by lowering interest rates, and decreasing reserve requirements for banks, thereby allowing them to lend out more money thereby pumping liquidity into the system. The Fed calls this a flexible money supply and it works well sometimes, such as immediately after the 9/11 attacks. However, many times in U.S. history the quantity of money in circulation in the United States has been deliberately manipulated to the detrement of the nation for political gain. That's what Still's video, "The Money Masters" goes to great lengths to show. Several Presidents in U. S. History (most notably Andrew Jackson) have fought these banks literally to the death. There is even evidence that Lincoln's assassination was brought about by banking interests because he issued money directly from Congress (greenbacks) thereby bypassing the money-manipulation powers of the large banking interests.</p>
<p>If you begin to ask questions about who the Fed is or what they do, you come across a lot of interesting things. Economically speaking, you have the money supply, or the amount of currency in circulation. This is driven in part by Fractional Reserve Banking, and in times of tight money or contraction, the Fed can raise interest rates and thereby put the brakes on new loans, and call back old loans.</p>
<p>This business cycle is like BREATHING to the Fed, indeed it is. And through this cycle, the Fed has come to own a lot of land and a lot of gold.</p>
<p>I really don't understand Wikipedia's policy. What am I supposed to call this article? Monetary reform is, in the opinion of many, the most important issue facing America today.</p>
<p>Mr. Still's movement is to get America to issue its own money. The way it is now, with the Fed being a PRIVATE central bank, it is a complex system that no one understands ... and when one DOES come to understand it, the Fed literally comes to own us by devaluing our money and reposessing our assets (indirectly, and during a tight-money phase).</p>
<p>Please do not delete this article without telling me, in kindergarten terms, why. Please do not say 'A7', I already read about A7, and it says 'does not bring topic or subject matter to the fore' or something like that.</p>
<p>Which is why I spent a lot of time brining the actual financio-economic principles to the fore.</p>

<p>This material appears to be well-researched and worth pursuing further.</p>
<p>Bill Still's Contribution Mr. Still's classic documentary, THE MONEY MASTERS, has made a profound impression on me and many individuals that I know. What he offers is startling, to say the least, at first encounter. However, he seems to be a rigorous researcher and the implications of what he reports are vast. I am glad to see a Wiki site for him so that others can offer any corrections or further information on such topics as the Fed, fractional reserve banking and the gold that was supposed to be in Fort Knox. Getting to the truth behind such issues semms critical to the well being of each person,our contry, our environment and humanity as a whole. 67.180.133.241 18:16, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have heard Bill Still speak on two separate occasions and am familiar with many of his materials. I have found him to have a great depth of knowledge and understanding, and he deports himself with conviction, credibility, and the highest integrity. I believe that his "Money Masters" production would be a great benefit to every American, and furthering his exposure and accessability a high priority because of the value and importance of what Bill Still has to offer71.108.220.183 05:34, 8 April 2007 (UTC)Steve</p>
<p>Regarding Bill Still: Reading his articles and watching his videos have taught me more about the history of the banking industry and how money is created, than I ever learned in all of my school years. His critical research and knowledge on the topic of money and banking picks up where G.Edward Griffin in his book The Creature from Jekyll Island left off. Bill's research is presented with clarity and is not only very interesting, his evidence is beyond dispute. Bill Still is a true American historiian and a scholar on banking and the creation of money and should be honored for his important works.</p>

<p>Bill Still produced and starred in the greatest documentary on the history of money that has ever been made. I've purchaced several copies of this documentary originally called "Capital Crimes", and later titled "The Money Masters". I have seen this documentary many times, and my friends are blown away by it! In three and a half hours this documentary tells the history of money B.C. to Present times in a fast paced inciteful tour de force! William T. Still or Bill Still made one of the most important documentaries ever made.</p>

<p>I have viewed and shared my copy of The Money Masters with many people and everyone agrees that this is one of the most important documentaries to come along in a very long time. Many cannot believe what has been revealed in his documentary because the information has been so well chipped into pieces and scattered in plain site. However Mr. Still is quite the puzzle master and once the pieces of the puzzle start coming together, the picture on the box becomes quite clear. Trust but verify. You can start your puzzle with this little piece right from the Federal Reserves web page.</p>

<p>Fedpoint 45: Reserve Requirements (aka. Fractional Reserve Banking)</p>
<p>"Reserve requirements, a tool of monetary policy, are computed as percentages of deposits that banks must hold as vault cash or on deposit at a Federal Reserve Bank. Reserve requirements represent a cost to the banking system. Bank reserves, meanwhile, are used in the day-to-day implementation of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. As of September 1996, the reserve requirement was 10% on transaction deposits,, and there were zero reserves required for time deposits.'</p>
<p>'The term "reserve requirements" refers to the percentage of deposits that a bank or other depository institution may not lend out or invest and must hold either as vault cash or on deposit at a Federal Reserve Bank.'</p>
<p>'Reserve Requirements and Money Creation'</p>
<p>'Reserve requirements affect the potential of the banking system to create transaction deposits. If the reserve requirement is 10%, for example, a bank that receives a $100 deposit may lend out $90 of that deposit. If the borrower then writes a check to someone who deposits the $90, the bank receiving that deposit can lend out $81. As the process continues, the banking system can expand the initial deposit of $100 into a maximum of $1,000 of money ($100+$90+81+$72.90+...=$1,000). In contrast, with a 20% reserve requirement, the banking system would be able to expand the initial $100 deposit into a maximum of $500 ($100+$80+$64+$51.20+...=$500). Thus, higher reserve requirements should result in reduced money creation and, in turn, reduced economic activity.'</p>
<p>'In practice, the connection between reserve requirements and money creation is not nearly as strong as the exercise above would suggest. Reserve requirements apply only to transaction accounts, which are components of M1, a narrowly defined measure of money. Deposits that are components of M2 and M3 (but not M1), such as savings accounts and time deposits, have no reserve requirements and therefore can expand without regard to reserve levels.”</p>
<pre>
“The Monetary Control Act (MCA) of 1980 authorizes the Fed's Board of Governors to impose a reserve requirement of from 8% to 14% on transaction deposits (checking and other accounts from which transfers can be made to third parties) and of up to 9% on nonpersonal time deposits (those not held by an individual or sole proprietorship). The Fed may also impose a reserve requirement of any size on the amount depository institutions in the United States owe, on a net basis, to their foreign affiliates or to other foreign banks. Under the MCA, the Fed may not impose reserve requirements against personal time deposits (personal savings accounts)except in extraordinary circumstances, after consultation with Congress, and by the affirmative vote of at least five of the seven members of the Board of Governors." 
</pre>
<p>(As of this writing, the actual reserve requirement is 3% for short term deposits, 3 days or less and for long term deposits, anything 4 days or more the reserve rate is 0%. This translates to unlimited profit for the bankers, with nothing at risk. Yet when the bank forecloses on a property the “Home Owner” generally looses his/her total investment, principle, interest, real and capital improvements, etc. Note 1: banks pay no taxes on anything at all except REO (Real Estate Owned aka. foreclosed) property that has been on their books for more than 6 months. Note 2: The proper pronunciation of Real in the term Real Estate is same as in El Camino Real, which means The Royal Highway. Note 3: Prior to the 1930s most land was owned in “Allodial” title, however with the “New Deal” came the striping of the allodial title and new “owners” of property became “tenants in .x.” held under “Fee Simple” with the imposition of property tax, the “fee”) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.107.94.6_b41f.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.107.94.6">71.107.94.6</a> (talk) 20:35, 8 April 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Bill Still's work is some of the best I have seen about the history of money and its international relationship. I consider his works a study of history and American money. To his credit I find it very accurate and enlightening. Most Americans do not understand money at all and the schools do not teach anything useful about it. His writings are more easily understood than others I have seen and should be mandatory reading for all students.
