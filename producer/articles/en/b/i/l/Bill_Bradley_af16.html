<p>Bradley was born in <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_City%2C_Missouri_a798.html" title="Crystal City, Missouri">Crystal City, Missouri</a> to Warren Bradley, a banker, and Susie Crowe.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Bradley began playing basketball in <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_grade.html" title="Fourth grade">fourth grade</a>. He was a basketball star at Crystal City High School, scoring 3,068 points in his scholastic career and twice being named an All-American. With stellar academic credentials as well, he received 75 <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarship.html" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a> offers.</p>
<p>The 6' 5" (1.96 m) Bradley chose <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>, even though <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> colleges could not offer athletic scholarships. At Princeton, under coach <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butch_van_Breda_Kolff_1851.html" title="Butch van Breda Kolff">Butch van Breda Kolff</a>, Bradley was a three-time All-American and the 1965 National Player of the Year. With Bradley in tow, the Tigers captured the Ivy League championship in each of his three varsity seasons. During his sophomore campaign, Bradley averaged 27.3 points and 12.2 rebounds a game while hitting 89.3 percent of his free throws. Among his greatest games was a 41-point effort in an 80-78 loss to heavily favored <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Michigan_a8fd.html" title="University of Michigan">Michigan</a> in the 1964 Holiday Festival (Bradley fouled out with his team leading 75-63), and a 58-point outburst against <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wichita_State_University_0f6b.html" title="Wichita State University">Wichita State</a> in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament_cc39.html" title="1965 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament">1965 NCAA tournament</a>, which was a single game record. In total, Bradley scored 2,503 points at Princeton, averaging 30.2 points per game.

<p>As a freshman, Bradley sank 57 successive free throws, a record unmatched by any other player, college or professional. As a sophomore, he led the league in rebounds, field goals, free throws, and total points, and, when he fouled out after scoring a record-breaking 40 points in an NCAA tournament game with <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Joseph%27s_University_ab8f.html" title="Saint Joseph's University">Saint Joseph's</a> in Philadelphia, was given an unprecedented ovation.</p>
<p>In his junior year, he made 51 points against <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a>, more than the entire opposing team had scored before he was taken out, and his 33.1 points-per-game average that season set an Ivy League record.</p>
<p>In his senior year, when he was captain, he led Princeton to the highest national ranking it had ever had in basketball. The Tigers placed third behind <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Los_Angeles_9767.html" title="University of California, Los Angeles">UCLA</a> and Michigan in the NCAA tournament, as a result of an 118-82 victory over Wichita State in the consolation game of the semi-finals. In the Wichita game, Bradley scored 58 points, an NCAA tournament record that still stands today.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bradley_af16.html" title="Edit section: Professional basketball">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Professional basketball</span></h2>
<p>After completing his studies at <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford</a>, and playing professional basketball briefly in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> for <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olimpia_Milano_19b6.html" title="Olimpia Milano">Olimpia Milano</a>, where he won a <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euroleague.html" title="Euroleague">European Champions Cup</a> (the most important trophy for European teams), Bradley returned to the U.S. to join the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Knicks_22a8.html" title="New York Knicks">New York Knicks</a> of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">National Basketball Association</a>. On the court, Bradley struggled his rookie year before coming into his own in his second season. During that season, he was moved from the guard position to his more natural forward position. In 1969-70, he helped the Knicks win their first national championship, followed by a second in 1972-73. The second championship season was Bradley’s best and he made his only All-Star Game appearance that year. Retiring from basketball in 1977, he was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.</p>
<p>In the NBA, Bradley was not the major scoring threat he had been in college. Over ten years playing <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_forward.html" title="Small forward">small forward</a> for the Knicks, "Dollar Bill," as he was nicknamed, scored a total of 9,217 points for an average of 12.4 points per game, with his seasonal best being 16.1 points per game.</p>
<p>During his time in the NBA, Bradley used his fame on the court to explore social and political issues, meeting with journalists, government officials, academics, businesspeople and social activists. He also worked as an assistant to the director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C. making contacts in Democratic circles. In 1976, Bill also became an author, with <i>Life on the Run</i>, which chronicled his experiences in the NBA and the people he met along the way.</p>
<p>Bradley retired from basketball in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, he was inducted into the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball_Hall_of_Fame_d8d9.html" title="Basketball Hall of Fame">Basketball Hall of Fame</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> the Knicks retired his number 24 jersey.</p>

<p>Bradley had harbored political ambitions for years, and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> decided to run for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, for a seat held by liberal Republican and four-term incumbent <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clifford_P._Case_15e2.html" title="Clifford P. Case">Clifford P. Case</a>. Case lost his primary to anti-tax conservative Jeff Bell, and Bradley won the seat in the general election with 55% of the vote.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Bradley acquired a reputation for being somewhat aloof and was thought of as a "<a href="../../../p/o/l/Policy_wonk.html" title="Policy wonk">policy wonk</a>," specializing in complex reform initiatives. The best known of these was the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> overhaul of the federal tax code, which reduced the tax rate schedule to just two brackets, 15% and 28%, and eliminated many kinds of deductions. Although he was a vocal supporter of various left-wing causes and political reform, he sometimes broke ranks with his party to support the <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Reagan</a> administration (initially supporting, for instance, Reagan's policy of aiding the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contra_%28guerrillas%29.html" title="Contra (guerrillas)">Contras</a> in <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicaragua.html" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>).</p>
<p>Some significant domestic policy initiatives which Bradley led or was associated with included: reform of child support enforcement; legislation concerning lead-related children's health problems; the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_Income_Tax_Credit_d55b.html" title="Earned Income Tax Credit">Earned Income Tax Credit</a>; campaign finance reform; and federal budget reform to reduce the deficit, which included, in 1981, supporting President <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Reagan</a>'s spending cuts but opposing his parallel tax cut package, one of only three senators to take this position.</p>
<p>Bradley was re-elected in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> with 64% of the vote, and he still retained popularity in New Jersey from his Knicks days and from practices such as his annual <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Day_%28United_States%29_60e9.html" title="Labor Day (United States)">Labor Day</a> talk-to-citizens stroll along <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jersey_Shore_eeca.html" title="Jersey Shore">Jersey Shore</a> beaches. Then a controversy over a state <a href="../../../i/n/c/Income_tax.html" title="Income tax">income tax</a> increase - which he refused to take a position on - turned his once-obscure challenger for Senate in 1990, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Todd_Whitman_2f97.html" title="Christine Todd Whitman">Christine Todd Whitman</a>, into a viable candidate. Bradley won by a very small margin. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> he opted not to run for re-election, publicly declaring American politics "broken."</p>

<p>On the issue of <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">taxes</a>, Bradley trumpeted his sponsorship of the <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986_a7fe.html" title="Tax Reform Act of 1986">Tax Reform Act of 1986</a>, which had significantly cut <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_rate.html" title="Tax rate">tax rates</a>, while simultaneously abolishing dozens of <a href="../../../l/o/o/Loophole.html" title="Loophole">loopholes</a>. He voiced his belief that the best possible tax code would be one with low rates and no loopholes, but he refused to rule out the idea of raising taxes to pay for his health care program.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_education.html" title="Public education">public education</a>, Bradley reversed his previous support of <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_voucher.html" title="Education voucher">school vouchers</a>, declaring them to be a failure. He proposed to make over $2 billion in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Block_grant.html" title="Block grant">block grants</a> available to each state every year to be used for education. He further promised to bring 60,000 new teachers into the education system annually by offering <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a> <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarship.html" title="Scholarship">scholarships</a> to anyone who agreed to become a teacher after graduating.</p>
<p>Bradley also made <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_poverty.html" title="Child poverty">child poverty</a> a significant issue in his campaign. Having voted against the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act_1fe2.html" title="Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act">Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act</a>, better known as the "Welfare Reform Act," which, he said, would result in even higher poverty levels, he promised to repeal it as president. He also promised to address the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimum_wage.html" title="Minimum wage">minimum wage</a>, expand the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_income_tax_credit.html" title="Earned income tax credit">Earned Income Tax Credit</a>, allow <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_parent.html" title="Single parent">single parents</a> on welfare to keep their <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_support.html" title="Child support">child support</a> payments, make the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_tax_credit.html" title="Child tax credit">Dependent Care Tax Credit</a> refundable, build support homes for <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenage_pregnancy.html" title="Teenage pregnancy">pregnant teenagers</a>, enroll 400,000 more children in <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_Start_b694.html" title="Head Start">Head Start</a>, and increase the availability of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_Stamp_Program_6ce4.html" title="Food Stamp Program">food stamps</a>.</p>
<p>Although Gore was considered the favorite of the party, Bradley did receive a few high-profile endorsements. He was supported by Senators <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Wellstone_f264.html" title="Paul Wellstone">Paul Wellstone</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Kerrey_8042.html" title="Bob Kerrey">Bob Kerrey</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Patrick_Moynihan_efaf.html" title="Daniel Patrick Moynihan">Daniel Patrick Moynihan</a>; former Senators <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A._Durkin_1339.html" title="John A.

<p>Bradley's campaign ultimately floundered, in part because it was overshadowed by Senator <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCain_2b79.html" title="John McCain">John McCain</a>'s far more attention-gaining, but ultimately unsuccessful, campaign for the Republican nomination, and in part because it was not able to match Gore's organization once the multiple-primary <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Tuesday_0c70.html" title="Super Tuesday">Super Tuesdays</a> began.</p>

<p>Bradley has mostly stayed out of the limelight since his failed 2000 presidential primary campaign, working mainly as a corporate <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consultant.html" title="Consultant">consultant</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/v/Investment_banker.html" title="Investment banker">investment banker</a>. He serves as a managing director of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_%26_Company_3d13.html" title="Allen &amp; Company">Allen &amp; Company</a> LLC. He is also chief outside advisor to <a href="../../../m/c/k/McKinsey_%26_Company_05ba.html" title="McKinsey &amp; Company">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>'s non-profit practice. In 2005, he joined the advisory board of British corporate investigation firm <a href="../../../h/a/k/Hakluyt_%26_Company_63dd.html" title="Hakluyt &amp; Company">Hakluyt &amp; Company</a>. Oxford University awarded Bradley an honorary Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) in 2003, with the comment that he was "An outstandingly distinguished athlete, a weighty pillar of the Senate, and still a powerful advocate of the weak."</p>
<p>Despite some speculation about a second presidential run, he did not run in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> and has shown no interest in returning to political office. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, he reportedly turned down a last-minute offer from New Jersey Democrats to replace <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Torricelli_19ca.html" title="Robert Torricelli">Robert Torricelli</a> on the ballot for his old Senate seat (<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Lautenberg_9f70.html" title="Frank Lautenberg">Frank Lautenberg</a> accepted it instead). In January of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Bradley endorsed <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Dean_da7d.html" title="Howard Dean">Howard Dean</a> for President in the 2004 Democratic primaries, joining his old rival <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a> in making that move—the endorsement, however, did not have any apparent effect on Dean's unexpectedly unsuccessful campaign. Bradley's book, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_American_Story_b8d9.html" title="The New American Story">The New American Story</a></i>, was released on March 27, 2007.</p>

<li>During his high school years, Bradley maintained a maniacal practice schedule. He would work on the court for "three and a half hours every day after school, nine to five on Saturday, one-thirty to five on Sunday, and, in the summer, about three hours a day. He put ten pounds of lead slivers in his sneakers, set up chairs as opponents and dribbled in a slalom fashion around them, and wore eyeglass frames that had a piece of cardboard taped to them so that he could not see the floor, for a good dribbler never looks at the ball." <sup id="_ref-Showdown_at_Gucci_Gulch_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Showdown_at_Gucci_Gulch" title="">[6]</a></sup></li>
