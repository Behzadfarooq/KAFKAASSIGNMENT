<p>He was first elected to the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Assembly_of_Ontario_b4b4.html" title="Legislative Assembly of Ontario">Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a> in <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1959.html" title="Ontario general election, 1959">1959 provincial election</a>, for the southern Ontario constituency of <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peel_%28electoral_district%29.html" title="Peel (electoral district)">Peel</a>. Although Peel was an extremely safe Conservative seat for most of its history, Davis's majority in this election was surprisingly narrow. The election took place soon after the federal Progressive Conservative government of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Diefenbaker_9dea.html" title="John Diefenbaker">John Diefenbaker</a> cancelled the <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avro_Arrow_a645.html" title="Avro Arrow">Avro Arrow</a> program. Most of the 14,000 Canadians put out of work by this decision were residents of Peel, and many cast protest ballots against Diefenbaker by supporting Bill Brydon, the provincial <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Liberal_Party_2013.html" title="Ontario Liberal Party">Liberal</a> candidate. Davis won, but by only 1,203 votes.</p>
<p>Davis served for two years as a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backbencher.html" title="Backbencher">backbench</a> supporter of <a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_Frost_3f6a.html" title="Leslie Frost">Leslie Frost</a>'s government. When Frost announced his retirement in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>, Davis became the chief organizer of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Macaulay_17bb.html" title="Robert Macaulay">Robert Macaulay</a>'s campaign to succeed him as premier and party leader. Macaulay was eliminated on the next-to-last ballot, and, with Davis, delivered crucial support for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Robarts_3496.html" title="John Robarts">John Robarts</a> to defeat <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelso_Roberts_8d01.html" title="Kelso Roberts">Kelso Roberts</a> on the final vote.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Davis_7714.html" title="Edit section: Minister of Education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Minister of Education</span></h2>
<p>Davis was appointed to Robarts's cabinet as <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Education_%28Ontario%29_398a.html" title="Minister of Education (Ontario)">Minister of Education</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_25.html" title="October 25">October 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1962.html" title="1962">1962</a>, and was re-elected by a greatly increased margin in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1963.html" title="Ontario general election, 1963">1963 provincial election</a>.</p>
<p>Davis was given additional responsibilities as Ontario's Minister of University Affairs on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_14.html" title="May 14">May 14</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>, and held both portfolios until 1971. He soon developed a reputation as a strongly interventionist minister, and oversaw a dramatic increase in education expenditures throughout the 1960s (education spending in Ontario grew by 454% between 1962 and 1971). He established many new public schools, often in centralized locations to accommodate larger numbers of students. Davis also undertook dramatic revisions of Ontario's outdated and inefficient school board system, reducing the 3,676 boards of 1962 to only 192 in 1967. Many boards had presided over a single school prior to Davis's reforms.</p>
<p>Davis also created new universities, including <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trent_University_ba30.html" title="Trent University">Trent University</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brock_University_3173.html" title="Brock University">Brock University</a>, and established twenty-two community colleges, the first of which opened its doors in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>. He established the <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Ontario_7482.html" title="TV Ontario">TV Ontario</a> educational television network in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>.</p>
<p>Davis's handling of the education portfolio made him a high-profile minister, and there was little surprise when he entered the leadership contest to succeed Robarts in 1971. He was quickly dubbed as the frontrunner, though his awkward speaking style and image as an "establishment" candidate hindered his campaign. He defeated rival candidate <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Lawrence_4a38.html" title="Allan Lawrence">Allan Lawrence</a> by only 44 votes on the final ballot, after receiving support from third-place candidate <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darcy_McKeough_2a69.html" title="Darcy McKeough">Darcy McKeough</a>. Shortly after the convention, Davis invited Lawrence's campaign team to join his inner circle of advisors. This group became known as the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Blue_Machine_60eb.html" title="Big Blue Machine">Big Blue Machine</a>, and remained the dominant organizational force in the Progressive Conservative Party until the 1980s.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Davis_7714.html" title="Edit section: Premier">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Premier</span></h2>
<p>Shortly after taking office as premier, Davis announced that his government would not permit construction of the proposed <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spadina_Expressway_85b4.html" title="Spadina Expressway">Spadina Expressway</a> in downtown Toronto (an initiative that had been unpopular with many of the area's residents). He also rejected a proposal to grant full funding to Ontario's Catholic high schools, which some regarded as an appeal to the Progressive Conservative Party's rural Protestant base. Davis's team ran a professional campaign in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1971.html" title="Ontario general election, 1971">1971 provincial election</a>, and was rewarded with an increased majority government.</p>
<p>Davis's first full term as premier was by most accounts his least successful, with public confidence in his government weakened by a series of scandals. There were allegations that the Fidinam company had received special consideration for a Toronto development program in return for donations to the Progressive Conservative Party. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, it was revealed that Davis's friend Gerhard Moog had received a valuable untendered contract for the construction of <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Hydro_9c08.html" title="Ontario Hydro">Ontario Hydro</a>'s new head office and related projects. <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_%28Ontario%29_e4d0.html" title="Attorney General (Ontario)">Attorney General</a> Dalton Bales, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solicitor_General_%28Ontario%29_4ad0.html" title="Solicitor General (Ontario)">Solicitor General</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Yaremko_8243.html" title="John Yaremko">John Yaremko</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treasurer_%28Ontario%29_7851.html" title="Treasurer (Ontario)">Treasurer</a> McKeough were all accused of conflicts-of-interest relating to government approval for developments on properties they owned. The government was cleared of impropriety in all cases, but its popular support nonetheless declined. The Conservatives lost four key by-elections in 1973 and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>.</p>
<p>On the policy front, the Davis administration introduced regional governments for <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham_Regional_Municipality%2C_Ontario_1377.html" title="Durham Regional Municipality, Ontario">Durham</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamilton-Wentworth_Regional_Municipality%2C_Ontario_e701.html" title="Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Municipality, Ontario">Hamilton-Wentworth</a> and Haldimand-Norfolk, but shelved further plans in response to popular protests. The government was also forced to cancel a planned 7% energy tax in 1973 following protests from the Progressive Conservative backbench. In the buildup to the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1975.html" title="Ontario general election, 1975">1975 provincial election</a>, Davis imposed a ninety-day freeze on energy prices, temporarily reduced the provincial sales tax from 7% to 5%, and announced rent controls for the province.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Davis_7714.html" title="Edit section: Minority governments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Minority governments</span></h2>
<p>The 1975 campaign was far more bitter than that of 1971, with Davis and Liberal leader <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Nixon_8b11.html" title="Robert Nixon">Robert Nixon</a> repeatedly hurling personal insults at one another. Polls taken shortly before the election had the Liberals in the lead. The Progressive Conservatives won only 51 seats out of 125, but were able to remain in power with a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minority_government.html" title="Minority government">minority government</a>. The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_of_Ontario_c5e3.html" title="New Democratic Party of Ontario">New Democratic Party</a> (NDP) won 38 seats under the leadership of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Lewis_20f9.html" title="Stephen Lewis">Stephen Lewis</a>, while Nixon's Liberals finished third with 36. Soon after the election, Davis hired <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Segal_86eb.html" title="Hugh Segal">Hugh Segal</a> as his legislative secretary.</p>
<p>Davis appointed right-wingers <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Stuart_Miller_6615.html" title="Frank Stuart Miller">Frank Miller</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Taylor_%28Ontario_politician%29_02a4.html" title="James Taylor (Ontario politician)">James Taylor</a> to key cabinet portfolios after the election, but withdrew from a proposed austerity program following a negative public response. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>, he introduced a policy statement written by Segal which became known as the "Bramalea Charter", promising extensive new housing construction for the next decade. Davis called a <a href="../../../s/n/a/Snap_election.html" title="Snap election">snap election</a> in <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1977.html" title="Ontario general election, 1977">1977</a>, but was again returned with only a minority. The Progressive Conservatives increased their standing to 58 seats, against 34 for the Liberals and 33 for the NDP.</p>
<p>The Conservatives remained the dominant party after the 1975 and 1977 elections due to the inability of either the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_New_Democratic_Party_0991.html" title="Ontario New Democratic Party">New Democrats</a> and the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Liberal_Party_2013.html" title="Ontario Liberal Party">Liberals</a> to become the clear alternative. The Conservatives were able to stay in power due to the competition between both opposition parties. As there was no serious consideration of a Liberal-NDP alliance after both campaigns, Davis was able avoid defeat in the legislature by appealing to other parties for support on particular initiatives. His government often moved to the left of the rural-based Liberals on policy issues. The opposition parties had also undergone leadership changes; Nixon and Lewis, who had posed a strong challenge to Davis, resigned after the 1975 and 1977 elections, respectively. Nixon's successor <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_Lyon_Smith_b98e.html" title="Stuart Lyon Smith">Stuart Lyon Smith</a> proved unable to increase Liberal support, while new NDP leader <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Cassidy_1333.html" title="Michael Cassidy">Michael Cassidy</a> lacked the support of the party establishment and could not measure up to Lewis's charismatic and dynamic figure.</p>
<p>This period of the Davis government was one of expansion for the province's public health and education systems, and Davis held a particular interest in ensuring that the province's community colleges remained productive. The government also expanded the provisions of the Ontario Human Rights Code, and expanded bilingual services without introducing official bilingualism to the province.</p>

<p>Davis had an awkward relationship with federal <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_d0d3.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Canada">Progressive Conservative</a> leader <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Clark_415b.html" title="Joe Clark">Joe Clark</a>. Clark and Davis held differing views over fuel prices, and the Davis government actively opposed Clark's 1979 austerity budget which included a gas tax. In the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1980.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1980">1980 federal election</a>, Davis's criticism of Clark's budget was used by the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberal Party</a> in official campaign documents and it played a role in the federal Tories' losses in Ontario; the swing in support enabled the Liberals to regain government.</p>
<p>Unlike most provincial premiers in Canada, Davis strongly supported <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_Canada_02d6.html" title="Prime Minister of Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Trudeau_6783.html" title="Pierre Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a>'s 1981 plans to patriate the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_Canada_20b2.html" title="Constitution of Canada">Canadian Constitution</a> from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and add to it a Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Davis's role in the constitutional negotiations of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> were pivotal in achieving a compromise that resulted in the passage of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> Constitution.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, while Davis played a role in the successful negotiations to merge the federal Progressive Conservatives with the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Canadian Alliance</a> to create the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_de3b.html" title="Conservative Party of Canada">Conservative Party of Canada</a>, Clark refused to endorse the newly merged party.</p>

He also announced that Ontario would purchase a 25% share in the energy corporation <a href="../../../s/u/n/Suncor.html" title="Suncor">Suncor</a>, despite opposition from within his own caucus.</p>
<p>Davis considered moving to federal politics by running to lead the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Conservative_Party_of_Canada_d0d3.html" title="Progressive Conservative Party of Canada">federal Progressive Conservatives</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> when Joe Clark only received lukewarm support during a leadership review. Davis decided not to do so when he realized that he would not receive endorsements from western Canada because of his support for the Constitution patriation and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Energy_Program_7e10.html" title="National Energy Program">National Energy Program</a>. His candidacy had been strongly opposed by <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Lougheed_f179.html" title="Peter Lougheed">Peter Lougheed</a>, the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premier_of_Alberta_efd3.html" title="Premier of Alberta">Premier of Alberta</a>.</p>
<p>He retired a few months before the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1985.html" title="Ontario general election, 1985">1985 election</a>, with him and his government still well ahead in polls against <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Peterson_24eb.html" title="David Peterson">David Peterson</a>'s Liberals and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Rae_f137.html" title="Bob Rae">Bob Rae</a>'s NDP. One of his last major acts as premier was to reverse his 1971 decision against the full funding of Catholic schools, and announce that such funding would be provided to the end of Grade Thirteen. Although the policy was supported by all parties in the legislature, it was unpopular with some in the Conservatives' traditional rural <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> base, and many would stay home in the upcoming election because of this issue.</p>

<p>Davis was succeeded by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Miller_%28premier_of_Ontario%29_5f16.html" title="Frank Miller (premier of Ontario)">Frank Miller</a>, who was elected leader at a February <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Progressive_Conservative_leadership_conventions%2C_1985_6e25.html" title="Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership conventions, 1985">1985 leadership convention</a> over <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Grossman_6bda.html" title="Larry Grossman">Larry Grossman</a>, who was widely considered the successor to Davis and his <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Blue_Machine_60eb.html" title="Big Blue Machine">Big Blue Machine</a>. Although Miller was more conservative, the Progressive Conservatives still held a significant lead over the opposition when the election was called. However, after a poor campaign, they were reduced to minority government and lost the popular vote to the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Liberal_Party_2013.html" title="Ontario Liberal Party">Ontario Liberal Party</a> in the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_general_election%2C_1985.html" title="Ontario general election, 1985">1985 provincial election</a> and were soon defeated by a motion of non-confidence by a Liberal-NDP accord, ending the party's 42 year period of rule over the province.</p>
<p>Davis was made a Companion of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Canada_843d.html" title="Order of Canada">Order of Canada</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, and has served on numerous corporate boards since his retirement from politics.</p>
<p>Davis's reputation within the Ontario Progressive Conservatives was compromised during the 1990s by the party's shift to the right under <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Harris_6536.html" title="Mike Harris">Mike Harris</a>. Many Conservatives parliamentarians were openly dismissive of Davis-era spending policies, and frequently highlighted the differences between Davis and Harris on policy issues. Davis remained a supporter of the party, but seldom appeared at official events. In a National Post editorial, on the tenth anniversary of Harris' 1995 electoral victory, Harris' chief of staff described the difference in their policies, saying that Davis retained power with a careful balancing act, while Harris used a bold platform to unexpectedly catapult the party from third place to first.</p>
<p>More recently, Davis has returned to an honoured position within the party. He was a keynote speaker at the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Progressive_Conservative_leadership_election%2C_2004_72f0.html" title="Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2004">2004 Progressive Conservative leadership convention</a>, and was singled out for praise in speeches by outgoing party leader <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernie_Eves_63ba.html" title="Ernie Eves">Ernie Eves</a> and new leader <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Tory_2b5f.html" title="John Tory">John Tory</a>. Davis was also present for Tory's first session in the Ontario legislature, following the latter's victory in a 2005 <a href="../../../b/y/-/By-election.html" title="By-election">by-election</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Davis played a role in the successful negotiations to merge the federal Progressive Conservatives with the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Alliance_ea7c.html" title="Canadian Alliance">Canadian Alliance</a>, and create the new <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_of_Canada_de3b.html" title="Conservative Party of Canada">Conservative Party of Canada</a>. In the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006.html" title="Canadian federal election, 2006">2006 federal campaign</a>, he campaigned for Conservative Leader <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Harper_d9dd.html" title="Stephen Harper">Stephen Harper</a> and endorsed former provincial minister <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Flaherty_177e.html" title="Jim Flaherty">Jim Flaherty</a>. Harper spoke favourably of Davis during the campaign, and said that he learned much from Davis's style of governing.</p>
<p>Throughout his political career, Davis often remarked upon the lasting influence of his hometown of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brampton%2C_Ontario_aa5d.html" title="Brampton, Ontario">Brampton, Ontario</a>. He is known, primarily by Bramptonians, as "Brampton Billy".</p>
<p>On October 24, 2006, Davis received <a href="../../../s/e/n/Seneca_College_1edb.html" title="Seneca College">Seneca College</a>’s first Honorary degree where he was presented with an Honorary Bachelor of Applied Studies. “It is fitting that Bill Davis receives Seneca’s first honorary degree,” says Dr. Rick Miner, President of Seneca College. “As one of the architects of the college system in Ontario, he is responsible for a dynamic post-secondary education environment which continues to be a pillar of our province’s economy.” Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>-<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_24.html" title="October 24">10-24</a>). <i><a href="http://www.senecac.on.ca/cms/media/newsdetail.jsp?mediaID=75" class="external text" title="http://www.senecac.on.ca/cms/media/newsdetail.jsp?mediaID=75" rel="nofollow">Canada’s largest college confers first honorary degree to Bill Davis</a></i>. <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_release.html" title="News release">Press release</a>.
