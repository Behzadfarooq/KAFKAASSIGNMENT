<li>The mugshot is not necessary and absolutely counterproductive. I am not being biased at all, but because we are not talking about a convicted felon or some criminal mastermind here, we do not need this kind of picture.

<li>Billy Joe's arrest for drunk driving was a pretty big deal and certainly more interesting/newsworthy than a lot of the trivia included in this article - as far as i'm aware the picture wasn't included in the article at all there was just a link to mugshot in the external links section - which seems thoroughly reasonable to me, in fact it would seem reasonable to mention the arrest in the article as well. Marilyn Manson, Tim Allen and so on all have links to their mugshots after their arrests in their articles - it's a perfectly reasonable piece of information and warrants inclusion. Just to clarify i'm not the person who added it, I just remember seeing it in the article before. <b>Arbiteroftruth</b> says we aren't talking about a convicted felon but I believe he was convicted of the drunk driving incident so technically we are. I also don't understand how its inclusion could possibly be 'counterproductive' unless the goal of this article is to make Billy look good rather than to offer information on the subject.81.157.212.141 00:51, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I completely agree with the above poster. The fact that he was arrested for drunk driving (and he was more than twice over the legal limit) is far more of a significant piece of information about the man than the exact length of his wedding (mentioned twice in this article) or that his father was a minor-league baseball pitcher. There is plenty of uncited trivia in the article as well as those two examples, his arrest for drunk driving was a well documented and very notable event. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagicBez_3b3e.html" title="User:MagicBez">MagicBez</a> 00:14, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well, I don't care what Billie Joe is. He is a great guy and a true musician. I think that it doesn't matter what he is. He is just a good person.</p>
<p>the article (1) says nothing about Billie being bisexual! it implicitly states he has nothing against it, but at the same time he did not engage in any ... erm ... you know, with a guy.</p>
<p>so I wanna remove Billie from the famous gay people list. what do you say? -<b>unsigned</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe you missed it since it's the last line of the article and vandals keep taking it out. The last line says that he has said that he considers himself to be bisexual. So the category of bisexual people fits, if you ask me. <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:23, 25 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>If you can't spell Billie Joe's name correctly, you don't get to add info about him as you are obviously an idiot. I can't believe I just went through here and had to edit that three times! Also, yes, he has had experiences with men, I heard him say it with my own ears, on Live 105 in San Francisco at least five years ago, when they still had the Johnny Steele show in the morning. And this is from the 1995 interview with The Advocate, look it up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"For Armstrong, who grew up with band member Dirnt in a suburb of Berkeley called Rodeo, homosexuality is neither a new subject nor one he must defend himself against. “I think I’ve always been bisexual,” Armstrong says simply. “I mean, it’s something that I’ve always been interested in. I think everybody kind of fantasizes about the same sex. I think people are born bisexual, and it’s just that our parents and society kind of veer us off into this feeling of Oh, I can’t. They say it’s taboo. It’s ingrained in our heads that it’s bad, when it’s not bad at all. It’s a very beautiful thing.”</i> When asked whether this beautiful thing is something he’s ever actually acted on, the recently married (and about to become a father) Armstrong smiles. “I think mostly it’s been kept in my head,” he says. “I’ve never really had a relationship with another man. But it is something that comes up as a struggle in me. It especially came up when I was about 16 or 17. In high school people think you have to be so macho. People get attacked just because someone insinuates something about their sexuality. I think that’s gruesome.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-<b>unsigned</b></p>
<p><br />
Man... what is it with people and denying Billie's sexuality because he married a woman? Adrienne is AMAZING to say the least, even a blind gay man would want her. She just radiates beauty inside and out. Billie is bisexual, and I take offense to anyone denying it just because he's settled down with someone. You can't settle down with one of each as a bisexual. If he'd married a man, you'd all call him gay even though he's bisexual. That's just the way it seems to work. Good work on the above for posting the advocate article. -<b>unsigned</b></p>
<p><br />
This is what I got out of the article: Billie just supports gays and has absolutley nothing against them. He considered himself bisexual only because he felt that homosexuality touched his life in many personal ways. [his uncle was gay and his girlfriend was bisexual.] i think that he is more heterosexual then he is bisexual. He even admitted that he never loved any man nor did he date one. Billie Joe Armstrong is considered bisexual only because he stands up for gays;not because he has the same liking for both men and women. I believe that to properly adress this I think you should put Billie under heterosexuals but recognize him for his beliefs by explaining that he said he was bisexual because he feels that homosexuals should not be mistreated. I think that he was just merely confused when he was interviewed. -<b>unsigned</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Except, he says he's bi and he's bi in his head which means he thinks guys are hot and he says it's been an issue for him, deciding. He's said it on MTV, VH1, in rock magazines as well as the Advocate. He's a bisexual because he says he is. I think he would know, even if he has never done anything with a guy, I see no reason not to believe him. <a href="../../../z/y/t/User%7EZythe_56f0.html" title="User:Zythe">Zythe</a> 14:58, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<p><i>"I think that he was just merely confused when he was interviewed."</i> Fortunately, it's not up to you. It's up to him. If he says he is, you can't just say he's confused. That's offensive, and stupid of you.</p>
<p>The fact is, he says he is, and he feels he is, therefore we trust that he is. Give up already. If you're just upset that your punk frontman's gay I suggest you get personal help and stop harrassing wiki to change crap to make you more comfortable. -<b>unsigned</b></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If Billie Joe Armstrong has stated that he is <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bisexuality.html" title="Bisexuality">bisexual</a>, then I'm 100% positive that he knows what he is talking about. All of you have to realize that you are edit warring over something silly; you can't decide whether he is or is not bisexual, because that's not up to you. It's up to him. If he has stated it and has said that he's had trouble "deciding", then the facts are clear as day. I am a big fan of Green Day myself, but I don't argue over whether Armstrong is heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual all day. I could really care less actually, considering that my life (or anyone else's life) isn't going to influence him. That's his decision, and you know it. If he thinks males are hot, then that's great! We should be supporting him, and that's what I've just accomplished! —Hollow Wilerding . . .

<p>This is all getting rather silly. I don't know if he's vegetarian or not but the article had conflicting sentences in it today.

<p>you're confusing me, billie joe armstrong, himself says none of the members are vegetarian, in person on camera, but you're saying he lied?</p>

<dd>No I'm not saying he is (or is not) a vegetarian, nor am I saying that he lied. Originally the sentence said:</dd>

<dd>"Billie is not a vegetarian, contrary to popular belief. In an interview for the Idiot Club on Green Day's website, he answered a question from a fan stating that he wasn't a vegetarian. None of the members of Green Day are vegetarians."</dd>

<dd>I was trying to figure out if he was, or was not a vegetarian. I couldn't so I removed the contradiction and put it on the talk page.

Of course we all know that just because you support someone doesn't mean you are a member of their party, but sometimes party politics and <i>partisanship</i> get the best of us, and that's okay.

<p>Bj has been in heaps of bands such as -sweet children -pinhead gunpowder -Blatz -Rancid -Goodbye harry -the corrupted morals is there any more that he has been in?</p>
<p>billie joe was not in the band "the lookouts" that was trè before he went into green day. soon after trè became a drummer for green day, the lookouts became a record lable, i think...</p>
<p>Hes in a new wave band called the Network, they're a great band, check em' out and he has played bass live with the influents.</p>
<p>actually, no one knows if the members of Green Day are in the band the Network. it seems like it, but they keep denying it. just though you might want to know that. --Greendayrox 20:13, 1 July 2006 (UTC) i know it is not one of the bands he has been in, but there was no edit section for equipment. i just thought you should know that gibson now makes a signature model of his les paul jr. guitar.</p>
<p>Billie Joe was also in a band called Condom.</p>
<p>Lookout! records was around when the band The Lookouts were together.</p>

<p>You guys, it really doesn't matter what religion, sexuality, etc. etc., he is. He's a great musician and an interesting guy, but we don't need to psychoanalyze his personal life. So instead of doing long complex posts about it (and getting way too excited), why don't you just leave him alone and do something more productive with your time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Precisely. Aren't there fansites for obsessing about that kind of thing? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristy747_70ef.html" title="User:Christy747"><b><font color="green">Christy747</font></b></a> 19:06, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>So totally! I'm glad you agree. 70.162.37.27</p>
<p>Of course there are fan sites devoted to Billie Joe psychoanalysis, and you are right, Wikipedia isn't a fan site, it is a collaborative encyclopaedia, which should contain little or no speculation at all. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">Talk!</a></sup> 21:49, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, if it's an online encyclopedia we really don't need any information on his personal life. If that's what people want they should just follow the links to the fan sites. But for anyone who just wants to find out who he is, some of the stuff up there is totally inappropriate. 70.162.37.27</p>
<dl>
<dd>Care to give us an example? His quote regarding his sexual preference is not inappropriate at all, as it is information about Billie Joe himself. Your own opinions guiding you to removing that section, however, is biased. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">Talk!</a></sup> 23:39, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That is a good point. However, I do believe that that is personal information that isn't neccessary on an online encylopedia. Billie Joe has also said several other things about himself that aren't (and shouldn't be) included here. They have their own appropriate place to be written. For Wikipedia's purpose, I don't believe it is pertinent. I also don't believe anything about his religion is pertinent. You can call me biased, but I just don't think certain things should be up there. Also, why should we have things about certain people's sexuality? Why should it matter? If we have it for some people then why don't we have it for everyone? 70.162.37.27</p>
<p>You are good at arguing your point, because you really made me think about it. You know, I think the main objection I have with some of the content is that it's totally irrelevant. I not only think the bisexual comment should be taken out, but also the whole Trivia section. I mean, come on. Trivia? We sound like Imdb! Encyclopedia's shouldn't have Trivia! The only information that we technically need is a small bio and things regarding his music, such as the section about his guitars. In my opinion, anything else is excess. If people really WANT more information then they can go to the fansites. That's my opinion, and I don't know if anyone else agrees or not, but thank you for letting me share it. 70.162.37.27</p>
<dl>
<dd>You do bring up a good point about the Trivia. I, actually, am the person who created the trivia section in the first place, since there was a rather random fact that was stuck in the middle of the paragraph. It has grown since then, but I suppose some of it mught just be fan information. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">Talk!</a></sup> 16:27, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry. I didn't mean to sound rude. Yes, when you have random facts stuck in, a Trivia section is a good answer to that, but now all it is is fan information, and that definitely isn't necessary. 70.162.37.27</p>
<p>Just something that ought to be said-- I've gone onto lots of pages for musicians, and they're all smaller than Billie Joe's page. The pages for the members of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Ferdinand_%28band%29_d84f.html" title="Franz Ferdinand (band)">Franz Ferdinand</a> for instance.

<p>Do you have any tips from your own experience on the edit summary? 70.162.37.27</p>

<dd>Sure thing. If you're planning on removing an entire section, make sure you can explain it well. If it's too long an explanation, don't hesitate to say "See talk page for more details". If somebody disagrees, they can easily leave a message on the talk page, and discussion can continue there. Also remember to keep your cool.

<p>"Bille Joe has a rich heritage with numerous nationalities on both his paternal and maternal side. His father is of Italian descent and his mother is of mixed Scottish/Irish, Dutch and Cherokee descent."</p>
<p>Something like that, although the first sentence is rubbish. I've put Scottish and Irish together but they are both Celtic nations and, being part of the British Isles, there has been a lot of intermingling between the two (before the union of Britain some Irish clans left and went to Scotland to fight against the English). Anyway, I've been a Green Day fan for the past fifteen years, but I must admit that I know (or have forgotton) much of Billie's family history. Doesn't he take "Armstrong" from his father's side. If so, Armstrong is a clan from the English/Scottish border. He may take Armstrong from his mother, I don't know. But it's certainly not a very Italian name. Where does his father's Italian blood come from? I think he does have Italian blood somewhere, but I don't know where. Is all of this really true anyway? I think it should be investigated before it's put up in the article. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedpeguyuk_4f20.html" title="User:Hedpeguyuk">hedpeguyuk</a> 18:25, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What value is it anyway? Human beings mingle, races converge. If you were to trace my family history you would find Irish/Scottish/English, German/Austrian, Hungarian, French and Scandanavian (Vikings!). There will be a lot of other nationalities also somewhere. Unless his immediate family were recent immigrants, what relevance does it have? Oh, I didn't see the English bit by his father, that may explain the Armstrong but my point still remains that it should really matter. Europeans and Americans are all mongrels (in a nice way). <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedpeguyuk_4f20.html" title="User:Hedpeguyuk">hedpeguyuk</a> 18:35 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think BJ was taking the michael when he claimed the reason for being called "Billie" rather than "Billy" was that his mother was high on painkillers. He was actually born William..I've also removed the bit about him "sacking"/"replacing" their former drummer. I've spoken to a number of people at Lookout and they maintain John left to pursue his studies. Billie was aware of the situation.

<dd>I agree. The sexuality section... I couldn't even figure out who was saying what. I tried to clear some stuff up, but I couldn't. If someone else could, that would be great.

<dd>that's a really good question, thanks for contributing. I don't have any resources to hand you, but the way I seem to remember it is he just switched because he wanted to, but I'm willing to bet his mother thought it might help him to improve his academic performance. It is fact, however, that he did not get kicked out of either school. He cleared that up in the question and answer on the Idiot Club.--<a href="../../../o/n/a/User%7EOnathinwhiteline_3a35.html" title="User:Onathinwhiteline">Jude</a> 01:35, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Tradition" of kissing?</span></h2>
<p>The "tradition" of kissing a man at "every" concert is clearly a violation of the "always" and "never" rule of common sense. He <i>hasn't</i> kissed a guy at <i>every</i> concert he's ever done. He <i>has</i> kissed a guy at <i>several</i> concerts, however. I'm rewording this statement and I'm working on providing video and photo evidence, because it is true that he has kissed men at concerts, however not "every" one of them.--<a href="../../../o/n/a/User%7EOnathinwhiteline_3a35.html" title="User:Onathinwhiteline">Jude</a> 14:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I reworded the content and cited four sources. The photos were uploaded to tinypic.com and the youtube video was the first content in the search for "Billie Joe kissing."

<h2><span class="mw-headline">IMDb</span></h2>
<p>I don't think that using the IMDb "biography" link is a credible source for information. It's used in the trivia section about "Jason Mewes" and while it might be completely true, it's like linking another wikipedia article as a source. The Biographies on IMDb can be edited by users.</p>
<p>For example, the biography says: <i>"Billie Joe formed a very strong relationship with his father, who, at the age of ten, gave him his very first electric guitar - blue - which he still uses to this day, imaginatively named thus because of its pale blue colour."</i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0035626/bio" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0035626/bio" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Which we know isn't true.

<p>actually i believe if you research it the basket case video was filmed in black and white then later colored to give it a successfully surreal look</p>

<dd>That's very true, and I'm sorry if you read my reply wrong. I didn't give a full history of how the colour was enhanced, I just stated that it was. I could have been more informative, however I didn't see it necessary. When I said everything was enriched, I meant to the viewers' eyes, not that it had been enriched from its natural colour.

<dd>Because they are THAT green. You can see in bullet in a bible that he is *not* wearing contacts because of how close Sam Bayer gets to his face with the camera.
