<p>Sir, it’s an honor that you are contributing to wiki as I’ve found your great website far above and beyond enlightening on many occasions. It’s really a priceless research-tool. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">GeneralPatton</a> 16:54, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>BTW, there are dozens of copies of WP content, with varying degrees of GFDL compliance - we have a list of them somewhere in the "Wikipedia:" pages, but I can't find it right now. Anyway, we just maintain the list of them, no need to note in articles that they've been mirrored all over the place (it's a feature, not a bug&#160;:-) ). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 02:32, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Bill, Please note that i have now spent many, many hours compiling a selection of books in Sir T.B.'s library using the facsimile of 1986 E.J.Brill publications edited by J.S Finch. If there are any incorrect titles it is from those who listed the library contents in 1711 for auction. Also i really am not sure whether the usage of speech-marks to highlight titles makes the page actually look any better just simply more cluttered. Yes by all means be bold in editing pages but also please be aware that some pages have taken other wikis many many hours to compile! Also it is with some irratation i have noted that you have now made titles of Latin books indistinguishable from those written in English through your editing i shall revert this . Please consult me before any more 'helpful' editing . Regards <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorwikian_2eda.html" title="User:Norwikian">Norwikian</a> 10:32, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the Library, no question you've done a stellar job digging up the actual information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First item, I caught it before I read you, and have now reverted it, sorry: you're absolutely right, I didn't understand Wiki style conventions, and should not have changed double-apostrophes to single-quotes!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am, as you realize, no Browne scholar (although I've at least read him all, some of him repeatedly, probably my favorite English book is Garden of Cyrus/Hydriotaphia). I come at this page as someone with an interest parallel to Browne's, in many of the same texts: I've input online -- hand-typed, not scanned -- 6 of the ancient texts mentioned; and others not mentioned but which he must certainly have had, like Plutarch, Aelian, Cato, Frontinus, Vitruvius.</dd>

<dd>As for the actual content of this page, I didn't realize the typos and manifest errors were copied verbatim, but the reproduction of uncorrected errors is germane not to "Library of Sir TB" but to "1711 Catalogue etc." If the article were the latter, we would have to revert them right away and I'd feel very stupid for having edited them. But our concern here is with elucidating what Sir Thomas read, so there can be no harm in correcting accidental nonsense words due either to reading errors -- e.g., "Differtatio" (clearly long esses); or to uncorrected scanning -- e.g., "Sidereus Nuricius"; or to typos of unknown origin -- e.g., "Umbrare". Disabbreviating some of these titles would probably be useful for the audience this page is likely to reach, but there, I've been very cautious</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are still a pile of minor errors, and I've snagged a few more that I could clear up without reference to the original. But for example I've passed on the flexible spellings of 16c-17c French which might allow certain items, then maybe not; for example, most French words that would have an accent today, I've left unaccented, because accents were newish then and the actual books very likely had unaccented titles, although again maybe not. Despite being half-French, French-educated, and with many years experience as a French translator, I still haven't managed to figure out "naises traits" -- the closest reasonable emendation I can come up with "autres traits" but have failed to convince myself. Other cruxlets, in the matter of which I've been very cautious and changed nothing of course, include:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"de Cive", which is not Latin nor any reasonable abbreviation;</li>
<li>"Serpent and Draconum historica", where "Serpent(ium) &amp; Draconum historia" looks probable;</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Much more probable, but I've also been cautious and done nothing:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Questions in Genesis"; the work was published in 1623 alright, as "Quaestiones in Genesim"; was there an English translation that fast with our title? It seems very unlikely to me. (In general, if we want to get to the actual titles of the books -- fair nuff -- quite a few others ought to be changed: Plautus' Comedies, Martin Luther, etc. Right now at any rate we have an inconsistent list, opting partly for the original titles, partly for modern English translations.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I removed the link to Philology by the way because in the work by Martianus Capella the allegory of Philologia has very little to do with what we now call philology.</dd>

<p>Many thanks Bill for reverting your edit. It looks as if you have the knowledge to contribute a great deal here. You have certaintly made some good points about titles, on the whole i am simply checking whether the title existed or not before placing it. I shall consider carefully your other points. Yes translations from Latin to English to Latin were extremely quick in 17th c. As Sir T.b. wittily remarks in the intro to Pseudodoxia <i>And indeed , if elegancy still proceedeth, and English Pens maintain that stream we have of late observed to flow from many, we shall within few years be fain to learn Latine to understand English, and a work will prove of equal facility in either</i> .

<dd>Got a kick out of your <i>Bishonen</i>/<i>Lucus a non lucendo</i> connection...! The correct Latin is 2&#160;M's, no doubt about it (as in Koptev's page, the line above the quoted title). <i>But</i> if the title page of the actual edition has one&#160;M, then, for the purposes of referring to that edition, my edit would have to be reverted. Alex Koptev is approachable, speaks English and answers his e-mail, write him!

<p>Hi, Bill. I'm glad to hear that I didn't insult you at all, I guess you're just a good-natured person at heart. The Internet, though marvelous, is somewhat lacking in the respect that it cannot convey aspects of communication that we often take for granted: mood, tone, or body language, etc. I've found that because of this lack of entire layers of "normal" communication, people sometimes fill in the blanks in ways that are unintended. When I re-read what I had written, I cringed at how some people may have read it. Again, I'm glad you didn't.</p>

<p>I speedy-deleted Noj, whose content was simply ""See Italic text'Oxenfez'". You re-created it as a redirect to Oxenfez. Although that would seem to have been the original author's intent, "Noj" isn't a word and only appears by accident in the Oxenfez article. Why did you re-create the deleted page?

<dl>
<dd>Because the Oxenfez article specifically says that Noj is another name for Oxenfez, and the original author's intent in <i>his</i> Noj page was to redirect to Oxenfez (in an unWeblike way, the way one does in a print work). It's exactly similar to redirecting <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scriptores_Historiae_Augustae_2486.html" title="Scriptores Historiae Augustae">Scriptores Historiae Augustae</a> to <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historia_Augusta_13dd.html" title="Historia Augusta">Historia Augusta</a>. So if Oxenfez is a valid name — which I still doubt, and see the Lincolnshire residents who weighed in on it — maybe Noj is too. Well-intended and logical on my part, at any rate.

<p>I see you're making "sharper cats" for a lot of things, however it's not so helpful to create those tiny little one-member categories - it reduces the usefulness of categories for grouping similar articles. Also, some people have a habit of emptying and deleting very small categories, so you're risking having somebody else come along and undo your work. Creating a category because you think it might become large eventually doesn't work, because it might be years before it picks up sufficient articles. My general rule is to leave articles in bigger categories until there are at least 10 or so articles to be the "seed" for the new category. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 15:26, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Was wondering who'd be the first to comment.... Depthwise vs. breadthwise, the old question! Seriously, I&#160;find the large categories drowning in loosely categorized articles (<a href="../../../i/t/a/Category%7EItalian_people_5417.html" title="Category:Italian people">Category:Italian people</a> is my focus), and very, very many people and places either uncategorized or populating "X-ian people"/"Country X". I&#160;do agree to some extent that some few categories I&#160;made are not the most useful in the sense of having only 1 or 2 members right this minute; the source of it is that I create or navigate to a Category, say <a href="../../../i/t/a/Category%7EItalian_painters_d671.html" title="Category:Italian painters">Category:Italian painters</a>, and find <a href="../../../p/a/i/Category%7EPainters_098d.html" title="Category:Painters">Category:Painters</a> has either no subcats or lots and lots of national subcats — because they're easy to mark — and few on such things as by style/period, by medium, etc. What I&#160;feel I'm doing is clearing out the brush. The eventual aim for Categories, I&#160;expect the computer whizzes behind the architecture here will wind up doing it, is smooth Java crumbs, where, from a main Category, instead of navigating thru layers of cat pages, you'll run your cursor over the category, a silent menu will drop down, with submenus, etc., and in one operation you'll navigate to 20c Provençal painters or whatever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The competition is Lists, which I&#160;view as worthless.... Why list items with no articles? So I'm starting from the bottom and tying it all together; mindful of the nonsense of having single-article or single-subcat categories, I'm scouring for the nearest item that comes to mind that will make the 2d or 3d (and if on my way I see that a page of a dozen items can be reduced to 1 or 2, so much the better, even if it means I&#160;get distracted); then back to Italy. — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 15:55, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that there's no way to know when this future software will be written; none of the developers I know of is working on anything like that. I'm sure you've seen half-constructed and abandoned infrastructure all over WP; small categories, or categories constructed for orthogonality, are kind of like that, where you're hoping that something will happen, but without any assurance. It's so unpredictable as to what will get attention from one day to the next, I tend to prefer doing things in a way that looks right today. Now lists are a bit of an anticipation; for instance <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_battleships_of_the_United_States_Navy_a246.html" title="List of battleships of the United States Navy">list of battleships of the United States Navy</a> listed all such ships when it was created, but there were many red links, and we painstakingly filled them all in. Another thing that I've done with lists is to find orphans; <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_garden_plants.html" title="List of garden plants">list of garden plants</a> found a bunch of forgotten articles for instance, plus it's also 100% or nearly so, so you can see how much is done and how much remains. Similarly, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ancient_Romans_23c9.html" title="List of ancient Romans">list of ancient Romans</a> is everything in OCD; when they're all filled in, we'll be ready to challenge P-W next... 1/2&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 13:29, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

But there can be no doubt after all that clearing the brush from "England", "English people",&#160;etc. will then allow useful subcats like Category:English people by counties, Category:English painters of the 17th century, and all those harder-to-categorize things like Tribes and Ethnology and Dialects, Currency.

<p>Hi, you explained me about categories for cities and counties, specifically for Hungary. I haven't really thought much about optimal categories, your suggestion about the counties of the Kingdom of Hungary is good. I think a category Category:Cities in Hungary over 100.000 would be pretty small (there's only 9). The present category Cities in Hungary contains all municipalities I think (Hungary isn't so big), which leaves Category:Towns in Hungary obsolete. I suggest we leave it like that, and remove Towns in Hungary. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 10:29, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good morning (or I&#160;think, afternoon?) — I&#160;admit immediately that I&#160;am no expert on Hungary, but it looks like we have 3&#160;different things going on here: (1) Cities; (2) the <i>comitatus</i> and/or <i>municipalities</i> (which look to me like a form of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commune.html" title="Commune">commune</a>??); (3) small towns and villages. From looking at your work, I&#160;get the impression that my "towns" corresponds, or ought to correspond, to places that are not municipalities, i.e., that are within them; of which there must surely be hundreds and hundreds. Granted right now they're not onsite in such vast numbers, but they will inevitably creep on: Wikipedia is not 4&#160;years old yet! || Also, a second concern: in other countries, the distinction is being made between the land units (provinces, counties) and the towns by the same name. It would be nice if, to the extent reasonable, the geographical units tree could be homogenized.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To sum up, I agree with you that Cities could be narrowed down to the 9&#160;biggies; I&#160;think there should be a Category:Comitatus of Hungary, which should probably include districts no longer in modern Hungary; that <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopron.html" title="Sopron">Sopron</a>, yes, should be removed to Category:Comitatus of Hungary; and that villages and towns not seats of a comitatus should be filed under Category:Towns of Sopron, a subcat of Comitatus.&#160;&#160;&#160;??? — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 12:05, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good afternoon. As you may have noticed I created a category <a href="../../../c/o/u/Category%7ECounties_in_the_Kingdom_of_Hungary_b6ab.html" title="Category:Counties in the Kingdom of Hungary">Category:Counties in the Kingdom of Hungary</a>, which contains all the counties/comitatuses of the former Kingdom of Hungary. A comitatus is a county, which is like a province, département or canton. <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopron.html" title="Sopron">Sopron</a> is Sopron-city, <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopron_%28county%29.html" title="Sopron (county)">Sopron (county)</a> is the former county. The 216 <i>cities</i> (or communes) that are listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Hungary_3f45.html" title="List of cities in Hungary">List of cities in Hungary</a> may be actual cities or villages, but since there's only 43 with an entry right now, I think that's a problem for the future. I suggest removing Towns... altogether. The difference between city and village is usually arbitrary and historical, for instance in the Netherlands the smallest city has about 400 inhabitants, and the largest village over 100.000. Would you suggest making categories for the cities/villages in every separate county? Maybe nice in the future. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 10:34, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right. After looking carefully, I&#160;do agree. And as you point out, even when the time comes — as you say, not yet — there is one problem: the difference between a "City"/"Village" historically/officially, and a neutral Wiki-geographical categorization by just plain size. In Italy, which is what I&#160;know about and work on mostly, fortunately they don't use the words "city", "village", etc., but "municipality" (<a href="../../../c/o/m/Comune.html" title="Comune">comune</a>), so it doesn't matter what we call a town/city, there is no confusion. Many comuni though are 400 people, some non-comuni are 20,000.... Metadata is not easy stuff. — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 13:40, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To finish off our little discussion here: I noticed that there is still a lot of confusion about categories for cities, towns and villages. For instance, according to the categories: Denmark has only towns, Hungary has a lot of cities and a few towns, the Netherlands have a lot of cities, 3 towns and a lot of municipalities. Do you know whether a decision has been reached about this somewhere? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 16:50, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I&#160;haven't; I've been pretty much out of the loop. The "town" vs "city" question has been made intractable, in my opinion, by nominalists battening on what is called a Town and what is called a City (whatever that means once one starts translating from other languages, which, as a professional translator, I'm of course acutely aware of). The original idea, that I&#160;was happy to work with and expand, was to differentiate smaller places from larger, in Italy for example <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> from <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treia.html" title="Treia">Treia</a>; the latter, however, though 1000 times fewer inhabitants than the former, was granted a patent of Città by a pope, so bingo! if nominalism has its sway, and there is a wave of it, with all the concomitant nonsensical results, there is nothing to be done. So — I've just pulled out of the whole thing altogether.... Best, <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 18:18, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also noticed this in wine regions. I would rather you didnt do it there at the moment, because as wine is expanded (it was in a sorry state), I am adding articles in some places such as <a href="../../../a/l/s/Alsace_wine.html" title="Alsace wine">Alsace wine</a> rather than putting under <a href="../../../a/l/s/Alsace.html" title="Alsace">Alsace</a> so it will have to be changed. Also very few places are listed as wine regions so far. Also a few are cross border (eg Moselle in France and Luxembourg), though they could be listed as both. And the German wine regions are a mess because of different naming. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinc_436a.html" title="User:Justinc">Justinc</a> 13:43, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the thumbsup, the project is really worth the effort. As you probably know it's going to be huge since the Polish (and Lithuanian for that matter) heraldic system is fairly complicated and at times up to 12% of people had their CoA here in Poland, so there's really lot of separate coats of arms (as opposed to Western Europe that bases its heraldic system mostly on joining several coats of arms into one or variations of the same CoA). Anyway, I'm starting right away.

<dd>Thanks for the corrections at <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labedz_Coat_of_Arms_9635.html" title="Labedz Coat of Arms">Łabędź Coat of Arms</a>. As you might know the Polish heraldic traditions are quite different and I'm still learning the Western blazon system. In Poland and Lithuania usually the name of the coat of arms (or the battle cry) is usually enough since the emblems were rarely divided and by "Łabędź" everyone understood that the bird is Argent, the beckground Gules and so on. Thanks again.

<p>Łabędź is interesting heraldically as a pure example of a class of arms that in England at least are called "punning arms", since Łabędź means "swan" , doesn't it? (I&#160;speak no Polish, but some Russian, and the word in Russian is лебедь.) Anyway, there is no article punning arms, but I'm collecting examples.... By the way in French heraldry, the more famous arms are occasionally referred to in other blazons by a similar shorthand: one speaks for example of "semé de France" to mean a blue field with a fleurs-de-lys pattern, etc. — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 21:50, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your support. Increasingly, the deletionist lunatics here are running the asylum. As you can tell by reading some of their comments, wildly POV fact-free emotion-clouded judgements are pretty much the order of the day, and objectivity doesn't get much of a look-in. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 23:41, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! Over at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion</a>, we are trying to figure out what to do with the Slovak/Slovakian categories.

<p>Hi Bill - these are not useful. It breaks up the complete list of botanists at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Category%7EBotanists_5c1e.html" title="Category:Botanists">Category:Botanists</a>, thereby making pages much harder to find when one needs to know (a) if a particular botanist has a page, and (b) what the page is titled, when adding links at e.g. a plant named by that botanist. Botanists are also highly international in their work, and the their nationality is often completely irrelevant to the areas they worked in, making it hard to predict what their nationality might have been (e.g. <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siebold.html" title="Siebold">Siebold</a> worked mainly on <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> plants while based at a <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> mission, making it very hard to know that he can only be found listed at <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_botanists_8905.html" title="Category:German botanists">Category:German botanists</a>). I think these subcategories would be best deleted, or at the very least, any botanist listed at one of these subcategories <b>must</b> also be on the full list at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Category%7EBotanists_5c1e.html" title="Category:Botanists">Category:Botanists</a> - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 14:22, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Annoyingly, nominating an article for deletion is actually a three step process. Please follow the steps at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion</a>. Also, make sure to use the vfd2 and vfd3 tags listed there to enter your reason for deletion and place the page on the deletion log. That's how other people will be able to see the nomination even if they don't happen to go to the page in question. I've gone back through your edit history to format the entries you've already tagged and added them to the log. Thanks for helping to keep the place clean.</p>

<p>I'm well aware of all this, having spent a few months last year on Vfd Patrol; I didn't nominate the Lion page for deletion, just voted/made a suggestion; the original nominee should do their own laundry.

<p>Well, it does matter if there are two Kovalenkos. As it is a very common last name, that could very well be the case. Or would Wikipedia just put "Andrei Kovalenko" above "Dema Kovalenko" automatically since the title of his page comes before? In that case, I am wrong. --<a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryazan_bb4e.html" title="User:Dryazan">Dryazan</a> 14:10, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, in theory it would matter — but here we bump into a bug or a "feature" (depending on how you look at it) of the Wiki software. No matter what you put after "Kovalenko", within the Kovalenkos, if there were several of them, the pipe sort will alphabetize by the name of the article.... Nothing's perfect. But then, as I&#160;said, you do <i>no harm</i> by adding ", Dema" — and I&#160;do no harm by removing it. I'm not chasing your edits, by the way; the latest was an Italian and I&#160;do mostly Italian stuff on Wikipedia, because of my own website: the others I&#160;was editing people born in Kiev/Kyiv....

<p>Yes, "thru" is an acceptable if minority American spelling; rather than anglify spellings — newbies are warned about correcting "honour" or "honor" (either one), else with the many backgrounds of people, we'd never stop revert wars — wouldn't it be best to contribute some substance, if you can? <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 23:44, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Bill,</dd>
<dd>The official OED website (which I have access to through my university), says <i>thru: now used informally as a reformed spelling and abbreviation (chiefly) in N. Amer.</i></dd>
<dd>The New Oxford American English Dictionary 2nd edition (which ships with MacOS X 10.4) also says <i>thru: informal spelling of through.</i></dd>
<dd>I've been mostly focusing on 'spidering' through Wikipedia cleaning up random spelling, capitalisation, punctuation, and grammatical mistakes that I find. I've been told on #Wikipedia that this is regarded as a useful activity.</dd>
<dd>I've no interest in Anglicising/Americanizing the English on Wikipedia (except sometimes within individual articles to keep them internally consistent), but given the informal nature of 'thru', I thought it was fair game.</dd>

<dd>(Yeah, I&#160;get the OED thru the University of Chicago that hosts my website too: no argument there.) Anyhoo, one spelling or another, as long as they're OK, makes very little difference; I&#160;was sorta hoping to spur your well-attested energy into something a bit more useful.... Actual spelling mistakes of course is a different matter, although even there, quite honestly, most of the time I&#160;just leave them, since there is so much substantial stuff to do. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 00:29, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bill, several months ago you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ASCD&amp;diff=10844804&amp;oldid=6872075" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ASCD&amp;diff=10844804&amp;oldid=6872075" rel="nofollow">changed the SCD template</a> from</p>

<p>noting</p>

<p>"wrongfully" doesn't mean what the writer thought!</p>

<p>in the "edit history".</p>
<p>I wondered what you meant by that, since there's <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategorization_of_people_a8ff.html#Template:SCD" title="Wikipedia talk:Categorization of people">new talk about that template</a>.</p>
<p>Another question I've wanted to ask you for some time (only I didn't know it was so easy you being a wikipedian) regards an <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacitus.html#ref_mylasa" title="Tacitus">inscription about Tacitus found at Mylasa</a>: do you know of any source where an <i>image</i> or a <i>transcript</i> of that inscription might be found (i.e. on the web, preferably free of copyright)?</p>
<p>I ask you this since your LacusCurtius website (which I value very high!) shows you have some intrest in Roman inscriptions. The <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacitus.html#endnote_mylasa" title="Tacitus">first footnote on the Tacitus page</a> says "OGIS 437, first brought to light in Bulletin de correspondance hellénique, 1890, pp. 621–623." as a reference for that inscription. Well, I don't have access to these <i>paper</i> sources, or can they be found on the internet somewhere?</p>

<dd>"Wrongfully" was just a (glaring) misuse of English; it's someone's idea of "wrongly", because it sounds better.... Another very common example is "amphitheatre" where "theatre" is meant. "Wrongful" is in fact a legal term of very specialized application.
<dl>
<dd>Well, "incorrectly" was not what was intended by the template. I had first written "<b>unrightfully</b> labeling persons". Then a native English speaker (Seth, taking part in the "Categorization of people" discussion at the time) had changed to "wrongfully", saying that "unrightfully" was bad English. I have to rely on native English speakers here, which I am not. the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_of_people_2346.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization of people">Categorization of people guideline</a> does <i>not</i> advise to apply the SCD template when there are obvious material errors ("incorrectly"), but when wikipedia categorisation is not used in the most <i>appropriate</i> way. Do you think something like this would do better:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>This category may label persons inappropriately. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>It's about the meaning of "label" too, which I intended to use in the meaning of <i>racists inappropriately labeling jews</i>, not in the meaning of a secretary making an error and putting the wrong label on an incoming letter. So if there's any suggestion to have a better and less ambiguous word for "label", I'd lend my ear too.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 9 July 2005 11:40 (UTC)

<dd>"improperly", "inappropriately", or "wrongly" would all do, with various nuances of meaning. Yes, "incorrectly" is not what's meant, I&#160;see that now.

Jona Lendering <a href="http://www.livius.org/rome.html" class="external text" title="http://www.livius.org/rome.html" rel="nofollow">(Livius.Org)</a> hasn't written his Tacitus article yet, but may well have the full info or even a photograph, since that's his playing field, and he's probably been to Mylasa, altho there again I'm not seeing an article "Mylasa" on Livius yet.

<p>Dear Bill, Please note that i have now spent many, many hours compiling a selection of books in Sir T.B.'s library using the facsimile of 1986 E.J.Brill publications edited by J.S Finch. If there are any incorrect titles it is from those who listed the library contents in 1711 for auction. Also i really am not sure whether the usage of speech-marks to highlight titles makes the page actually look any better just simply more cluttered. Yes by all means be bold in editing pages but also please be aware that some pages have taken other wikis many many hours to compile! Also it is with some irratation i have noted that you have now made titles of Latin books indistinguishable from those written in English through your editing i shall revert this . Please consult me before any more 'helpful' editing . Regards <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorwikian_2eda.html" title="User:Norwikian">Norwikian</a> 10:32, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the Library, no question you've done a stellar job digging up the actual information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First item, I caught it before I read you, and have now reverted it, sorry: you're absolutely right, I didn't understand Wiki style conventions, and should not have changed double-apostrophes to single-quotes!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am, as you realize, no Browne scholar (although I've at least read him all, some of him repeatedly, probably my favorite English book is Garden of Cyrus/Hydriotaphia). I come at this page as someone with an interest parallel to Browne's, in many of the same texts: I've input online -- hand-typed, not scanned -- 6 of the ancient texts mentioned; and others not mentioned but which he must certainly have had, like Plutarch, Aelian, Cato, Frontinus, Vitruvius.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the actual content of this page, I didn't realize the typos and manifest errors were copied verbatim, but the reproduction of uncorrected errors is germane not to "Library of Sir TB" but to "1711 Catalogue etc." If the article were the latter, we would have to revert them right away and I'd feel very stupid for having edited them. But our concern here is with elucidating what Sir Thomas read, so there can be no harm in correcting accidental nonsense words due either to reading errors -- e.g., "Differtatio" (clearly long esses); or to uncorrected scanning -- e.g., "Sidereus Nuricius"; or to typos of unknown origin -- e.g., "Umbrare". Disabbreviating some of these titles would probably be useful for the audience this page is likely to reach, but there, I've been very cautious</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are still a pile of minor errors, and I've snagged a few more that I could clear up without reference to the original. But for example I've passed on the flexible spellings of 16c-17c French which might allow certain items, then maybe not; for example, most French words that would have an accent today, I've left unaccented, because accents were newish then and the actual books very likely had unaccented titles, although again maybe not. Despite being half-French, French-educated, and with many years experience as a French translator, I still haven't managed to figure out "naises traits" -- the closest reasonable emendation I can come up with "autres traits" but have failed to convince myself. Other cruxlets, in the matter of which I've been very cautious and changed nothing of course, include:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"de Cive", which is not Latin nor any reasonable abbreviation;</li>
<li>"Serpent and Draconum historica", where "Serpent(ium) &amp; Draconum historia" looks probable;</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Much more probable, but I've also been cautious and done nothing:</dd>

<li>"Questions in Genesis"; the work was published in 1623 alright, as "Quaestiones in Genesim"; was there an English translation that fast with our title? It seems very unlikely to me. (In general, if we want to get to the actual titles of the books -- fair nuff -- quite a few others ought to be changed: Plautus' Comedies, Martin Luther, etc. Right now at any rate we have an inconsistent list, opting partly for the original titles, partly for modern English translations.)</li>

<p>Many thanks Bill for reverting your edit. It looks as if you have the knowledge to contribute a great deal here. You have certaintly made some good points about titles, on the whole i am simply checking whether the title existed or not before placing it. I shall consider carefully your other points. Yes translations from Latin to English to Latin were extremely quick in 17th c. As Sir T.b. wittily remarks in the intro to Pseudodoxia <i>And indeed , if elegancy still proceedeth, and English Pens maintain that stream we have of late observed to flow from many, we shall within few years be fain to learn Latine to understand English, and a work will prove of equal facility in either</i> .

<p>Hi, Bill, I'm sure you know a lot more Latin than I do, so I'm delighted that you took a look at my <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucus_a_non_lucendo.html" title="Lucus a non lucendo">Lucus a non lucendo</a>, thanks very much.

I wonder a little about them getting it wrong in the <b>title</b>. Could it be an acceptable alternative spelling? What do you think, mm or m?

<dd>Got a kick out of your <i>Bishonen</i>/<i>Lucus a non lucendo</i> connection...! The correct Latin is 2&#160;M's, no doubt about it (as in Koptev's page, the line above the quoted title). <i>But</i> if the title page of the actual edition has one&#160;M, then, for the purposes of referring to that edition, my edit would have to be reverted. Alex Koptev is approachable, speaks English and answers his e-mail, write him!

<p>Hi, Bill. I'm glad to hear that I didn't insult you at all, I guess you're just a good-natured person at heart. The Internet, though marvelous, is somewhat lacking in the respect that it cannot convey aspects of communication that we often take for granted: mood, tone, or body language, etc. I've found that because of this lack of entire layers of "normal" communication, people sometimes fill in the blanks in ways that are unintended. When I re-read what I had written, I cringed at how some people may have read it. Again, I'm glad you didn't.</p>

<p>I speedy-deleted Noj, whose content was simply ""See Italic text'Oxenfez'". You re-created it as a redirect to Oxenfez. Although that would seem to have been the original author's intent, "Noj" isn't a word and only appears by accident in the Oxenfez article. Why did you re-create the deleted page?

<dd>Because the Oxenfez article specifically says that Noj is another name for Oxenfez, and the original author's intent in <i>his</i> Noj page was to redirect to Oxenfez (in an unWeblike way, the way one does in a print work). It's exactly similar to redirecting <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scriptores_Historiae_Augustae_2486.html" title="Scriptores Historiae Augustae">Scriptores Historiae Augustae</a> to <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historia_Augusta_13dd.html" title="Historia Augusta">Historia Augusta</a>. So if Oxenfez is a valid name — which I still doubt, and see the Lincolnshire residents who weighed in on it — maybe Noj is too. Well-intended and logical on my part, at any rate.

<p>I see you're making "sharper cats" for a lot of things, however it's not so helpful to create those tiny little one-member categories - it reduces the usefulness of categories for grouping similar articles. Also, some people have a habit of emptying and deleting very small categories, so you're risking having somebody else come along and undo your work. Creating a category because you think it might become large eventually doesn't work, because it might be years before it picks up sufficient articles. My general rule is to leave articles in bigger categories until there are at least 10 or so articles to be the "seed" for the new category. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 15:26, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Was wondering who'd be the first to comment.... Depthwise vs. breadthwise, the old question! Seriously, I&#160;find the large categories drowning in loosely categorized articles (<a href="../../../i/t/a/Category%7EItalian_people_5417.html" title="Category:Italian people">Category:Italian people</a> is my focus), and very, very many people and places either uncategorized or populating "X-ian people"/"Country X". I&#160;do agree to some extent that some few categories I&#160;made are not the most useful in the sense of having only 1 or 2 members right this minute; the source of it is that I create or navigate to a Category, say <a href="../../../i/t/a/Category%7EItalian_painters_d671.html" title="Category:Italian painters">Category:Italian painters</a>, and find <a href="../../../p/a/i/Category%7EPainters_098d.html" title="Category:Painters">Category:Painters</a> has either no subcats or lots and lots of national subcats — because they're easy to mark — and few on such things as by style/period, by medium, etc. What I&#160;feel I'm doing is clearing out the brush. The eventual aim for Categories, I&#160;expect the computer whizzes behind the architecture here will wind up doing it, is smooth Java crumbs, where, from a main Category, instead of navigating thru layers of cat pages, you'll run your cursor over the category, a silent menu will drop down, with submenus, etc., and in one operation you'll navigate to 20c Provençal painters or whatever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The competition is Lists, which I&#160;view as worthless.... Why list items with no articles? So I'm starting from the bottom and tying it all together; mindful of the nonsense of having single-article or single-subcat categories, I'm scouring for the nearest item that comes to mind that will make the 2d or 3d (and if on my way I see that a page of a dozen items can be reduced to 1 or 2, so much the better, even if it means I&#160;get distracted); then back to Italy. — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 15:55, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that there's no way to know when this future software will be written; none of the developers I know of is working on anything like that. I'm sure you've seen half-constructed and abandoned infrastructure all over WP; small categories, or categories constructed for orthogonality, are kind of like that, where you're hoping that something will happen, but without any assurance. It's so unpredictable as to what will get attention from one day to the next, I tend to prefer doing things in a way that looks right today. Now lists are a bit of an anticipation; for instance <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_battleships_of_the_United_States_Navy_a246.html" title="List of battleships of the United States Navy">list of battleships of the United States Navy</a> listed all such ships when it was created, but there were many red links, and we painstakingly filled them all in. Another thing that I've done with lists is to find orphans; <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_garden_plants.html" title="List of garden plants">list of garden plants</a> found a bunch of forgotten articles for instance, plus it's also 100% or nearly so, so you can see how much is done and how much remains. Similarly, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ancient_Romans_23c9.html" title="List of ancient Romans">list of ancient Romans</a> is everything in OCD; when they're all filled in, we'll be ready to challenge P-W next... 1/2&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 13:29, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

But there can be no doubt after all that clearing the brush from "England", "English people",&#160;etc. will then allow useful subcats like Category:English people by counties, Category:English painters of the 17th century, and all those harder-to-categorize things like Tribes and Ethnology and Dialects, Currency.

<p>Hi, you explained me about categories for cities and counties, specifically for Hungary. I haven't really thought much about optimal categories, your suggestion about the counties of the Kingdom of Hungary is good. I think a category Category:Cities in Hungary over 100.000 would be pretty small (there's only 9). The present category Cities in Hungary contains all municipalities I think (Hungary isn't so big), which leaves Category:Towns in Hungary obsolete. I suggest we leave it like that, and remove Towns in Hungary. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 10:29, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Good morning (or I&#160;think, afternoon?) — I&#160;admit immediately that I&#160;am no expert on Hungary, but it looks like we have 3&#160;different things going on here: (1) Cities; (2) the <i>comitatus</i> and/or <i>municipalities</i> (which look to me like a form of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commune.html" title="Commune">commune</a>??); (3) small towns and villages. From looking at your work, I&#160;get the impression that my "towns" corresponds, or ought to correspond, to places that are not municipalities, i.e., that are within them; of which there must surely be hundreds and hundreds. Granted right now they're not onsite in such vast numbers, but they will inevitably creep on: Wikipedia is not 4&#160;years old yet! || Also, a second concern: in other countries, the distinction is being made between the land units (provinces, counties) and the towns by the same name. It would be nice if, to the extent reasonable, the geographical units tree could be homogenized.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To sum up, I agree with you that Cities could be narrowed down to the 9&#160;biggies; I&#160;think there should be a Category:Comitatus of Hungary, which should probably include districts no longer in modern Hungary; that <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopron.html" title="Sopron">Sopron</a>, yes, should be removed to Category:Comitatus of Hungary; and that villages and towns not seats of a comitatus should be filed under Category:Towns of Sopron, a subcat of Comitatus.&#160;&#160;&#160;??? — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 12:05, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good afternoon. As you may have noticed I created a category <a href="../../../c/o/u/Category%7ECounties_in_the_Kingdom_of_Hungary_b6ab.html" title="Category:Counties in the Kingdom of Hungary">Category:Counties in the Kingdom of Hungary</a>, which contains all the counties/comitatuses of the former Kingdom of Hungary. A comitatus is a county, which is like a province, département or canton. <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopron.html" title="Sopron">Sopron</a> is Sopron-city, <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sopron_%28county%29.html" title="Sopron (county)">Sopron (county)</a> is the former county. The 216 <i>cities</i> (or communes) that are listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cities_in_Hungary_3f45.html" title="List of cities in Hungary">List of cities in Hungary</a> may be actual cities or villages, but since there's only 43 with an entry right now, I think that's a problem for the future. I suggest removing Towns... altogether. The difference between city and village is usually arbitrary and historical, for instance in the Netherlands the smallest city has about 400 inhabitants, and the largest village over 100.000. Would you suggest making categories for the cities/villages in every separate county? Maybe nice in the future. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 10:34, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're right. After looking carefully, I&#160;do agree. And as you point out, even when the time comes — as you say, not yet — there is one problem: the difference between a "City"/"Village" historically/officially, and a neutral Wiki-geographical categorization by just plain size. In Italy, which is what I&#160;know about and work on mostly, fortunately they don't use the words "city", "village", etc., but "municipality" (<a href="../../../c/o/m/Comune.html" title="Comune">comune</a>), so it doesn't matter what we call a town/city, there is no confusion. Many comuni though are 400 people, some non-comuni are 20,000....

<p>To finish off our little discussion here: I noticed that there is still a lot of confusion about categories for cities, towns and villages. For instance, according to the categories: Denmark has only towns, Hungary has a lot of cities and a few towns, the Netherlands have a lot of cities, 3 towns and a lot of municipalities. Do you know whether a decision has been reached about this somewhere? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkussep_658a.html" title="User:Markussep">Markussep</a> 16:50, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I&#160;haven't; I've been pretty much out of the loop. The "town" vs "city" question has been made intractable, in my opinion, by nominalists battening on what is called a Town and what is called a City (whatever that means once one starts translating from other languages, which, as a professional translator, I'm of course acutely aware of). The original idea, that I&#160;was happy to work with and expand, was to differentiate smaller places from larger, in Italy for example <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a> from <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treia.html" title="Treia">Treia</a>; the latter, however, though 1000 times fewer inhabitants than the former, was granted a patent of Città by a pope, so bingo! if nominalism has its sway, and there is a wave of it, with all the concomitant nonsensical results, there is nothing to be done. So — I've just pulled out of the whole thing altogether.... Best, <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 18:18, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I also noticed this in wine regions. I would rather you didnt do it there at the moment, because as wine is expanded (it was in a sorry state), I am adding articles in some places such as <a href="../../../a/l/s/Alsace_wine.html" title="Alsace wine">Alsace wine</a> rather than putting under <a href="../../../a/l/s/Alsace.html" title="Alsace">Alsace</a> so it will have to be changed. Also very few places are listed as wine regions so far. Also a few are cross border (eg Moselle in France and Luxembourg), though they could be listed as both. And the German wine regions are a mess because of different naming. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinc_436a.html" title="User:Justinc">Justinc</a> 13:43, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the thumbsup, the project is really worth the effort. As you probably know it's going to be huge since the Polish (and Lithuanian for that matter) heraldic system is fairly complicated and at times up to 12% of people had their CoA here in Poland, so there's really lot of separate coats of arms (as opposed to Western Europe that bases its heraldic system mostly on joining several coats of arms into one or variations of the same CoA). Anyway, I'm starting right away.

<dd>Thanks for the corrections at <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labedz_Coat_of_Arms_9635.html" title="Labedz Coat of Arms">Łabędź Coat of Arms</a>. As you might know the Polish heraldic traditions are quite different and I'm still learning the Western blazon system. In Poland and Lithuania usually the name of the coat of arms (or the battle cry) is usually enough since the emblems were rarely divided and by "Łabędź" everyone understood that the bird is Argent, the beckground Gules and so on. Thanks again.

<p>Łabędź is interesting heraldically as a pure example of a class of arms that in England at least are called "punning arms", since Łabędź means "swan" , doesn't it? (I&#160;speak no Polish, but some Russian, and the word in Russian is лебедь.) Anyway, there is no article punning arms, but I'm collecting examples.... By the way in French heraldry, the more famous arms are occasionally referred to in other blazons by a similar shorthand: one speaks for example of "semé de France" to mean a blue field with a fleurs-de-lys pattern, etc. — <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 21:50, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! Over at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion</a>, we are trying to figure out what to do with the Slovak/Slovakian categories.

<p>Since you created some of those categories, could you give us some input?

<p>Hi Bill - these are not useful. It breaks up the complete list of botanists at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Category%7EBotanists_5c1e.html" title="Category:Botanists">Category:Botanists</a>, thereby making pages much harder to find when one needs to know (a) if a particular botanist has a page, and (b) what the page is titled, when adding links at e.g. a plant named by that botanist. Botanists are also highly international in their work, and the their nationality is often completely irrelevant to the areas they worked in, making it hard to predict what their nationality might have been (e.g. <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siebold.html" title="Siebold">Siebold</a> worked mainly on <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> plants while based at a <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> mission, making it very hard to know that he can only be found listed at <a href="../../../g/e/r/Category%7EGerman_botanists_8905.html" title="Category:German botanists">Category:German botanists</a>). I think these subcategories would be best deleted, or at the very least, any botanist listed at one of these subcategories <b>must</b> also be on the full list at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Category%7EBotanists_5c1e.html" title="Category:Botanists">Category:Botanists</a> - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 14:22, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Annoyingly, nominating an article for deletion is actually a three step process. Please follow the steps at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion#How_to_list_pages_for_deletion</a>. Also, make sure to use the vfd2 and vfd3 tags listed there to enter your reason for deletion and place the page on the deletion log. That's how other people will be able to see the nomination even if they don't happen to go to the page in question. I've gone back through your edit history to format the entries you've already tagged and added them to the log. Thanks for helping to keep the place clean.</p>

<p>I'm well aware of all this, having spent a few months last year on Vfd Patrol; I didn't nominate the Lion page for deletion, just voted/made a suggestion; the original nominee should do their own laundry.

<p>Well, it does matter if there are two Kovalenkos. As it is a very common last name, that could very well be the case. Or would Wikipedia just put "Andrei Kovalenko" above "Dema Kovalenko" automatically since the title of his page comes before?

<dd>Yes, in theory it would matter — but here we bump into a bug or a "feature" (depending on how you look at it) of the Wiki software. No matter what you put after "Kovalenko", within the Kovalenkos, if there were several of them, the pipe sort will alphabetize by the name of the article.... Nothing's perfect. But then, as I&#160;said, you do <i>no harm</i> by adding ", Dema" — and I&#160;do no harm by removing it. I'm not chasing your edits, by the way; the latest was an Italian and I&#160;do mostly Italian stuff on Wikipedia, because of my own website: the others I&#160;was editing people born in Kiev/Kyiv....

<p>Yes, "thru" is an acceptable if minority American spelling; rather than anglify spellings — newbies are warned about correcting "honour" or "honor" (either one), else with the many backgrounds of people, we'd never stop revert wars — wouldn't it be best to contribute some substance, if you can? <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 23:44, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Bill,</dd>
<dd>The official OED website (which I have access to through my university), says <i>thru: now used informally as a reformed spelling and abbreviation (chiefly) in N. Amer.</i></dd>
<dd>The New Oxford American English Dictionary 2nd edition (which ships with MacOS X 10.4) also says <i>thru: informal spelling of through.</i></dd>
<dd>I've been mostly focusing on 'spidering' through Wikipedia cleaning up random spelling, capitalisation, punctuation, and grammatical mistakes that I find. I've been told on #Wikipedia that this is regarded as a useful activity.</dd>
<dd>I've no interest in Anglicising/Americanizing the English on Wikipedia (except sometimes within individual articles to keep them internally consistent), but given the informal nature of 'thru', I thought it was fair game.</dd>

<dd>(Yeah, I get the OED thru the University of Chicago that hosts my website too: no argument there.) Anyhoo, one spelling or another, as long as they're OK, makes very little difference; I was sorta hoping to spur your well-attested energy into something a bit more useful.... Actual spelling mistakes of course is a different matter, although even there, quite honestly, most of the time I just leave them, since there is so much substantial stuff to do. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 00:29, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Bill, several months ago you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ASCD&amp;diff=10844804&amp;oldid=6872075" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3ASCD&amp;diff=10844804&amp;oldid=6872075" rel="nofollow">changed the SCD template</a> from</p>

<p>noting</p>

<p>"wrongfully" doesn't mean what the writer thought!</p>

<p>in the "edit history".</p>
<p>I wondered what you meant by that, since there's <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategorization_of_people_a8ff.html#Template:SCD" title="Wikipedia talk:Categorization of people">new talk about that template</a>.</p>
<p>Another question I've wanted to ask you for some time (only I didn't know it was so easy you being a wikipedian) regards an <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacitus.html#ref_mylasa" title="Tacitus">inscription about Tacitus found at Mylasa</a>: do you know of any source where an <i>image</i> or a <i>transcript</i> of that inscription might be found (i.e. on the web, preferably free of copyright)?</p>
<p>I ask you this since your LacusCurtius website (which I value very high!) shows you have some intrest in Roman inscriptions. The <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacitus.html#endnote_mylasa" title="Tacitus">first footnote on the Tacitus page</a> says "OGIS 437, first brought to light in Bulletin de correspondance hellénique, 1890, pp. 621–623." as a reference for that inscription. Well, I don't have access to these <i>paper</i> sources, or can they be found on the internet somewhere?</p>

<dd>"Wrongfully" was just a (glaring) misuse of English; it's someone's idea of "wrongly", because it sounds better.... Another very common example is "amphitheatre" where "theatre" is meant. "Wrongful" is in fact a legal term of very specialized application.
<dl>
<dd>Well, "incorrectly" was not what was intended by the template. I had first written "<b>unrightfully</b> labeling persons". Then a native English speaker (Seth, taking part in the "Categorization of people" discussion at the time) had changed to "wrongfully", saying that "unrightfully" was bad English. I have to rely on native English speakers here, which I am not. the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_of_people_2346.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization of people">Categorization of people guideline</a> does <i>not</i> advise to apply the SCD template when there are obvious material errors ("incorrectly"), but when wikipedia categorisation is not used in the most <i>appropriate</i> way. Do you think something like this would do better:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>This category may label persons inappropriately. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>It's about the meaning of "label" too, which I intended to use in the meaning of <i>racists inappropriately labeling jews</i>, not in the meaning of a secretary making an error and putting the wrong label on an incoming letter. So if there's any suggestion to have a better and less ambiguous word for "label", I'd lend my ear too.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 9 July 2005 11:40 (UTC)

<dd>"improperly", "inappropriately", or "wrongly" would all do, with various nuances of meaning. Yes, "incorrectly" is not what's meant, I&#160;see that now.

Jona Lendering <a href="http://www.livius.org/rome.html" class="external text" title="http://www.livius.org/rome.html" rel="nofollow">(Livius.Org)</a> hasn't written his Tacitus article yet, but may well have the full info or even a photograph, since that's his playing field, and he's probably been to Mylasa, altho there again I'm not seeing an article "Mylasa" on Livius yet.

<p>It is not Wikipedia policy, as you stated, not to use styles at the start of articles. They have been used at the opening of articles to show what an individual's style was or is. A user tried to get a consensus to remove them and failed. The agreed consensus, to avoid endless editing wars, was to leave styles where they currently are. In trying to remove them you broke the agreed compromise and tried to enforce a non-existent rule on Wikipedia. I have reverted your changes. Please don't unilaterally try to change an agreed compromise on the basis of a non-existent Wikipedia rule. Any attempt to break that compromise will simply be reverted automatically by those involved in agreeing that compromise.</p>

Given the edit wars that erupted on the issue, everyone pretty much agreed to leave the issue alone. It might be revisited some day, but right now it would only trigger one mother of an edit war, as there are still too much bitterness and rivalries generated by the recent battle.

<dd>I was aware of no agreement on that, folks; some minority decided it in some obscure place, and from now on to the end of time no matter how many feel it's not right, it'll stay. Well then, I&#160;won't revert, but it really is plain silly; it must have got started when somebody got it in their head that the recently dead were somehow being dissed by this universal editorial practice — which would account for people being invested in this point: time and time again I&#160;bump into some childish thing of this type (articles uneditable because of vandal wars, etc.). It's this kind of idiosyncrasy (flying in the face of all accepted practice, look at any other encyclopedia you please, and almost all of Wikipedia as well) that makes Wikipedia look bad, and keeps better contributors away; more generally phrased, it belies Jimbo's axiom that "Wikipedia is not an exercise in democracy"; and offers ammo to them that knowledge, like art, is not a sphere for democracy. Anyhow, the immediate effect on me now, for example (I&#160;thoroughly dislike controversy), will be to keep my edits and new articles down, because I'll feel somewhat assaulted, and why bother.</dd>

<p>I am against <i>using</i> honorifics and styles in articles - I regard the best to only <i>explain</i> such once in the article. Thus, a bio shuld not begin "His Majesty King Edward", "His Holiness Pope John", but there would be only an explanation, something as follows: "Edward was king of xx. As heir apparent, He was styled as His Royal Highness, and as king, His Majesty...". I think an enactment of a policy to enforce that would be needed now.

<dd>Since you ask, and for what it's worth — very little, I&#160;fear, since the minute something gets controversial I&#160;just go away — that seems reasonable to me. I&#160;believe some of the royalty biographies do just that, even going so far as to list, in a special section, the various styles thru the life of the person. It still seems like a bit of overkill (read, really: excess column-inches devoted to the matter), but as they say, Wikipedia is not print, and disk storage is cheap. I&#160;would except <i>current</i> monarchs; Elizabeth&#160;II, by my lights, quite properly starts with "Her Majesty".</dd>

<dd>The use of "His/Her Majesty" in relation to a dead person by the way, in addition to not being customary, is also inaccurate: "Le Roi est mort: Vive le Roi&#160;!" is usually the official view of the monarchies themselves: the Majesty resides in the living Monarch, not elsewhere. Anyhoo, nobody should look to me for support, and I'll leave to others the time spent on such things. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 19:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Google appears to prefer Celano over Celaeno by a ratio of approximately 5:2. I say move it to Celano, with a redirect at Celaeno. "Celaeno" is the first spelling I think of, mostly because it was the spelling <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._P._Lovecraft_a712.html" title="H. P. Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> used, and as such was the one I encountered first. May want to also add a redirect at "Caelano" as well, since this may have been what HPL meant to write. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:01, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bill. When you create a Category (Like <a href="../../../a/r/g/Category%7EArgentine_cardinals_616b.html" title="Category:Argentine cardinals">Category:Argentine cardinals</a>), please don't let it <i>hang</i> to a non existing category (Argentine prelates). Since there are still not much articles about Argentine cardinals, I'll link it directly to Argentine Religion. Thanks, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a> 07:26, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I usually don't, and link up to an existing root; as in this case, I&#160;did (see creation date and time of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Category%7EArgentine_prelates_8bf0.html" title="Category:Argentine prelates">Category:Argentine prelates</a>). I'll fix your move now. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 10:13, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry! I guess I got you right in those few seconds that it took you to create the other one. Sorry again for being annoying. Good wiking, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarianocecowski_5a8d.html" title="User:Marianocecowski">Mariano</a> 11:17, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Think nothing of it, and better safe than hanging, like you say. (As for Argentine cardinals and prelates, those are awfully thin categories right now! but I'm sure can be fleshed out from existing articles; the bugaboo of consistency —) Best, <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Thayer_8b58.html" title="User:Bill Thayer">Bill</a> 11:52, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
