<p>The NATO bombings that Clinton lead in 1999 against the ethnic cleansing needs to be added. I'm not sure how to do it.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Error in My Life</span></h2>
<p>In his autobiography Bill Clinton wrote that Martin Van Buren was the first sitting Vice President to have been elected President. That is incorrect as John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were still Vice President when they were elected President. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Shadow_Treasurer_cf43.html" title="User:The Shadow Treasurer">The Shadow Treasurer</a> 02:08, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That doesn't seem like a factual error. Rather, Van Buren was the first sitting Vice President to be elected President after the passing of the 12th Amendment. This amendment created the Presidential ticket system we use today and fundamentally altered the basic fabric of what it means to be a sitting Vice President to be elected President. --<a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_Sowell_3ef6.html" title="User:Don Sowell">Don Sowell</a> 22:35, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically it is still an error. It would not be an error if he had mentioned the 12th Amendment which he didn't.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Shadow_Treasurer_cf43.html" title="User:The Shadow Treasurer">The Shadow Treasurer</a> 06:04, 28 December 2006 (UTC) Read another error in the book. He wrote that Tomiichi Murayama was the first socialist Prime Minister of Japan. That is not correct as Murayama was really the first socialist Prime Minister in 46 years when he came into office in 1994. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Shadow_Treasurer_cf43.html" title="User:The Shadow Treasurer">The Shadow Treasurer</a> 04:32, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why not, this article is about Bill Clinton. Silly question.</p>
<p>The following may or may not be an error depending on one's viewpoint: He wrote that in 1996 he became the first Democrat to win a second term as President since FDR in 1936. Technically Harry S Truman and Lyndon B Johnson were elected to a second term in 1948 and 1964 respectively. In Truman's tenure it was close to two full terms as he served 94.4% of the term that FDR had been elected to. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Shadow_Treasurer_cf43.html" title="User:The Shadow Treasurer">The Shadow Treasurer</a> 05:47, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I unprotected it a couple days ago because 1) it had been protected for over two weeks, and 2) before that two weeks the page had not needed protection for many months since a brief period back in February. It is disappointing that a page that has gone so long without protection so long suddenly requires semi-protection for an extended period. Since the vandalism on the page may be election related, my plan is to wait until a week after the election is over and see if the vandals have lost interest at that point. Others may want to try earlier, if you do, please watch the page. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature12_b3bf.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature12"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 12:57, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <i>swear</i> I saw this in here recently but glancing back at a few older edits I can't find it. I thought that someone edited it a few days ago to reflect that his license was suspended (for 5 year, I think?). But this is a busy article, particularly in light of the recent interview, so it's easy to miss or overlook even major edits. Go ahead and add it to the article (supported by a verifiable reference, of course) as I agree that it's a significant enough event to warrant a brief mention. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 14:31, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>China had nukes long before Bill Clinton was President. China did obtain some missile-guidance technology from the U.S. during the Clinton presidency, however.

<dd>I did some research about six months ago and I found several academic sites that stated China aquired the technology for effective ICBM guidence systems through technology buys and esiponage during the Clinton Administration.

<hr />
<p>This article is the size of Hitler because no other prominent person in recent history has generated such rankor/fervor/hate/love. As such, the shear volume of material written about or refering to Clinton is inevitably going to generate a lot of debate and may become one of the reasons why Clinton goes down, historically, as one of America's most notable figures. I didn't vote for Slick either time, but I can see both sides of the partisan arguments. What astounds me is how much falsehood gets spread by both sides. William Jefferson Clinton may be the most misunderstood and miscast character I have ever encountered - and I LOVE history.</p>
<p>The one thing that makes any antagonist/protagonist viable is the appearance of a worthy opponent. Clinton's opponent for a dozen years or more is/was Richard Melon Scaife. Given Scaife's involvement with the CIA and the Bush family, it is very hard for me to understand why this Clinton nemesis isn't at least mentioned in the article. I have edited in some mention of Scaife &amp; the Arkansas Project several times only to have it disappear afterwards. It makes one wonder about the tinfoil hat theory of "Men in the Shadows". <a href="../../../i/d/i/User%7EIdioT.SavanT.i4_eb6b.html" title="User:IdioT.SavanT.i4">i4</a> 21:01, 23 October 2006 (UTC) IdioT.SavanT.i4</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Economic Prosperity Statistics</span></h2>
<p>We started discussing this but never reached a conclusion, so I'm copying it out to the active talk page.</p>
<p>Reading through the stats on President Clinton's economic record I found several things that I wondered about. Maybe someone can address these if needed.</p>
<p>Creation of more than 22.5 million jobs—the most jobs ever created under a single administration, and more than were created in the previous 12 years. Of the total new jobs, 20.7 million, or 92 percent, were in the private sector. Wouldn't one need to factor in 8 years of population growth here?</p>
<p>Economic gains spurred an increase in family incomes for all Americans. Since 1993, real median family income increased by $6,338, from $42,612 in 1993 to $48,950 in 1999 (in 1999 dollars). We'd need to discount inflation/standard of living for this to be meaningful, wouldn't we?</p>
<p>The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever. Well I'm sure it is. But that's like people saying Bush got more votes than any other president in history, while ignoring population growth. How does 2000 compare to other historical surpluses if discounted for inflation?</p>
<p>Also none of these stats are specifically sourced - I'm assuming that the references section at the bottom covers them? If not, we need to get sources for all this stuff.</p>

<p>I'm no expert, but it's possible that all the dollar amounts for 1999 on median family income (for example) were in 1993 dollars. If that's the case, it'll have already been adjusted for inflation.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clinton walked out of his commitment to the Army Reserve</span></h2>
<p>as a condition to being admitted to ROTC, Clinton signed up and was sworn in to the army reserve, but never showed up. Other than that, his draft dodging looks comarable to Dick Cheney's. Compare the two bios on Wiki.CorvetteZ51 13:07, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know if he was actually sworn into the Army Reserves. Probably not as you would read more about it.

<dd>at the time, Clinton would have been a grad student. So a four year program seems unlikely. Besides that, I find it hard to believe that a deferment was given to a 'walk-on', ie a person with no obligations. I find it hard to believe that all the 'letter writing effort ' would be need to get Clinton into ROTC,if their were no obligations. Clinton could always 'just take two years-beginning ROTC', but that doesn't get you a deferment.CorvetteZ51 18:18, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Misleading wording</span></h2>
<p><i>"After much debate, the Congress - which has sole power under the U.S. Constitution to regulate the armed forces - implemented the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, stating that homosexual men and women may serve in the military as long as their sexuality is kept secret. By 1999, Clinton said he didn't "think any serious person could say" that the policy was not "out of whack".[3]"</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Reading this, I was surprised, so I went to the article sourced. The wikipedia article suggests that Clinton said that the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy is out of whack, but that's not what the article says at all. The article states that Clinton says the way its <b>implemented</b> "now" (in 1999) is out of whack, not the policy, and that he was calling for it to be implemented the way it was intended to when the policy was created. So the source nearly says the exact opposite of what the wikipedia article is saying here. Someone can either fix it to be worded more accurately to the source, or dump the last sentence from the quote above all together, since its talking about Clinton's opinions 7 years ago about the way things were run 7 years ago, and I'm assuming at least the latter has changed since then, if not Clinton's opinions as well. This part is also written into the section about Clinton's first term, so referencing 1999 events and quotes there doesn't make much sense anyway (particularly when the quote is used in context and you see he's not talking about the policy itself).</dd>

<dd>Typical NeoCon distorted view of history. Clinton gets all the blame for Bin Laden and 9/11 and Bush (of course) is totally blameless. Never mind the fact that Bush spent an astounding 42 percent of his time in office before 9/11 on vacation. Never mind that he rejected the Hart/Rudmann proposal for a Dept. of Homeland Security in Feb. 2001 (the establishment of which would have almost certainly prevented 9/11). Never mind the fact that Bush took zero action after he received the "Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S." PDB on Aug. 6, 2001. NeoCons truly live in a fantasy world: a world in which Clinton conspired to murder Vince Foster and Kerry conspired with the U.S. Navy to receive a Silver Star and Bronze Star he didn't really deserve. I guess I don't blame NeoCons for worshipping their hero Bush and re-writing history to smear the Dems.

<p>I think the portion that says that President Bush reneged about raising taxes needs to be changed. Techinically he did not create a new tax and according to a PBS program he did tell the truth. He raised an existing tax and did not create a new tax. The reason it hurt him was not because people felt that he lied, but rather they felt it was done in in the shadow of politics. In other words he did it behind the people's back. I don't know the word reneged seems to imply that he lied, but in fact he did not. It could use rewording in that area. I know it's a very small detail, but I think for the integrity of keeping wikipedia as academic as possible these small details are important.</p>

<p>CorvetteZ51, this is a ludicrous argument. Even people that hate Bush (43) are going to want to put in his article that he implemented Faith-Based Initiatives, No Child Left Behind, and so on, whether they agree or disagree with those programs. For example, many Republicans might support NAFTA. At least put that in there, as well as the things they'd want to CONDEMN about him. It's irrational to not put his actual policy accomplishments in there, whether you like them or hate them.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</span></h3>
<p>I have to agree. Clinton passed the <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act_98fd.html" title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> of 1998, which was the first significant amendment to the U.S. Copyright Act since 1976. It finally brought federal intellectual property (IP) law up to date with technology and -- for the first time in American history -- allowed recording-artists and sound-recording copyright owners to receive royalties for all digital public performances of their work. (For decades the Copyright Act only guaranteed an exclusive right to public performance to songwriters and their music publishers). The DMCA also provided certain protections to ISPs from claims of copyright infringement. I would certainly say that that kind of landmark legislation counts as a major accomplishment worth mentioning in more detail. It changed the entire legal landscape of digital consumer technologies from sound-recordings on one end to computer-software on the other. --<a href="../../../r/k/r/User%7ERkrause_97b9.html" title="User:Rkrause">Rkrause</a> 05:42, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am a new user, however, I thought this section should be added. At the very least, the possibility ought to be entertained with all of the behavior he shows.</p>
<p>Clinton simply shows a lot of behavior indicitive of a sociopath - cheating on his wife, sexual promiscouity (to the extremes), manipulation (on a personal level, that is - most politicians are manipulative in a different sense) and charm and charisma. These are merely the things we are certain of. However, there are also allegations of rape, and anger outbursts.

<dd>Agree with Supersexyspacemonkey. Also, I have read of and even spoken to several psychologists who say that George W. Bush shows evidence of narcissism to the extreme, alcoholism that still impacts behavior, deteriorating mental capacity, sociopathic behavior in his apparent disregard for human life (namely Iraqi) and quality of life (namely American). All of this much worse, not to mention more relevant to our lives, than a sex addiction. I suspect you wouldn't be doing much laughing if I cited some of this in his article.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anal-Oral Contact</span></h2>
<p>As part of a greater psychological profile of Clinton in support of recent discussion regarding his mental health, I think it is relevant to present the following:</p>
<p>Clinton engaged in <b><u>anal-oral contact</u></b> multiple times with Lewinsky according to the Starr Report as sourced here<a href="http://icreport.access.gpo.gov/report/6narrit.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://icreport.access.gpo.gov/report/6narrit.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, here<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/icreport/6narrit.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://thomas.loc.gov/icreport/6narrit.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and here<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/icreport/7groundsfoot.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/icreport/7groundsfoot.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. --<a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaizum_0a13.html" title="User:Haizum"><b>Haizum</b></a> <b>μολὼν λαβέ</b> 23:27, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Any kind of sexual "deviance" (if indeed that it be) is utterly trivial and, unless illegal, is entirely subjective, and is a completely, totally, and utterly irrelevant and inapropriate topic of conversation in a biographical article. This section is as relevant, as tasteful, and as useful to the reader as telling how many times the president wipes his rear after defecating, and with how many squares, or describing in detail the First Lady's hygenic practices involving her menstrual cycle. In other words, it might be factually correct or incorrect, but to discuss it for an article is disgusting, sensational, and perverse. Not only that, why did you not just include this info in the above section which already covers it? Because you got a thrill from using the title "Anal-oral" contact. Please grow up.--<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupersexyspacemonkey_b4be.html" title="User:Supersexyspacemonkey">Supersexyspacemonkey</a> 17:10, 26 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'll echo "supersexyspacemonkey"'s sentiments above--this sort of sensationalist nonsense is inappropriate for the primary article on a former president; as one user noted above, the article in its current form already gives undue weight to the Lewinsky scandal, while the entirety of Clinton's presidency is relegated to one paragraph (making it "read like a National Enquirer article" as another user noted--I will note that both the presidency and the scandal have subsidiary articles). I encountered this article for the first time recently, and was appalled by its lack of perspective. I'll see if I can clean it up a bit in a few days. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETraumerei_be75.html" title="User:Traumerei">Traumerei</a> 18:03, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not even clear on how the scholarship works, despite consulting the Wikipedia and Oxford. I only bring it up because people have told me Clinton didn't finish. <a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.66.9.162.html" title="User:70.66.9.162">70.66.9.162</a></p>
<p>Clinton attended Oxford for the first year as he was a Rhodes Scholar, but his time in the program was cut short due to his being drafted and being forced to come home, at which point he enrolled in Law School and joined the ROTC program at the University of Arkansas.</p>
<p>As I understand it he was not forced to come home but chose to do so. He was told that if he stayed at Oxford through his doctorate he would be considered for a faculty position but did not find this compelling. I cannot remember where I learned this unfortunately, but I am certain some searching could source it.</p>
<p>== Good Point == Mr Clinton DIDN'T finish the Rhodes program, a two year course of study in England. Notable graduates of the Rhodes program include Senator Russell Feingold (D-WI) and General (Ret) Wesley Clark, who DID graduate. Engineer1234 20:15, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for researching and restoring the deleted content. It appears that the content was deleted on Nov. 1 as you say, but it was done via a "minor" edit with no edit summary by <a href="../../../r/o/u/User%7ERougher07_f284.html" title="User:Rougher07">User:Rougher07</a>; unsurprisingly, that user has an infobox stating that he "supports G.W. Bush"; coupled with the stealthy nature of the edit, it was almost certainly partisan. I do believe that the section on the administration could use lots of improvement (some users have already noted the judicial nominations elsewhere). Possible subjects include his role in the largest deficit reduction plan in US history, the downsizing of the federal bureaucracy per the National Performance Review plan (making it, I believe, the smallest government since the Kennedy era), environmental initiatives, direct student loans and other educational programs, the Haiti issue, and many others. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETraumerei_be75.html" title="User:Traumerei">Traumerei</a> 01:38, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

I would also like to add that I wish that a more politically balanced article on Clinton could appear here. The current article seems to me to be excessively dominated by right wing writers trying to score political points, with little regard for history. The same can be said about articles on other recent political figures. (And I don't mean to leave the left wing writers off the hook with regard to some of these.)

<p>I have just reread the article and wonder if it is the same article that I read last week! I hearby retract my statement above concerning unbalance in this article. Typically, I have not been contributing edits to articles that pretain to political science, restricting myself more to science (indeed, I have little time to contribute in that area). However, being a member of the Fulbright Association I did want to credit Clinton with what I believe to be a well deserved Fulbright Prize. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJay_Gregg_9b2a.html" title="User:Jay Gregg">Jay Gregg</a> 17:25, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Who put the NPOV tag up? You didn't specify what your claim is. Was it just the missing Presidential Administration info? If so it has been readded. Please remove the tag if that was the issue.

<dd>If you want to include every self-contradictory thing a politician has done, particularly relating to foreign policy, every politician's wikipedia article would be a gigabyte long.
