<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Joel_c796.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>Born in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Joel was raised in <a href="../../../h/i/c/Hicksville%2C_New_York_ad15.html" title="Hicksville, New York">Hicksville, New York</a>. Often he himself, along with many in the media, have confused this with him living in neighboring <a href="../../../l/e/v/Levittown%2C_New_York_561b.html" title="Levittown, New York">Levittown, New York</a>; in truth, Joel lived on Meeting Lane in Hicksville, near the Levittown border, in a section of town developed by Abe Levitt after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>. <a href="http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-hometown_joe,0,6402455.story?coll=ny-lihistory-navigation" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-hometown_joe,0,6402455.story?coll=ny-lihistory-navigation" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.antonnews.com/hicksvilleillustratednews/1999/08/13/news" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antonnews.com/hicksvilleillustratednews/1999/08/13/news" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. His father, Howard (né: Helmut) Joel, was with the US Army unit that liberated <a href="../../../d/a/c/Dachau_concentration_camp.html" title="Dachau concentration camp">Dachau concentration camp</a> in April 1945. Howard was originally from Germany where his father <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Amson_Joel_b123.html" title="Karl Amson Joel">Karl Amson Joel</a> owned the fourth largest mail order company in Germany before being dispossessed by the Nazis. His mother, Rosalind Nyman, was born in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, to an <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnostic.html" title="Agnostic">agnostic</a> Jewish family. His parents later divorced, and his father moved back to <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> (Austria). His half-brother Alexander Joel is an acclaimed classical pianist and conductor in Europe, now living in New York. <a href="http://www.thevillager.com/villager_12/billyjoel.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thevillager.com/villager_12/billyjoel.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>From an early age, Joel had an intense interest in music; especially European classical music. He reluctantly began piano lessons at an early age at his mother's insistence. His interest in music instead of sports was the source of teasing and bullying in his early years. (He has said in interviews that his piano instructor also taught ballet. This led neighborhood bullies to mistakenly think he was learning to dance.) As a teenager, Joel took up <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxing.html" title="Boxing">boxing</a> so that he would be able to defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Gloves_77be.html" title="Golden Gloves">Golden Gloves</a> circuit for a short time (winning over twenty bouts), but abandoned the sport shortly after having his nose broken in a boxing match.</p>
<p>Joel attended Hicksville High School, and was to have graduated in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>. However, he was one English credit short of the graduation requirement; he overslept on the day of an important exam due to his late-night musician's lifestyle.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Faced with a summer in school to complete this requirement, he decided not to continue. He left high school without a diploma to begin a career in music. In 1992, the English credit requirement was waived by the Hicksville School Board and he received his diploma at Hicksville High's graduation ceremony 25 years after he left the school.</p>

<p>At the age of 14, Joel joined his first band, The Echoes (which later became The Lost Souls). According to producer <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_Morton_bcc5.html" title="Shadow Morton">Shadow Morton</a>, Joel was also the pianist on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shangri-Las_9170.html" title="The Shangri-Las">the Shangri-Las</a> hit "Remember (Walking In The Sand)" <a href="http://www.limusichalloffame.org/lirock/shadow04.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.limusichalloffame.org/lirock/shadow04.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, he joined The Hassles, a <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_ec1e.html" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> band that had some local success ("Every Step I Take," "You Got Me Hummin'"). The Hassles released two albums (<i>The Hassles</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a> and <i>Hour of the Wolf</i>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>) on the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Artists_7688.html" title="United Artists">United Artists</a> record label. Following The Hassles' demise in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, he formed the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_rock.html" title="Pop rock">pop rock</a> duo Attila with Hassles drummer Jon Small. Attila released their eponymous debut album in <a href="../../../j/u/l/July.html" title="July">July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> and disbanded the following October.</p>
<p>Upon losing his record contract with Attila, Joel suffered severe <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">depression</a>, and was admitted into Meadowbrook Hospital after ingesting furniture polish in a half-hearted <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> attempt. <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Billy-Joel-Tried-To-Suicide-With-Furniture-Polish-10309.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Billy-Joel-Tried-To-Suicide-With-Furniture-Polish-10309.shtml" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> The note he left eventually became the lyrics to his song "Tomorrow Is Today." Upon release from Meadowbrook Hospital in early <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>, he began to re-explore his place in the music business, including the participation in a television commercial with <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chubby_Checker_b99b.html" title="Chubby Checker">Chubby Checker</a> and the contribution of rock criticism to a music magazine called <i>Changes.</i></p>

However, the album was mastered at the wrong speed, and the album was initially released with this error, resulting in Joel sounding a half step too high (Joel later commented that he sounded like <a href="../../../a/l/v/Alvin_and_the_Chipmunks_850a.html" title="Alvin and the Chipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a>). The onerous terms of the Family Productions contract also guaranteed him very little money from the sales of his albums.</p>
<p>In order to get out of the deal with Family Productions, Joel moved to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a> with Elizabeth Weber, and they married in Los Angeles in May, 1971. For six months the following year, he played in the Executive Lounge piano bar under the name Bill Martin. This experience is what gave him the material for "<a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano_Man_%28album%29_08e3.html" title="Piano Man (album)">Piano Man</a>."</p>
<p>In addition, a <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_7d25.html" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a> radio station, <a href="../../../w/m/m/WMMR_5990.html" title="WMMR">WMMR</a>-FM, started playing a tape of a new song, "Captain Jack," which was taken from a <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_concert.html" title="Live concert">live concert</a> broadcast which became an underground hit on the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Coast_of_the_United_States_0292.html" title="East Coast of the United States">East Coast</a>. An executive from Columbia Records named Herb Gordon heard his music and made his record label aware of Joel's talent. From there he signed with Columbia Records. Hits such as "She's Got a Way" and "Everybody Loves You Now" were originally released on this album, though they did not gain much attention until released as live performances in 1981 on <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Songs_in_the_Attic_1e36.html" title="Songs in the Attic">Songs in the Attic</a></i>. Since then they have become regular concert numbers. <i>Cold Spring Harbor</i> got a second chance on the charts in 1983, when Columbia reissued the album after slowing it down to the correct speed. The album reached # 158 in the US and # 95 in the UK nearly a year later.</p>

<p>His experiences in Los Angeles connected him with record company executives, who bought out his contract with Ripp with the condition that the "Family Productions" logo be displayed alongside the Columbia logo for the next five albums. Also in the contract was the agreement that Family Productions would receive a 25 cent royalty for every album Joel sold, which would come back to haunt him when he hit it big. His brief tenure in Los Angeles also inspired his signature song "Piano Man." The album <i><a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano_Man_%28album%29_08e3.html" title="Piano Man (album)">Piano Man</a></i> was released in late 1973 and was <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_Gold_4096.html" title="Certified Gold">certified Gold</a>. To this day it has sold over four million copies. However, due to the large sums of money involved in the legal tangles of the contract buyout, Joel netted less than $7,000 in profit from his certified Gold record. Although this album is best known for its title track, several other future gems include "Captain Jack," "The Ballad of Billy the Kid," and "You're My Home" (the <a href="../../../b/-/s/B-side.html" title="B-side">b-side</a> of the "Piano Man" single, which would later be covered by <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Reddy_22a7.html" title="Helen Reddy">Helen Reddy</a>), all of which would become staples of Joel's live shows.</p>
<p>As of January 2007, the song Piano Man is still in the top 100 rock songs on iTunes.</p>

<p>Joel remained in Los Angeles to write <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Streetlife_Serenade_9bdc.html" title="Streetlife Serenade">Streetlife Serenade</a></i>, his second album under the Columbia label. References to both <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburbia.html" title="Suburbia">suburbia</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/n/Inner_city.html" title="Inner city">inner city</a> pepper the album. The standout track on the album is "The Entertainer," which picks up thematically where "Piano Man" left off. Joel was upset that "Piano Man" had been significantly edited down in order to make it more radio-friendly, and in "The Entertainer," he refers to the edit with sarcastic lines such as, "If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05." This refers to the album version of this song which is 5:37, and the edited single which is 3:05. Although <i>Streetlife Serenade</i> is often considered one of Joel's weaker albums (Joel has confirmed his distaste for the album), it nonetheless contains some notable tracks including the title track, with its <a href="../../../d/e/b/Debussy.html" title="Debussy">Debussy</a>-like intro, "Los Angelenos," and the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instrumental.html" title="Instrumental">instrumental</a> "The Mexican Connection."

<p>Disenchanted with the L.A. music scene, Joel returned to New York in 1975. There he recorded what many fans and critics consider one of his best albums, <i><a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnstiles.html" title="Turnstiles">Turnstiles</a></i>. On <i>Turnstiles</i>, Joel used his own hand-picked musicians in the studio for the first time, and took a more hands-on role.

<p>The song "<a href="../../../u/p/t/Uptown_Girl_66b8.html" title="Uptown Girl">Uptown Girl</a>" was one of the first songs written when Joel returned from vacation.

<p>Following the success of <i>An Innocent Man</i>, Joel had been approached to release an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered "Greatest Hits" albums as marking the end of one's career. This time, he agreed, and <i>Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2</i> was released as a 4-sided album and 2-CD set, with the songs in sequence of when they were released. The new songs "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27re_Only_Human_%28Second_Wind%29_38a7.html" title="You're Only Human (Second Wind)">You're Only Human (Second Wind)</a>" and "The Night Is Still Young" were recorded and released as singles to support the album.</p>
<p><i>Greatest Hits</i> was highly successful, selling over 20 million copies worldwide and becoming the top-selling double album of all time by a solo artist (and second overall after <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wall_cd64.html" title="The Wall">The Wall</a></i> by <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pink_Floyd_f331.html" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>). It has since been certified <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diamond_album.html" title="Diamond album">diamond</a> by the <a href="../../../r/i/a/RIAA_104b.html" title="RIAA">RIAA</a> for over 20 million albums sold . To date it is the 6th best selling album in American music history according to the RIAA.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the <i>Greatest Hits</i> album release, Joel released a 2-volume <i>Video Album</i> that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to the present time. Along with videos for the new singles off the <i>Greatest Hits</i> album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, "Piano Man," for this project.</p>
<p>Two versions of <i>Greatest Hits</i> were released on CD: the initial release on double CD in 1985, and a re-released Enhanced CD version in 1998. While both are the same basic album in general, there are a number of subtle differences between the two:</p>
<ul>
<li>While all the longer hits ("Piano Man," "Captain Jack," "Goodnight Saigon") are fully intact, many other shorter songs ("Pressure," "Just the Way You Are," "My Life") were shortened significantly in the 1985 release. Oddly enough, the included booklet lists all of the lyrics, even the parts cut for time. These songs are fully restored in the re-release.</li>
<li>The 1985 release features the live version of "Say Goodbye to Hollywood" from <i>Songs in the Attic.</i> The version from <i>Turnstiles</i> was used for the 1998 re-release.</li>
<li>The 1998 re-release features enhanced content due to advancements in CD technology over the previous 13 years.</li>

<p>Joel had already scored a hit with "Modern Woman" from the 1985 movie, "<a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruthless_People_0998.html" title="Ruthless People">Ruthless People</a>," (starring <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bette_Midler_84ad.html" title="Bette Midler">Bette Midler</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_DeVito_6f20.html" title="Danny DeVito">Danny DeVito</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Slater_487b.html" title="Helen Slater">Helen Slater</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge_Reinhold_7e1a.html" title="Judge Reinhold">Judge Reinhold</a>), when he began work on the album that would become <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bridge_%28Billy_Joel_album%29_7225.html" title="The Bridge (Billy Joel album)">The Bridge</a></i> in early 1986. <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Charles_5e75.html" title="Ray Charles">Ray Charles</a> contributed vocals and music to the song "Baby Grand" with Joel, and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Winwood_d50d.html" title="Steve Winwood">Steve Winwood</a> played <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammond_organ.html" title="Hammond organ">Hammond organ</a> on the song "Getting Closer." The final song recorded for the album was "Code Of Silence." <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cyndi_Lauper_8181.html" title="Cyndi Lauper">Cyndi Lauper</a> appears on the album, contributing backing vocals.</p>
<p>Though it broke into the Top Ten, <i>The Bridge</i> was not a success in relation to some of Joel's other albums, but it yielded the hit "A Matter Of Trust" (# 10). In a departure from his "piano man" persona, Joel is shown in its video as playing a <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Paul_280f.html" title="Les Paul">Les Paul</a>-autographed Gibson guitar. The ballad "This Is The Time" also charted, peaking at # 18, and has been a favorite on the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prom.html" title="Prom">prom</a> circuit ever since. "Modern Woman" was also released as a single and was quite successful, but Joel has since said in interviews he doesn't care for the song, and subsequently it has been left off most of his compilation sets (the exception appears to be <i><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Lives_cb4b.html" title="My Lives">My Lives</a></i>).</p>
<p>It was also the last Billy Joel album to carry the "Family Productions" logo.</p>
<p>At around this time, Billy completed voice work on <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney.html" title="Disney">Disney</a>'s <i><a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_%26_Company_2e27.html" title="Oliver &amp; Company">Oliver &amp; Company</a></i>, released in 1988.

For the film, Billy recorded a song titled "Why Should I Worry?" Critics were generally positive towards the film, and pointed to Billy's acting contribution as one of its highlights, despite it being his first acting job. In interviews, Billy explained that he took the job due to his love of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Walt_Disney_Company_cac2.html" title="The Walt Disney Company">Disney</a> cartoons as a child.</p>

<p>Throughout his tour supporting <i>The Bridge</i>, Joel and his handlers started planning a trip to the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. He would be the first American rock act (after <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a>) to play there since the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Wall_24be.html" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> went up, a fact not lost on history buff Joel. There would be six live performances, three each at indoor arenas in <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moscow.html" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Petersburg_5667.html" title="Saint Petersburg">Leningrad</a>. Joel and his family (including young daughter Alexa) and his full touring band made the trip in June 1987. The entourage was filmed for television and video to eventually offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world.</p>
<p>The audience in at least the first Moscow shows was filled with members of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_76ce.html" title="Communist Party">Communist Party</a>, who received tickets from the government as a perk. Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel's energetic show, something that never had happened in other countries he had performed in. As a result of that a minor international incident occurred when he famously flipped over an electric keyboard during the second Moscow show as a show of frustration that his lighting engineers would not turn down the house lights to calm the audience despite several requests. The lighting engineers were more concerned with the amount of light being adequate for filming. <a href="http://www.joelfanmedia.com/gallery/details.php?image_id=406&amp;sessionid=9939575b3bb9ac38c88758773445f6a0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.joelfanmedia.com/gallery/details.php?image_id=406&amp;sessionid=9939575b3bb9ac38c88758773445f6a0" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

Singer Peter Hewlitt was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like "An Innocent Man."</p>
<p>It has been estimated that Joel lost over US $1 million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.</p>

The song became Joel's third US Number 1 hit.</p>
<p><i>Storm Front</i> was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first Number 1 album since <i>Glass Houses</i>, 9 years earlier. <i>Storm Front</i> was Joel's first album since <i><a href="../../../t/u/r/Turnstiles.html" title="Turnstiles">Turnstiles</a></i> to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Jones_%28Foreigner%29_e48c.html" title="Mick Jones (Foreigner)">Mick Jones</a> of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreigner_%28band%29.html" title="Foreigner (band)">Foreigner</a> fame.

After "We Didn't Start the Fire," <i>Storm Front</i> also produced the top ten hit "I Go To Extremes" (# 6). The album was also notable for its song "<a href="../../../l/e/n/Leningrad_%28song%29.html" title="Leningrad (song)">Leningrad</a>," written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city during his tour in 1987, and "The Downeaster Alexa," written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album was the ballad "<a href="../../../a/n/d/And_So_It_Goes_5902.html" title="And So It Goes">And So It Goes</a>."</p>
<p>In 1992, Joel sued former manager and ex-brother-in-law Frank Weber (ex-wife Elizabeth's brother) for $95 million after accounting irregularities were discovered.

<p>Joel started work on <i><a href="../../../r/i/v/River_of_Dreams_1e31.html" title="River of Dreams">River of Dreams</a></i> in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by Christie Brinkley that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The eponymous first single was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, and #1 for a staggering twelve weeks on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. The album includes hits such as "The River of Dreams," "All About Soul," and "Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)," written for his daughter, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_Ray_Joel_2471.html" title="Alexa Ray Joel">Alexa</a>. A radio remix version of "All About Soul" can be found on "The Essential Billy Joel" (2001), and a demo version appears on "My Lives" (2005). The song "The Great Wall of China" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. "2000 Years" was prominent in the millennium concert at Madison Square Garden, December 31, 1999, and "Famous Last Words" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting.</p>

<p>In August 1995, Billy Joel's long-time <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bassist</a> Doug Stegmeyer committed suicide in his <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_ec1e.html" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> home. Stegmeyer had played on every one of Joel's albums from <i>Turnstiles</i> through <i>The Bridge</i>.</p>
<p>In 1999 Joel performed at New York's <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madison_Square_Garden_6f37.html" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> on the eve of the new millennium, which at the time was considered to be Joel's last solo <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">concert</a>. The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">concert</a> (dubbed The Night Of The 2000 Years) ran on close to 4 hours and was later released as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/2000_Years%7E_The_Millennium_Concert_7dba.html" title="2000 Years: The Millennium Concert">2000 Years: The Millennium Concert</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 2001 Joel released <i><a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasies_%26_Delusions_8544.html" title="Fantasies &amp; Delusions">Fantasies &amp; Delusions</a></i>, a collection of classical piano pieces. All were written by Billy Joel and performed by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Joo_996b.html" title="Richard Joo">Richard Joo</a>. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_theatre.html" title="Musical theatre">show</a> "Movin' Out." The album topped the classical charts at # 1. Joel performed "New York State of Mind" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the <a href="../../../a/_/t/America%7E_A_Tribute_to_Heroes_4cd6.html" title="America: A Tribute to Heroes">America: A Tribute to Heroes</a> benefit <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">concert</a>, and on October 20, 2001, along with "Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway), at the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">concert</a> for New York City in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed "Your Song" with Elton John.</p>
<p>Joel has toured extensively with <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a> on a series of "Face to Face" tours. During these <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">shows</a>, the two have played each other's songs and performed duets.</p>

The compilation also includes the Umixit software, in which people can remix "Zanzibar," "Only the Good Die Young," "Keepin' The Faith," and live versions of "I Go To Extremes" and "Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)" with their PC. Also, a DVD of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert.html" title="Concert">show</a> from the River of Dreams tour is included.</p>

<p>Several of Joel's songs have grown out of specific personal experiences, including "<a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano_Man_%28song%29_1d19.html" title="Piano Man (song)">Piano Man</a>," which he wrote describing his regular job playing at a <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano_bar.html" title="Piano bar">piano bar</a> in the early 1970s, and "<a href="../../../s/c/e/Scenes_from_an_Italian_Restaurant_7db2.html" title="Scenes from an Italian Restaurant">Scenes from an Italian Restaurant</a>," purportedly written about either the <a href="../../../s/y/o/Syosset.html" title="Syosset">Syosset</a> mainstay Christiano's or a similar eatery in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>'s <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Italy%2C_Manhattan_064e.html" title="Little Italy, Manhattan">Little Italy</a>. His song "Vienna" was supposedly written about a visit to his father in Europe, while "Big Shot" was based on a bad <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating.html" title="Dating">date</a> with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Jagger_1896.html" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>'s ex-wife <a href="../../../b/i/a/Bianca_Jagger_4889.html" title="Bianca Jagger">Bianca</a>.</p>
<p>In a <i><a href="../../../p/l/a/Playboy.html" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> interview, Joel indicated that "Rosalinda's Eyes" was penned for his <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother.html" title="Mother">mother</a>, Rosalind, as the song his <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father.html" title="Father">father</a> should have written for her.</p>
<p>"<a href="../../../o/n/l/Only_the_Good_Die_Young_cc26.html" title="Only the Good Die Young">Only the Good Die Young</a>" created a bit of a stir within the religious community when it was first released in 1977. Some radio stations even refused to give the song any airtime. It is said that while Joel was doing a show in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>, he had been specifically asked not to perform the song during the show and even received death threats; in response, Joel played it twice. Joel has said about the song that "the point of the song wasn't so much anti-Catholic as pro-lust."</p>

<p>In the mid <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>, the touring and studio lineup of Joel's band stabilized. The main lineup consisted of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Billy Joel - lead vocals, piano, synthesizer, organ, harmonica</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_DeVitto_cde8.html" title="Liberty DeVitto">Liberty DeVitto</a> — drums, percussion</li>

<li><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richie_Cannata_d6c4.html" title="Richie Cannata">Richie Cannata</a> — saxophones, flute, clarinet, organ, percussion, backing vocals</li>
</ul>
<p>This was also the lineup for Joel's first live album, <i>Songs in the Attic</i>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> saw significant changes to Joel's band. By the <i>River of Dreams</i> tour the only remaining long standing member of the band was DeVitto on drums. Multi-instrumentalists Crystal Taliefero and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Rivera_550d.html" title="Mark Rivera">Mark Rivera</a> joined and remain in his band to this day. Rivera had taken over the prominent saxophone solo in the song "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_of_Mind_d17a.html" title="New York State of Mind">New York State of Mind</a>" that had previously been performed by Cannata (and was re-recorded by Phil Woods for the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greatest_Hits_%28Billy_Joel_albums%29_0493.html" title="Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)">Greatest Hits</a> version of the song). The <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> <i>River of Dreams</i> tour saw the addition of Dave Rosenthal on keyboards who also remains with the band. Tommy Byrnes has become a frequent band member on guitar and was both a musical consultant and band member in the <i><a href="../../../m/o/v/Movin%27_Out_d2cd.html" title="Movin' Out">Movin' Out</a></i> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_theatre.html" title="Musical theatre">musical</a>. For the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> tour, Joel did not invite DeVitto back as drummer. Chuck Burgi (from the Broadway production of Joel's musical 'Movin' Out') replaced DeVitto. Richie Cannata returns on saxophones, along with Mark Rivera and Crystal Taliefero, with Cannata again performing the "New York State of Mind" solo. Carl Fischer plays trumpet and trombone when needed also.</p>
