<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilghman_946c.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Tilghman was born in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Dodge%2C_Iowa_1017.html" title="Fort Dodge, Iowa">Fort Dodge, Iowa</a>, on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/5/1854.html" title="1854">1854</a>. He became a <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_bison.html" title="American bison">buffalo</a> hunter at age 15 and claimed he killed over 12,000 bison over his five years of activity. During this time he may have become acquainted with other legendary figures such as <a href="../../../w/y/a/Wyatt_Earp_5f3f.html" title="Wyatt Earp">Wyatt Earp</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat_Masterson_1d4a.html" title="Bat Masterson">Bat Masterson</a>, and <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mysterious_Dave_Mather_1b47.html" title="Mysterious Dave Mather">Mysterious Dave Mather</a>, who also hunted buffalo. Tilghman's older brother, Richard, hunted with him, and at one point during the mid-1870s when the hunting team was attacked by a war party of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">American Indians</a>, his brother was killed. <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~oklincol/tilghman/tilghman.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rootsweb.com/~oklincol/tilghman/tilghman.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Following his hunting career, Tilghman moved to <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_City%2C_Kansas_24f1.html" title="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City, Kansas</a>, where he used the money he had saved to open a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_%28establishment%29.html" title="Bar (establishment)">saloon</a> in 1875. Tilghman was a <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teetotaler.html" title="Teetotaler">teetotaler</a> but, like so many of the famous figures of the Old West, he saw owning a saloon as an irresistible financial opportunity.</p>

<p>In September 1878, he served as a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Reconnaissance.html" title="Reconnaissance">scout</a> for the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Cavalry_c110.html" title="U.S. Cavalry">U.S. Cavalry</a> during a surge of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheyenne.html" title="Cheyenne">Cheyenne</a> raids on settlements, working along side the likes of <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunslinger.html" title="Gunslinger">gunman</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Joshua_Webb_98a7.html" title="John Joshua Webb">John Joshua Webb</a>. Later that same year, he was approached by Bat Masterson to serve as a deputy sheriff, and he accepted. He served in that capacity until 1884 and earned an excellent reputation, working at various <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_enforcement.html" title="Law enforcement">law enforcement</a> jobs for the rest of his life, earning the respect of Masterson, <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doc_Holliday_64c8.html" title="Doc Holliday">Doc Holliday</a>, and Wyatt and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil_Earp_0487.html" title="Virgil Earp">Virgil Earp</a>. By 1889 Tilghman moved on to <a href="../../../g/u/t/Guthrie%2C_Oklahoma_b3eb.html" title="Guthrie, Oklahoma">Guthrie, Oklahoma</a>, during the land rush. Town Marshal Bill Grimes approached him to serve as deputy marshal, and he accepted.</p>
<p>The territory had formerly been part of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Territory_1bdc.html" title="Indian Territory">Indian Territory</a> and was still one of the most lawless places in the west. As a deputy <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Marshal_20ea.html" title="US Marshal">US Marshal</a>, Tilghman was one of the three men most responsible for finally bringing law and order to the area. The others were <a href="../../../h/e/c/Heck_Thomas_799d.html" title="Heck Thomas">Heck Thomas</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Madsen_207c.html" title="Chris Madsen">Chris Madsen</a>. The trio, serving under <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Parker_fc9c.html" title="Isaac Parker">"Hanging Judge" Parker</a>, were collectively known as the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Guardsmen_0569.html" title="Three Guardsmen">Three Guardsmen</a> and were responsible for the arrest and/or killings of many of the worst criminal elements of the era, numbering by some estimates as high as 300 arrests, including the systematic elimination of the notorious <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_Bunch_39a9.html" title="Wild Bunch">Wild Bunch</a>. On <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_15.html" title="January 15">January 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a>, his single handed capture of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Doolin_5238.html" title="Bill Doolin">Bill Doolin</a> in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eureka_Springs%2C_Arkansas_53ac.html" title="Eureka Springs, Arkansas">Eureka Springs, Arkansas</a>, brought him increased fame as a lawman, for which he became best known. That same year he shot and wounded Doolin gang member "Little Bill" Raidler. Raidler was sentenced to prison and was released some years later because he suffered constantly from his gunshot wounds. Raidler died in 1904 as a result of those wounds.</p>

<p>Tilghman retired from his position in 1910 and was elected to the Oklahoma State Senate. He also accepted the position of police chief of <a href="../../../o/k/l/Oklahoma_City_ee0e.html" title="Oklahoma City">Oklahoma City</a> in 1911. In 1915, he acted as an advisor for the movie <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Passing_of_the_Oklahoma_Outlaws_780a.html" title="The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws">The Passing of the Oklahoma Outlaws</a></i>. The film is noted as an early attempt to de-glamorize the image of outlaws. In 1924, the aging Tilghman accepted a position as marshal of <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cromwell%2C_Oklahoma_ef0a.html" title="Cromwell, Oklahoma">Cromwell, Oklahoma</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilghman_946c.html" title="Edit section: Murder">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Murder</span></h2>
<p>He was in the job less than a year before he was killed in the line of duty. He die on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>. Wiley Lynn, a corrupt <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prohibition.html" title="Prohibition">prohibition</a> agent, shot him. Lynn and Tilghman had had numerous verbal confrontations because Lynn repeatedly released prisoners who were arrested by Tilghman. The incident began on <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> night, when Tilghman, Deputy Hugh Sawyer, and businessman W. E. Sirmans were having coffee at a cafe called <i>Ma Murphy's</i>.</p>
<p>Shots were heard outside, and Tilghman drew his handgun and went outside. In the street stood a drunken Wiley Lynn, with a gun in his hand. <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brothel.html" title="Brothel">Brothel</a> madame Rose Lutke was standing beside him. Another <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitute.html" title="Prostitute">prostitute</a>, Eva Caton, was sitting inside Lynn's car with a date, a furloughed <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">army</a> <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">sergeant</a>. Tilghman clasped Lynn's gunhand and called for Deputy Sawyer to come assist. <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~oklincol/tilghman/tilghman.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rootsweb.com/~oklincol/tilghman/tilghman.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>As Sawyer ran outside, Tilghman, Lynn and Rose Lutke stood body to body in the darkness. Two shots rang out, and Lutke screamed. As Deputy Sawyer rushed forward, Tilghman slumped forward and fell. Deputy Sawyer, inexperienced, did not fire but rather disarmed Lynn and yelled <i>"Wiley Lynn has shot the marshal"</i>. Lynn then fled with Rose Lutke to the car and sped away. <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~oklincol/tilghman/tilghman.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rootsweb.com/~oklincol/tilghman/tilghman.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>Tilghman's body was laid in state at the Oklahoma state Capitol. One month later, the town of Cromwell was torched, allegedly by angry citizens, with every brothel, bar, flop house and pool hall burned to the ground. No one took credit for the <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arson.html" title="Arson">arson</a>, although it has been suggested that instead of citizens, it was former lawman friends to Tilghman, led by former Deputy U.S. Marshal Chris Madsen. <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~oklincol/tilghman/tilghman.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rootsweb.com/~oklincol/tilghman/tilghman.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Rose Lutke disappeared, and was never heard from again. Wiley Lynn escaped prosecution because, evidently, Deputy Sawyer was unable to say that he actually <i>saw</i> Lynn shoot Tilghman because of the darkness. The town of Cromwell never recovered to its former "wild" status, and as of a 2000 census, its population was less than 300 residents. In 1932, Lynn was shot and killed in a shootout with Oklahoma Crime Bureau agent Crockett Long, who had been a friend to Tilghman. Long and a teenaged bystander were also killed during the shootout, by Lynn. <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~oklincol/tilghman/tilghman.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rootsweb.com/~oklincol/tilghman/tilghman.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>The 1999 made-for-television movie <i>You Know My Name</i> was based on Tilghman's life and final days. Veteran <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_movie.html" title="Western movie">western movie</a> actor <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Elliott_5398.html" title="Sam Elliott">Sam Elliott</a> produced the film and starred as Tilghman. His wife, Zoe Agnes Stratton Tilghman, wrote about him in the book <i>Marshal of the Last Frontier</i>.</p>
