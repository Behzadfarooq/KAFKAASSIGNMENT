	    <p><b>Bill Simmons</b> (born <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>), best known as <b>The Sports Guy</b>, is a columnist for <i><a href="../../../p/a/g/Page2.html" title="Page2">Page2</a></i> on <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN.com_009f.html" title="ESPN.com">ESPN.com</a> and <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_The_Magazine_bb4a.html" title="ESPN The Magazine">ESPN The Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>His ESPN.com column is notable for its prodigious length and the irregularity with which it is written, as well as its extended analogies and references to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_culture.html" title="Pop culture">pop culture</a> (especially from the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>). Simmons aims for humor in his columns, which are written from the perspective of a fan rather than an impartial journalist.</p>
<p>Simmons has earned a love/hate relationship with his readers, who often complain that he writes far too often about <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>-related topics and the <a href="../../../n/b/a/NBA_52b6.html" title="NBA">NBA</a> in general at the expense of other sports.</p>
<p>A native <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New Englander</a>, Simmons is a passionate fan of the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_the_Holy_Cross_150d.html" title="College of the Holy Cross">Holy Cross Crusaders</a>, and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Celtics_b035.html" title="Boston Celtics">Boston Celtics</a>. He was a longtime fan of the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Bruins_3d6f.html" title="Boston Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> and the <a href="../../../n/h/l/NHL_5702.html" title="NHL">NHL</a>, but claims that their poor administration led to him completely losing interest in them.<sup id="_ref-ESPN.com_2001-10-26_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ESPN.com_2001-10-26" title="">[1]</a></sup> Simmons' interest in soccer was piqued by the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_World_Cup_e470.html" title="FIFA World Cup">FIFA World Cup</a>. He subsequently wrote a column detailing his efforts to choose an <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_Premier_League_5e1a.html" title="English Premier League">English Premier League</a> team to follow, eventually selecting <a href="../../../t/o/t/Tottenham_Hotspur_b55b.html" title="Tottenham Hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a>.<sup id="_ref-ESPN.com_2006-07-19_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ESPN.com_2006-07-19" title="">[2]</a></sup> Since his column discussing the selection process, he hasn't written any stories on the team or the EPL season. He also passionately roots against certain teams, specifically the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_Eagles_800a.html" title="Boston College Eagles">Boston College Eagles</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Colts_aabe.html" title="Indianapolis Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Lakers_c195.html" title="Los Angeles Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a>.</p>
<p>He moved to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> at the end of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, and is currently a <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Clippers_fcf3.html" title="Los Angeles Clippers">Los Angeles Clippers</a> season ticket holder.</p>

<p>In 1988, Simmons completed a postgraduate year at <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choate_Rosemary_Hall_9836.html" title="Choate Rosemary Hall">Choate Rosemary Hall</a>, a <a href="../../../u/n/i/University-preparatory_school.html" title="University-preparatory school">prep school</a> located in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wallingford%2C_Connecticut_c472.html" title="Wallingford, Connecticut">Wallingford, Connecticut</a> after attending <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brunswick_School_92a7.html" title="Brunswick School">Brunswick School</a> in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich%2C_Connecticut_3540.html" title="Greenwich, Connecticut">Greenwich, Connecticut</a>. Simmons attended and graduated from the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_the_Holy_Cross_150d.html" title="College of the Holy Cross">College of the Holy Cross</a> in 1992, and subsequently studied sports journalism at <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_University_b25d.html" title="Boston University">Boston University</a>, where he received his masters degree<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup> Before his affiliation with ESPN, he was known as the "Boston Sports Guy" on the web site Digital City <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>. Simmons also worked for the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Herald_f08a.html" title="Boston Herald">Boston Herald</a> briefly in the 1990s, and he was a bartender for a short time while he established himself on the web.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2002, he moved to <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> to work as a comedy writer for <i><a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live_1b3f.html" title="Jimmy Kimmel Live">Jimmy Kimmel Live</a></i>. Although he left the show in 2004, he remained in California. Simmons also frequently writes about his non-sports related personal life in his columns. He often mentions his wife, Kari, but only as "The Sports Gal", and his baby daughter Zoe, born in the spring of 2005.</p>
<p>Simmons now boasts his own section of <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN.com_009f.html" title="ESPN.com">ESPN.com</a>'s Page 2, entitled "Sports Guy's World", and in late 2004 ESPN launched an online cartoon based on his columns. His wife, Kari, occasionally writes mini-articles within Simmons' own Page 2 articles. He has appeared on <a href="../../../v/h/1/VH1_84a4.html" title="VH1">VH1</a>'s <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/I_Love_the_90s%7E_Part_Deux_8462.html" title="I Love the 90s: Part Deux">I Love the 90s: Part Deux</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../c/o/l/Colbert_Report_e7c8.html" title="Colbert Report">Colbert Report</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Rome_Is_Burning_7a40.html" title="Jim Rome Is Burning">Jim Rome Is Burning</a></i>, and is an occasional guest on several sports talk radio shows.</p>

The book is a collection of his columns, with minor changes and lengthy footnotes, leading up to the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_World_Series_ea20.html" title="2004 World Series">2004 World Series</a> victory by the Boston Red Sox.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_13.html" title="March 13">March 13</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> edition of ESPN The Magazine, Simmons revealed that he would be competing in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_World_Series_of_Poker_6a1f.html" title="2006 World Series of Poker">2006 World Series of Poker</a> Main Event. Simmons busted out of the tournament during his first day of play.</p>

Other celebrities that participated were <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela_Anderson_9466.html" title="Pamela Anderson">Pamela Anderson</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedric_the_Entertainer_54f4.html" title="Cedric the Entertainer">Cedric the Entertainer</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_L._Jackson_663e.html" title="Samuel L.

Simmons attributed his success to his extensive knowledge of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a> and to star player <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobe_Bryant_69d8.html" title="Kobe Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>, as well as the Isiah-esque ineptitude of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_NBA_on_TNT_e988.html" title="The NBA on TNT">TNT</a> analyst Smith.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Simmons_90c9.html" title="Edit section: Style">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Style</span></h2>
<p>His writing is characterized by references to <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movies.html" title="Movies">movies</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_shows.html" title="Television shows">television shows</a> such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sopranos_69e1.html" title="The Sopranos">The Sopranos</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../b/e/v/Beverly_Hills_90210_a55f.html" title="Beverly Hills 90210">Beverly Hills 90210</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../e/n/t/Entourage_%28TV_series%29_3b6d.html" title="Entourage (TV series)">Entourage</a></i>, his disdain for the <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_National_Basketball_Association_f3c4.html" title="Women's National Basketball Association">WNBA</a>, male insecurities, and anxiety about the emasculating effects of wives and girlfriends.</p>
<p>He frequently mentions friends and family in his column, and trips to Las Vegas or other gambling venues with his friends. Simmons frequently writes about his gambling, whether it's at the blackjack table or his many parlays during football season. On Fridays during the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">NFL</a> season, he makes picks for every game.</p>
<p>He will also discuss movies (most notably, <i><a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoosiers.html" title="Hoosiers">Hoosiers</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_f51f.html" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shawshank_Redemption_9a97.html" title="The Shawshank Redemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../b/o/o/Boogie_Nights_6746.html" title="Boogie Nights">Boogie Nights</a></i>, <i>the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocky.html" title="Rocky">Rocky</a> series</i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Karate_Kid_e140.html" title="The Karate Kid">The Karate Kid</a></i>), favorite TV shows of the past and present, his many fantasy sports teams, memories regarding professional wrestling (mainly with the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Entertainment_4940.html" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">WWF/E</a>) and video games. One of his ongoing projects is "The Best 72 Sports Movies of the last 33 Years", which he updates in no particular order.</p>
<p>He also occasionally writes columns answering reader's e-mails. He almost always ends these columns with a strange email, followed by the statement "Yup, these are my readers."</p>
<p>One of his more popular columns is his annual Draft Diary, where he discusses watching the <a href="../../../n/b/a/NBA_Draft_6018.html" title="NBA Draft">NBA Draft</a>, usually with his father, and mocks various aspects of it.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Simmons_90c9.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>Simmons is an avid <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Basketball_Association_2e33.html" title="National Basketball Association">NBA</a> fan and is quick to express his opinions over who's doing a good job and who's not. He has heavily criticized Celtics head coach <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doc_Rivers_4522.html" title="Doc Rivers">Doc Rivers</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Clippers_fcf3.html" title="Los Angeles Clippers">Los Angeles Clippers</a> general manager <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgin_Baylor_6841.html" title="Elgin Baylor">Elgin Baylor</a> (who once called Simmons an "asshole"), and especially <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Knicks_22a8.html" title="New York Knicks">New York Knicks</a> coach and general manager <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isiah_Thomas_368d.html" title="Isiah Thomas">Isiah Thomas</a>. This led to Thomas threatening Simmons on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_A._Smith_b9ff.html" title="Stephen A. Smith">Stephen A. Smith</a>'s radio show in early 2006, saying, <i>"If I see this guy Bill Simmons, oh, it's gonna be a problem with me and him."</i> Simmons has claimed that despite his comments in the past, he and Baylor are now on good terms.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Simmons_90c9.html" title="Edit section: Memes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Memes</span></h2>
<p>Simmons responds to issues in the sports world in a unique way, usually putting a different, funny, and unique spin on events, ideas, and theories.</p>
<p><a name="Ewing_Theory" id="Ewing_Theory"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Simmons_90c9.html" title="Edit section: Ewing Theory">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ewing Theory</span></h3>
<p>One of his most used <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomenon.html" title="Internet phenomenon">Internet memes</a>, which was actually the brainchild of David Cirilli, has been the <i>Ewing Theory</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup>, which postulates that certain teams see increased success after the departure of a superstar. Named after <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Ewing_3fa6.html" title="Patrick Ewing">Patrick Ewing</a> of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Knicks_22a8.html" title="New York Knicks">New York Knicks</a>, who many thought to be better when Ewing was injured or otherwise unable to play, the theory relates to a team's improvement just after its star athlete leaves the team for any reason (including being traded or retiring). Other examples noted by Simmons include the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, who traded <a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomar_Garciaparra_bc8b.html" title="Nomar Garciaparra">Nomar Garciaparra</a> mid-season and went on to win their first <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> in 86 years, the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> Los Angeles Lakers, who won a championship in the same season that their superstar <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgin_Baylor_6841.html" title="Elgin Baylor">Elgin Baylor</a> retired after nine games, and after Baylor's Lakers had lost in the finals eight times during his career; or the 2001 <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Patriots_d9e3.html" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, who won <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXXVI_39f0.html" title="Super Bowl XXXVI">Super Bowl XXXVI</a> after an injury to <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Bledsoe_4d3b.html" title="Drew Bledsoe">Drew Bledsoe</a> forced <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Brady_122c.html" title="Tom Brady">Tom Brady</a> into the starting quarterback's role.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Simmons_90c9.html" title="Edit section: Levels of Losing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Levels of Losing</span></h3>
<p>Another recurring Simmons topic is the <i>13 Levels of Losing</i>, where he defines, describes and ranks the most painful ways for a sports team to lose, such as the "Stomach Punch" (a game that ends with an opponent making an improbable and game-winning play; the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_City_Miracle_e7ff.html" title="Music City Miracle">Music City Miracle</a> being a good example), or the "Guillotine" (when your team is hanging tough, but somehow you just know they will fail in the <a href="../../../c/l/u/Clutch_%28sports%29.html" title="Clutch (sports)">clutch</a>). Not surprisingly, given Simmons' background, he ranks Game 6 of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986_World_Series_30ce.html" title="1986 World Series">1986 World Series</a> as the most painful defeat in sports history.</p>

<p>Additional Simmons running conventions include referring to players who are no longer effective as having "a giant salad fork sticking out of their back", the Vengeance Scale, the "Juvenation Machine" (used to describe an athlete or team having a strong comeback year) and "I will now light myself on fire" (a catchphrase he uses whenever forced to admit an unpleasant truth, such as his <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> acknowledgment of <a href="../../../k/o/b/Kobe_Bryant_69d8.html" title="Kobe Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a> as the player most deserving of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005-06_NBA_season_e7a7.html" title="2005-06 NBA season">2006</a> <a href="../../../n/b/a/NBA_MVP_04da.html" title="NBA MVP">NBA MVP</a> award).</p>

<p>Simmons recently made the semi-serious suggestion that sports teams should hire a Vice President of Common Sense who would be an average fan essentially taken off the street and given no behind-the-scenes knowledge. This official would be called in to assess important transactions; his reaction would be a gauge to help the team notice obviously poor decisions arising from such problems as bureaucracy, group-think and hype (by way of introduction to the concept, Simmons said that the VP of Common Sense would have selected <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggie_Bush_802f.html" title="Reggie Bush">Reggie Bush</a> over <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Williams_9e6c.html" title="Mario Williams">Mario Williams</a> in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_NFL_Draft_7574.html" title="2006 NFL Draft">2006 NFL Draft</a>). He uses such terms so frequently that ESPN.com has a glossary of Simmons conventions, with links to articles in which they were used.</p>

<p>Simmons also created the "Reggie Cleveland All-Stars", a list of sports figures whose names would seem to indicate that they are black when they are white, or the converse. (The namesake is <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggie_Cleveland_fbcc.html" title="Reggie Cleveland">Reggie Cleveland</a>, a white former pitcher with a "black-sounding" name.)</p>
<p>Simmons officially designated the following players as All-Stars:</p>
