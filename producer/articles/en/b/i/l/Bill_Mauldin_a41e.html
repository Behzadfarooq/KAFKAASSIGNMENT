<p>Mauldin was born in <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_Park%2C_New_Mexico_1ae7.html" title="Mountain Park, New Mexico">Mountain Park</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>. His grandfather had been a civilian <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> scout in the Apache Wars and his father was an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artilleryman</a> in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Mauldin took courses at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, under the tutoring of <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_VanSickle_Ford_ab37.html" title="Ruth VanSickle Ford">Ruth VanSickle Ford</a>. While in Chicago, Bill Mauldin met <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Lang_Jr._b6db.html" title="Will Lang Jr.">Will Lang Jr.</a> and became fast friends with him. Bill Mauldin entered the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">U.S. Army</a> in 1940 to fight in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Mauldin_a41e.html" title="Edit section: World War II cartoonist">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World War II cartoonist</span></h2>
<p>While in the <a href="../../../4/5/t/45th_Infantry_Division_%28United_States%29_9360.html" title="45th Infantry Division (United States)">45th Infantry Division (United States)</a>, he began drawing cartoons about regular soldiers, called <i>dogfaces</i>. Eventually he created two cartoon infantrymen, Willie and Joe, who became synonymous with the average American <a href="../../../g/i/_/GI_%28term%29_0715.html" title="GI (term)">G.I.</a>. Mauldin began working for <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stars_and_Stripes_3535.html" title="Stars and Stripes">Stars and Stripes</a></i>, the American soldiers' <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newspaper.html" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a>, and his cartoons were viewed by soldiers all over <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and also published in the United States. Willie was on the cover of <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Magazine_89f3.html" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a></i> in 1943 and Mauldin was there in 1958.</p>
<p>Those officers who were raised in the army during peacetime were generally offended by Mauldin, who parodied the spit-shine and obedience to order without question view that was more easily maintained during that time of peace. General <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Patton_c84b.html" title="George Patton">George Patton</a> once summoned Mauldin to his office and threatened to "throw his ass in jail" for "spreading dissent". This after one of Mauldin's cartoons made fun of Patton's demand that all soldiers must be clean-shaven at all times, even in combat. But <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Eisenhower_f660.html" title="Dwight Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, the Supreme Commander, told Patton to leave Mauldin alone, because he felt that Mauldin's cartoons gave the soldiers an outlet for their frustrations. Mauldin told an interviewer later, "I always admired Patton. Oh, sure, the stupid bastard was crazy. He was insane. He thought he was living in the Dark Ages. Soldiers were peasants to him. I didn't like that attitude, but I certainly respected his theories and the techniques he used to get his men out of their foxholes."</p>
<p>Mauldin's cartoons made him a hero to the common soldier. They often credited him with helping them to get through the rigors of the war. Mauldin himself served on the front lines, landing at <a href="../../../a/n/z/Anzio.html" title="Anzio">Anzio</a>, and receiving a <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purple_Heart_4dee.html" title="Purple Heart">Purple Heart</a> after being wounded by an artillery shell fragment. He attained the rank of sergeant and was awarded the Army's <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legion_of_Merit_56bc.html" title="Legion of Merit">Legion of Merit</a> for his cartoons.</p>

Mauldin in 1945</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1945, at the age of 23, Mauldin won the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>. The first collection of his work, <i>Up Front</i>, was a best-seller. The cartoons are interwoven with an impassioned telling of his observations of war.</p>
<p>After WWII he turned to drawing <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_cartoons.html" title="Political cartoons">political cartoons</a> expressing a generally <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_libertarian.html" title="Civil libertarian">civil libertarian</a> view associated with groups such as the <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html" title="ACLU">ACLU</a>. These were not well received by newspaper editors who were hoping for more apolitical Willie and Joe cartoons. But Mauldin's attempt to carry Willie and Joe into civilian life was also unsuccessful, as documented in his memoir, <i>Back Home</i> in 1947.</p>
<p>He abandoned cartooning for a while, working as a <a href="../../../f/i/l/Film_actor.html" title="Film actor">film actor</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freelance_writer.html" title="Freelance writer">freelance writer</a>, and <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illustrator.html" title="Illustrator">illustrator</a> of articles and books, including one on the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>. He drew Willie and Joe only a few times afterwards, once for the funeral of <a href="../../../o/m/a/Omar_Bradley_64e9.html" title="Omar Bradley">Omar Bradley</a> and once for the funeral of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_C._Marshall_f33b.html" title="George C. Marshall">George C. Marshall</a>, both of them considered "soldiers' generals," once for a <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_Magazine_5a21.html" title="Life Magazine">Life Magazine</a> article on the "New Army," once to memorialize fellow cartoonist <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Caniff_367a.html" title="Milton Caniff">Milton Caniff</a>, and possibly a few other times. (He had wanted to have Willie and Joe be killed on the last day of combat, but <i>Stars and Stripes</i> forbade it.)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Mauldin_a41e.html" title="Edit section: Congressional candidate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Congressional candidate</span></h2>
<p>In 1956, he ran unsuccessfully for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a> as a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democrat</a> in New York's 28th Congressional District. Mauldin had this to say about his run for Congress: "I jumped in with both feet and campaigned for seven or eight months. I found myself stumping around up in these rural districts and my own background did hurt there. A farmer knows a farmer when he sees one. So when I was talking about their problems I was a very sincere candidate, but when they would ask me questions that had to do with foreign policy or national policy, obviously I was pretty far to the left of the mainstream up there. Again, I'm an old <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truman.html" title="Truman">Truman</a> Democrat, I'm not that far left, but by their lives I was pretty far left."</p>

<p>In 1958, he returned to cartooning on the editorial pages of the <i><a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Post-Dispatch_036e.html" title="St. Louis Post-Dispatch">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a></i>. The following year, he won a second Pulitzer Prize and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Cartoonist_Society_53e4.html" title="National Cartoonist Society">National Cartoonist Society</a> Award for Editorial Cartooning. In 1961 he received their <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuben_Award_6656.html" title="Reuben Award">Reuben Award</a> as well. In 1962 he moved to the <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Sun-Times_5b28.html" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i>. One of his most famous post-war cartoons appeared in Chicago in 1963, following the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination.html" title="Assassination">assassination</a> of <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F.

<p>Mauldin remained with the <i>Sun-Times</i> until his retirement in 1991. Bill Mauldin was inducted into the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Walk_of_Fame_c855.html" title="St. Louis Walk of Fame">St. Louis Walk of Fame</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_19.html" title="May 19">May 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>.
