<p>Hello all Bill Lawrence partisans on both sides. As <b>this article is about the person Bill Lawrence</b>, I think we can wait until we have a more complete NPOV history detailed here before we add details of the conflict to the main article page. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarltonh_e6a2.html" title="User:Carltonh">Carltonh</a> 16:32, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As Willi Lorenzo Stich has been known exclusively by the personal name <b>Bill Lawrence</b> for at least 40 years, and was even called Bill Lawrence by Jzchak Wacjman as well before the controversy, it is appropriate and NPOV to call him by that name just as much as the names<a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/i/Sting.html" title="Sting">Sting</a> for those individuals. As such, those who erase his name and replace it with Willi L. Stich are intentionally trying to add a POV bias. (Notice Willi = Bill and Lorenzo = Lawrence is intentionally hidden by that.) To whom belongs <b>Bill Lawrence</b> as a trade mark and/or service mark is debated and acknowledged. That the person here <a href="http://nocaster.com/bl45recordsleeve.jpg" class="external free" title="http://nocaster.com/bl45recordsleeve.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://nocaster.com/bl45recordsleeve.jpg</a> is known as <b>Bill Lawrence</b> is continuous 40 year history. All commercial references to Bill address him as a person <a href="http://www.billlawrence.com/Images/scan0004.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.billlawrence.com/Images/scan0004.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.billlawrence.com/Images/scan0004.jpg</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarltonh_e6a2.html" title="User:Carltonh">Carltonh</a> 19:07, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bill Lawrence started "Lawrence Sound Research" (LSR) in 1976. It was the first company to market replacement pickups. In 1982 Jzchak (EZ) Wajcman joined the company as co-owner before the company's bankruptcy in 1984. Jzchak Wajcman also coowned a previous but separate company with Bill, "Lawrence Electro Sound" from 1965-1970. At the time of the LSR bankruptcy, Wajcman purchased the assets of the company from the foreclosing bank.</p>
<p>There continues to exist the controversy whether the "Bill Lawrence" name was one of the assets which Wajcman bought. It had not been officially trademarked by LSR or any previous company while Bill Lawrence was a part of them. However, Bill's name and picture did appear on its products and advertisments. Both Bill Lawence and Wacjman produce pickups using the Bill Lawrence name while the issue is being addressed by the US Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<p>Of primary importance to the legal dispute is whether the <a href="../../../u/s/p/USPTO_ba6b.html" title="USPTO">USPTO</a> will consider <b>Bill Lawrence</b> as a name identifying the individual who called himself by this name or not. Per the <b>Trademark Act Section 2(c), 15 U.S.C. §1052(c); TMEP §§813 and 1206</b>, if the USPTO determines the name represents the person born Willi Lorenz Stich, then Wajcman would be required to have signed written consent that this person authorizes Wajcman to register the name as a legal trademark. Since Wajcman does not have this, and could not get it, his argument that he own this name rests on his claim that <b>Bill Lawrence</b> does not represent a person. However, LSR advertisements identified by photograph and name that the person born Willi Lorenz Stich was Bill Lawrence. The Bill Lawrence name was also used to represent him both as a recording artist and by publications within the music industry.</p>
<p>Bill Lawrence officially filed for a US <a href="../../../s/e/r/Service_mark.html" title="Service mark">service mark</a> for the name <b>Bill Lawrence</b> in May 1998 for <i>Technical consulting in the nature of design and evaluation of stringed musical instruments and accessories, namely, pick-ups, strings and bridges</i> with a first use date of 1962.</p>
<p>Jzchak Wajcman officially filed for a California <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_mark.html" title="Trade mark">trade mark</a> over the name <b>Bill Lawrence</b> in May 2004. In June 2004, Wajcman filed a petition to have Bill's US service mark cancelled. To date, it has not been cancelled and stands "in full force and effect."</p>
<p>Jzchak Wajcman did not officially register the company name <b>Bill Lawrence Guitar Pickups</b> until October 1998 with the San Diego registration number 1998027533.</p>

<p>The following is not NPOV for several reasons. There was no such company officially titled <b>Bill Lawrence Guitar Pickup Company</b> that existed as a creation of Bill Lawrence. It would be useful, however, to find out what date that Jzchak first <b>registered</b> the name <b>Bill Lawrence Guitar Pickup Company</b> because this official title is something that he created after the 1984 bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Jzchak Wajcman's altered/forged assignment document posted above, including 180 pages of other dubious documents, were submitted to the USPTO one year ago on July 15, 2005, not two years ago as the anonymous writer posted above. ( See link below)</p>
<p>All of Jzchak Wajcman's altered/forged documents was then, and is still now, a major issue in both the Federal Court and at the USPTO. Using the USPTO and Federal Court to publish dirty documents does not make them clean.</p>
<p>FYI - Wajcman's cancellation petition at the USPTO is suspended -- confirmed dates 06/21/2005 and 06/19/2006.</p>

<p>The “New Info” highlights the absurds, taken out of context, it is misstating and contradicting the actual facts and events. It gives the real story a false meaning and effect. This distorted statement: <i>“At a recent hearing, Jzchak Wajcman admitted through his attorney that he filed a copy of an altered or forged document”</i> is a clear twist. Wajcman's attorney never made such a statement. This spinning trick will not change the facts that at the courts hearing, the judge ruled against Stich and Wajcman won that TRO motion. The real facts are that Wajcman received the assignment as is from Willi Stich’s wife Joyce Stich on or about June 23, 1982. Wajcman never asked Joyce to take anything out of the Assignment. The Assignment signed by Willi Stich (with or without the six year limitation) is relevant to show that Willi Stich always viewed the “Bill Lawrence” name as a trademark and trade name [edit: and even with the six year limit, the Assignemnet was in effect when the sale of LSR, including the tradename "Bill Lawrence", took place]. Willi Stich entered into a security agreement with Third National Bank on July 8, 1983 under which he pledged certain assets as security, Such assets included without limitation all Stich’s patents, patent applications, copyrights, trademarks, and trade names. The Bank foreclosed on Willi Stich’s assets including the trademark and trade name "Bill Lawrence" and in 1985 Third National Bank in Nashville legally sold and transfered the trade name “Bill Lawrence” to Wajcman. All the rest is nonsense. Wajcman clearly owns the “Bill Lawrence” tradename.</p>

<p>To Who It May Concern -- April 25, 2006</p>
<p><br />
There were two lawsuits filed in the 9th District Federal Court in Southern California in 2005 -- Case No: 05CV1200LAB.</p>
<p><br />
Because of these federal cases, Bill and I want to avoid wasting our valuable time and energy defending ourselves at Wikipedia against all these ridiculous and specious accusations and statements published here by a certain party and his shill --most likely a sock pocket too --as evidenced on the history pages.</p>
<p><br />
Let’s just STOP THE NONSENSE here at Wikipedia and cease functioning as a de facto, extralegal courtroom with no judge or jury -- in other words, please allow the federal court to properly handle the legal issues at hand.</p>
<p><br />
Bill's legendary achievements, as a player, designer and manufacturer, will be detailed in a book he's currently preparing. There is also quite a lot information about Bill published in our industry’s trade books, historical data and magazine articles/interviews that can help readers learn more about him. One recent example, here's a short bio as published by the First World Guitar Congress where Bill held a symposium at Towson University in Maryland in June 2004 on "The Function of the Electric Guitar." Other well-known music industry figures attended the Guitar Congress with Bill include guitarists Les Paul, Eric Johnson, and Andy Summers, as well as Randall Kremer, the spokesperson and chief communications officer for the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>“Bill Lawrence was born in Cologne, Germany on March 24, 1931, about the same time the electric guitar was invented. His father, a skilled machinist and accomplished guitarist, introduced him to the world of engineering and music. When Bill was eight he began playing the violin but, at that age, wasn’t sure if he wanted to be an engineer or a musician. This all changed in 1946 just after the end of the war. While working for the US military government as an interpreter, Bill was exposed to the American Forces Radio Network (AFN). For the first time Bill heard jazz and, more importantly, the electric guitar. Guitarists, like Les Paul, Barney Kessel and Oscar Moore, became his idols, and at sixteen, he switched from violin to the guitar. Before the age of twenty, Bill was one of Europe’s leading guitarist, and by 1953, he became the main endorser for Framus. Europe’s largest guitar manufacturer, Framus would introduce a guitar made to Bill’s specifications -- the Billy Lorento guitar (Bill’s stage name at that time). As an endorser in those early years of the electric guitar, he recognized that it was extremely difficult for guitarists to explain the qualities of sound to guitar builders and engineers. Because of this he began his intensive study in physics and electrodynamics, becoming one of the electric guitar’s first "player-designer-engineers".</p>
<p>Over the past thirty-five years, Bill has published numerous articles on the subject of guitar design, been granted a number of patents, and worked with some of the most respected companies in the guitar industry. He is, without question, a true expert in guitar and string instrument pickup design. His latest designs include the series of pickups (the SCN’s) used in Fender’s top line, highly acclaimed American Deluxe Series Guitars and Basses.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The music industry and guitarist worldwide continue to support Bill Lawrence and his work, and -- I believe I can speak for many of us who‘ve witnessed Bill‘s recent plight -- we are greatly saddened that he must cope with this bizarre situation where someone tries to rewrite history to erase a man’s 40+ year professional identity, namely Bill Lawrence.</p>
<p><br />
The fact is -- Bill’s status as a living legend cannot be so easily eradicated because he is, and continues to be, part of the psyche and heartbeat of our illustrious music scene!</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thank you.</p>

P.S. I will take a stand regarding three matters published here --</p>
<ol>
<li>1. Joyce, Bill’s ex-wife.</li>
<li>2. Bill’s Certificate of Registration for his mark “Bill Lawrence.”</li>
<li>3. The first replacement pickup company.</li>

<p>Joyce is unable to defend herself against the Jzchak Wajcman's allegation of altering/forging the assignment agreement 24 years ago. She passed away in the late 90‘s and can’t speak out against this recent attack.</p>
<p>There was a mistake on Bill‘s initial application filed on May 26, 1998 for his Bill Lawrence mark regarding his place of birth. It was immediately corrected by Bill and his attorney at the trademark office -- evidenced by his "Bill Lawrence Certificate of Registration” appropriately printed which he received from the Trademark Office shortly after the mark was approved on December 28, 1999.................It’s well known, even by Bill himself, where he was born!</p>
<p>In the late 60's and early 70's when Bill had his custom shop in Greenwich Village, Larry Dimarzio joined his team. When Bill left to work with Gibson in the early 70's, Larry continued with Bill's direction and therefore, Larry Dimarzio started the first replacement pickup company.--Becky Lawrence 12:57, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article is a biography of a person whose legal name is apparently "Willi Lorenz Stich", according to the court records. Therefore I am going to move the biography to that page. The article under the name "Bill Lawrence" should cover the business. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 23:32, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bill Lawrence and Willi L Stich share one social security number, and both names have been registered in the United States for more than 35 years. Therefore, Bill Lawrence/Willi L Stich are legally the same person. Will BeBack is incorrect with his above statement.--Becky Lawrence 01:15, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was going by the <s>court records</s> trademark office records, which use "Stich" as the legal name of the subject. If you have a source to indicate otherwise, please add it.

<dd>This part of this discussion is completely ridiculous! Do you question the identity of the tens of millions of Americans of foreign birth who have anglicized their names? Firstly, there are post-1972 court documents that show that the US courts indeed recognise Bill Lawrence as a legal identity of the person also known as Willi Lorenz Stich. Therefore, I’m sure nobody wants to challenge and be in breach of the US courts on such a matter. Secondly, every music magazine for decades has interviewed the person/personality known as Bill Lawrence. He has also been a recording artist under that name! Very few people know who Willi Lorenz Stich is. All these attempts to erase a legal and world famous identity are scandalous. Maybe we should make a complete and utter farce of Wikipedia and list every famous person by his/her birth name just to satisfy those that have an agenda against the man the world knows as Bill Lawrence.</dd>

<dd>As Will said, if there are documents recognizing Bill Lawrence as the gentleman's legal name, could you please specifically identify what those documents are or provide a link if they are accesible via the web? Or perhaps you can specify which magazines/articles you're referring to? No one is suggesting that the identity be erased, simply pointing out that some evidence of your claim is required (see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> for information on our policy about references). Without references, anyone could make a claim to be someone named Bill Lawrence and I'm sure you wouldn't want the wrong person using that identity, right?
