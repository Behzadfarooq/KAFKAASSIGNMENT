<p><b>William Robert Baxter</b> (born <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_3.html" title="November 3">November 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>) is an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> politician. He has been a <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Party_of_Australia_5507.html" title="National Party of Australia">National</a> member of the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Legislative_Council_c522.html" title="Victorian Legislative Council">Victorian Legislative Council</a> representing North Eastern Province since June <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> (excepting a four-month break in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">85</a>). He also served one term in the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Legislative_Assembly_90e6.html" title="Victorian Legislative Assembly">Victorian Legislative Assembly</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a>. Baxter is the current National Party spokesperson for the treasury, finance, industry, industrial relations and the financial services industry. <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_of_2005.html" title="As of 2005">As of 2005</a>, he was the longest-serving member of the current Legislative Council.</p>
<p>Baxter was born and raised in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathalia%2C_Victoria_5288.html" title="Nathalia, Victoria">Nathalia</a> area. He started high school in Nathalia, but graduated from <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>'s prestigious <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_College%2C_Melbourne_54a1.html" title="Scotch College, Melbourne">Scotch College</a>. Despite having completed high school at Scotch College, Baxter returned to his family property at Picola, near Nathalia, and began working as a farmer and grazier. Around the same time, he began to pursue an interest in politics. In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1966.html" title="1966">1966</a>, he became the secretary of his local party branch, and a delegate to the party conference, at the age of only twenty. At the 1969 federal election, he was Deputy Prime Minister <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McEwen_d03e.html" title="John McEwen">Sir John McEwen</a>'s campaign director in his seat of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Murray_d6e1.html" title="Division of Murray">Murray</a>.</p>
<p>Baxter was elected to the Nathalia Shire Council in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>, and in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, became the Shire President. In the same year, he stood as the National candidate for the largely safe National <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Legislative_Assembly_90e6.html" title="Victorian Legislative Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a> seat of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_district_of_Murray_Valley_59d0.html" title="Electoral district of Murray Valley">Murray Valley</a>, replacing the retiring George Moss. Having been easily elected, he juggled the two commitments until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, when he ceased to be Shire President, although he remained on the council. Throughout this term, Baxter also served on the Road Safety Committee. In the leadup to the 1976 state election, the Murray Valley electorate underwent major boundary changes, and as a result, Baxter chose to contest the adjacent seat of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_district_of_Benambra_ffb0.html" title="Electoral district of Benambra">Benambra</a>. Baxter polled the most primary votes, but though it had been a National seat since <a href="../../../1/9/3/1932.html" title="1932">1932</a>, Benambra fell to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Lieberman_ae65.html" title="Lou Lieberman">Lou Lieberman</a> of the rival conservative <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal Party</a> on preferences.</p>
<p>After losing his seat in the Legislative Assembly, Baxter made a comeback in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, when he switched to the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_Legislative_Council_c522.html" title="Victorian Legislative Council">Legislative Council</a> and successfully contested a by-election in the safe National seat of North Eastern Province. He received his first parliamentary position the following year, when he was appointed as Deputy Leader of the National Party in the Legislative Council and Party Whip. He was again returned in a regular election the following year. After the election, he nominated for a position on the Public Works Committee, and served there until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, when he switched to the Natural Resources and Environment Committee.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, Baxter resigned from the Legislative Council to contest the federal seat of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Indi_04d2.html" title="Division of Indi">Indi</a>, challenging sitting Liberal member <a href="../../../e/w/e/Ewen_Cameron_b8e7.html" title="Ewen Cameron">Ewen Cameron</a>. The bid was unsuccessful, as Baxter came third behind Cameron and the ALP candidate, and Cameron was easily re-elected on Baxter's preferences. Baxter subsequently contested the by-election for his old seat in February <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, and was once again elected to the Legislative Council. Over the next three years, he served on three more committees, responsible for Economic and Budget Review, WorkCare and Social Development.</p>
<p>Baxter retained his previous portfolios after being re-elected in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, and received another promotion in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, when he became Leader of the National Party in the Legislative Council. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, he was made Shadow Minister for Roads and Ports as part of the Liberal-National <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition_%28Australia%29_d450.html" title="Coalition (Australia)">coalition</a> opposition. Two years later, <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Kennett_0196.html" title="Jeff Kennett">Jeff Kennett</a> led the coalition to an election victory, and Baxter became Minister for Roads and Ports in the new government. However, the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> election saw a changed ratio between the two parties, and the National Party lost one of its portfolios to the Liberals. As a result, Baxter returned to the backbenches, and instead took up a position as Chairman of the Parliament House Completion Authority, which oversaw the renovation of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_House%2C_Melbourne_2f52.html" title="Parliament House, Melbourne">Parliament House</a> in order to comply with the original architectural designs.</p>
<p>The coalition between the Liberal and National parties again fractured after the Kennett government suffered a surprise defeat at the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> election. This meant that a range of new portfolios had to be filled, in order to cover all the areas that had previously been overseen by members of the larger Liberal Party. When these were allocated after the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> election, Baxter once again was in line for promotion, obtaining the high-profile portolios of the treasury, finance, industry, industrial relations and the financial services industry. In addition, he is also a member of the Legislative Council Privileges and Public Accounts and Estimates Committees.</p>
<p>Baxter has been an active member of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Parliamentary_Association_d04e.html" title="Commonwealth Parliamentary Association">Commonwealth Parliamentary Association</a> for many years, having served on its executive committee and attended numerous conferences, going back as far as <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. In September <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, he made a bid for the position of executive committee chairman, but was defeated by <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>'s <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Speller_1ebe.html" title="Bob Speller">Bob Speller</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of reforms to the Legislative Council made after the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_legislative_election%2C_2002.html" title="Victorian legislative election, 2002">2002 election</a>, Baxter's two-member electorate was abolished and replaced with a larger, five-member electorate. After fellow incumbent <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damian_Drum_c126.html" title="Damian Drum">Damian Drum</a> won the first spot on the National Party ticket, Baxter decided to transfer back to the Legislative Assembly, and he hoped to regain the seat of Benambra for the Nationals at the upcoming <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_legislative_election%2C_2006.html" title="Victorian legislative election, 2006">2006 election</a>. He polled third behind <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilley_2c98.html" title="Bill Tilley">Bill Tilley</a> of the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal Party</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor</a> candidate <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Mahood_a30b.html" title="Lisa Mahood">Lisa Mahood</a>.</p>
