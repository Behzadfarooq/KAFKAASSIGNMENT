<p>I don't know who changed the title to "Billie", but if they can't even spell his name right, they shouldn't be making an official wikipedia page about him or moving things around. James Wan, the director of Saw, is the CREATOR of Billy. You know, he sat down one day and constructed him for this movie and named him, and seeing as EVERY time he talks about him he spells it with a 'y', I would say that is dandy proof that "ie" is a load of crap. Please stop making the mistake and passing it on to others.</p>
<p>If you would even like to go over and ask James to get it straight from the horse's mouth, you can do it at the House of Jigsaw (official Saw) message board, or myspace at <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=9960495&amp;MyToken=5adfb21a-d6b0-48de-9ff2-a7de4458dfd6" class="external free" title="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=9960495&amp;MyToken=5adfb21a-d6b0-48de-9ff2-a7de4458dfd6" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=9960495&amp;MyToken=5adfb21a-d6b0-48de-9ff2-a7de4458dfd6</a> . He will tell you that "Billie" is the incorrect spelling.</p>
<p>And, actually, "Billie" is the spelling for a girl.</p>

<dd>Don't know the specifics, but I recall when he was originally made he was pretty low-budget and was moved by strings and once the series became more high budget he was able to be more mobile and move by himself.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 23:44, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It should be in the actual article. But, he never had strings, and there have not been any modifications to the original Billy used in SAW 1. They made 2 robotic Billys used with romote control eyes for SAW 2, and another one for SAW 3. They figured that the real Billy was too fragile and couldn't handle the set any longer, seeing as James made him and he isn't professional at it. He was falling apart occasionally, so once they had more money, they made more high-tech new ones. I personally like the real one best.</p>

<p>It shows Jigsaw creating Billy in the third film. Why does it say "He's rumored to have been created by the series's primary antagonist John Kramer". It's not a rumor if they show Jigsaw actually MAKING him. As for the supposed novel being made, are there any sources to supply the rumor? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackOfHearts_6714.html" title="User:JackOfHearts">JackOfHearts</a> 05:50, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

--In my opinion, it isn't clear that he's making it. It was Saw 3. How do you know he wasn't just fixing him or /rebuilding/ him after Adam beat him with the baseball bat? Billy's origin is a secret, and it's nice that way as of now.</p>
<p>As for the novel, I added it because it actually was true. I don't mess around and post about things that aren't real, especially since I'm also a big SAW fan. The only reason I couldn't supply a citation is that none of it is open or ready for public display. It also doesn't help that it's an outside/homage project only being talked about by some of the SAW community that knows of the author, and not a big heavy-duty thing supported by Lion's Gate. I simply heard about it. If you'd like to give me more time, there could eventually be a link. Iwantasmoothie 11:35, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The puppet-making scene in Saw 3 was a flashback taking place BEFORE he kidnapped Amanda, and thus before Adam was ever kidnapped. And even it wasn't, saying that he was only fixing it after Adam gave Billy the beatdown is speculation and original research.</dd>
<dd>If there's a link, fine. But until then don't post it unless it can be verified.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberGhostface_739d.html" title="User:CyberGhostface">CyberGhostface</a> 11:32, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be alot of controversy: Is the puppet's name spelled "B-I-L-<b>L-Y</b>" or "B-I-L-<b>L-I-E</b>"?

<p>--It is not spelled "Billie". That was an error made in some of the special feature SAW dvds. Nobody knows who wrote the title for it in the extra, but James Wan, who created and named Billy, always spells it with a 'y'. In fact, that was always how it was spelled until the mistake was seen and people started using it for some reason.Iwantasmoothie 11:35, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
