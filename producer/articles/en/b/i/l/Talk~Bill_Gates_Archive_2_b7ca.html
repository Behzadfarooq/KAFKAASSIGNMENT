<p>The United States Constitution in fact forbids American officials, but not citizens from accepting honors and titles from foreign princes:</p>
<p>No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.</p>
<p>As such it is not proper at all to list Gates' KBE in this article as a way of identifying him. It is against the spirit, and if Profit is construed as being a CEO of a modern public corporation, Gates' acceptance of this bauble may be illegal.</p>
<p>Very little precedent exists prior to the acceptance by the convicted felon Caspar Weinberger, former US official responsible for Contra destabilitization of Nicaragua, of a knighthood. NO US official or public figure has until the 1980s willingly accepted a British knighthood to my knowledge. Today, at a minimum, one would expect that the figure would not want part of his signature.</p>
<p>Therefore I have removed KBE. It biases the article towards a recent Anglo American "special relationship".</p>
<p>Away with this bauble. It is silly. It is arrogant. It sets up a New Class of people of modest accomplishments.</p>
<p>That is of course only my opinion, but the article violates good NPOV style by an inappropriate foreign title.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are quite right that the KBE does not belong in Bill Gates's name, if for no other reason than that neither Bill Gates nor Microsoft nor either the New York Times or the Washington Post use the KBE designation. There was a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Gates_Archive_1_6ffb.html#Stop_removing_.22KBE.22_from_the_end_of_his_name.21.21.21" title="Talk:Bill Gates/Archive 1">long discussion</a> about this, which is now archived. –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 11:26, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A title such as KBE, CMG (commander of the order of St Michael and St George, known waggishly as call me god), KCMG (knight commander of the order of St Michael and St. George), or GCMG (grand commander, etc., God calls me god) is only appropriate as an annunciator within a moral community that accepts the titles as central.</p>
<p>For example, the only people who in America follow their names, used as annunciators, with "PhD" are usually out to hornswoggle the public with liver pills or Intelligent Design, which is why we Americans say, never play cards with a man named Doc.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Er Bill Gates isn't the CEO of Microsoft, as the article clearly states. Also KBE is honorary title not a title of nobility <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:55, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, he's the Chief Visionary, or something like that, and has been since around 2000. The reasoning stands. And I am well aware that when Americans receive these titles, they are qualified as "honorary" to make us forget our Constitution. This changes nothing, for they are honorary and titular for British recipients, providing no power sacred or secular, only the power to rather more lord it over the working people in a new aristocracy that has based its wealth on theft.<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinoza1111_b2f9.html" title="User:Spinoza1111">Spinoza1111</a> 04:59, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I repeat, these honors and titles were not accepted, or if accepted, not publicized, by Americans until the convicted felon Caspar Weinberger and the senile old fool Ronald Reagan saw fit to accept these baubles in violation of the spirit of American equality<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinoza1111_b2f9.html" title="User:Spinoza1111">Spinoza1111</a> 04:59, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Things like calling Ronald Reagan a "senile old fool" are the very thing that drive the credibility of Wikipedia into the toilet.71.244.163.156 02:42, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>They have been REFUSED by several noble fellows including Mr. David Bowie because they encapsulate thousands of years of unjust expropriation and bullying.<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinoza1111_b2f9.html" title="User:Spinoza1111">Spinoza1111</a> 04:59, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He's the Chief Software Architect. And to be honest, I don't even get what your argument is. Are you saying anyone involved in any management position in a US company is now allowed to accept an honourary title or what? And does this mean a British citizen or a citizen from a country where titles, honourary or otherwise? are allowed can't be in any management position on a company? You seem rather confused as well. By definition, an honourary title which you yourself admit provides no power can't be considered a title of nobility. Therefore your argument that it is against the spirit of the constitution is rather silly as the constitution seems primarily to refer to titles of nobility, which provide power, not honorary titles which provide nothing. An honourary title is a recognition of achievement and there may be debate in the merits behind who they are awarded but an honourary is an award therefore more equivalent to awards such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Honorary Citizen of the United States, Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in the USA, or for that matter the awards which are provided by non govermental organisations worldwide such as the Nobel Prize. In any case, the honourary part has little to do with the US constitution, it has to do with what the British want... Also, it is not publicly known why David Bowie rejected the CBE. For all we know, he might have been offended that it was a CBE not a KBE. Or maybe he wanted it but was afraid it would effect his reputation. He himself knows, but since he has never explained (and even if he had, how could we know he was giving the real reason). BTW, the US if anything is properly the most guilty of unjust expropriation and bullying over the past few decades. Really your rant is rather silly. You sound like some rabid US conservative who probably believes the US should blow the rest of the world to hell to spread 'freedom'. In any case, we have already established that the KBE should be part of his name in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 16:22, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>BTW I just read that Colin Powell received an honourary KCB in 1993. Yes I'm referring to the man who was secretary of state from 2000-2004. The shock the horror.

<dd>Just noticed this discussion, having already added info on his KBE. It needs to be listed as this is a factual encyclopeadia. Whether or not he uses it, or whether or not he was right to be awarded it is immaterial; the event took place. Besides, many notable Americans are KBEs. I accept there is a case for not putting <b>KBE</b> after his name, but that fact it was awarded must be noted. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrunners_a7d8.html" title="User:Grunners">Grunners</a> 22:57, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If it is true that MSFT has only 32 patents to its name, how come the article states that it has "thousands" of patents? Can someone please verify the true number of patents that MSFT holds, and revise the article accordingly? I rather doubt that the company has 1000s of patents -- how long have they been in business after all? If you were talking about truly innovative, long-lasting companies like IBM or AT&amp;T (Bell Labs), that would be a different story. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJalabi99_f6c7.html" title="User:Jalabi99">Jalabi99</a> 02:16, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Gates served as the CEO of the company until 1998 when Steve Ballmer took the position. Gates continues to serve as a chairman of the board at the company and also as a position he created for himself entitled "Chief Software Architect".</dd>
</dl>
<p>With regards to the above, my understanding is the original reason for the move is widely believed to have been in preparation for the possible split-up of Microsoft. Gates wanted to be in the company that developed Office etc not the OS company.

<dd>I believe he created that position because he did not want to mess with everything that a CEO has to. Instead, he wanted to work mainly on the software part of his company (including the OS).
<dl>
<dd>Bill Gates is a geek at heart (and I mean that in a good way). With challenge of running a corporation the size of Microsoft, being the CEO meant that he had very little time to guide the technology. Relinquishing the CEO position to Ballmer, and giving him the position of CSA allowed Gates to spend more time on the tehcnology strategy leaving the business strategy in depth to Ballmer. <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 19:49, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>It says at the top of the article that Bill Gates' income is just $1 million dollars. If you read further, just his property tax is more than one million dollars (see: "...the annual property tax is just over $1 million.").</p>
<p>He's got to be making more than just a million a year.</p>

<dd>According to Forbes website he sells 20 million shares a quater, MSFT stock right now is @ $27 as of 01/06 so that is about he gets $540 million plus or minus every other quarter 4 times a year I think he can manage paying his 1 million dollar property tax a year and doesn't care how much he get paid at Microsoft because he is the richest guy in the world.
<dl>
<dd><i>Income</i> and <i>salary</i> are two different things—as I'm quite sure the <a href="../../../i/r/s/IRS_367a.html" title="IRS">IRS</a> would argue—and should not be confused.

<dd>Yeah, and when you're a multi-billionaire, the "salary" from your official job position doesn't mean much anymore since even if you get paid $10 million, it's less than 1% of your net worth after taxes. Warren Buffett, the second richest guy and a friend of Gates, pays himself $0.1 million (but he's frugal so he can probably live on that alone). The boys behind Google pay themselves $1 per year, at which point the salary becomes just a marketing trick. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShawnc_13f4.html" title="User:Shawnc">Shawnc</a> 21:23, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I don't even think the $540 million would entirely qualify as income. Only the capital gain would. The rest is merely a liquidation of assets.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">IQ</span></h2>
<p>Any reason IQ was dropped from early life? Ya, IQ flaunting can be a bit of a pissing match but it's still on topic. Perhaps re-add in line regarding SATs. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:13, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do think that the man is unquestionably very intelligent and certainly gifted. However, it would be a logical fallacy to rank him up there with Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein simply because of the fortune he has amassed, and the fact that he is extremely computer literate and business savvy.</p>
<p><b>He has an IQ of 160 according to who?</b> There are many anonymous sites on the net with spurious lists of IQs. These are generally not credible sources. Now, some are based on serious studies. However, those are based on extremely well documented observations of truly profoundly and globally intellectually gifted persons.</p>
<p>I have read a few nebulous articles stating that Bill Gates has an IQ of 160, 165, and even 180. In one of them there was a ludicrous section on how to tell a person's IQ based on their handwriting. Unless this information is coming from a person who is a recognized authority on such matters (with an actual doctorate), it really isn't very useful for the purpose of Encyclopedia articles.</p>
<p><b>To my knowledge, no official score from a test conducted by a licensed psychologist or other such psychometric specialist on Mr. Gates indicating his IQ has been released to the public</b>. <i>If I were to create a web site and make a list of people that I believe (based on my own intuition) have IQ's of greater than 150 this would not be evidence.</i></p>
<p><b>His SATs were 1590 according to who?</b> At the time he got into Harvard the bottom requirements were 1370 or possibly lower and let's not forget that he dropped out. When George W. Bush was admitted into Yale with his SAT score of 1206, the standard for Yale was supposed to be 1330. Both come from rich families with more than enough influence to get a person without an extraordinary academic record into Yale or Harvard.</p>
<p><b>To my knowledge, Mr. Gates' SAT scores have never officially been released to the public, although he may have stated what he recalled they were in an interview.</b> However, it would be better to have a link to the interview where he stated what his SAT was as a reference, than a list said to be based on what he <i>might have said</i> to the press at some other time. Anything less than that really should be left out. There was a link provided in the article as a reference to his SAT score, but it refers to what was stated in a press inquiry. Anything less than the actual record of the SAT score isn't proof. To quote the article: "Here are a few SATs of some well-known Americans, <b>based on their own recollections or press inquiries</b>." The article doesn't even tell you in what publication he said what his SAT was.</p>
<p>Also, since about 1993 the position of organizations such as Mensa on SAT scores is that they are not a good indicator of IQ as they are more involved in academic minutia than in critical reasoning and creative problem solving. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScifiterX_690f.html" title="User:ScifiterX">ScifiterX</a> 04:55, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
On top of that, IQ tests aren't generally used to measure one's alleged "intelligence"; they are designed to determine whether one needs special education services. Never has an assessment been so misinterpreted and misused by people with political axes to grind.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dispute with Gazpacho and Request for Mediation</span></h2>
<p>With a wealthy background (Gates was born with a million dollar trust fund set up by his grandfather in 1955, who was a national bank vice-president) he was able to access computers from a very early age (See:<a href="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~an497637/project1.doc" class="external free" title="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~an497637/project1.doc" rel="nofollow">http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~an497637/project1.doc</a>). Gates has denied having a trust fund while at Harvard in a Playboy Magazine interview but did not specifically deny being born with a trust fund.</p>
<p>I would note that the trust is part of the public record and has been reported in various biographies of Bill Gates</p>
<p>One biography that provides evidence for the Bill Gates trust fund is - www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671880748?v=glance</p>
<dl>
<dd>Let's review your basis for your edit:
<ul>
<li>The biography you refer to, which I have not examined personally but would be willing to if the local libraries have it (very likely);</li>
<li>An assertion, which you have never cited, that Gates personally admitted having a trust fund, despite saying that he didn't;</li>
<li>An assertion that the trust fund is public record, which you have not sourced, I have not verified , and is suspect because you raised it rather late;</li>
<li>A few random internet sources that are no better than your own say-so.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do not deny that there is a widespread belief that Gates had a trust fund and I am not trying to remove that from the article. But his statement responding to the allegations is <i>not</i> specific to Harvard. He says "never had any trust funds of any kind." This is a statement directly from Gates in a magazine that, whatever else you might say about it, is not known to falsify interviews. I am determined to keep the quote in the article. I am determined to prevent any attempt to misrepresent what Gates said. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 18:34, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to put in my two bits: trusts are technically not a matter of public record in American law, unlike wills. Trusts are usually administered privately. It is up to the beneficiaries or trustees to petition a court if there is a disagreement over the administration of the trust. Otherwise a trust will operate without court supervision, just like most private companies.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The point is that it's unlikely that Bill Gates' trust fund (assuming one exists) is actually public record unless it is involved in something where paperwork has to be filed with the government (for example, if title to real property is held in the name of the trust). --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 22:45, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Until this dispute can be resolved I think both points of view should be expressed via the inclusion of the trust fund information with the .edu source and the Playboy Magazine quote.</p>
<p>I would note the language claiming Bill Gates was born with a trust fund stood for quite sometime before Gazpacho decided to start editing it out based on anecdotal information. I have attempted to present both points of view to maintain neutrality.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia guidelines say to attribute claims as specifically as possible, particularly when there is a dispute; see <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_terms_687f.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms">Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms</a>. Therefore, "several biographers" instead of "reportedly", and "Gates said it in Playboy in 1994" rather than "some people claim." <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 23:51, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I will concede to the "several biographers" language but I will not concede to the fact that Gates claimed to never have a trust fund period as the language is ambiguous. I believe Bill Gates is claiming he never used trust funds while at Harvard since the question he was asked was direct to that point and his sentence stipulates to funding being provided to him for attending Harvard which may have been paid for via a trust fund. I believe Bill Gates is claiming he never directly had control over any trust funds while attneding Harvard but that is not tantamount to a specific claim that his grandfather did not establish a trust fund for him.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Considering the language he used that seems to be wishful thinking on your part, but whatever. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 00:17, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It was a long interview and Bill Gates did not fully elucidate what specifically he meant. Also, it is very common for celebrities to mispeak during interviews and it is my belief that the carefully researched work of several academic biographers trumps a single answer during a single interview in terms of credence. However, in the spirit of neutrality both points of view should be presented until the dispute can be fully resolved.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As promised, I checked the book you referred to. On page 5 it calls the trust fund story fiction. I'd appreciate it if in the future you provide sources that check out. A direct quote from the source would be helpful. I did not find one biographical work in two libraries, even <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_X._Cringely_a73e.html" title="Robert X. Cringely">Robert X. Cringely</a>'s, that asserted the trust fund as fact. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 01:19, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It may perhaps be helpful in order to mediate this dispute to understand <i>why</i> in particular the issue is so important to either of you. For example, while I have absolutely no clue about the trust fund issue, I am, however, quite familiar with certain key events in Bill Gates' career that contributed to his unprecedented success. I'd be glad to share them with you, but first I'd like to know what's at the bottom of this dispute. Is it simply a case of "Bill-Gates-gets-too-much-credit-because-he-was-a-spoiled-brat-born-with-a-silver-spoon-in-his-mouth" vs. "Bill-Gates-is-perhaps-the-most-intelligent-and-business-savvy-person-to-ever-walk-the-Earth"? <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoomis51_de2c.html" title="User:Loomis51">Loomis51</a> 01:43, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I had read in a Wikipedia article on him that Bill Gates contributed a few thousand dollars to the George Bush campaign in 2004. --66.81.193.127 13:02, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is correct.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Charitable Motives?</span></h2>
<p>I am just wondering how someone who has spent 1/3 of their entire life income on charity is still embroiled in controversy as to the motives of their generous nature. In the article, Bill Gates III is claimed to have spent more than $25 000 000 000 on charity. How is it that people STILL think that he has motives. It is so pathetic to see people have to pick and knaw at people who are rich, even though they donate BILLIONS of dollars to charity. Can't anyone see that Bill Gates alone has helped so many people through he and his wife's foundation? Why do people still critisize him?--138.130.220.28 02:20, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I read the article cited as "proof" and it is BS.

<p>65.40.139.84 00:13, 31 March 2006 (UTC) One could easily argue that any man that spends $2000 on a door knob isn't really that serious about helping others, think of how many people could have been helped if bill lived like a normal middle class person had all the money he spent on a rich lifestyle. Real rich people to admire are those that live well below there means and actually attempt to extract the most benefit for others despite themselves, while retaining enough income to be secure. IMHO excess is in fact considered immorral, this is why rich people are constantly knawed at, in fact many rich people support wittingly or unwittingly creation of poverty through their own corporate interests, through the "musical chairs" of moving to other countries and "pump and dump" on their societies until labour gets too expensive, then onto the next country.</p>

<p>The category-footer of the page indicates he is an athiest. Can this be confirmed?</p>
<p>In a 20/20 interview of 1998, Barbara Walters asked him if he believed in God. His reply was that he had a religous upbringing. He didn't specify which religion, but certainly there was no indication of him being athiest.</p>

<dd>If he didn't explicitly say, "There is no god" (or something similar), then perhaps Wikipedia shouldn't claim he is an atheist. Maybe your story is correct, but it doesn't count as verification.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Critical passage in intro</span></h2>
<p>My reasons for my particular wording are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various people have accused Gates, personally, of building and maintaining his fortune by fraud, theft, copyright infringement, anticompetition, sabotage, and perjury. They're on record, even if they haven't gone to the government.</li>
<li>With so many accusations, there's no reason to single out anticompetition in the intro, even though the US v. Microsoft case is a useful recent example.</li>
<li>The government authorities that find against Microsoft aren't always courts. Some of them are regulatory commissions.</li>

<p>I think it is very important to convey that even despite Gates' intelligence, foresight, and philanthropy, there are records of activity that was anticompetitive and limited consumer choice. Further, these accounts have been tried, appealled, retried and upheld by courts in the United States (findings of felony antitrust violations, Sherman Act 1 and 2, as well as dozens of state statutes governing competition and business practices) and similar findings in Europe and Korea. These are not accusations by competitors or individuals (to date, no court has ever ruled on a competition complaint filed by Microsoft's competitors), but accusations brought to court and tried by federal authorities at the highest levels of the US government.

<p>Actually I was talking about the "inconsistent" bit. I know Gates read discarded listings; anyone interested in programming does. But the "inconsistent" remark is weasel-worded. I'm pretty sure I wrote it myself as a tone-down of blatant POV, but I don't remember exactly what was there before.</p>
<p>I don't like the first two sections of this article very much. The "Early life" section is embarrassingly short (not mentioning, for example, Gates's many small-time business deals before Traf-O-Data), and there's a lot about Microsoft that has no clear connection to Gates. People have a tendency to personify Microsoft as Gates when the reality is more complicated. And many of the other sections stray off topic.

<p>Use of the term "closed source" -- a backward construction from "open source" -- is misleading, as it implies that a conscious choice was made in the false dichotomy between an "open source" model and a "closed source" model. What is termed "closed source" is the normal legal relationship between content creators and content users. Under the copyright laws normally in effect in all industrial countries (i.e., under the Berne Convention copyright treaty), this content is private property as soon as it is created. It is only through carefully written licenses that software can be made "open source." When Microsoft started selling software, it was doing so as a business. Why should it have been expected to create complex licenses to deprive itself of control over its product? -- Bob</p>

I'm not sure why they chose him (his ongoing involvement in the company)? At that, there are several entries on the Times list that come right out and say "Forest and John" or "Karl and Theo" and then group the money.</p>

<p>Hi Oscar, I apologize for reverting your edits but I just think that it is important to not only keep the arrow figure that states how Gates' wealth has changed in the past year, but also to indicate that Robson Walton and the rest of his family are indeed richer than Gates, but each family member alone is NOT.

<dd>I agree. If we're talking an arrest that changed his life (a la O.J. Simpson) then it may be important for the section, but it really isn't---it's trivial at best. I don't think it is a violation of NPOV, but it certainly is something that might piss him off if he saw it. Who the hell wants their record for all to see? Not me.
<dl>
<dd>This is a silly change. The mugshot photo of Bill Gates is not NPOV, and does nothing to besmirch his reputation. If he was embarrassed by it, I can assure you that, as the world's richest man and owner of one of the largest photo archives on earth (Corbis), if he wanted to suppress it, he could have done so long ago. I mean, he is SMILING in the photo after all -- he took the whole arrest thing as a great joke. The arrest was tangentially pertinent to his professional career, since it was for speeding in a car he purchased with proceeds of his early years in Microsoft. As a compromise, I propose that it be re-added but in a section marked "Trivia" or something.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Green Profit and Red Loss Indicator Discussion</span></h2>
<p>I have been noticing several edits by users with the sole purpose of changing the red loss indicator arrow to a green profit indicator arrow. Clearly, there is a bit of confusion on the matter. The red loss arrow does in NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, indicate DEBT. I implore you to look at other well written articles such as the one on Warren Buffet, or other billionaires whose fortunes have slowly decreased over the years. The red loss indicator is shown to indicate that the individual in question has a current net worth that is lower TODAY, than it was the LAST TIME the mentioned Forbes/Fortune article indicated his or her net worth. Please leave the indicator as a red loss arrow, since Bill Gates' wealth was estimated at 51 billion dollars on the 400 richest americans list, and is now estimated at 50 billion on the world's richest people for 2006. Please post your thoughts within this discussion, or direct them to me. I wish to enforce this with a passion, due to the immense confusion it is causing with Wikipedia terminology/jargon. Thank you. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheelectricchild_5615.html" title="User:Theelectricchild">Theelectricchild</a> 18:08, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your responses. While you are correct in that the Wikipedia definition is ambiguous, one could counter-argue your point by asking how exactly is Bill Gates' worth a company <i>profit</i>? (Indicated by the previously used green arrow). I will try to get furthur clarification on the definition, but more discussion is welcome.

<dd>After furthur consideration, it is my belief that the profit and loss indicator definitions that you are referring to should only be used for corporation information boxes. (IE <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing.html" title="Boeing">Boeing</a>, etc). I would think that a more appropriate solution is to develop another alternative definition for the indicators that pertain to individuals. If we go by the fact that the loss indicator depicts debt, then we would have to make the appropriate changes to individuals such as <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Buffet_d433.html" title="Warren Buffet">Warren Buffet</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robson_Walton_98f2.html" title="Robson Walton">Robson Walton</a>, and others to a green profit arrow correct? The problem I have with this, is that it contradicts the source that we are getting our information from, which is primarily Forbes.com. The lists in Forbes use a similar "key" for net worth, with up arrows indicating a positive change from a previous estimation, and down arrows indicating a negative change from a previous estimation. As a Wikipedia administrator, would it be possible for you to bring the attention of forming a new definition or perhaps more clarification on the indicators? If you think it is trivial, then that is perfectly fine, but asking never hurts!

<p>If you want to know what kind of person Bill Gates really is read his own words below as they appear in the court record.</p>
<p>I doubt my edit will remain in this article due to Bill Gate's power and wealth, but from what I've read this is the true story.</p>
<p>Bill Gates referred IBM to Professor <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Kildall_933b.html" title="Gary Kildall">Gary Kildall</a>, the founder of Digital Research, but when they did not reach immediate agreement with him they went back to Gates, who offered to fill their need himself. He licensed a modified version of CP/M from <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Paterson_803a.html" title="Tim Paterson">Tim Paterson</a> of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Computer_Products_9154.html" title="Seattle Computer Products">Seattle Computer Products</a> for $56,000, and IBM shipped it as <a href="../../../p/c/-/PC-DOS_b5de.html" title="PC-DOS">PC-DOS</a>.</p>
<p>Seattle Computer products needed an operating system for a computer they were making that was going to use the Intel 8088 chip. They went to Gary Kildall and asked him to modify CP/M so it would run on Intel's 8088 chip. Gary Kildall told Seattle Computer Products he didn't have the time. So, Seattle Computer Products asked one of their programmers by the name of Tim Paterson to write a patch for CP/M to allow it to run on the Intel chip. Tim Paterson did so, and named "his" creation "Quick and Dirty Dos." Neither Tim Paterson nor Seattle Computer Products ever got permission from Gary Kildall to modify CP/M. Even if permission had been granted, what Tim Paterson wrote would have belonged to Seattle Computer Products not to Tim Paterson, since he created it for Seattle Computer products while he was their salaried employee. Gary Kildall could have sued Bill Gates, Microsoft and IBM, but was personally averse to litigation. Eventually, he did sue Bill Gates, Microsoft and IBM, and won a relatively modest settlement.</p>

<p>You will find reference to the lawsuit on Gary Kildall's Wikipedia webpage. I am not absolutely certain of this fact. I will remove reference to it in the article. But it is inconceivable to me that any potential defendant was left out. When a suit like this is filed, plaintiffs must list all potential defendants.</p>
<p>The other part of the story that this article fails to discuss is this:</p>
<p>MS-DOS became the de facto standard because IBM used it in their PC. Bill Gates then refused to sell MS-DOS to any computer manufacturer that offered micro-computers with any other OS. This was a clear violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Bill Gates continued this illegal practice for many years, and it enabled him to build his company to an unprecedented level. When no US Attorney General would enforce the law, more than a dozen Attorney Generals from different states filed suit against Microsoft. They won their case, but the companies that lost out were never made whole. In the early years of MS-DOS, Professor <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Kildall_933b.html" title="Gary Kildall">Gary Kildall</a>, himself, came-out with a competitive product called DR DOS. Microsoft refused to sell MS-DOS to any computer manufacturer who also offered their customers DR DOS. Since no computer manufacturer could remain in business without selling MS-DOS, they all caved-in to Microsoft's demands, and Dr Dos and Gary Kildall lost out again.</p>
<p>I would have bought DR DOS, if I had known the truth at the time. I really feel bad for Professor Kildall. From what I understand, he was a true genius. I don't understand how we let Bill Gates get away with this.</p>
<p>I admire George Soros, Jim Wales (another successful trader), Steve Wazniak, Steve Jobs and all true geniuses. But it seems the real story of Bill Gates and Microsoft is a sad one, one where disregard for the law, and retalatory threats paid-off.</p>

<p>Though still the dominant operating system for personal computers, MS-DOS is a dinosaur. By not adapting to the changing needs of program developers and users, DOS has become a dead end on the evolutionary path and is headed for extinction. It's played out, unfixable, and hopelessly inadequate for supporting the applications of the 1990s.</p>

<p>I deeply resent your uncivil insinuation. How would you like it if I wrote: "Warren, if your desire is to molest little boys, you won't get far with it on Wikipedia." Promoting a smear campaign is the last thing I wish to do. I just want everyone to know the truth about Bill Gates, and the truth about Professor Gary Kildall. I believe the truth about Bill Gates is very unflattering and not widely known. I am sorry to rain on your holy cow.</p>
<p>The facts speak for themselves. It sounds to me like you want Wikipedia to sugarcoat Bill Gates' life, and you are saying Wikikpedia supports your effort. You may be right, but I certainly hope not. I have never met Bill Gates. I have no personal grudge against him, nor any reason to have a personal grudge against him. I am happy when people succeed honestly as George Soros has, as Steve Wazniak and Steve Jobs have, as Jim Wales has. I dislike it when people stomp on other people, steal their intellectual property, violate Federal law and gain from their activity.</p>
<p>I am amazed that people have the positive view of him that they do. I get the feeling that people admire success no matter how it is achieved. Successful people mesmerize the average citizen into believing they are idols, heros and Gods and can do no wrong. Dapper Don Gotti has a big fan following as well. Unlike Gotti, Bill Gates never killed anyone, and may never have violated a single criminal law. But in my book his conduct was far from ethical. I know today, most American believe all is fair in love, war and business, but that is not how I see things. My thought is that because the average human being tends to be selfish and unethical, they give Bill Gates a pass. You might not agree with me that the average human is selfish and unethical, and that might be true from your perspective. But I hold people, including myself, to a much higher moral standard than most people do.</p>
<p>Moreover, I care more about Professor Gary Kildall's loss than Bill Gates' questionable gains. Professor Kildall was a creative genius. We both owe him an immense debt. On the other hand, I saw Microsoft achieve success using strong arm tactics, and use the tactic VHS used in beating out Betamax.</p>
<p>I wish there was some evidence to the contrary, but all evidence seems to indicate that Bill Gates is philistine, that he never really cared to make the best product he could. His hallmark has been buying second rate products, giving them away free until they become an industry standard that kill off better products. Bill Gates knows people will buy an inferior product for the sake of compatibility, and has exploiting this piece of knowledge from the beginning.</p>
<p>Do you know who Philo Farnsworth is? How about Kary Mullis? How about Leo Szilard? I feel bad that Creadance Clearwater Survival lost all rights to their own music. I think they were cheated. The average person supports the popularizer, not the creative genius without whom we would be living in the stone-age. I believe we owe genius creators more, and notorious self-promoters less.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">the Centibillionaire issue</span></h2>
<p>I've restored this into the lead section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, Gates' wealth briefly surpassed $100 billion making him America's first centibillionaire.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>There is some disagreement as to whether the term "centibillionaire" refers to 100 billion, or 10 million (as "centi" typically stands for 1/100ths). Here's two reasons why it needs to stay in the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>In popular media (I'm talking Forbes, Time Magazine, that kind of thing), the term "centimillionaire" has been used for a number of years to describe people with 100 million dollars or more. Indeed, Forbes published an article titled <a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/2003/08/04/cz_pn_0804hopeedit.html" class="external text" title="http://www.forbes.com/home/2003/08/04/cz_pn_0804hopeedit.html" rel="nofollow">Bob Hope: Just Another Centimillionaire</a> the week after his death. This has led to the use of the term centibillionaire when describing Bill Gates, as as extension of that term. Yes, it flies in the face of the international standard of units... darn, eh? As an encyclopedia, we are here to report what other people have said, not to try and push our own vision of accuracy.</li>
<li>One could reasonably argue that "centimillion" and "centibillion" don't adhere to <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_prefix_bab4.html" title="SI prefix">SI prefix</a> rules at all, because they're combining a prefix with a long-scale name. We'd never talk about a "terahundred" or a "kilomillionth", would we? How about a "nanobillion"? A "pictoquintillion"! Okay, I'm getting carried away here, but hopefully the point is made.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, the "centibillionaire" comment should stay. If nobody makes a good argument for its removal that overrides the above, I will continue to push its inclusion. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warrens</a> 21:31, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>oops didn't notice the discussion and edited it to remove the term, the reasons i think centibillionare shouldn't be used are</dd>
<dd>1. wikipedias own article on centibillionaire clearly states that it doesn't mean $100 billion and anybody clicking on the link from bill gates article sees that the article is wrong!</dd>
<dd>2. centibillionare means what it means, use in popular media doesn't change the actually meaning of a word</dd>
<dd>3. the term centibillionare adds nothing to the article and there is no need to add confusion</dd>

<dd>Did you completely fail to understand what I wrote as justification for use of the term? "Centibillionaire" is a term being used <i>solely</i> by the media to describe someone with 100 billion dollars. It's not a scientific term... it's more like a word like <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centenarian.html" title="Centenarian">Centenarian</a>, which clearly means 100 years, not 1/100th of one year. I'm going to put the term back in, and if you plan on removing it again, come back with a stronger counter-argument than "it means what it means", because, frankly, that says nothing at all. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warrens</a> 18:08, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The wikipedia article on "centibillionaire" both notes the common usage by the media and also says the usage is incorrect. The whole argument is stupid. Why don't we just take it out and say "Bill Gates is the first American to amass a net worth over $100 billion"? Having the term "centibillionaire" in the article does not add anything, and we can easily say the same thing, ommitting that word, and eliminating any controversy. The only thing we lose by removing the word is stupid arguments on the talk page and edit wars. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranhamo_4524.html" title="User:Aranhamo">Aranhamo</a> 21:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

You don't address a British knight as "sir" in anywhere but the inaccurate, outdated and Eurocentric Encyclopedia Britannica. This is because globally, it isn't expected or acceptable to speak English as if you were British: to say, Sir Douchebag or Lady Camilla. You do so only if you've been invited to a bunfight and you do so at the bunfight as common courtesy. But any more than "Lord" McCartney kow-towed to the emperor of China during his foolish mission of 1795, you do not, even in a honorary sense, reinforce, as the citizen of your country, pretensions beyond the norm of a foreign prince.</p>

<p>Many other pages in Wikipedia list people as "Sir" who have KBE title. Two that come to mind are [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>] and [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>]. Indeed, Sir Paul McCartney is of a lower order in the British Empire than Sir William Gates is, so if one of the two should be listed, it should be Gates.</p>
<p>Other discussion on this talk page notes that accepting KBE may be unlawful in the United States. This is absolutely <i>not relevant</i>. He has accepted the title; it IS his title; whether he legally can accept it is not an issue for this encyclopedia. The fact stands that he already has.</p>
<p>The only issue for this encyclopedia is the stylistic distinction of whether the title should be displayed. If we go for consistency, we should list him as "Sir" as we do with "Sir Isaac Newton" and "Sir Paul McCartney".</p>
<p>If you respond to my request for commends with a negative, please clarify your stance on the "US citizens can't have titles" issue -- I don't want to get into a discussion of this because it's not relevant and not for us to decide. As an encyclopedia, we should merely recognize that he HAS the title and not engage in a stupid dispute over its legality. If someone is a <i>lawyer</i> then I would request he put his comments here about its legality. Otherwise, if you are not a lawyer, you are not qualified to dispense legal advise and your opinion on the legality of his title is both arbitrary and not fit to influence this document.</p>
<p>He <i>has</i> the title. That is fact. The question is why Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Paul McCartney are listed as such when Sir William Gates is not.</p>

<p>I've read more archived discussion on the talk page and see some good arguments both ways. Some people say that because Bill Gates himself does not use it, that we also should not. I don't see that as a compelling argument: he also calls himself Bill, but we're an encyclopedia and thus address him as William Gates in his article.</p>
<p>Indeed, I do consider it important to at least list his title somewhere in the passage. If not after his name, as KBE, then how?</p>
<p>I'd also like to point out that Paul McCartney did not refer to himself as MBE but the article page still lists it after his name on his article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>

<dd>We do state in the 3rd paragraph that Gates was awarded the KBE. But outside the Commonwealth, this is not a title but an honor. Britain cannot give a title to an American. The right to use a British title is part of British law or the laws of members of the Commonwealth which honor British titles. So Bill Gates can include anything in his name he wants — PhD, KBE, Esq., etc. — but he is not "entitled" to do so under either British law or US law. Prudently, he has eschewed the use of honorary titles such as PhD and KBE in his name, as most people do. And so should we. –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 17:22, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Those bestowed with the title KBE who are not citizens of the Queen, can accept title, but may not use the prefix "Sir". Bill gates can use the title KBE after his name, but may not use the prefix "Sir" unless he becomes a citizen of Great Britain. KBE should follow his name. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.65.131.202 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.65.131.202_9693.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.65.131.202">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>The KBE given to Bill Gates was <u>not a title</u>, it was an <u>honor</u>. The USA does not have titles. The British government cannot "give" a title to a US citizen but it can honor them.

<p>However saying that being awarded an honarary docterate still entitles the use of the Dr. suffix.So how come it dose not apply In this case.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 00:03, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>When one receives an honorary doctorate, they are theoretically entitled to use "Dr" or "PhD" in their name. But almost no one ever does because it's not a "real" PhD earned by hard work but an honorary one. (That's not to say it isn't a great honor.) Bill Gates has several honorary PhDs but he doesn't say "Hi, I'm Dr. Gates" and he doesn't sign his letters "Bill Gates, PhD" or "Bill Gates, PhD, KBE." We look at how Bill Gates writes his name to indicate how WikiPedia should express it. If he used the PhD or KBE regularly, then so would we. –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 11:19, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
