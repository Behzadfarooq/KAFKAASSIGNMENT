<p>I think this paragraph should be added. I think if it is not, this article is very clear example of Liberal/left-wing bias and should be classified as not being NPOV.</p>
<p>The Frank article alleges that Graham was involved in the gay sex trade. And he engaged in this activity as a married man with two children. Lawrence Metherel, a former teen male prostitute, has long ago disclosed that he had a sexual relationship with Graham dating back to 1980, when Metherel was 15 years old. In a recent interview with a Canadian magazine, Metherel said that, for 15 years, Graham provided him with regular support payments of up to $1,500 a month. <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=221" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=221" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnon_0a1b.html" title="User:Anon">anon</a>9:00, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The allegations are neither proven in a court of law, nor have verifiable, credible sources to back them up. (<i><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_%28magazine%29.html" title="Frank (magazine)">Frank</a></i> is not a sufficiently credible source on which to base an assertion of truth, and neither is Jamie Glazov. Sorry to break it to you.) It's legitimate to note that such allegations <i>exist</i>, particularly because they're the real root of the whole <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheryl_Gallant_c206.html" title="Cheryl Gallant">Cheryl Gallant</a> dust-up that everybody was so eager to pretend came out of nowhere, but Wikipedia still has a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> requirement. Which means, for one thing, that we can't give too much credence to unproven allegations. For all your obvious preference in favour of <i>believing</i> the rumour to be true, it does in fact remain an unproven rumour. And I'm not a Liberal partisan, either — in fact, I voted for opposing candidates in both of the elections that have taken place since I've lived in his riding — but I am a Wikipedia administrator with a responsibility for ensuring that Wikipedia policy (including both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>) is followed. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 03:01, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Maybe somebody should actually Google (name removed). There are over 200 links. I think this counts as proof that Bill Graham was involved in the gay sex trade.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It counts as proof that allegations <i>exist</i>. It does <i>not</i> constitute proof that the allegations are <i>true</i>. (And don't think I haven't noticed the irony in the fact that you're arguing in favour of treating the allegations as proven fact at the very same time as someone else further down this page is arguing in favour of not even acknowledging them at all. For the record, I think both approaches are wrong; I believe we need to acknowledge that the allegations exist, but not put too much faith in their truth or credibility.)

<p>I know this sounds confusing, but according to today's reports, while Graham has become interim parliamentary leader of the party, and Leader of the Opposition, he is not the interim Leader of the Liberal Party; the leader for now remains Paul Martin. So it is premature to add the Liberal Leaders template unless Martin drops his other duties and makes Graham full interim leader. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 20:38, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_leader.html" title="Parliamentary leader">parliamentary leader</a>, is the correct term, <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_Leader_4add.html" title="House Leader">House Leader</a> is the short hand for Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons (i.e. Leader of the Government in the House of Commons is not the Prime Minister, but the Government House Leader; Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons is the Opposition House Leader not the Leader of the Opposition). - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 04:38, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>My understanding is that Graham heads the entire Liberal caucus ie both the House of Commons caucus and the Senate caucus that he is the leader of the Liberals in parliament, not just in the House of Commons. Homey</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I understand it, Martin still leads the Liberal leader and Graham is only "interim leader of the Official Opposition in the House of Commons". This is how it is consistently worded on the Liberal Party website. This is the original announcement <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/news_e.aspx?id=11465" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.liberal.ca/news_e.aspx?id=11465" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> --<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a></dd>

<p>A total lack of reference to Graham's strongly alleged homosexuality seems inappropriate. Would the following statement, placed at the end of his personal history, be acceptable: "Graham has neither confirmed nor denied his alleged homosexuality"</p>
<dl>
<dd>With all due respect, I disagree; if we were to begin posting one's "alleged homosexuality" in articles such as these, then wouldn't it also be prudent to amend Mr. Harper's article with something along the lines of "Mr. Harper is allegedly heterosexual, as having a wife may imply"? <a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFiveParadox_a401.html" title="User:FiveParadox">FiveParadox</a> 04:49, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I might want to stay out of this one, lol. I'm gay, so this is a bit of a sensitive topic to me. It's just, pointing it out like that because he <i>might</i> be gay, because someone somewhere said something suspicious, would only serve to re-inforce, in my opinion, the idea that homosexuality is something to be noted, i.e., something incorrect or defective. <a href="../../../f/i/v/User%7EFiveParadox_a401.html" title="User:FiveParadox">FiveParadox</a> 07:58, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Unless you were looking at it during the ten minutes between the most recent attempt to strip the existing reference and my reversion of that removal, the article already covers the topic of his sexuality as thoroughly as is possible under the circumstances.

<dd>The reason I believe the section is warranted in this case is the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheryl_Gallant_c206.html" title="Cheryl Gallant">Cheryl Gallant</a> "Ask your boyfriend" incident. In as much as a lot of media commentators <i>pretended</i> that Gallant's statement came out of nowhere and that nobody had a clue what the hell she was talking about, it in fact had <i>everything</i> to do with the old <i><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_%28magazine%29.html" title="Frank (magazine)">Frank</a></i> rumours.</dd>

<dd>If there hadn't been an incident in which somebody dragged the question of his sexuality onto the floor of the House in debate, I wouldn't support discussing the <i>Frank</i> stuff at all — but given that the Gallant incident <i>did</i> happen and did garner significant media coverage, Wikipedia simply can't pretend that we don't know <i>exactly</i> why she said what she did. We need to be careful to discuss the matter in a way that doesn't lend it undue credence, but given the Gallant incident we no longer have the option of pretending the speculation doesn't even <i>exist</i>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:10, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's lots of trash talk on the floor of the House of Commons. Why are allegations of homosexuality worth discussing, but not other accusations?

<dd>There isn't a single source on Google to support that it was considered news in and of itself. <i>Nothing</i> comes up on Google besides blog entries and passing references to the comment in otherwise unrelated news stories involving Young or Grey (or even as background context for the gratuitous <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belinda_Stronach_50bc.html" title="Belinda Stronach">Belinda Stronach</a> comments) — not one single, solitary reference comes up to the comment being treated as a news story in its own right. And the reduced prevalence of the web in 1997 doesn't account for that; you can find actual verifiable media references for far older slurs such as the Sambo and Tequila Sheila incidents. "Slab of bacon" certainly got mentioned in passing, but got only a fraction, at best, of the media coverage that Gallant's comment did. And just for the record, I'm a <i>journalist</i>, for gawd's sake, so my memory of what got media coverage and what didn't is far more reliable than you seem to think.</dd>

<dd>By this token, something that happened in 1989, when there was no Google and only research scientists even knew that the Internet <i>existed</i>, should produce virtually no Google hits at all. Except that the Howard McCurdy Sambo incident produces far more Google hits of verifiable media coverage than the slab of bacon comment does.

<dd>And as for "what's special about homosexuality", it has a lot more to do with the fact that in both Bill Graham's and Cheryl Gallant's Wikipedia articles, the comment was originally discussed with a "Since Graham is married to a woman, the comment made no sense whatsoever and nobody has a clue what the hell she was talking about" postscript. Which is an out-and-out lie; we know <i>exactly</i> what the hell she was talking about. We may not know if the <i>Frank</i> allegations were <i>true</i> or not, but that's an entirely different matter — and the way the section was originally written before I expanded it, we were outright <i>lying</i>.</dd>

<dd>As well: whether a person is "fat" or not is an objectively quantifiable, binary characteristic. Either they're fat or they aren't, there are no grey areas, and I can verify it just by <i>looking</i> at them. It's not a characteristic people can hide. Being gay, on the other hand, is not so clear cut: in addition to "gay" and "not gay", there are grey areas called "bisexual", "gay-but-in-the-closet" and "straight-but-often-targeted-by-rumours-nonetheless", and I <i>can't</i> verify which is the case just by looking at them.</dd>

(And again, the prevalence of the web in 1997 compared to today doesn't account for that — a Google search on <i>"Howard McCurdy" "Sambo"</i>, a far older incident which would be virtually ungooglable if contemporary-web-prevalence were a factor, actually brings up direct media coverage of that incident in its own right.)

<dd>I've addressed your first point below several times. I don't think Gallant's comment should be included here. As for your second point, I have already pointed out that we don't discuss the sexuality of other Canadian politicians on Wikipedia. Their sexuality is just as much a "grey area" as Graham's. Why should we discuss Graham's and not theirs? Finally, I am happy to do the work to provide the text of the articles in question if you think it will settle something. I get the distinct impression, however, that it would be a pointless exercise. Please correct me if I have misunderstood. HistoryBA 01:27, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My two cents: It should be there, and I trust Bearcat to treat it in an NPOV fashion. Rightly or wrongly, Graham's sexuality is the element of his personal life that most often has prompted outside attention (far moreso than his land-roving adventures), and better for Wikipedia to put forward a straightforward and truthful explanation of what various tongues wag about in Ottawa (and why they do so, and exactly how credible the whole basis for said wagging is) rather than purposely play Polyanna and pretend nobody has ever has anything to say on the subject. In light of the the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Oaten_c1d4.html" title="Mark Oaten">Mark Oaten</a> stuff across the pond (which struck me, in contrast to Graham, as proof that we have a far more civilized press corps, even if they're not quite as much fun), it seems especially odd to say this is nn as being purely about House of Commons heckles. The fact that a rather deliberate and homophobic taunt was made in the HoC and the national press chose to walk around the elephant in the room is itself notable enough to merit mention, and speaks to Canadian political culture in a substantive way.</dd>
<dd>On that note, I recall hearing <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_MacKay_a693.html" title="Peter MacKay">Peter</a>-<a href="../../../b/e/l/Belinda_Stronach_50bc.html" title="Belinda Stronach">Belinda</a> whispers for more than a month before whatshisface in the National Post opened his trap and "outed" their relationship in a column entirely out of any sort of relevant context—very much a giggle-giggle tired of keeping a secret thing, I think. It'll be interesting to see if this subject comes up again in the mainstream media now that Graham's got a much higher profile. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Tom_5b57.html" title="User:The Tom">The Tom</a> 11:35, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So let me get this straight. User:HistoryBA originally removed any reference to the gay rumours from this article, stating that their inclusion or exclusion should be discussed on the talk page. So they were discussed, and while the number of participants wasn't exactly overwhelming, the discussion ended a month ago with a slight preference in favour of inclusion. Now another user readded the material, again in about as NPOV way as possible, and User:HistoryBA again reverted that, again stating that their inclusion or exclusion should be discussed on the talk page (as if they hadn't already been). No offense against anyone, but since this dispute looks like it can't be resolved by the current participants, I'm taking it to RFC. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:51, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I understood the discussion, Five Paradox was against it being here, I preferred it to be on Cheryl Gallant's page but not here, a position JGGardiner accepted. Bearcat wanted it somewhere, with a preference for it being here, but a willingness to accept it on Chery Gallant's page. Saforrest and The Tom both thoought it should be here. That's far from a consensus. There was no formal vote, but I would guess that the result would be 3-3 if a vote had been held. Am I misinterpreting the discussion? I certainly didn't see a "slight preference in favour of inclusion" here. HistoryBA 00:35, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, I can save everyone a lot of time. I am not doubting that Cheryl Gallant said what she did, or that some Ottawa wags have talked about whether Graham is gay, or that someone can provide proof to support any of these facts.

Which is an out-and-out lie; we know exactly what the hell she was talking about.

<dd>Someone else dealt with the Google issue above and I have offered repeatedly to make the effort to reproduce the text of newspaper articles from that time -- articles that focus on the statement and do not treat it as a peripheral issue. It is relevant because it establishes my point that everything said in the House of Commons does not necessarily need to be included in Wikipedia. HistoryBA 00:38, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The point raised as a response to the Google issue was not valid — nobody <i>ever</i> addressed the reality that the Howard McCurdy "Sambo" incident brings up <b>actual direct media references</b>, despite being almost ten years <i>older</i> and thus ten years <i>farther</i> removed from the existence of Google than "slab of bacon". So if you want me to consider the point made, then <i>answer the Howard McCurdy point</i>.</dd>
<dd>And the way you raised the whole matter in the first place was to set up an illogical and utterly irrelevant comparison between ambiguous sexuality and fat jokes, so it does not establish any valid point whatsoever. The <i>body shape</i> of a public figure is <i>not</i> an encyclopedic matter; a discussion of whether Deborah Grey is fat or not would have no place in an encyclopedia <i>regardless</i> of Doug Young's attempts at wit. The sexual orientation of a public figure <i>is</i> a legitimately encyclopedic topic; we have entire category trees devoted to the topic. The only remotely valid comparison to this matter would be the <a href="../../../k/y/l/Kyle_Bradford_d16c.html" title="Kyle Bradford">Kyle Bradford</a>-<a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> incident, which <i>is</i> discussed in Tom Cruise's article.</dd>
<dd>I sincerely regret letting you drag me into an irrelevant side debate about the level of media coverage — my primary point was, is and continues to be that <b>there is no valid comparison to be made between the two incidents in the first place</b>. And that's the only point on which I will engage <i>any</i> further discussion about the "slab of bacon" issue. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:47, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Providing contemporary newspaper sources would have responded to any concerns over whether this was an issue at the time. My offer to provide those sources remains, if you are willing to consider them proof and not insist that an event only occurred if it is documented on the internet. In my mind, the newspaper sources render all the other arguments over whether it was actually an issue (including the McCurdy argument) irrelevant. The Gallant issue was raised to prove that Graham's alleged homosexuality was irrelevant. My argument all along has been that mention in the House of Commons does not automatically prove that something is relevant. HistoryBA 12:55, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>What part of "I sincerely regret letting you drag me into an irrelevant side debate about the level of media coverage" are you having trouble with? There <i>isn't a valid comparison to be drawn between the situations in the first place</i>, so the level of media coverage <i>doesn't matter</i>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:24, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Well, to be honest, I don't understand any of it. I think you should take responsibility for willingly jumping into the discussion, rather than blaming me for dragging you in. You challenged the facts that I presented, and I have been trying to defend them ever since, despite the fact that you insist that your memory as a journalist and the internet are more valid sources than newspaper accounts at the time. As for relevance, as I said above, I do believe "slab of bacon" comment is relevant as it establishes one of my key points: mention in the House of Commons is not sufficient to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. Finally, you seem to be suggesting above that I am dragging this out. Once before, I refrained from responding to one of your posts, suggesting that both you and I leave this dicussion to others. I honoured that suggestion, and did not comment again until you did. I don't see how repeating the same arguments again and again helps anyone. HistoryBA 18:36, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If you want to make the point that "mention in the House of Commons is not sufficient to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia", then find a situation that's legitimately comparable to the one at issue here. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:47, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I am saying that one of the principles on which you based your original argument is flawed. You seed to be arguing that something something merits inclusion because it was mentioned in the House of Commons. The "slab of bacon" comment proves that this logic does not hold. Asking me to find a case similar to the Gallant one totally misses my point. Finally, I don't think either of us is going to change the other's mind by continuing this back-and-forth. My offer to drop the matter stands. HistoryBA 18:54, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're missing <i>my</i> point if you think I've ever said that Cheryl Gallant's comment was what <i>made</i> the topic notable. It was only the most public <i>example</i> of what was <i>already</i> a significant topic of discussion WRT Graham. Again, there's a large difference between the two, and you're still arguing with your own misinterpretation of my words rather than with anything I actually said. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:05, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Here's what you actually said:
<dl>
<dd>The reason I believe the section is warranted in this case is the Cheryl Gallant "Ask your boyfriend" incident. In as much as a lot of media commentators pretended that Gallant's statement came out of nowhere and that nobody had a clue what the hell she was talking about, it in fact had everything to do with the old Frank rumours.</dd>
<dd>If there hadn't been an incident in which somebody dragged the question of his sexuality onto the floor of the House in debate, I wouldn't support discussing the Frank stuff at all — but given that the Gallant incident did happen and did garner significant media coverage, Wikipedia simply can't pretend that we don't know exactly why she said what she did. We need to be careful to discuss the matter in a way that doesn't lend it undue credence, but given the Gallant incident we no longer have the option of pretending the speculation doesn't even exist.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I, on the other hand, do believe that we have the option of not discussing the Gallant incident or the rumours she was perpetuating. I think relevance remains the key principle here. I have now repeated your words verbatim, rather than providing my intepretation (or, as you would say, "misinterpetation"). I have also repeated my position, which has remained unchanged. I renew my offer to drop this thing. Haven't we both recorded our positions in a clear enough way? HistoryBA 19:27, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is it appropriate or inappropriate for Graham's article to mention and/or discuss the existence of rumours about his sexual orientation?</p>
<p>Background: in the early 1990s, the Canadian gossip magazine <i><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_%28magazine%29.html" title="Frank (magazine)">Frank</a></i> published allegations that Graham had a sexual relationship with a youngish man. Although Graham has never publicly acknowledged the rumours, they've never quite died out — in 2002, an opposition MP, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheryl_Gallant_c206.html" title="Cheryl Gallant">Cheryl Gallant</a>, heckled Graham in the House of Commons by shouting "Ask your boyfriend!" at him.</p>
<p>No editor in good standing is seriously suggesting that we should treat the rumours as proven fact — but there is a dispute as to whether this article should even acknowledge their existence at <i>all</i>. I'm of the opinion that as long as the matter is addressed in a neutral and careful way, the matter <i>should</i> be discussed in this article, because it's entirely relevant to the subject and not acknowledging that such rumours exist presents a POV problem, but User:HistoryBA believes that it shouldn't even be hinted at here on the basis that Gallant's comment is only relevant in her article, and that the actual background for her comment isn't relevant <i>anywhere</i>.</p>
<p>HistoryBA also compares this to an earlier situation in which <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Young_d855.html" title="Doug Young">Doug Young</a> called <a href="../../../d/e/b/Deborah_Grey_935d.html" title="Deborah Grey">Deborah Grey</a> a "slab of bacon" in the House of Commons, and figures that addressing the gay rumours in Graham's article would be akin to using Grey's article to discuss whether or not Grey is "fat". I find that an invalid comparison, because body type and sexuality aren't even remotely equivalent issues in any way whatsoever, but HistoryBA apparently doesn't believe I've answered it at all.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, speaking as a member of Toronto's gay community there's a very tricky balancing act involved here: there's the matter of <i>rumours</i> about his sexual orientation existing on the public record, and the very separate matter of what we know off the record but couldn't post here without violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.</p>
<p>The matter has been unresolvable by the discussion that's taken place so far, so I'm asking for outside input. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not at all a fair summary of my views. My position is this: (1) Rumours do not merit inclusion in an encylcopedia unless they are significant. Rumours of Graham's being a homosexual are only signficant if you can show that they had some effect, positive or negative, on his political career. To the best of my memory, no one has provided any such evidence. (2) Slurs in the House of Commons do not merit inclusion in an encylopedia article an the person being slurred unless they are significant. Again, to the best of my memory, no one has provided evidence to show that Gallant's comments had any effect, positive or negative, on Graham's political career. (3) Slurs say much about the person who made them. It is fully justifiable, therefore, to include Gallant's comments, and the context in which they were made, in the Gallant article. HistoryBA 02:42, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's entirely inappropriate for Gallant's article to go into any more detail about the substance of the Graham allegations than it already does. And in my opinion it's also entirely inappropriate for what can appropriately be written in Gallant's article to be the farthest extent of what we write about the matter — there's no encyclopedic value to be had in saying that a controversy exists if you're not willing to talk about what the controversy in question <i>is</i>. Though YMMV, I suppose. And FWIW, I don't believe I've misrepresented your views on the matter at all — I didn't say a single thing in my summary that is in any way contradicted by your clarification. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 02:59, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is what I wrote, I think it's a sufficiently NPOV summary:
<dl>
<dd><i>Over ther years, there have been rumors that Graham may be homosexual, largely arising from unproven allegations made in Frank magazine. Such rumors came to public attention in 2002, when Canadian Alliance MP Cheryl Gallant mockingly accused Graham of having a "boyfriend" during a session of Question Period in the House of Commons.</i></dd>

<dd>Bearcat: (1) I do not believe we should even say that a "controversy" exists over Graham's sexuality, unless you can prove that a "controversy" (as opposed to a "rumour") exists and you can prove it is relevant. (2) I do not believe that your summary represents my views. For example, I do not believe, as you assert above, that the background to Gallant's comments should be omitted if we talk about the comments themselves. If you review the discussion above, you will see that I have repeatedly asked why the Gallant comments should be included on the Graham page, and you have repeatedly responded as though I am saying that the Gallant comments should be included but that the context (the rumour) shouldn't -- a clear (though no doubt uninentional) misrepresentation of my views.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In Gallant's article, it's appropriate to say in connection to her comment that Graham's sexuality has been the subject of rumours — but it's <i>completely</i> inappropriate to discuss the actual substance of precisely what the rumours <i>are</i> or where they <i>came</i> from. The actual matter of the <i><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_%28magazine%29.html" title="Frank (magazine)">Frank</a></i> allegations has to be discussed either on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Graham_8afb.html" title="Bill Graham">Bill Graham</a> or nowhere at all, because they're fundamentally inappropriate on Gallant's article, and accordingly I stand by my summary. And in the context at hand, the distinction between "controversy" and "rumour" is largely a semantic one — the rumour <i>is</i> the controversy. There's no opposition between the two terms. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 20:12, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As I said before, Gallant's comments say a lot about who Gallant is and very little (if anything at all) about who Bill Graham is. I have yet to see any evidence that there is a "controversy" over Graham's sexuality. All you have proven is that there are some "rumours." The words have different meanings and difference is not one of semantics, but one of substance. HistoryBA 23:55, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Gallant's comments may say more about Gallant than about Graham, but the <i>prior</i> history of rumours about Graham's sexuality for almost a decade <i>before</i> Gallant made her comment has <i>nothing</i> to do with Gallant, which is why <i>that</i> matter <i>cannot</i> be discussed in Gallant's article. Why you keep coming back to this false premise that it's all about Cheryl Gallant is beyond me — it is a documentable fact that there have been rumours about Graham's sexuality since long <i>before</i> Cheryl Gallant ever came along, and I do not see any valid reason why Wikipedia should pretend there haven't been. Cheryl Gallant is a minor part of the whole matter — the original <i><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_%28magazine%29.html" title="Frank (magazine)">Frank</a></i> allegations are not about Gallant, they're about Graham. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 01:04, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I live in Graham's riding and it's pretty much an accepted fact that he's bisexual - I also went to university with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Baird_58ea.html" title="John Baird">John Baird</a> (he was in my "Gael group" and know people who know him today and I have no doubt that he's gay. I wonder if those pushing for inclusion of the allegations of Graham's bisexuality also favour the inclusion in the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Baird_58ea.html" title="John Baird">John Baird</a> article of allegations (with <i>Frank</i> as citation) that Baird is gay? BTW, if we do state that Graham is bisexual (or that there are rumours he hasn't denied that attest to this) we should not refer to the callboy story nor should we be sensationalistic about Graham's sexuality. I seem to recall the Globe &amp; Mail mentioned it in passing in a profile they did of him several years ago (before 2002), if we can find that I'd be far more comfortable referencing that then <i>Frank</i> or Sky Gilbert (<a href="../../../n/o/w/Now_Magazine_9ea3.html" title="Now Magazine">Now Magazine</a> once wrote that <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Norton_34d4.html" title="Keith Norton">Keith Norton</a> is well endowed <a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/17/31/News/feature.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/17/31/News/feature.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>- don't see a push for including that in his biography.

<dd>*laugh* Regarding John Baird, <i>personally</i> I'd be in favour of that — but again, there's a difference between what I personally know as a member of the gay community and what we <i>officially</i> know through verifiable public sources. I wouldn't support using <i>Frank</i> as the primary source for asserting that Baird is gay, but that's not what I'm suggesting for Graham either — I'm suggesting that we acknowledge the <i>existence</i> of a longstanding <i>rumour</i>, not that we overstep the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requirement by using original research to formally out someone. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 01:24, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Rather than respond to all of Bearcat's comments above, why don't I suggest that both of us refrain from commenting any further and leave this in the hands of other editors. We seem to be going in circles, and I don't think the excessive length of this debate helps others to follow it and voice opinions. HistoryBA 01:33, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I would simply reccomend referencing the Frank story if and only if the Gallant remark is to be included, because that story is a necessary component to understand the context of the remark. And even if referenced, the nature of the magazine should definatly be noted first. Otherwise, I don't think any other statement involving rumours surrounding Graham's sexuality should be included, unless they're in a serious or at least semi-serious newspaper. I know a few things around this area that are "understood", but they shouldn't be in factual articles that depend on verification of sources.Habsfannova 01:45, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've been silent on this discussion until now, primarly due to the fact that I haven't been certain which side to support. As a general rule, I believe we should respect the privacy of public figures who choose to keep their sexual identities private, even when said information is an open secret (I've removed several references to John Baird's sexuality, for instance, even though the accuracy of the information has never been called into question -- it's simply a matter of ensuring privacy and avoiding tabloid sensationalism).</p>
<p>The situation with Graham is a grey area, in that (i) he didn't volunteer the information, and has not publicized it, but (ii) it has nevertheless been discussed in public forums. Whether or not it's "relevant" is still unclear, and I'm not even certain what standard could be used to determine "relevance" in this instance. I don't know if I favour inclusion of the rumours or not.</p>
<p>I can, however, shed a bit of light on material in the public domain from the respectable press:</p>
<p>(i) <i>Globe and Mail</i>, 22 January 2002, A4 (referenced by Homey above - this was <b>before</b> the Gallant incident)</p>
<p><i>Then there is his flamboyant personal life. He doesn't believe that the stories that circulated in the mid-1990s about his homosexuality kept him out of cabinet. "I was made Foreign Minister by the Prime Minister," he says when asked about probes into his private life. "I believe I have his support and I have the love and support of my family and my friends."</i></p>
<p><i>"People might be interested in that aspect of my private life, but it is not relevant to my performance as a politician," he says.</i></p>
<p><i>It is relevant, of course, if it makes him politically vulnerable.</i></p>
<p><i>"Absolutely," he agrees. But he says that he is "at total ease with himself and the respect of my family and friends and the Prime Minister who put me here." As for the rest, look to his voting record, he says.</i></p>
<p>(ii) <i>Canadian Press</i> report, 11 April 2002, 17:22 report</p>
<p><i>Graham, who has maintained in the past that questions about his personal life aren't relevant to his success as a politician, said Thursday he had not heard the remark.</i></p>
<p><i>"I didn't hear what Miss Gallant said, so I'm not going to comment on that," he said outside the House. ``I understand she said something on the other side of the House; that's amongst them."</i></p>
<p>(iii) <i>National Post</i>, 12 April 2002, A08</p>
<p><i>In a newspaper interview just after he was appointed Foreign Affairs Minister in January, Mr. Graham was asked about stories from several years ago regarding his homosexuality.</i></p>
<p><i>He said it was not "relevant to my performance as a politician."</i></p>

<p>Hm, yes, the Globe story is vaguer than I remembered it (though we all know what they are asserting when they say "Then there is his flamboyant personal life".) As well, I don't think any serious newspaper has even gone that far in the past two years. (The Globe reporter also doesn't say "his rumoured homosexuality" but "stories... about his homosexuality"). While we can personally read between the lines I don't think it's wikipedia's job to do so. Given that there hasn't been a clear assertion in the mainstream media about Graham's private life (Sky Gilbert's "The first thing you need to know is that Bill Graham is gay" aside<a href="http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_02.14.02/columns/pink.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_02.14.02/columns/pink.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> - Sky Gilbert is not a journalist) and as there hasn't even been any hinting in the media about Graham's sexuality since the Gallant episode I think we should not refer to it - at least not until and unless it becomes a public issue or unless he acknowledges it himself the way <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Scott_0413.html" title="Ian Scott">Ian Scott</a> (finally) did a few years ago.

<dd>Seriously, Bearcat, I'd never heard this allegation before. I listen to the news (CBC radio) faithfully, but I don't have an otherwise overwhelming interest in politics. So far, the best anyone on the "allegiation" side has been able to do is "it was in <i>Frank</i> and "somebody used it as an insult in the House of Commons." That, and "everybody knows it." Maybe people with a strong interest in the day-to-day events in Canadian politics might know it, but that's a far cry from "everyone." I was raising a point in a humourous way, but I'll re-state it to be clear: if your criteria for including specious allegations are based entirely on (a) <i>Frank</i> and (b) random things said in the House of Commons in the heat of arguments, you've got a LOT of work ahead of you.</dd>
<dd>In good faith: "everybody" does not know it. I did not know it. My parents do not know it. People doing research on Graham for school projects do not know it. Their dogs, I assure you, do not know it. You can even find a dog and ask it. It will probably reply "woof," which is dog for "I didn't know that." How do I know that "woof" is Dog for "I didn't know that"? Why, I read it in <i>Frank</i>.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattShepherd_b745.html" title="User:MattShepherd">MattShepherd</a> 15:41, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I'll start here: given the number of people who have posted to this very talk page demanding that we discuss the allegations in the name of NPOV, I can safely assure you that it's not at all obscure knowledge limited to people with special interest in Canadian politics — there are lots of people out there who know <i>nothing</i> at all about Bill Graham <i>except</i> the gay rumours. The only apology anybody's getting from me is that I'm sorry if you've somehow failed to learn about the valid literary device known as intentional hyperbole.</dd>
<dd>As for what my criteria are, well, although I'm betting less than 24 hours before somebody attempts to remove this, I've been beating around the bush trying to find ways to say it without actually saying it, so I may as well just blurt it out: I'm a gay man who lives in Bill Graham's riding, and it's public knowledge around these parts that he's frequently seen at gay bathhouses for reasons which have precious little to do with handing out campaign literature. It's extremely difficult to balance what we <i>officially</i> know about his sexuality with what we <i>actually</i> know off the record, I grant you, but this isn't just based on <i>Frank</i> and random comments — it's an attempt to balance a known <i>fact</i> against what can actually be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a> in public media sources. It's the proverbial "elephant in the room" situation — just because nobody in the media openly acknowledges the elephant doesn't mean the elephant isn't there. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 06:56, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That seems to get us back to the question of why this is important, rather than just appropriate. If it isn't in the media (very much) what is the importance of this that warrants the inclusion? Bearcat, would you say that it is important in the community (the riding or the gay community)? Or is his sexual preference on its own enough for the inclusion? Or are we still on the political aspect? --<a href="../../../j/g/g/User%7EJGGardiner_acaa.html" title="User:JGGardiner">JGGardiner</a> 07:24, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're the one who brought up the issue of him being seen at gay bathhouses. Are you speaking here about the existence of the rumour or the truth of the rumour? I assumed that you were talking about the truth of the rumour, but if I am mistaken, please let me know. In any case, as you acknowledge above, "it's public knowledge around these parts" doesn't satisfy the Wikipedia standard for verfiability, which makes me wonder why we continue with this.

<dl>
<dd>I at <i>no</i> time suggested that the article should step over the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> boundary and clearly identify him as gay despite the lack of public media sources to verify evidence that I know about <i>personally</i>. I've stated more than once in this debate that I would <i>revert</i> anybody who did that; in fact, I <i>have</i> reverted people who did that. And if you read <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategorization_Gender%2C_race_and_sexuality_8826.html" title="Wikipedia:Categorization/Gender, race and sexuality">Wikipedia:Categorization/Gender, race and sexuality</a>, keep in mind that <i>I</i> wrote that summary, <i>including</i> the proviso that "even if you have personal knowledge of a notable individual's sexual orientation, they should only be filed in a gay-related category if factual, reliable sources can be provided to support the assertion."</dd>
<dd>All I have <i>ever</i> suggested is a short, neutral and NPOV summary of what <i>is</i> verifiable in the matter, namely that there <i>have</i> been allegations but that Graham has never responded to them in a public statement.

<dd>I'm going to review the original context for how this came up in the first place.
<ol>
<li>On <i>multiple</i> occasions at <i>this</i> article, I've had to revert anonymous additions which essentially asserted that the original <i>Frank</i> allegations (pertaining to a particular sexual relationship that he may or may not have had) were <i>true</i>. With <i>Frank</i> as the only source, it fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, but the fact that I've <i>constantly</i> had to monitor the matter indicates that a very large number of people are familiar with these claims — more than enough that <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> almost <i>requires</i> us to point out that the specific matter remains unproven, because entirely too many people wrongly believe them to be proven fact.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheryl_Gallant_c206.html" title="Cheryl Gallant">Cheryl Gallant</a>'s article, meanwhile, the "Ask your boyfriend" comment was originally postscripted with the patent falsehood that nobody had a clue what the hell she meant by it. Which also fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, because it <i>deliberately</i> creates a false impression that Gallant is completely untethered from reality.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>So I did the best I could at balancing the competing POV problems into something as neutral as possible, which acknowledged the existence of rumours without stepping over the bounds of what's publicly verifiable. I'm not proposing that Wikipedia should officially out him — I'd be the <i>first</i> person to revert it if somebody did that, actually, because I have <i>no</i> problem separating personal knowledge from the fact until he's outed in mainstream media it would fail <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. But it's absolutely <i>not</i> a neutral point of view to pretend that the issue doesn't even exist, and it's <i>not</i> a neutral point of view to pretend, as HistoryBA insists on doing, that the whole thing has everything to do with Cheryl Gallant and nothing to do with Bill Graham. The <i>only</i> NPOV solution to the problem is to acknowledge that such rumours <i>exist</i>, while taking care to ensure that they're discussed as rumours <i>qua</i> rumours rather than as proven facts.</dd>
<dd>As for why it's important...the rumours <i>do</i> exist, and there's substantial evidence that a <i>lot</i> of people know about them. If the goal here is to produce a fluffy press release bio, then yeah, by all means, leave it out. But if the goal is, as it should be in any Wikipedia article, to ultimately produce something that could conceivably be nominated as a <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">featured article candidate</a>, then we <i>have</i> to acknowledge the matter in some way — it's too large and too widely-known an issue for us to sweep under the carpet if we're taking the goals of this project seriously. This article could <i>never</i> get to FAC without <i>some</i> kind of discussion of the issue. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 08:32, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems clear to me that Wikipedia should help the reader who consults Wikipedia because, for example, she has heard the rumors and wonders if they are true. The reader would consult the article and learn that they are not verified. This would be informative to the typical reader. I agree with a standard that rumors must be <i>significant</i> to be reportable in Wikipedia (for example, there are "rumors" that aliens landed in <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roswell%2C_New_Mexico_4a2a.html" title="Roswell, New Mexico">Roswell, New Mexico</a> that Wikipedia reports, even though many people find the rumors ludicrious). I wonder if it would move the debate along to see if we have consensus on the following point:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Significant</i> rumors (of any nature) should be reported in Wikipedia even if they are demonstrably false (or disputed, or unverifiable or unverified), along with their status as false, disputed, unverifiable or unverified.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Then we only have to discover what <i>significant</i> means in order to settle this dispute. I don't see a reason to differentiate among significant rumors.</p>
<p>Harts4Life 06:55, 3 May 2006 (UTC)It appears as if the only real controversy over the allegations exists on this discussion forum, and not in the main media. For the record, I am a Liberal supporter, and didn't actually know about all of this (although I do barely remember the initial incident) until I read it here ... which as far as I'm concerned, is reason enough to not count the allegations as having a significant impact on his political career, nor to treat it as a reportable controversy.</p>
<p>I would certainly oppose including a statement on what someone may have said, at some point, about something that may have happen, at some time, somewhere, based on unsubstantiated rumours, in something that <b>should</b> be an encyclopædic article. However, if there were concensus to proceed [along what I would deem an unfortunate path], then at the very least, such a statement should make the doubts about the reliability of the claims quite clear. <i>In exemplia</i>,</p>

<p>CJCurrie contends that references to Graham's advocacy of gay rights constitute "tabloid sensationalism" and are therefore unworthy of mention. My response to that is not to say that Graham’s relationship with the gay community ought to be newsworthy, but rather that perhaps it simply is news, like it or not. If Graham does not want his advocacy efforts made public, he could simply resign from public office and become a private citizen. Not that being a private citizen means one’s advocacy efforts would be ignored (witness Harper and the NCC), but one presumably has a greater claim to privacy when one is not holding and seeking public office. I might add that there seem to be a number of editors here partisan to Graham who would be purging Wikipedia of any reference to, say, Monica Lewinsky were they equally as partisan to Bill Clinton. This purging is exceedingly patronizing to the intelligence of the reader, who can form his or her own judgments about the information, and is making a mockery of Wikipedia’s informative value. Because the gay lobby already knows that Graham is one of theirs, the object of political partisans like CJCurrie is apparently to keep the fundamentalist religious vote in Graham’s camp by keeping that group ignorant about the fact that Graham is highly unlikely to be sympathetic to their values. According to this article, there is not the slightest reason for anyone anywhere to have any issues with Graham. Yet the Vic Toews article is a non-stop litany of “controversies” and “criticisms”. My suggestion to CJCurrie is that you cannot have it both ways. If you want to whitewash the Graham article, then you have to allow that Toews’ article may be similarly whitewashed of all “irrelevancies” and unsubstantiated "allegations", etc etc. What is it going to be?<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdell555_915f.html" title="User:Bdell555">Bdell555</a> 15:17, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Not that there is anything wrong with that, so long as the reader is aware (the issue of whether to inform the reader or to protect reader innocence being at the core of the current dispute), and/or an editor with another POV is allowed to edit without being reverted.<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdell555_915f.html" title="User:Bdell555">Bdell555</a> 21:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm inclined to think that the "pussy palace" reference was included for reasons other than demonstrating Graham's support for the LGBT community. In any event, I'll reiterate my reasons for the reversion: (i) several politicians on the Toronto left opposed the raid; Graham's view was neither unique nor especially noteworthy, (ii) Graham's statement on the matter was trivial in the context of his career, and (iii) the presentation in the previous edit was clearly one of tabloid sensationalism. Please don't return the text unless you're able to able to respond to all three of these points. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 18:28, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>You can make whatever presumptions you want about my intentions and I can’t stop you. Getting to the point, which is the article at hand, should I fail "to respond to all three of of [your] points", would you still allow that perhaps whether your three-point standard for what should be deleted and what should not is the best standard is, itself, the very issue at hand? Would you have any objections if I reverted all of your work on Vic Toews wholesale and then asked you to "please don't return the text unless you are able to respond to all" of the points I set out for you? If we leave that aside for the moment and just assume that your standard is indeed the authoritative standard, I would note that while you may not believe it "noteworthy" when Graham is found in the same political camp as "the Toronto left", others might. You seem to find every instance when Vic Toews has appeared at all immoderate highly noteworthy. Do you believe that none of your edits to the Vic Toews' article are "trivial in the context of his career"? If the words "pussy palace" unravel your moral fibres, then why don't you edit those words out? Instead, you cut out Graham's lobbying for a refugee claimant as well, supposedly on the grounds of "tabloid sensationalism". It is this sort of wholesale, undiscriminating reversion that obstructs the "consensus building" HistoryBA so nobly desires. In any case, you need not worry about me reverting the text back in yet again. Political partisans always win revert wars, because they are highly motivated to see their particular POV pushed. My objective is not to eliminate bias, which is impossible, but to raise reader awareness of it when it exists. Having done that here on these talk pages, there is little else I need, or can, do.<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdell555_915f.html" title="User:Bdell555">Bdell555</a> 21:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(i) If you have any objections to the Vic Toews article, please raise them on that article's talk page. It may be worth noting in advance of any such objections that (i) Toews was the most visible target for criticism in the late-period Filmon government, a fact which should be reflected in the article (I actually had to <b>leave material out</b> of the criticism section), and (ii) Toews is very well known for his socially-conservative views, which are presented in an NPOV manner.</dd>

<dd>Bdell555: You didn't say that the edits were POV, you said that the editor was a political partisan. This is a personal attack. It is inappropriate given Wikipedia policies and the specific editor's history here. The editor in question deserves your apology. HistoryBA 23:10, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, while you're at it, you might want to clarify that when you referred to "CJCurrie and the hobgoblin of consistency," you were <i>not</i> referring to the famous quotation to the effect that a foolish adherence to consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. You wouldn't want anyone here to think that you were calling another editor a "little mind." HistoryBA 23:31, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was indeed alluding to that quote, but I would note that, contrary to your assumption about my intentions, I must have been deprecating myself, since as the party calling for consistency I am the small minded one. Your interest in protecting myself and others from such deprecation is noble, but I would note that I am not so sensitive, and perhaps others aren't either. After all, when my good faith edits are being reverted wholesale, I am not exactly being sent sweet thank you cards, but such is life as an editor and Wiki becomes a more uncomfortable place for everyone if we are all thin-skinned types who readily take offence. I am sorry that my inability to resolve the distinction between being a politically POV editor and being politically partisan offends you, or anyone else. As I have admitted, my mind is relatively little and there is no shortage of subtleties too large for my comprehension. I readily admit to often being partisan to conservative perspectives, but I trust that when input to an article is provided by persons of multiple perspectives, the final article ends up more useful to the reader. Hence my attempts to contribute 2 cents to this article. Returning to the issue at hand, my concern with the Vic Toews article (to take an example article) is that it arguably has an unencyclopedic tone of attempting to “out” a politician as someone outside the norm. To take just one example, a full quarter of the Bill Graham article consists of an “Honours” section, while no Honour granted to Vic Toews is considered worthy of mention. The debate over the merits of “outing” was already well underway here, which is why I believed the issue would be best resolved here, if possible, as opposed to spreading out to multiple locations. If, as Habsfannova suggests, “we shouldn't be specific about every politician/lawyer's cases/[advocacy efforts]” (as an aside, it is news to me that Graham’s advocacy efforts have taken place in the courtroom as opposed to other arenas), I simply and humbly submit that the principle apply to politicians of all political stripes.<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdell555_915f.html" title="User:Bdell555">Bdell555</a> 18:01, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, which is why CJCurrie's refusal to allow me to edit, which should be distinguished from editing my edits, is inconsistent with Wiki policy. Why am I being asked to apologize for calling attention to violations of Wiki policy, which also calls for a NPOV perspective? No apologies should be demanded of anyone when there no "problem editors"! Often an effective way to resolve a dispute is to put oneself in another's shoes, and in CJCurrie's shoes I see people attempting to smear Bill Graham, people who must be stopped. A perfectly legitimate presumption, just not in Wikipedia, where slant must be avoided and good faith assumed. The assumptions about bad faith on my part are unwarranted. When I add information about Graham's relationship to the gay community, I am not, for example, taking a page from CJCurrie’s practices and also introducing a “criticism” section. I am also not defending the policies of a government which the subject of the article is not even part of, unlike CJCurrie who has written, for example, that “Toews specifically argued that the Clause should have been used to overturn a court decision that weakened Canada's child pornography laws. (The Liberal government brought forward remedial legislation to address the decision, without resorting to the Notwithstanding Clause.)” The Liberal government’s legislative agenda is totally irrelevant to Toews, but adding that information supports the POV that Toews is an opponent of the Charter. These facts suggest that the real issue with my being reverted here is one of political slant, and whether any of us are card-carrying members of a political party is totally irrelevant to the question of whether such slant exists here with respect to the Bill Graham Wiki article.<a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdell555_915f.html" title="User:Bdell555">Bdell555</a> 15:40, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry but I don't think that we really do agree. Hmmm... where to start? Well first, I don't know all the details of the edit history but I would think that you and CJC simply have a disagreement about some particular content. That happens. People have different ideas about what belongs in the articles. Otherwise bots could be writing the articles. If it does happen, you should bring the (content) issue to the talk page and discuss it there. Look at the discussions above for example. As for good faith, I'd suggest that you check out <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a> and also <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. People write bad content all the time but with the best of intentions. Some people write good content with bad intentions. Well possibly. But NPOV is about the content, not the author. When I see bad content in an article that I'm new to, I don't look to see who wrote it. It doesn't matter. Once you write the content, it is a distinct entity from you. As for problem editors, you're right, I don't think that you are a problem editor. I don't think that anyone is. However, when I say "editor", I mean an editor of the content of the encyclopedia -- the talk pages are a somewhat seperate entity. I definitely think that it was a problem that you have suggested that CJC has certain impure intentions. To be completely honest, I also think that it was also problematic that CJC responded with the "I'm inclined to think that..." bit above. I'm sure that you wouldn't like to think what that implies about your motives or character. Maybe that will help you see why it is unproductive to assume bad faith. As for apologies, I can't speak for HistoryBA or anyone else, but I would be happier if instead of that we could just get back to good faith consensus work. So, I'm going to start a section below on "Graham's Advocacy", which I think was the original problem and hopefully we can start over there.

<dd>The point remains that you accused CJCurrie of acting out of political partisanship. Such is not "life as an editor," as the comment clearly violates Wikipedia etiquette and is unfair to the editor in question, given the editor's own record here. Suggesting that I'm thin-skinned for asking you to obey the rules is equally inappropriate. Am I to take it that you are refusing to apologize? HistoryBA 18:28, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And what, exactly, do you envision as the alternative? It's either the abbreviation LGBT or the unwieldy phrase "lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered".
