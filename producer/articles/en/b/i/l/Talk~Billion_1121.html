<p>For all editors who have the urge to edit this article, please note the following first&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is now a <b>DISABMIGUATION</b> PAGE. <b>Not</b> a page trying to define the word 'billion', or to be gone into any great detail on the difference of the two values of the number. Its purpose is solely to show that there are two different values, a <b>brief</b> description each, and showing a link to why there are two values. Do not elaborate beyond this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There <i><b>really</b></i> are two different values for billion. Do not insist that, just because whichever country you live in, you have only ever heard of one value in your life, that this therefore is the only 'real' meaning. Different countries <i><b>really</b></i> do define 'billion' differently, and what value is common in one, is not in the other, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Please do not add phrases such as 'in the USA', 'in Europe', 'in Britain still' (or similar). It makes the article very country-centric, and so becomes biased sounding. Someone will just edit it out as well (look at the history!), so you're wasting your time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is the English language version of Wikipedia. So it follows that the English language meanings are most relevant. Billion may also be a word in another language, but that does not mean that nationality of language is more relevant or the correct meaning. Basically what is relevant is American English, and British English, and even these are confused enough with the word billion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you really want to argue the difference between the values, go to the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_and_short_scales.html" title="Long and short scales">long and short scales</a> page, where it will be relevant. Not here.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And if you really want to convince people, cite references and discuss in the talk page first.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Yeah, it is a disambig. But I moved it back to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion.html" title="Billion">billion</a> from <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Billion (disambiguation)">billion (disambiguation)</a>.

<p>I found this phrase to be useless:</p>
<p><i>The original meaning, <u>since the beginnings of modern times</u>, is...</i></p>
<p>"The original meaning" is more clear in meaning, while "since the beginnings of modern times" is somewhat redundant and a lot more vague. If it was the original meaning, then we could assume that it has been since the "beginnings of modern times," whatever that means. When was "the beginnings of modern times?" A hundred years ago? A thousand years ago? Last week? Where/when/by whom was the word coined? What information am I supposed to obtain from this phrase? Or why not just omit the meaningless phrase altogether?</p>

<p>!!!!!ETHNOCENTRISM ALERT!!!!!! There are too many European languages mentioned in this article. Please add more diversity and/or multiculturalism.</p>
<p><i>Given that most English speaking countries, including USA, Britain, Australia, Canada have adopted the US usage. It only makes sense that, in Wikipedia, an English encyclopedia, we follow the U.S. convention: one billion equals one thousand millions.

<dd>I do hate ambiguous terms. However, I wasn't aware the the the other English speaking countries had standardized on the Yankee terminology. This will be useful info for the future. Thank you! --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">maveric149</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think the other english countries had standarized to use the US value for billion. Please provide references if that is really true. Also it would be good to have in mind that English is THE international language. Similar words like "billon" in spanish, or "billion" in french, means 10^12, and these languages are getting into the ambiguety now. While all these languages have a similiar word to milliard to say one thounsand million.</p>

<dd>The other way 'round. The US adopted the French version.

<p>The origin of the word is bi (twice) million (million), one million million, 2*6=12 zeroes.</p>
<p>And the problem is if we use billion for 10^9 ¿what should we use for 10^12? The whole numbering system breaks!! -- dax5</p>
<dl>
<dd>The UK officially uses the US Billion for treasury reports. In other usages either the US or the international billion can occur. I would always say "thousand million" or "US billion" in the UK, as this is the only way to avoid confusion. Whereas I agree that it makes sense for the WikiPedia to use the US billion (where exponential notation is not practical), I think it should <i>explicitly</i> say "US billion" wherever it is used, or many people will be confused.

<p>Well, you just deleted it. The statement that Wikipedia uses "Billion" in the sense of 10<sup>9</sup> has been in this article for a long time and I think it remains very important. There are many articles linking to "Billion"; some of them talk about the different usages, but many others use the term in the sense of 10<sup>9</sup> without saying so. It is then important that people who click on the billion link are told what the term means in Wikipedia, precisely because of its very ambiguity: the most likely reason they clicked on the link in the first place is to find out: "what do they mean with a billion?". I agree that it would be preferable to avoid the word altogether, and I added that to the article. But that alone won't help the hapless surfer who comes here from <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W.

<p>True or false: there are still plenty of English speakers (in no particular country on earth) who still think that the proper meaning of this word is 10^12. 66.245.90.177 14:34, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure that's true, since a) it was certainly true in the 1960s and many people alive then are still living, and b) AHD4, particularly significant since it's an American dictionary, gives it as one of the meanings for "billion" with the comment "chiefly British."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, Anthere tells me that in France, the customary phrase for 10<sup>12</sup> is "mille milliards," precisely because it is unambiguous. I was going to say something about this in the article--a query to a USENET newsgroup on French society and culture seems to confirm it--but I'm still puzzled by the fact that Googling, restricted to French-language pages only, on "mille milliard" and "mille milliards" generates far fewer hits than "billion." Perhaps it's colloquial spoken usage and not formal written usage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But, where are you going with this? Common sense says that people who wish to be understood internationally and cross-culturally should avoid using the word "billion," and, conversely, people reading international and cross-cultural material need to be alert that "billion" has two meanings and the correct one must be determined by context. There's no point in fussing about it, the word will <i>always</i> be ambiguous. Even if the entire world were to get together on this, there will always be the issue of quotations. I mean, you're not going to pretend that Carl Sagan said "Thousands of millions and thousands of millions." (Yes, I know he never actually said it...)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, when I looked up the entry in Fowler where he recommended that the British adopted American usage, he may have answered a question that had always puzzled me, namely, what's so "two"-ish about 10<sup>9</sup> or "threeish" about 10<sup>12</sup>? He's suggesting that an (American) "billion" is "one thousand multiplied by itself twice." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 16:31, 14 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let's follow through on that logic. Three is one added to itself twice. Hence three is twoish. Similarly four is one added to itself thrice and thus threeish. In general any integer, n, greater than one is one added to itself n-1 times. Thus for all intergers, n, such that n&gt;1, n is (n-1)ish. One thousand million is no more twoish than three: calling it a <i>billion</i> is an afront to logic but, alas, it seems we're stuck with it. It is a nice way of remembering what American large number names mean though. I suggest the Americans adopt British usage ... a snow flake's hope in Hell. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">Jimp</a> 25Nov05</dd>

<p>I am British and Australian, a scientist, engineer and teacher. Reading the current article I am surprised to find that it suggests that British and Australian usage of the word billion now follows the American usage of the word! Sorry, not so. In both the UK and Australia (and many other English speaking countries I have worked in) the American billion 10^9 is only used when referring to money values - all other usage including science, maths, engineering, construction, surveying, mapping, teaching.... etc, uses the correct value of 10^12.</p>

<dd>I'm not surprised. This is an interesting point that is well worth having in the article. But can you provide a reference for this other than your own experience? A scientific journal style sheet, for example?

For example, at least some French-speakers I've consulted say that 10<sup>12</sup> is always referred to as "mille milliards" rather than "billions," but reference books don't seem to mention this. Similarly most dictionaries say that "milliard" is a perfectly good English word for 10<sup>9</sup>, but I have <i>never</i> heard an English-speaking person make use of it either in speech or in writing. Similarly Chuquet, who is sometimes cited as the originator, or at least the codifier of the names ending in -illion apparently refers to billion as meaning 10<sup>9</sup> and 10<sup>12</sup> in two different places within the same work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given the great complexity of the topic, I wish you could bring yourself to avoid referring to 10<sup>12</sup> as the "correct" value. Both British and American usage both derive from the French—at different periods in history! And no less an authority than Fowler's Modern English Usage recommends using "billion" to mean 10<sup>9</sup>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If it is true (as you suggest) that British financial usage is different from usage in other fields, and if it is also true that French usage changed as recently as 1948, all I can say is that the words billion, trillion, etc. are all but useless due to ambiguity and that arguing about their correct value is an utterly sterile debate. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 12:51, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree with the hard-and-fast division into "English" and "non-English" in the Billion and Trillion (which is too definite IMO) articles, (but agree the accepted Wikipedia value should be the US one). Here is why.</p>
<p>My Collins English-German dictionary, third edition, purchased in England 1997, has this entry:</p>
<p><b>Trillion</b> n (Brit) Trillion f; (US) Billion f.</p>
<p>Now the Trillion referred to is the German for 1 followed by 18 zeroes, and Billion is the German word for 1 followed by 12 zeroes. My few German acquaintances tell me they know this difference between the British and American (US) usage of "Trillion". Similarly for Billion. Also I did once hear an English-speaking person use "milliard", I had to ask them what it was! They (a well educated but non-British person) thought it was a common English word.</p>
<p>My Cassell's English-Italian dictionary, admittedly an old 1985 edition, makes the same distinction in this way:</p>
<p><b>Billion</b> Bilione (English, 1,000,000,000,000; Amer. 1,000,000,000)</p>
<p>Similar distinction for Trillion. Neither divides the usage into "English" and "non-English", speaking or otherwise.</p>
<p>Admittedly current usage <i>in the United Kingdom</i> is either confusion or has adopted the American (US) usage. This has certainly been the case in the financial industry. I was taught the 'old' British usage of both terms in a school run by Americans in a British colony (helps to pass the British exams).</p>
<p>The www.unc.edu link in <a href="../../../t/r/i/Talk%7ETrillion_fccc.html" title="Talk:Trillion">Talk:Trillion</a> above explains this, so I feel the articles should reflect this admittedly ambiguous difference. I tend to clarify when speaking English to well-educated non-British Europeans (who are aware of the problem with Billion and Trillion), as to exactly which I am using ("American" or "British") to make it clear.</p>
<p>Having said all that I'm not sure what's best: American and non-American; English and non-English; British and American (how the dictionaries usually give it); standard usage and non-standard? -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibob_130d.html" title="User:Wikibob">Wikibob</a> | <a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibob_a563.html" title="User talk:Wikibob">Talk</a> 11:06, 2004 Jul 21 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it simply needs to be acknowledged that usage is hopeless muddled. Within the United States, the usage of billion = 10<sup>9</sup>, trillion = 10<sup>12</sup>, etc. has, as far as I know, been stable and consistent for a couple of centuries, so it is probably accurate to characterize this as "United States" usage. But, apparently, France has switched back and forth at least twice; England used to use billion = 10<sup>12</sup> fairly consistently but is now inconsistent; I've seen bits of evidence that the usage recorded in dictionaries does not match what is used in the real world (some French speakers have told me that 10<sup>12</sup> is commonly referred to as "mille milliards"). And, apparently, <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuquet.html" title="Chuquet">Chuquet</a> himself implied <i>both</i> usages within the <i>same</i> work! These eggs are scrambled and there's no unscrambling them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And the solution is so easy, which is to avoid the use of these words.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's not really that big a problem, as the usage is often clear enough from context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Handle it just like acronyms or other things. There should be consistency within any one article. If the meaning is clear from context—and it usually is—nothing needs to be done. If it isn't, then simply define the word on its first appearance: "In 1950, the population of the world was approximately 2 billion (where <i>billion</i> means <i>1 000 000 000</i>)." Or by adding a numerical value: "The total world production of energy in 2002 was 153 quadrillion BTU (153 000 000 000 000 BTU)." Just look at the page; if it is judged that a reader might actually be confused, then just do the simplest thing that will minimize the confusion. We all need to read and understand books written in British, American, Canadian, Australian English and we all need to read books that are decades old as well as books that are brand new. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> 12:30, 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
COME ON!!</p>
<p>Puerto Rico shouldn't be included as one of the exceptions. The most commonly spoken (and one of the official languages) is spanish, and in our use the word billion is meant to be 1 000 000 000 000, while some people use it meaning 1 000 000 000 because of US influence, but this usage is incorrect as anyone who knows spanish will tell you.</p>
<p>For that reason, Puerto Rico shouldn't be included in that list</p>

<p>Would it assist to create two new pages 'Long scale' and 'Short scale' and put all the history &amp; discussion into these? These pages could also list the countries that adhere to the particular convention. Then, we could refer just to long or short scale rather than English-speaking (plus Brazil, etc) vs Non-English-speaking (except Brazil, etc). This should simply the articles on billion, trillion, etc. etc. Also, despite the encouragement to avoid using these terms, there are over 2000 articles in en.wikipedia that use Billion, most of which use the short scale as far as I can tell. Perhaps we do need to acknowledge this fact when we advise against using the terms? <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcairns_bb52.html" title="User:Icairns">Ian Cairns</a> 12:32, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are way too many different versions of the table of meanings for million/milliard/billion/trillion. I'd like to see all the information consolidated somehow, but I don't think that separate "Long scale" and "Short scale" articles would be a good way to do it. I don't think that the terms "long scale" and "short scale" are used outside Wikipedia. I'd suggest consolidating all the historical information into <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion.html" title="Billion">Billion</a> (or a new article), consolidating the table of number names into a new template, and making all the other pages like <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_large_numbers.html" title="Names of large numbers">Names of large numbers</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_numbers.html" title="List of numbers">List of numbers</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language_numerals.html" title="English language numerals">English language numerals</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milliard.html" title="Milliard">Milliard</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trillion.html" title="Trillion">Trillion</a>, etc. refer to these two. —<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarrett_905e.html" title="User:AlanBarrett">AlanBarrett</a> 13:25, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for that. I've struggled with names for these two naming systems - there isn't a formal name that is widely used; and all the geography / language involved in who uses what gets very complicated.

<dd>I think we want something broader than just "Billion" or "Trillion" (which should each be about only one name), but narrower than "Names of large numbers" (which includes lakh, crore, googol, myriad, and many other terms that are outside the million/billion/trillion family). Perhaps "Million, billion, trillion, and related terms" might work. (I would include milliard and billiard as "related terms".) —<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanBarrett_905e.html" title="User:AlanBarrett">AlanBarrett</a> 15:25, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've never heard these terms used in English. I just did a Google search on <i>billion trillion "short scale" "long scale"</i> and got only two hits, both on Wikipedia mirrors, both referring to this article.</p>
<p>Are these phrases in general use? They're very convenient and very evocative, but have they been used outside this article? Are they real English phrases, or are they translations into English of phrases in general use in some other language? If we're going to use these phrases here, we shouldn't just say the American used is <i>termed the "short scale"</i>, we should state clearly <i>who</i> calls it that and where the term arose.

<p><a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas_Chuquet_1f8c.html" title="Nicolas Chuquet">Nicolas Chuquet</a> is credited as the first person to put down in writing the systematic series of number names byllion, tryllion, quadrilion, etc. But did he use the <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_scale.html" title="Long scale">long scale</a> exclusively? I was fascinated by Robert Munafo's suggestion that Chuquet was inconsistent: <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mrob/pub/math/largenum.html#chuquet" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.earthlink.net/~mrob/pub/math/largenum.html#chuquet" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Munafo exhibits a page image showing Chuquet's use of the long scale, and a quotation indicating that he used the short scale. The accuracy of the quotation has, however, been strongly disputed by <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Chuquet_3b3e.html" title="User:Michael Chuquet">Michael Chuquet</a>, particularly in <a href="../../../b/i/n/Talk%7EBinary_prefix_c9d9.html" title="Talk:Binary prefix">Talk:Binary prefix</a>, where he says "One knows that Nicolas Chuquet used the long scale exclusively.... But, a falsified quotation, taken again by hundreds of Web site and a pseudo-scientist 'lucky find' (A double use of Chuquet himself&#160;!) let believe the opposite."</p>
<p>I contacted Munafo for the source of the quotation, and he replied:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is from an earlier version of the web page <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Chuquet" class="external free" title="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Chuquet" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Chuquet</a> , which I downloaded on the 22nd March 2004. Because it is a Wikipedia article, it is no longer available.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yikes! A dubious assertion of fact in Wikipedia was picked up, pruned of Wikipedian attribution by a process of quotation and requotation, promulgated to a number of other websites, and then (alas) picked up by me as a source to reference in working on current Wikipedia articles. The article from which Munafo got the quotation read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In 1484 the French mathematician Nicolas Chuquet wrote in his article "Triparty en la science de nombres": Au lieu de dire mille milliers, on dira million, au lieu de dire mille millions, on dira byllion, etc..., et tryllion, quadrilion...octylion, nonyllion, et ainsi des autres si plus oultre on voulait procder.</dd>

<p>The first is whether the quotation from Chuquet is correct; that is, is there or is there not a passage in Chuquet's work containing the word "au lieu de dire mille millions, on dira byllion?"</p>
<p>The second is a translation issue. Anyway, the question is, <i>if</i> the passage is accurately quoted, can it possibly mean anything other than a "byllion" = "mille millions" = "a thousand millions" = 1,000,000,000?

<p>Some time ago I tried looking this up in Chuquet. The version I found was a modern book with large excerpts from Chuquet and some commentary. I'm pretty certain that the quote on the internet is just wrong - it should be "au lieu de dire million millions, on dira byllion." I didn't find any evidence of Chuquet using a 10^9 billion.

<p>Have we had any discussion about whether to use the word "billion" in Wikipedia, apart from when talking about that word itself?? I think it should become Wikipedia's convention to avoid this ambiguous word. Any comments?? 66.245.126.161 16:25, 9 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I understand it, Wikipedia uses SI notation, so we would write 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>12</sup> rather than "billion." However, both this article and the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Billion" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Billion" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary</a> one make it clear to me that the standard is that billion means 10<sup>9</sup>.</dd>

<dd>No major media outlets avoid using billion, and nowhere in the English-speaking world is the term still used to mean "million million" in careful writing (which is, I hope, what Wikipedia is).

It is not just a "handful" of people who use the long-scale meaning of billion. And it is a live dispute. There are many reasons to believe that short scale usage is rapidly gaining ground, but until both U.S. and British dictionaries give the long scale usage as "archaic" or "obsolete" you can't just brush it away.

<p>The term Milliard is obsolete in modern British English. See for example <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_scale.html" title="Long scale">long scale</a> which has had that description for a little while now.

<li>An editor just removed the word "obsolete" basing this on its appearance in dictionaries. I am, however, beginning to believe that dictionaries are fairly unreliable in this regard. I have <b>never</b> heard the word "milliard" spoken aloud in English and never seen it in print, <i>except</i> in discussions of the word itself, dictionaries, tables, and the like. I'm a U. S. citizen who, however, has always done a fair amount of reading of British-originated material). A Google News search on "milliard" turns up only ten hits; six are surnames, three are in French, and one is a news item in English from a European website, which seems to be an airline discussion forum, <a href="http://www.luchtzak.be/article6476.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.luchtzak.be/article6476.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which I think is a user-posted item saying "Varig is expected to launch cost-cutting measures wheres its debts have already reached $ 2.4 milliard." I'm going to revert the change with a request that the editor discuss it here, and give examples of actual recent usage.

<p>I would also like to remove the word obsolete, but I'll wait. I use the word, am a native English speaker, and have seen its use in several government or national media reports: Australian, Indian, Dutch, Russian (when these last two translate to English). Google on "milliard government" and see that the word is still used by English speaking people around the world. I would agree that very few are aware of the word, but the same can be said of many other words that are not obsolete. I also agree that dictionaries are often wrong. How about very rare? I have no view on the use of milliard to avoid ambiguity, though. -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibob_130d.html" title="User:Wikibob">Wikibob</a> | <a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibob_a563.html" title="User talk:Wikibob">Talk</a> 23:08, 2004 Nov 21 (UTC) Some backpedalling on my part, I've just seen a <a href="http://www.agimo.gov.au/__data/assets/file/18855/sw_v7n1.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.agimo.gov.au/__data/assets/file/18855/sw_v7n1.pdf" rel="nofollow">reference</a> to the 6th edition of Australian Government Publishing Service's Style Manual that recommends avoiding milliard.

<p>Hello, this is Eric Kvaalen, the one who added a sentence suggesting the use of the word "milliard", and who deleted the word "obsolete". It is true that the word is not used much--the only other people I hear use it are people whose native language is not English. But I don't think the word was ever very common (maybe we could check the Oxford English Dictionary). I suspect it has always been a minority word which exists because of its use in other languages. As an American who has lived abroad for most of the last twenty some years, I think the use of billion for 10^9 is a sort of (unconscious) "American imperialism", and I think efforts should be made to solve the problem. My suggestion is to use the word "milliard" and I think calling it "obsolete" will make people think that one shouldn't use it. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_Kvaalen_2860.html" title="User:Eric Kvaalen">EricK</a> 06:43, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Eric. Thanks for that. The point is that even before the British started using the American usage of Billion, we used to call the number 'thousand million' and didn't use the word 'milliard' - which we all associate with continental european languages. To start calling this milliard would represent new usage. I understand that you would like us to use this word, but the simple fact is that the word milliard was hardly ever (if at all) used in British English and never in American English. As such, it is obsolete - hence the article. Thanks 07:24, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The latest OED draft entry gives the note, "The term is now largely superseded by &lt;billion&gt;." None of their recent cites use "milliard" in the precise sense of "one thousand million" but instead as an unspecified large number:</p>
<p>(n.) 1990 Man 25 95 Milliards of deities assembled in front of the cave. (adj.) 1981 'J. GASH' Vatican Rip (1983) xviii. 139, I saw a milliard doubts flicker across her face. 1991 'J. GASH' Great Calif. Game (1992) viii. 64 Somebody was changing a picture, a Philip Steer painted in a milliard divisionistic dots.</p>
<dl>
<dd>These are illiterate confusions of the word "milliard" with "myriad", and indicate precisely what tends to happen when the language is permitted to degenerate into meaninglessness.210.235.63.243 12:19, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Jonathan Gash, aka John Grant, appears to be a big fan of this sense.)</p>
<p>The latest cite listed for the specific sense is from 1977:</p>
<p>1977 Outlook for Natural Gas (Shell Internat. Petroleum Co.) 3 This will be followed within a year or so by the start up of two schemes, each involving 10 milliard cubic metres (7 million tonnes) a year.</p>
<p>But a 1974 cite suggests the term was already moribund then:</p>
<p>1974 Encounter 43 IV. 58/2 English schoolchildren are still taught that a thousand million is a milliard.</p>
<p>That was the year that Harold Wilson's government began replacing "milliard" with "billion" in treasury figures, as we've discussed before:</p>

<p>"Use of 'thousand million' for 10^9 and 'million million' for 10^12 avoids ambiguity. The old word 'milliard', also found in many other languages, can be used for 10^9, but this usage is unfamiliar to many native English speakers."</p>

<dd>As an interesting and perhaps controversial side issue, I believe you'll find that any native English speaker who is of the opinion that a "billion" is 10^12 will be familiar with the word "milliard" for 10^9. It is only those who believe that a "billion" is 10^9 who will, inevitably, not require a second word for it. In other words, "milliard" is neither unfamiliar nor (as suggested above) obsolete, but merely known to that class of speakers who adhere to this set of meanings.210.235.63.243 12:19, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'd agree with that too. Here in New Zealand many people avoid the term "billion" simply because there are two meanings of it. Milliard is still used, but very rarely (not rarely enough to be considered obsolete, mind you). Certainly the American system of using the term for 1000 million seems wrong compared to the international system of using it for 1 million million. After all, that's where the word comes from "billion" = "bi-million" = million x million. With the US system it becomes impossible to calculate larger terms quickly and easily. An octillion is 1000000^8, except in American. There it's... um... carry three... add one if it's a Thursday... slip two.... But if they want to persist in using it in that way, let them. For ease and simplicity here on Wikipedia talking in terms of "thousand million" and "million million" will solve almost all the problems (and thankfully Webster's dead, so he's not going to start calling 10,000 a million!).

Yes, there are individuals still using 10^12 - but see the quote higher up this article about anyone in the UK using billion = 10^12 being likely to be misunderstood. It's not just government documents. It's also the BBC and the press.

Searching does seem to show that (apart from dictionary definitions that are perhaps a little out of date) it is almost invariably referred to as the "old" definition of a billion. In any case, my opinion would be that the possibility of "using the wrong billion" when using source material more than a few years old needs to be made clearer in the article. Also not forgetting any other countries which may still be using the old definitions. It's probably also worth mentioning that scientists generally avoid this term, preferring the <a href="../../../s/i/_/SI_prefix_bab4.html" title="SI prefix">SI prefixes</a>.</dd>

<p>Mel, You suggest that the long scale Billion (10^12) is in current usage in the UK. Please can you provide any citation for this usage, e.g. newspapers, other media. The BBC and all broadcast media that I have looked at have used the short scale Billion for some time now.

<dd>My change was largely based on personal experience, I'm afraid, though that includes fairly recent discussion of Radio 4. A quick Google throws up <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/billion" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutwords/billion" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> (which acknowledges the adoption of the U.S. billion by the U.K. government, but still talks of the British billion as being in common use), <a href="http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxbill00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxbill00.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> (which points out that "the U.S. meaning is still rare outside journalism and finance"), and <a href="http://thesaurus.maths.org/mmkb/entry.html?action=entryById&amp;id=6541" class="external autonumber" title="http://thesaurus.maths.org/mmkb/entry.html?action=entryById&amp;id=6541" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. There's some (mostly confused) discussion at <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-61424,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-61424,00.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The British billion is still widely used outside journalism and finance (always quick to adopt Americanisms) and the government. Perhaps, rather than saying that it is ir isn't used, the article should give more detail. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 10:29, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please can you reference the Radio 4 discussion. I can't find any usage of 10^12 on any BBC website. Most of your other links have been raised and answered here before. The discussion on your last point is at <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_and_short_scales.html" title="Long and short scales">Long and short scales</a>.</dd>
<dd>I agree that there are several individuals who continue to use the old version, a bit like pre-decimal currency and metric martyrs - your Grauniad quote seems very apt for these people. However, my experience is that the overwhelming current usage in the UK media (TV, press, web, etc.) is 10^9 and has been for a few years. The dictionaries are lagging behind the street. Can you provide any UK web article currently using 10^12? For example, here is the BBC recently in scientific mood (as opposed to journalism or finance) <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4886816.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4886816.stm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, and here in numerical mood <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4750744.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4750744.stm" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4487100.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4487100.stm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. There are 86 pages of search items referencing Billion at the BBC alone - mostly finance - and all of them using 10^9 AFAICT. <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcairns_bb52.html" title="User:Icairns">Ian Cairns</a> 10:50, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I count anything on the BBC Website as journalism, whatever its subject. As we have to go by <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, etc., then even if it's true that the relevant reference works, such as dictionaries, are lagging behind the truth, we have to lag behind too. (Though I believe, though from personal experience only, that the use of the British billion is more common than you suggest. If it comes to that, while "metric martyrs" in the sense of trasesman insisting on using non-metric measures may be rare, the use of such measures in the population is very widespread.)</p>
<p>If I can find other citations I'll add them, but Googling is a tiresome business; one has not only to find relevant uses of "billion", but know enough about the subject matter to be able to tell which they mean. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 20:43, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't understand your rationale for changing this article from U.S. to U.K. English, nor for changing the ordering of the explanation. The former is clearly against the MoS, the latter seems to be based on a misunderstanding (that this being an English-language encyclopædia means that it's an English-nationality encyclopædia). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 22:35, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please clarify where I have changed this from US to UK English. I can't see it. The article sections deal with 10^9 and 10^12 in that order. I changed the article's introduction to keep to the same order, i.e. "respectively". Do you have a problem with 10^12 not coming first? I don't see where I have denied anyone's nationality.

<p>There are Millions of People they learned Million, Milliard, Billion, Billiard, Trillion, Trilliard and so on. I suggest there are more non-native-speaking-english readers then us and gb- readers.

<dl>
<dd>Hello Cosy. The UK and Ireland are in the European Community. Are you suggesting that they all learned Million, Milliard, Billion, Billiard, Trillion, Trilliard? If so, you are wrong. Please see <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_and_short_scales.html" title="Long and short scales">Long and short scales</a> where it is explained why Billion is no longer termed 'US' usage. Similarly, your long scale usage was incorrectly termed 'European enumeration'. Contributors have added (to Long and short scales) that some non-English-speaking European countries use most of the short scale usage (although they may use Milliard instead of Billion). The whole story is in Long and short scales. The abbreviated story is in Milliard / Billion, etc. <a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcairns_bb52.html" title="User:Icairns">Ian Cairns</a> 10:22, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
