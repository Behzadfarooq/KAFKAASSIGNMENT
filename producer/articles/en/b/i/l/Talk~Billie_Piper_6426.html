<p>Since when has her birth name had that spelling? Moreover, it ought to be noted somehow that Billie remains her 'real' name. I remember from Billie's early website <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980710010728/c3.vmg.co.uk/billie/club/questions/basics.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.archive.org/web/19980710010728/c3.vmg.co.uk/billie/club/questions/basics.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Q: Is Billie your real name?</dd>
<dd>A: Yes, my real name is Billie Piper. I was registered as Leanne for three weeks, but luckily my parents changed their minds!</dd>

<p>So it seems we need to verify the chart positions of Billie's singles and albums. All of Piper's UK discography and chart positions are found in a sidebar in the <i>Doctor Who Magazine</i> interview that I added to the References section, so that's OK. (The magazine says that the album <i>Honey to the B</i> made it to #14, but <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honey_to_the_B_e1e3.html" title="Honey to the B">Honey to the B</a> says it debuted at #1. Not sure which is correct, but I'm leaving the <i>DWM</i> citation on the page for now.) I haven't been able to find a source for the Australian and US chart positions, other than the <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honey_to_the_B_e1e3.html" title="Honey to the B">Honey to the B</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walk_of_Life_c9c1.html" title="Walk of Life">Walk of Life</a> pages here on Wikipedia (and of course, I don't know where they got their info from). I don't know much about pop music, really, and I haven't noticed extensive footnoting on the discographies of other pop singers here on Wikipedia. Does anyone know what we need to do to meet the standard for verification, and how best to cite whatever we find? (For a bit I was writing "(Cook, 2006)" after each UK chart position, but that looked really dumb so I reverted it.) Help from anyone is welcome. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 03:02, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I'm not the one who put the "not verified" and "fact" tags on the page. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> was. I was just trying to respond responsibly. In fact, I did a fair bit of research, and found both online and print sources for the UK chart positions (and added both to the "References" section); it's the Australian ones I couldn't find. The Rage playlist site that you added isn't terribly helpful unless you happen to know the exact week that each of Billie's songs were on the playlist — even if you perform a <a href="http://search.abc.net.au/search/search.cgi?query=Playlist+%2BBillie+%2BPiper&amp;collection=abcall" class="external text" title="http://search.abc.net.au/search/search.cgi?query=Playlist+%2BBillie+%2BPiper&amp;collection=abcall" rel="nofollow">detailed search</a>, it gives a list of every time one of her songs was played on the show.</dd>

<dd>I'm not going to put the tags back on, though.

<p>Her parents originally conceived of her name as Leiane Piper but changed it to her full name Billie PAUL Piper, as they were intent on boys.

<dd>I agree that "Paul" is hardly a feminine name, but we'd need an actual citation that that was Mandy and Paul Piper's reason for choosing a masculine-sounding name before putting it in the article. Maybe Billie's parents wanted to make some point about boys' and girls' names. Without a citation, we can't say that they chose the masculine-sounding name because they were "keen on boys". —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 23:57, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Numerous sources call him a builder, and while many actors take on casual work to support themselves, the only production IMDb (he's the only paul piper in there) has him in is some documenary about billie.

<p>Well the source above is the only one i've ever found, and it says "Leanne", although as it was from a spoken interview it prob says more about the journalist - i mean, i doubt she spelled it out for them. Perhaps the alternate spelling was added to the article by someone to whom it is the normal spelling, or just possibly someone with a personal connection(?). Until the other one can be sourced, i'll change it back to Leanne. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoammo_73c6.html" title="User:Amoammo">Amo</a> 00:32, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>She has declared, very openly, in very clear terms, her attraction to women - that is, her bisexuality. She doesn't need to have encounters.

<li>If there's a category for bi-curious people, I think that would be more appropriate, since she's only stated an attraction. That is, she's expressed a bisexual <i>orientation</i>, but has not adopted (at least in public) a bisexual <i>identity</i> or demonstrated bisexual <i>behaviour</i>. Given that it's only one out of the three possible meanings of "bisexual", I think that based on the GCN quote alone it's more appropriate to keep her out of the category.

<dd>Actually I think this "bi-curious" idea is a creepy idea (you feel it is OK?) used to demean bisexuals. I don't know why you dragged it in unless you have some agenda. Perhaps you think bisexuality is abnormal and that is why you want to draw the category in abnormal terms (no one objects to other categories - but with bi/homosexuality they think it is a taint and are very eager to pander to bigots). Read what she said. And read the article on bisexuality - she is well within its parameters. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENerriTunn_e68a.html" title="User:NerriTunn">NerriTunn</a> 19:18, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Erm... if you knew me and my family you'd know that the suggestion that I think bisexuality is abnormal is laughable. I'm <i>very</i> supportive of LGBT rights, and have even protested in favor of gay marriage. If you look above, you'll see that I didn't suggest "bi-curious" — Amoammo did. I went with it simply because I thought that it was a more accurate and concise description of what she said in the interview: she is attracted to women, and "might" want to sleep with one.</dd>

<dd>I don't have an opinion one way or the other about "bi-curious", but I don't see it (or bisexuality) as "creepy". I see it as distinct from bisexuality, insofar as bisexuality is more a fixed identity ("this is who I am") and bi-curiosity (is that the right term?) is an expression of potential ("this is who I might be"). I also do not think either category has a "taint" — my sole interest is in accuracy, and keeping with the BLP policy.</dd>

<dd>To that end, I think we should go with Foxhill's compromise below. Aside from the question of bisexual vs. bi-curious, I hope that everyone can agree that if we incorporate the quote into the "personal life" section <i>and</i> have the link to wikiquote (both of which NerriTunn removed in reverting me) the "Quotes" section is redundant. NerriTunn, if you want to change the wording of the "personal life" section again, please don't revert the other changes (such as the wikiquote link or the smaller reference section) — just edit the "personal life" section alone.

<dd>If this is causing so much strife, why don't you just replace the line "She has also stated that she is bisexual but has yet to have sex with a woman." and say "in an interview with the <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_Community_News_c5b7.html" title="Gay Community News">Gay Community News</a> in 2006, she spoke of her attraction to members of her own sex stating 'Yeah, I fancy women big time... I check them out more than I check men out.' " reference it and job done. Both bisexual and bi-curious are disputed terms in many fields so if they cause friction between editors, why not just not use them. The quote gives her position on the matter, she herself hasn't stated implicitly whether she is one or the other, so there is no need to try to interpret the source, just say what you see.

I'll put it back in now, in the interests of compromise, but I think we should discuss the matter further. I'll also ask for opinions at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ECategorization_Gender%2C_race_and_sexuality_74d6.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Categorization/Gender, race and sexuality">Wikipedia talk:Categorization/Gender, race and sexuality</a>, to see whether there's a precedent for cases like this (where an individual has made statements suggesting a sexual orientation, but not used the term themselves). —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 23:44, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The closest thing I can think of to an actual precedent for a case like this pertained to <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristanna_Loken_2cda.html" title="Kristanna Loken">Kristanna Loken</a>, an actress who stated in an interview that she was attracted to and had dated both men and women, but her categorization as a bisexual actor was disputed on the basis that she hadn't actually used the specific <i>word</i> "bisexual". That's not exactly analogous to this case, true, but it's the closest there is to a similar precedent, as far as I know...and as of today, the bisexual actors category <i>is</i> present on her article.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I can see and understand both sides of this matter. Certainly it's appropriate to include her quote in the article, but be aware that it <i>is</i> problematic to extrapolate an <i>identity</i> from a statement of this type. It can certainly point toward bisexuality, but it could also point toward lesbianism ("I check them out more than I check men out") — and, for that matter, you can't entirely rule out the possibility of a <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a> move here (i.e. going for the shock value by "revealing" something she'll retract later). One of the reasons sexuality is such a complicated and controversial categorization scheme for people is that orientation isn't, in and of itself, a visible characteristic; it's one that we can only identify through a person's statements and actions, and those can <i>both</i> be inconsistent with a person's <i>internal</i> orientation setting. In other words, we can only identify a person's sexual orientation through what they consciously <i>choose</i> to reveal about it.</p>
<p>So in terms of the <i>article</i> content, we should certainly stick to quoting her as precisely as possible and not inferring anything she hasn't said. <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is pretty clear on that part. Whether the <i>category</i> is right or wrong, I couldn't say, but hopefully my input can help direct the ongoing discussion a bit. I'm also going to post this to the LGBT notice board for additional input. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:26, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Should we consolidate the recently added B-sides into the singles, or remove them? —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 05:49, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Register_Office_ac41.html" title="General Register Office">GRO</a>'s index for birth registrations for the December quarter of 1982 quite clearly shows her name as "Leian Paul Piper".

I'd suggest that any other spelling is either a case of the name being misremembered, or it being mistranscribed in interviews. Clearly the article needs revising accordingly.<br />
Anyone checking the link should be warned that the page is a fairly large download.<br />

<p>An anon recently removed a comment about Piper's supposed music comeback (based on a post at with the edit summary "MySpace is believed to be run by an imposter, therefore this music news cannot be trusted." I dont doubt the anon's comment, especially since I've seen no other sources besides this MySpace page saying that Piper intends to return to pop music — but I'd like some more confirmation that the MySpace page is a fake. If nothing else, it would be good to know that for sure so that we can deal with people re-adding material from it. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 14:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article states she and Evans were divorced last September, and gives <a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article1399518.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article1399518.ece" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> as a reference; however, there's a single reference to the divorce in that article and that does not state it is finalized (nor does it give a date). Today we have <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/article-23388607-details/If+I+started+thinking+too+much+I'd+probably+break/article.do" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/article-23388607-details/If+I+started+thinking+too+much+I'd+probably+break/article.do" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, in which Billie herself clearly states "I'm not even divorced yet...".
