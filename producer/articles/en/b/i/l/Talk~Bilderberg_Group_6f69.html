<p>Hmm, something I do not understand (technically): I only opended the discussion here, added my remark above, furthermore looked up the history (but didn´t change nothing in the article) - but then, when I went back to the article (or even opended it again later) m y old sentence stood there again (including that type-error "whome"). That was not my intention, I tried (several times) to replace it by the the newer version (from the history) again; hope it works now.</p>

<p><i>The folllowing is written from a highly critical perspective.</i></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> Bilderberg meeting in <a href="../../../v/e/r/Versailles.html" title="Versailles">Versailles</a> conveniently merged into the <a href="../../../g/8/_/G8.html" title="G8">G8</a> meeting of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finance_minister.html" title="Finance minister">finance ministers</a> in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, a 20-minute car ride from Versailles, on May 19. The procedure is <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tradition.html" title="Tradition">traditional</a>: what happens in the Bilderberg is usually a preview of what is later discussed at the full G8 gathering, scheduled in 2003 for June 1 to 3 at <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evian-les-Bains_40c1.html" title="Evian-les-Bains">Evian-les-Bains</a> in the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alps.html" title="Alps">Alps</a>.</p>
<p>On Bilderberg's first full 2003 working day on May 15, 2003, French <a href="../../../p/r/e/President.html" title="President">President</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Chirac_001d.html" title="Jacques Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> delivered a welcoming speech, trying to bury the bitter divisions among the guests over the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">war on Iraq</a> by emphasizing that the US and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Europe_1e16.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a> are longtime <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allies.html" title="Allies">allies</a>. But Chirac's gracious hosting may not have been enough to soothe the hawks in the US administration still miffed at "pacifist" France.</p>
<p>An influential Jewish European banker reveals that the ruling elite in Europe is now telling their minions that the West is on the brink of total financial meltdown; so the only way to save their precious investments is to bet on the new global crisis centered around the Middle East, which replaced the crisis evolving around the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>.</p>
<p>According to a banking source in the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_London_c553.html" title="City of London">City of London</a> connected to Versailles, what has transpired from the 2003 meeting is that American and European Bilderbergers have not exactly managed to control their split over the American invasion and occupation of <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq.html" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, as well as over <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israeli</a> Prime Minister <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_Sharon_de21.html" title="Ariel Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a>'s hardline policy against the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian.html" title="Palestinian">Palestinians</a>.</p>
<p>Europe's elite were opposed to an American invasion of Iraq since the 2002 Bilderberg meeting in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chantilly%2C_Virginia_4ee1.html" title="Chantilly, Virginia">Chantilly, Virginia</a>. Rumsfeld himself had promised them it wouldn't happen. Last week, everybody struck back at Rumsfeld, asking about the infamous "<a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Weapons of mass destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a>". Most of Europe's elite do not believe American promises that Iraq's <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petroleum.html" title="Petroleum">oil</a> will "benefit the Iraqi people". They know that <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenue.html" title="Revenue">revenues</a> from Iraqi oil will be used to rebuild what America has bombed. And the debate is still raging on what kind of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract.html" title="Contract">contracts</a> which rewarded <a href="../../../b/e/c/Bechtel_Corporation_71d0.html" title="Bechtel Corporation">Bechtel</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halliburton.html" title="Halliburton">Halliburton Energy Services</a> will "benefit" Western Europe.</p>
<p>Europe's elite, according to those close to Bilderberg, are suspicious that the US does not need or even want a stable, legitimate central government in Iraq. When that happens, there will be no reason for the US to remain in the country. Europe's elite see the US establishing "facts on the ground": establishing a long-term military presence and getting the oil flowing again under American <a href="../../../c/o/n/Control.html" title="Control">control</a>. This could go on for years, as long as the Americans can guarantee enough essential services to prevent the Iraqi people from engaging in a war of national liberation.</p>
<p>It was also extremely hard at the Versailles meeting to forge a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a> on the necessity of a European Union army totally independent of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization_0e71.html" title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO). The US establishment, of course, is against the EU army. But so are some Europeans, starting with anti-army cheerleader <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Robertson_32be.html" title="George Robertson">Lord Robertson</a>, NATO's secretary general. Europe's elite can't stand US domination of NATO any more. Some Europeans suggest a separate force, but controlled by NATO. Americans argue that a separate EU force would dissolve NATO's role as the UN's world army. And Americans insist that NATO is no longer confined to the defense of Europe: its troops now could go anywhere in the world, directed or not by the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_Security_Council_53d3.html" title="UN Security Council">UN Security Council</a>. The impasse remains.</p>
<p>All these crucial developments were discussed behind closed doors. The Trianon Palace Hotel in Versailles was closed to the public. Part-time employees were sent home. The ones who remained were told that they would be fired if caught revealing anything about the meeting. Armed guards completely isolated and cordoned off the hotel. Some members of the American corporate press attended - but the public will never know about it: Bilderberg news is not fit to print - or broadcast. No <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalist.html" title="Journalist">journalists</a> from any <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a> controlled by Bilderberg multinational tycoons such as <a href="../../../r/u/p/Rupert_Murdoch_2da1.html" title="Rupert Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a> were or will be allowed to report it.</p>

<p>That should have a shape, a form. [](...[])+ [](...[])+[]...[](...[])+ (...) + [] (...[]). In each [] (...[]) you can consider a person in a double sense, one significant, sintactic, and another, heuristic, semantic. There is discussion about the topic (Hintikka, for example; and basically Searle -the theory of the sign-) the belief of a single person is not substantive almost in the more cases, but what about the knowledge? In an androtic sense for the government, you should make noise before say works to anothers. Affectiveness stays in the pledge the most of the time, on that the knowledge reflects point to point the metrical of each position. Mostly a position underkissed should be a prominent position. And by the way that is the case. Who doesnt work cant manage properly the fact, yes she can manage the efect, and hesitate when the fact becomes relevant. In order to discuss, a NP comprehension of the factors is always by effect of the fact view under primary consideration; in a way like another, decisions art to have multilevel as say coordination. To each factor an envelop mixture is needed, making stress on qualities and disposable rights effective to each basic person. On the peaks of rights the equivalence is obvious, between partners the robotization of the congress gives a shaft of methafors to dispatch each topic or scene. Ad hoc, in a metadata file is intended to read the conflictivity, but not from the conscious yes from the inner x-file about, a black box remanent every day. In short, each step on the fluid of a metric movement of costume involves not always human understanding, but shadowed citizenship former "factors" More than it, jajaja, critical resolutions have to be ended from several points of view, better, lots of views in congress, doing relevant the technic execution of demostrative experience as usual decision making. Now, be sure the views of youth, children, women, "oldies" jaja, homeless, identities above all, amongst men we claim the ashes of our tobacco discomformity (I smoke, by the moon) to decir "Hey you all, you are not workin' you are havin a coffee" César Castro GMT 0:00 Santiago de Compostela</p>

<p>This group ("Bildenbergers") was (from about fifteen until ten years ago especially) the subject of constant clamouring on American <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_wing.html" title="Right wing">right wing</a> <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_radio.html" title="Talk radio">talk radio</a> about how it was nothing less than a <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">cabal</a> which <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secrecy.html" title="Secrecy">secretly</a> ruled the world. In recent years, this seems to have diminshed as a topic for discussion, at least on programmes that I have heard. (Perhaps because much of the discussion seemed so patently ridiculous, perhaps because its most ardent opponents also seemed rife with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> – it was all the worse because it was somehow a <i><a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a></i> cabal.) I don't know how to incorporate this within the body of the article without it seeming hopelessly POV, even though the <i>fact</i> is not that these sort of charges have merit, but that they were relentlessly discussed is undeniable. I would like to see someone try to handle this.</p>

<p>Bilderberg would necessarily be anti-conspiracy because it is known. Much is known about this group and the fact that it has a name at all shows that it isn't secret. By contrast, a group that sought secrecy would have no formal organization. My guess is that Bilderberg meets at hotels because its members would like the freedom to speak their minds without offending their weekend host. The price they pay is some media attention, but we would all be remiss if we believed that this <i>known</i> group was somehow more harmful than the potentially thousands of groups not known to the American and European publics. Watch "Remains of the Day" again and you will see everything that's right with Bilderberg.</p>

<li>"Influential" is fuzzy. We can agree that <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> is extremely powerful. Is he "influential"? Depends. He doesn't exert <i>any</i> positive (some negative) soft influence on the 49% who hate his guts. He has less cultural influence even than some people I know. "Influential" begs the question "influential over whom"? I'm not powerful, have never held political or high corporate office, but I have done some things that would qualify me as "influential"... but lots of people can so the term's not terribly meaningful. I find the word "influential", in this case, more problematic than "powerful", which is neutral. To say someone's "powerful" isn't inherently negative or positive.</li>
<li>Social class <i>is</i> the reason the BG and other secret societies keep themselves in secrecy. Same with "Tiger 21", "<a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a>", and other similar groups. Why are "big decisions" made on $150-300k/membership golf courses? To keep people out. It's that simple. It's a fact that there's a group (or maybe multiple groups) of people trying to consolidate wealth and power... and exclusivist "high society" groups like the BG are how they do it. These groups are designed to keep the "common people" out of "big decisions". They'd much rather put their sons (some deserving, some worthless) into overpaid positions of privilege running smooth machines than open what they have to the "undesirables". Now, this extremist exclusivity certainly doesn't characterize all of the "upper class", and these "society" people may turn out to be a bunch of fools, fencing themselves in while becoming ironically less relevant in an internationalizing, democratizing, decentralizing world... but for now they're very powerful. They got us an elitist oil war, after all. Quite frankly, I believe that these elitist sub-societies pose a far greater threat to the United States, the American way of life, and the nation's stability in the next 20 years than any foreign threat, including terrorism. Terrorism took a few thousand lives in the past five years, quite dramatically, while millions of Americans got laid off to fund a party for increasingly-rich, out-of-touch execs running smooth machines, who get handsomely rewarded even if they get <i>fired</i>.</li>
<li>Third point: Fair enough.</li>
<li>I agree that my edit summary betrays my political bias. I actually consider all these elitist secret societies evil; however, Skull and Bones is just a bunch of weird, underachieving rich kids masturbating in coffins (and <i>their</i> reason for secrecy is that the stuff they did was so damn embarrassing it would make every S&amp;B alum in the country a laughing-stock) while the Bilderberg group got an oil war on. It makes the latter a much more pressing evil. I'll raise S&amp;B awareness when I'm aware of them doing something truly sinister. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEventHorizon_687f.html" title="User:EventHorizon">EventHorizon</a> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User_talk%7EEventHorizon_f083.html" title="User talk:EventHorizon">talk</a> 04:51, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Re: "influential" v. "powerful": I guess that makes sense.</li>
<li>The secrecy may very well be due to class, and it probably is a major factor. If such is the case, why not just say it in the article? Saying that the meetings are "kept from the 'common people'" is sneaky and inherently POV. An encyclopedia is to supposed be neutral and present the facts in an objective manner. While those facts may reveal unpleasant truths about their subject, they should not be mixed with value judgements. For example, the sentence "Hitler believed that jews were an inferior race, and he killed 6 million of them." is preferable to "Hitler was a racist bigot, and he brutally murdered 6 million jews." <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Burley_88c3.html" title="User:Scott Burley"></a>-- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Burley_88c3.html" title="User:Scott Burley">Scott</a> <a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScott_Burley_3755.html" title="User talk:Scott Burley"><font color="black"><small><i>e<sup>iπ</sup></i></small></font></a> 20:54, Feb 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>many sites that you can find google, tell that bilderberg group was born in Oosterbeeck, in Oland, in Hotel Bildeberg: a very different information. the last meeting of bildeberg group took place two years ago at stresa, in italy. prince of netherland was the president untill 1976, when he must leave the president because of the Lockheed scandal. the same year david rockefeller, member of trilateral commission, became the president of bildeberg group.those are the information that everyone can find in google.</p>

<dd>As long as you acknowledge that it's a stupid question.&#160;:) (jk) The only thing 'the public' knows for sure is *that* these people meet, *where* they do it, and *when* the meetings take place. The name is derived from the location of the first meeting. Everything else is secret. As for the article being 'explanatory', fully or otherwise, you can do us all (the whole world, I mean) a favour if you're interested, and try to get into one of the meetings. Then, come back and write in the article (do it from your laptop while you're there, if you like) what you learn. We can, after all, *only* publish the information that is available. Should the article be deleted until we know for sure what our leaders and the business elite are discussing without telling their constituencies? I'm inclined to say no. The existence of this 'group', whatever you might choose to call it, is not a 'crackpot theory', just an observation of something the world's leaders do every year that they don't tell anyone about the results of. *If* there's a political concern, it ought to be nonpartisan: Democratically elected leaders in discussion with industry and the banking class in secret, beyond public scrutiny and (presumably) accountability may be making decisions in concert, without the involvement of the public or the free media. That, if that's what's happening, is antidemocratic and potentially illegal. Sigma-6</dd>

<dd>I couldn't begin to count the number of grassroots grouplets I've been involved with that didn't get as far as letterheads, bank accouunts etc. There was one we called a "supper club", another called the Quadrilateral Commission (one step beyond the Trilateral one) which had a letterhead but nothing else, and so on. Some of these grouplets actually did get quite a lot done, after a fashion. Probably the best way to understand this Bilderbergers thing, is as the same kind of <i>ad hoc</i> informal network that doesn't get too hung up on organizational details but just wants to share ideas and concoct strategies, and maybe pull off some behind-the-scenes actions. What's wrong with that? They just happen to be billionaires and their political puppets, dedicated to controlling the rest of us, but hey, they have freedom of association too, right? I think the argument is with the content, rather than the style. As for what the content is, you can pretty well deduce it without having to have it spelled out. If you accept the existence of this class of folks, you should probably accept their agenda too, or at least try to argue it out with them <i>mano a mano</i> if you can detain one long enough for good chat. If you don't accept their existence, then whether they meet or not is beside the point. (By "existence as a class" I'm resorting to the old commie trick of implying that you can eliminate a category without eliminating its (human) contents. I like to think that's actually true - and that these benighted perverse victims of their own hubris can be liberated. I'm so neive... but it sure beats the alternative.)</dd>

<p>The 'Bilderberg Group' carries all kinds of conspiratorial connotations, and no-group self-identifies themselves as such. On the other hand, there is an annual event known as the 'Bilderberg Meeting', which even issues press releases on occasion <a href="http://www.prnewswire.de/cgi/release?id=42594" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prnewswire.de/cgi/release?id=42594" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. In the interests of accuracy and credibility, I propose changing the title to <b>Bilderberg Meeting.</b> - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrosbiesmith_4feb.html" title="User:Crosbiesmith">Crosbiesmith</a> 23:06, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The current name "Bilderberg Group Conspiracy" is terrible, although it is not an official group, it is certainly not a conspiracy. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:00, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, "Conspiracy" should not have a capital C, however I think a different name is needed altogether. I am reverting back until we come up with something more sensible. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:20, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I can tell it is most commonly referred to as the Bilderberg group, "meeting" is ok, but if you are keen on changing it then I think "conference" is slightly preferable to "meeting" (note lower casing). <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 21:16, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have moved it to "Bilderberg group", with a lower case g (unlike before), as it is not a proper noun. I have also changed the introduction slightly to reflect the fact that it is not an official entity. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluemoose_d309.html" title="User:Bluemoose">Martin</a> 22:29, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nope. This really is pointless as well, because if they were so secretive how would we know about it? Also, are the Illuminati that well known?

<p>The "Attendees" section seems to indicate that there are three "chairman" for the Group. Is this the case (chairmen or chairs or chairpeople?) or is there an error? Don't know enough to fix it myself.</p>

<p><a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeC_3d6e.html" title="User:GeorgeC">User:GeorgeC</a> - I think your changes to the article introduction have introduced <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">point-of-view</a>. In particular, the text states that Bilderberg is a group which circumvents democratic process. Unless this is the group's declared aim, this remains a matter of opinion, not a matter of fact. I also think the text comes close to using <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasel words</a>. The text states 'Numerous theories abound', 'Allegedly, they have an office', and 'the meeting is said to have occurred', without stating who propounds these theories, who alleges, or who says. These claims require at least an attribution or, better still, a referenced attribution. I believe these changes cause the article to fall short of the required quality standards, and I will be reverting these shortly. Other people may wish to comment on these changes.

<dd>You've replaced the P.O.V. with another unattributed allegation, specifically, 'its alleged circumvention of democratic process'. Regarding the views of David Icke and Alex Jones, these may or may not be worthy of inclusion somewhere within Wikipedia, but they do not belong in the introduction to the article on Bilderberg. These are not particularly notable individuals, nor are they notable experts on the Bilderberg conferences. Their writings have a familar drawback which is that they <i>do not cite their sources</i>. - 20:58, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have reverted your introduction. If your really feel the views of Icke and Jones are noteworthy, please put these in the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilderberg_Group_5eac.html#Perspectives_on_the_nature_of_the_group" title="Bilderberg Group">Bilderberg Group#Perspectives on the nature of the group</a> section, avoiding point of view and unattributed opinion. The material added was far too long for an introductory section. For example, claims about Kissinger's accent do not belong in the 'Bilderberg' article, let alone its introduction. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrosbiesmith_4feb.html" title="User:Crosbiesmith">Crosbiesmith</a> 09:11, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the list of links in see also is way to long. However, I don't want to remove any of infoavour of others before we've discussed it here.

<dl>
<dd>I absolutely agree. I've said elsewhere that I'm against 'See also' lists almost all the time. If a link is relevant, I feel it should be mentioned in the text. By that criteria, I would remove 'see also' altogether. If we are to keep the list, we need to answer the question, 'What is the purpose of the See Also' list? How does it assist the reader? Then we can decide which links to keep.</dd>
<dd>I suspect the See Also list is often used to imply a connection between two topics where none can be proved. - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrosbiesmith_4feb.html" title="User:Crosbiesmith">Crosbiesmith</a> 08:24, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>People seem to be using this article to show their own opinions of the controversial figures associated with the organisation. Prince Bernhard was shown as an 'ex-SS officer' (he was in the RAF, never the SS). It wasn't the only disagreement between this page and even other Wikipedia Biography pages. Alot of these people are living persons, so maybe we should be more careful with it. <a href="../../../t/a/y/User%7ETaylorSAllen_5223.html" title="User:TaylorSAllen">TaylorSAllen</a> 01:57, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Surely the point is this;</p>
<p>it is not just a discussion, an agenda is set and a truth created. There is thus a coordinated programme of dissemination between the media, business, science and politics.</p>
<p>The necessity of a programme, the truth of an idea is created by it's iteration.</p>
<p>Political policies (like the identity registration programme) are justified by the international inevitability. The policy is laundered.</p>
<p>It is discussed at Bilderburg, agreed at the G8. Each of the governments says that they must have it because the other ones are having it. They are 'powerless' the future is inevitable, it is 'progress', there is no scope for democratic debate.</p>
<p>The 'perception management' has already been created, the rebuttals of oponents have already been anticipated and rejoinders created, the financial opportunities have been analysed and aportioned.</p>
<p>The idea that we are supposed to take these disccusions on trust is clearly ridiculous. But, the notion is spread that it would be ridiculous to question that these powerful people could even be considering creating situations to their profit and circumventing democracy, procedural rules, corporate compliance or even the most basic form of oversight.</p>
<p>It is the creation of a Guild of International Governance. It is an example of an elite democratic method in which an oligarchy rules for the benefit of all (in their minds) which just happens to be in their own interests (as they - the best of the best can tell that they are the best of the best, everyone else must be inferior and do what they are told).</p>
