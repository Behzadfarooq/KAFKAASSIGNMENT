<p><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Brown_5a54.html" title="Bill Brown">Bill Brown</a> (born 1942) was a long time air personality on former oldies station <a href="../../../w/c/b/WCBS_FM_8f7c.html" title="WCBS FM">WCBS FM</a> <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. For most of his tenure there he aired on Middays at the station. He also did many voiceovers on commercials airing on that and other New York City radio and television stations.</p>
<p>Bill Brown began his radio career in Georgia back in the late 1950s working at several local radio stations. He entered the military in the early 1960s and did some work on armed forces radio playing top 40 and rock and roll tunes. After serving honorably he began working on WOR-FM (now <a href="../../../w/r/k/WRKS_676e.html" title="WRKS">WRKS</a>)in 1966 doing various swing airshift eventually becoming full time. Initially WOR FM was a progressive rock station but evolved into an adult top 40/oldies station by 1968.</p>
<p>In 1969, WCBS FM traded in their easy listening Young Sound format for an album rock format similar to WABC FM (Later <a href="../../../w/p/l/WPLJ_af08.html" title="WPLJ">WPLJ</a>) and WNEW FM. He was on the original airstaff. Unfortunately, WCBS FM did not achieve even mediocre ratings while, WNEW FM and WPLJ got most of the rock listeners. After research and several years of very low ratings WCBS FM dropped the AOR format on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">July 7</a> at 6 AM and began playing Oldies from 1955 to then current product. Initially the station played both rock and roll songs and non rock songs of the 1950s and early 60's and only softer rock and pop hits of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Bill Brown, along with the rest of the airstaff including Don K Reed (who was hired in January of 1972) all stayed on with the Oldies format. Back then, it was common for airstaffs to stay on after format changes and not as common to lay off entire airstaffs. By the end of 1972, Bill Brown was on the station weekdays 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Satrdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Still over the next few years most of the staffers would leave through attrition but Bill Brown and Don K Reed stayed on and were still part of the station in 1974. In 1975, Bill Brown also became Program Director of WCBS FM. For a few months he gave up his midday airshift. By the end of 1976, Bill Brown was on from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays along with his Saturday morning shift. Under Bill Brown WCBS FM moved away from easy listening type and began to play more 60's rock. In 1978 Bill Brown gave up his program director position but retained his airshifts. His shift was still 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays and 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. weekends.</p>
<p>In 1984, when Ron Lundy arrived, Bill Brown was moved to 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. while Ron moved to the 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. slot. Harry Harrison now aired from 5:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. (previously he was on 5:30 a.m. to 10 a.m.) Bill's Saturday shift was then 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. every second week. Bill Brown also continued doing voiceovers for many commercials airing on WCBS FM and other radio stations. He celebrated 20 years in 1989 and 25 years in 1994 and 30 years of service in 1999. In 1994, he officially dropped his Saturday morning airshift in honor of his many years of service at the station.</p>
<p>As airstaff occasionally came and went (though staffers stayed many years in most cases) Bill Brown continued on consistently from noon to 3 p.m. In 2005 though his airshift moved to 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays. With his years of service, age, and retirements of other well known staffers it was speculated that his retirement was not far off. Also WCBS FM began watering down their 1955 to 1989 (1955 to 2000 including current product 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.) format at the start of 2001. The symbolic point came when the Doo Wop Shop with Don K Reed was canceled on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a> of 2002. By 2003 the amount of total songs on the station were decreased from over 1500 to under 1000. The pre 64 songs in rotation also dropped from about 250 to barely 25. While 70's and 80's music was played more often their song amount of songs in regular rotation also decreased.</p>
<p>After a lot of negative feedback about the lack of pre 64 oldies, a show called Heart &amp; Soul Of Rock &amp; Roll was brought back in June of 2003 on Sunday evenings from 8 p.m. to Midnight hosted by Norm N Nite live from Cleveland's Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Still, Bill Brown remained until <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_3.html" title="June 3">June 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>. Although ratings were decent and the station was profitable, CBS executives abruptly alid off the entire airstaff at 4 p.m. that day. Bill Brown was the last live airpersonality to sign off several minutes before 4. He came out of Margaritaville/<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Buffett_32b7.html" title="Jimmy Buffett">Jimmy Buffett</a> and played Rescue Me/Fontilla Bass. It was unclear whether or not he knew the end was happening from his last statement though he did not say a typical goodbye. His last words were "CBS FM 101.1- Did You ever get the urge to scream RESCUE ME!! Well I am beginning to feel that way right now...here's Fontella Bass. CBS FM 101.1 By Now!!" Other airstaffers definitely did not know the end was near as they said goodbye and stated when they would be back. The rest of the airstaff did not know what was happening until after Bill Brown signed off and was at the meeting. In fact half the airstaff did not even attend this meeting. They were in touch through a conference call. These staffers could not be present because this meeting was only announced at 2 p.m. that day.</p>
<p>At the 4 p.m. meeting the staffers were laid off and informed that Oldies CBS FM would be shut down immediately and replaced by an adult rock format of over 2000 songs called "JACK FM". From the 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. hour the station played 8 oldies wth jingles in between followed by 30 minutes of stunt montages. At 5 PM the jockless Jack format signed on.</p>
<p>Bill Brown then retired from CBS FM after 33 years of playing oldies as well as nearly 36 years of service. He is the only airpersonality to be with the station through their entire run using live on air personalities. He did one of their first shifts the day WCBS FM adopted the rock format in 1969 and the very last live airshift doing oldies in 2005. Don K Reed was the only other air-personality to be with CBS FM during their entire run as an oldies station. He did the fourth shift on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">July 7</a> into <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_8.html" title="July 8">July 8</a> of 1972 and did the 4th to last live airshift from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_5.html" title="June 5">June 5</a> of 2005.</p>
<p>Bill Brown resides in Northern New Jersey with his wife.</p>
