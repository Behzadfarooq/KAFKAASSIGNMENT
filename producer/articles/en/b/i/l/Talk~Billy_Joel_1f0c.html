<p><i>Solved: Billy lived in the city of Hicksville, in a Levittown project. <a href="http://www.antonnews.com/hicksvilleillustratednews/1999/08/13/news/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antonnews.com/hicksvilleillustratednews/1999/08/13/news/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">Locarno</a> 14:46, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>I can confirm this. My backyard happens to face his old backyard, just over the sump. I'm on Lantern Rd. and he was on Meeting Lane. Levittown is three blocks south of his house. "Hicksville" just looks lousy in a rock-n-roll bio. He most definitely lived in Hicksville, not Levittown. -EJF 11/27/05</p>
<p>He lived in Hicksville, which is adjacent to Levittown. I knew him then, and I know exactly where he lived. I took lessons from the same piano teacher. The only thing "Levittown" about Billy is that he lived in a house of a type built by, and named after, a famous postwar builder named "Levitt." He attended Hicksville High School -- not Division Avenue High School, which he would have attended had he actually lived in Levittown. I think Billy just doesn't like the name "Hicksville," but his own lyrics squarely place him there, as "Little Gio" (who was unfortunately taken from us about a year ago), "Virginia," the people in the "Italian Restaurant," and others were real baby boomers whom I've known -- and they were all from Hicksville, not Levittown. Incidentally, a few years back, he was inducted into the Hicksville High School Hall of Fame, which is commemorated by a plaque in the lobby.</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK, perhaps you can tell us why all these references on the web to "Levittown" are wrong? Are you saying that Billy lies about this?

<dd>I think we need more evidence than an anonymous poster saying "I knew Billy and he never lived in Levittown," especially when the official site says otherwise. I'll be bold and change it to reflect both towns. --<a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">Locarno</a> 14:25, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Very interesting argument. "You're wrong because others say something else." Incidentally, you have no assurance that your unofficial sources are independent of the "official" source of this particular item of misinformation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just a note on this: Wikipedia official policy is to create articles based solely on what others say. "All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources." (see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_Original_Research_6a12.html" title="Wikipedia:No Original Research">Wikipedia:No Original Research</a>) <a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">Locarno</a> 14:38, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As for why Billy's press would say that he lived in Levittown (and yes I've heard him personally say it on TV, too), I can only conjecture, but my best guess is that his music is deemed to be "emblematic" of the postwar Baby Boom generation, as was "Levittown," whose name has long been used loosely and synonymously with cookie-cutter postwar residential construction. Perhaps the metaphorical fit was just too good for him not to foster.</p>
<p>I know the facts here of my own personal knowledge, and could testify to them in court. That's evidence. If you want your "publication" to be wrong, just don't bother fact checking.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want evidence (as distinguished from simply parroting what others tell you), you could locate the place he lived, and ask what town you're in. Or, you could check old copies of Newsday, the local newspaper. Perhaps most simply, you could call the administrative office of Hicksville High School. Any such technique would provide additional evidence. What you have now, however, is less than persuasive evidence -- in support of either proposition -- and an inaccurate article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no dispute that Joel went to Hicksville H.S., nor that he at some point lived in Hicksville. But did he ever live in Levittown? It does seem likely that all the other sources above are basing their data on Billy Joel's official info. I guess it's pretty much your word against Joel's, and I acknowledge that Joel could be lying. Is it possible that Joel's parents did in fact move from the Bronx to Levittown, then shortly after moved again to Hicksville? There also may be an issue of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_Original_Research_6a12.html" title="Wikipedia:No Original Research">Wikipedia:No Original Research</a> here. By the way, why won't you sign your name? Perhaps you're not sure how--just insert four tildes (~) while editing. --<a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">Locarno</a> 14:17, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Interjection by a friend (female) of first poster: I lived in Hicksville &amp; knew Billy pretty well...actually hung out at the Village Green with him &amp; the rest of the "Lost Souls" (his band from HHS) He used to rehearse at Dave "The Pig's" house in the basement. He dated my girlfriend Charlotte &amp; we used to take the train out to Kings Park to visit her together. Yep....he lived in Hicksville!</p>
<p>Further response from first poster in this thread: You take criticism well -- an unusual virtue (one that comes in handy on Wikipedia, no doubt). Part of the reason I haven't signed anything is I don't know the parameters of required anonymity. I'll try at the end of this post. Having read the ban on "original research," I can't help but think that it would still be possible to locate a deed to the house recorded in the name of Mr. Joel's mother. This would, apparently, not violate the rule against "developing" primary sources, nor would it be prohibitively expensive, as I am a lawyer. However, I really don't want to turn this into an "outing" of Billy, whom I liked and respect, and whose lyrics are perfectly hilarious when he wants them to be. What do you think? Is this worth chasing down? --<a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawman_1767.html" title="User:Lawman">lawman</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you, lawman. We all should know how to deflect even the beginning of a personal attack and change the focus back to the issue at hand. Also, I'm a baseball <a href="../../../u/m/p/Umpire.html" title="Umpire">umpire</a>, so I have a little practice with criticism. <a href="../../../p/s/z/User%7EPSzalapski_f9a8.html" title="User:PSzalapski">Locarno</a> 14:29, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Next response from lawman: Forget researching deeds: The online Encyclopedia Brittanica places Billy in Hicksville, in fact has him being born there. (Strange, as no hospitals where one might have been born leap to mind.) So does the "Newsday" site, where Billy even talks about the existence of a Hicksville potato farm out back of his family's house. The website of the Songwriters Hall of Fame has him growing up in Hicksville, also. Lots of other sites do, too. Game over. He's a Hick.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It seems to be both Levittown and Hicksville (one a town, one a city? Or perhaps some other parent-child relationship?)</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
Oh we're living here in Levittown

<p>Don't forget that Joel has said that the original town in his song Allentown was indeed Levittown. Oh were living here here in Levittown. He changed it because he thought he could tell a better story using Allentown PA.</p>
<p>I'd always heard that the street he lived on (Meeting Lane) was right on the border of Levittown and Hicksville. I have friends that live on Bobolink Lane which is about 4 blocks south of Meeting Lane and that is considered to be Levittown. The "Village Green" that he sings about is Levittown's North Village Green. Here is a nice little article I found on the subject. <a href="http://www.antonnews.com/hicksvilleillustratednews/1999/08/13/news/" class="external free" title="http://www.antonnews.com/hicksvilleillustratednews/1999/08/13/news/" rel="nofollow">http://www.antonnews.com/hicksvilleillustratednews/1999/08/13/news/</a></p>

<p>Can anyone confirm that Christie Brinkley was widowed and not divorced from Jean-François Allaux? Every reference I find shows that they were divorced in 1981. The "recently-widowed" line is a bit awkward. Is it even necessary to mention that she had been previously married? --<a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilk_3b0f.html" title="User:Neilk">Neilk</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm the one who keeps changing it to "widowed". The information I got was from an interview with Joel many years ago. The information I can find on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> is very ambiguous. Some just state their years of marriage, some state that she divorced him, but I think they are just making assumptions. Joel stated that Allaux died—he was some sort of race car driver and died in a crash. If you can find definitive information that states otherwise—like a published biography on Brinkley—I'd agree to the change. Otherwise, I think it should stay. Unfortunately, the Internet is not always a reliable source of information. :-S</dd>

<p>I agree that it should be omitted unless there's a published biography on Brinkley with the facts straight, but in that case, shouldn't the "recently-widowed" mention be omitted as well? Do you have definitive information that Allaux died in a crash while they were married?</p>

<p>Sounds good. I'll go ahead and delete the reference to Allaux until there's a verified source. =) <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilk_3b0f.html" title="User:Neilk">Neil</a> 19:30, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>AFAIK, Christie was engaged to Allaux when he died. They were never married. I have never seen references to him as her first husband, as she has had two since Billy. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShigpit_a5cb.html" title="User:Shigpit">Shigpit</a> 00:31, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I stand corrected. Christie was married to Allaux until 1981. See <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christie_Brinkley_554a.html" title="Christie Brinkley">Christie Brinkley</a> and her references. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShigpit_a5cb.html" title="User:Shigpit">Shigpit</a> 17:26, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Christie was married to Jean-Francois Allaux for 9 years (divorced in 1981), then was going out with Olivier Chandon, the champagne heir, a racing car driver who was killed in a crash in 1983. Christie and Billy met on St Barts when Christie was dating Chandon. When Chandon was killed Billy rang Christie to console her, and that's how those two got together. 203.206.118.206 10:45, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The webmaster has a history of spamming, whether it be within the article itself, or in modifying other links, including the official website, to revert back to his own. In addition, a majority of the page is devoted to the webmasters attempts to make money, which is clearly against what Wikipedia stands for. JoelFan has always remained in the External Links section, and is not a money-making venture.

<p>"Billy Joel Fan.com" &amp; "Billy Joel Forum.com" ARE NOT SPAM SITES!!! They are both sites that are heavily related to Billy Joel. While there may be advertisements on both sites, "Billy Joel Forum.com" doesn't really have any advertisements. There is no reason why it shouldn't be able to be added. In fact, there are other sites listed under the links that also have advertisements. People keep removing these two sites and keep adding in JoelFan.com - both sites should be able to exist together on the site. I will replace them both now. If you disagree, explain how these two sites are any different from the other sites listed.</p>

<p>Billy Joel talked about this in one of his interview: he wrote the song 'New York State Of Mind', and send the demo to Frank Sinatra in hope that Sinatra will sing this song. That never happened, so that song becomes one of Joel's own hits when he later successfully launch his own singing career. Jason Huang 12:34AM, Dec 04 2004</p>
<p>In the back of my mind, I seem to remember something about Frank Sinatra helping B.Joel's career. Anyone know for sure?</p>
<hr />
<p>As far as I always understood, 'New York State Of Mind' was written originally for Ray Charles to sing, Billy Joel sent it to him, and Ray said it was great but it wasn't for him. So, Billy ended up recording it himself. This made the recording of 'Baby Grand' with Ray all the sweeter.</p>

<p>I'd hardly say he has to tour to survive, he's doing his first European tour in over 10 years. We all know the big money is in world tours, and so he probably just does the ocassionally American shows because he might actually enjoy playing them, and for a little bit of cash.</p>

<dd>Let's not also forget that Billy clears this up in the liner notes for Songs in the Attic as well.

<dd>Oyster Bay is a town, one of three or four in nassau. If you live in Nassau (which billy did) you live in the town of Hempstead, North Hempstead Oysterbay or Longbeach. So living and hicksville and levittown he was a resident of the township of Oyster Bay.
<dl>
<dd>^Nassau is divided up into several large townships, the two in question being Town of Oyster Bay and Town of Hempstead. Billy Joel lived in north Levittown, which is T.O.H., but his neighborhood is now technically property of Hicksville NY, which is Town of Oyster Bay.</dd>

<p>Rather than having a stub for various songs, why not have them on their album page? On the album page, there could be a song info section describing the songs. This way it would eliminate a couple of stubs, and add more info to the album pages (which don't have much info beyond the track listing). I also realize the problem with You're Only Human, but that could go on the Greatest Hits page.</p>
<p>Also, should there be a page on the new box set coming out called "My Lives"? There is sufficient info for a future page, IMO. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurricanehink_6991.html" title="User:Hurricanehink">Hurricanehink</a> 02:58, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm going through this article and will eventually have it completed to the point that it should be.

<p>In the song <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Life_%28Billy_Joel_song%29_335c.html" title="My Life (Billy Joel song)">My Life</a>, Billy Joel sounds a lot like Bill Conrad, who was a bus driver from the Wilson School District, which is located on 2601 Grandview Blvd. in Sinking Spring, PA. He has that abrasive tone in his voice when he says, "This is <i>my life</i>..." Mr. Conrad went ballistic when the kids got under his skin, and his voice is very abrasive. Cedric J.

<p>You seem to be determined to put irrelevant information into this article. I'm not sure how this makes you feel, but most of what you've added to this article (under multiple IP addresses) has either interrupted the flow of the article, beaten a dead horse (yes, Billy got divorced from his first wife, we get it), or just been plain wrong.</p>
<p>You have said that the whole <i>Innocent Man</i> album is Billy's therapy after his divorce. It is quite possible that there was some of that left in the well after the actual divorce, but pretty much the entire album was written after he fell in love with Christie Brinkley. Based on the upbeat nature of most of the album, and the fact the words have virtually nothing negative to say about her at all, I cannot understand how you believe this album is focusing on a previous relationship.</p>
<p>"This Night" in particular is about the beginning of a relationship -- there is nothing that can be said about being about what you're trying to spam the article with. <a href="http://www.billyjoel.com/discography/thisnight.html" class="external text" title="http://www.billyjoel.com/discography/thisnight.html" rel="nofollow">Lyrics here</a></p>
<p>"Keeping The Faith" has nothing to do with a divorce either -- it's about nostalgia and "the good old days." The fact the video was filmed in a courtroom might be confusing you.</p>
<p>"An Innocent Man," if you need to personify all Billy Joel's songs to refer to a part of his own life, might possibly have something to do with his breakup. But I would like to see some attribution for how it's about being served with papers. I've followed the man's career since the late '70s and that's a story I have never heard.</p>
<p>I'm glad you're interested in contributing. Every contributor to Wikipedia is welcome. However, by posting under multiple IP addresses and continually hitting the same article to get your point across, you're acting like a vandal rather than a contributor. My suggestion, if you want to be taken seriously, is to register. Then you can have real, civil conversations with other Wikipedians rather than forcefeed articles with information that might be in error.</p>
<p>I trust you'll do the right thing. I'm rolling back your changes, but I hope you'll see this note and take it under advisement.

<p>Under the criticisms heading there is a message declaring that it sounds like an advertisement. I've read through this and can understand how it may be mistaken for an advertisement, but the section doesn't try and sell albums or promote anything. It states the facts surrounding what Billy Joel has done. Does anyone have an alternate view to this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you serious? This entire article reads like an advertisement or press release from start to finish, with goofy glowing non-neutral POV endorsements like:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Joel's songwriting cannot be separated from the life that inspired so much of his work."</li>
<li>"Joel has always had a trusting, open attitude in both his business and personal relationships."</li>
<li>"As a result of his love of teaching and music, Joel has been passing on his hard-learned experience with the music industry and as an artist to a new generation."</li>
<li>"Some of the most entertaining segments of his program are when he explains the inception and development of his songs from the genesis of the initial idea."</li>
</ul>
Not to mention fannish statements that are strictly a matter of opinion, like:
<ul>
<li>"If there is a particularly unique quality about Billy Joel's music, it has been his eclectic songwriting."</li>
<li>"Joel has denied any influence of Elton John on his music, but there exists some similarity between the music at the beginning of each performer's career."</li>
<li>"A historic command performance was made before a wildly enthusiastic, multi-generational, hometown crowd. Standing ovations were provided for most of Joel's works, as well as for outstanding side performances by lead guitarist Tommy Byrnes"</li>
</ul>
The entire article sounds like something written by Joel's press agent, or a really excited fanzine editor. Totally inappropriate for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 02:45, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Joel's songwriting cannot be separated from the life that inspired so much of his work."- Much of his work was indeed inspired by real life situations and relationships.</li>
<li>"Joel has always had a trusting, open attitude in both his business and personal relationships."- His "trusting attitude" cost him millions of dollars, and he never hid himself from the public. If nothing else, he opened himself up to the public through his Master Classes at colleges across the country.</li>
<li>"As a result of his love of teaching and music, Joel has been passing on his hard-learned experience with the music industry and as an artist to a new generation."- He always said he would have been a teacher if the music career had failed. And the sole purpose of 25 years of visiting colleges and fielding questions from the audience was to pass down what he had learned.</li>
<li>"Some of the most entertaining segments of his program are when he explains the inception and development of his songs from the genesis of the initial idea."- Opinion, yes, but he is one of the few artists out there who is willing to explain the history and inspiration of a song, both in interviews, and in concert.</li>
<li>"If there is a particularly unique quality about Billy Joel's music, it has been his eclectic songwriting."-The man hasn't released new material in 13 years (not to mention not touring solo in 6,) and yet still was able to have a sell-out concert tour over this past winter. That is clearly eclectic songwriting by any definition.</li>
<li>"Joel has denied any influence of Elton John on his music, but there exists some similarity between the music at the beginning of each performer's career."- Listen to Cold Spring Harbor and Piano Man, and then listen to Empty Sky and Elton John (the album), and tell me there are no similarities.</li>
<li>"A historic command performance was made before a wildly enthusiastic, multi-generational, hometown crowd. Standing ovations were provided for most of Joel's works, as well as for outstanding side performances by lead guitarist Tommy Byrnes"- I was there for all 12, and this is indeed a factual statement, though it is unfair to single out just Byrnes for his performance, because the entire band, by all accounts (biased and unbiased), was in top form. 69.123.53.186 08:15, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just wanted to make a note about my edits - since there is a disputed tag.</p>
<p>I agree that this article needs some SERIOUS work and is NOT neutral. However, I really didn't want to get into revising this large of an article, at least not at this time.</p>
<p>I'm not a raving fan of Joel's....but as a Wiki editor, I thought it was very, very odd to have almost the first paragraph (after the intro) be "alcohol problems". Certainly as a musician, his work should be the focus of the article. I kept the text about his car accidents &amp; alcohol issues, but moved it to near the end of the article to group with information about his personal life. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickBurns_f65d.html" title="User:NickBurns">NickBurns</a> 18:03, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I chanced onto this article while Googling some song lyrics, and it was very jarring to see "Alcohol Problems" at the head of the article; as mentioned previously, surely this is an article primarily about Joel as a musician.

<p>Firstly, I apologise... I love Wikipedia, and Billy Joel, and saw the following sentence; had to read it several times before realising there might be the odd word or two missing, and maybe some punctuation could be changed to make it read more smoothly - not a criticism, I know how much hard work goes into all of this and I'm sure everything is a constant work-in-progress.</p>
<p>I don't even know if i'm going the right way about this, as this is rather a confusing site when it comes to editing/talking etc. Anyway, here's what i'm on about. (I've no idea about editing techniques, etc. so i've put changes in italics).</p>
<p><b>"Joel was riding alone the one day along the shore where there was lots of traffic, and where there very little on the roads, he would at a traffic light, and somebody will say "Hey Mr. Joel" or "Hey B.J.", on April 15, 1982 Cornelia Bynum had made a right hand at the intersection of New York Avenue and West 5th Street, and which she ran a red light, he managed to stop, and he hit the brakes, and plowed straight (collided) into Billy, who was going through a green on his Root Beer Brown 1340cc 1978 Harley Davidson FLH Electra Glide."</b></p>
<p>1. "Joel was riding alone the one day along the shore" - 'the' needs to be removed, to read alone one day; <a href="../../../o/r/_/Or.html" title="Or">or</a> - even better, "<i>Joel was riding along the shore one day, where there was lots of traffic</i>". Was there lots of traffic?... see point 2.</p>
<p>2. "and where there very little on the roads" : Very little what... traffic? can't be as previously says there was lots of traffic, so what was there very little of?</p>
<p>3. "he would at a traffic light" : should surely be 'he would <i>stop</i> at a traffic light'</p>
<p>4. "and somebody will say "Hey Mr. Joel"" : should surely be 'and somebody <i>might shout' "Hey Mr. Joel"'. HOWEVER, who's to say on that specific night whether somebody did or didn't shout</i> to him, so it's surely not really pertinent to this particular story is it, unless it did actually happen and caused a distraction?</p>
<p>5. ", on April 15" : this should surely be the start of a new sentence, as it all rambles into one - '. On April 15'</p>
<p>6. "West 5th Street, and which she ran a red light, he managed to stop, and he hit the brakes, and plowed straight (collided) into Billy, who was going through a green" : surely should read 'West 5th Street <i>where she ran THE red light, hit the brakes and plowed straight</i> into (collided) Billy, who was going through <i>on</i> green riding his Root Beer... <i>'.</i></p>
<p>The 'he managed to stop' and 'he hit the brakes' refer to Cornelia Bynum, who is female, and so should read she. The 'he managed to stop' is incorrect as he (<i>she</i>) hit the brakes, and was therefore moving.</p>
<p>The '<i>the</i> red light' and 'through <i>on</i> green' are more correct, as there is only one red and green light, and they refer to the intersection specifically, not intersections in general.</p>
<p>So, what i'm saying is that it would sound better, read better and make more sense as follows:</p>
<p><b>"Joel was riding along the shore one day, where there was lots <i>or very little, depending on which is correct</i> of traffic. He would stop at a traffic light and somebody might shout "Hey Mr. Joel" or "Hey B.J.". <i>(is that a necessary sentence?)</i> On April 15, 1982 Cornelia Bynum had made a right hand at the intersection of New York Avenue and West 5th Street, where she ran the red light, hit the brakes and plowed straight into (collided) Billy, who was going through on green riding his Root Beer Brown 1340cc 1978 Harley Davidson FLH Electra Glide."</b></p>
<p>I wouldn't have said anything if it were just grammatical, but I actually couldn't read and understand the sentence at all the first couple of times, due to words missing and it all being one long sentence as well. Plus the contradictory statements are baffling!</p>
<p>Hope I don't sound too critical and feel free to ignore me, berate me for rudeness, and chastise me for putting this in the wrong place (?) :) Trinity14 03:03, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

The second was called, as I recall, "Hour of the Wolf." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.185.221.100 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.185.221.100_a213.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.185.221.100">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>While it may have been stated on 'The Hassles' LP the reason why Billy was known (or at east billed as Billy Joe) was because at the time pepole kept forgetting that there was an 'l' at the end of his name.</p>
<p>So insted of having to correct the masses he just went with Billy Joe Joel (all though that is NOT his real full name)</p>

<p>Look... maybe I'm waaaayyyy off base here, but, wow, the picture of Joel getting his honorary doctorate looks incredibly Photoshopped to me. Is it just me, or does somebody need to take a hard, close look at that and see if we can come up with a better photo? 12.216.229.177 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.216.229.177_5d2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.216.229.177">contribs</a>)</p>

<dd>I've had a look - and while I agree it's a bad photograph (exposure time of 1/30th of a second makes it blurry). It doesn't look fake to my eye.

<p>i have to remove the reference to his mother's family being an "agnostic jewish" family. you are not jewish if you dont believe in god. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Keltik31 (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKeltik31_2f02.html" title="User talk:Keltik31">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Keltik31_bb33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Keltik31">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I've restored it; Keltik31 has a record of anti-Semitic edits and discussion posts. His/her lack of understanding about the variety of beliefs that can be held not-withstanding, I think they just wanted the word "Jewish" removed from the article. <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeirdoactor_7234.html" title="User:Weirdoactor">Weirdoactor</a> 18:58, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>anti-semetic is also another term that needs to be explained. i feel that someone is anti-semetic if they paint the entire group with one brush. i dont do that and i dont appreciate the term being used to describe me. i feel that you can be hebrew and agnostic, but not jewish and agnostic. it, to me is like claiming to be a catholic atheist. judaism is a religion. jewish is not a race. if you dont believe in god, then you cannot be jewish.

<p>While it's good people have interest in making articles for the songs, the above, and most of his other song articles, are so short that they are hardly worth keeping. A way to solve both problems would be to include a songs section in the album pages to describe each song a bit - length, inspiration, covers, maybe live performances.

<p>I don't know if there is a reason for this, but the photo currently in use for BJ is rather pixelized. I think it was stretched because it is small only 4 KB I would definitely consider adding a different photo. Maybe several because he has looked different over the years.

<p>"52nd Street...was named after the block where Columbia Records' office was located."</p>
<p>52nd Street (if you've been living under a rock) is the world famous block on the street of same name in midtown Manhattan which was home to the world's major jazz clubs during the 40's and 50's (including the Onyx, Three Deuces, Famous Door etc.) This single strip of concrete was considered to be the central nerve of the jazz scene for decades. The Billy Joel album with it's myriad jazz references, pays tribute to this musical Holy Land (not to a street address for Columbia records...)</p>

<p>I believe the Greatest Hits packages should be included in the album listing, and not just tacked-on as "other albums" The Greatest Hits 1&amp;2 album went -diamond-, selling over 10 million in the U.S. alone. This should not be glossed over. It at least deserves an album art picture. I'll be editing the sales figure to reflect the diamond status, as indicated by the link to the album's page.
