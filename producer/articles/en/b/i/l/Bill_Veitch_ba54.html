	    <p><b>William Andrew (Bill) Veitch</b> (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_25.html" title="May 25">25 May</a> <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870.html" title="1870">1870</a> - <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">1 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>) was a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> politician. He began his career in the labour movement, but was a strong opponent of socialism, and rejected the militant views held by many of his colleagues.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Veitch_ba54.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Veitch was born in Port of Monteith, a small town in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perthshire.html" title="Perthshire">Perthshire</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. After receiving a basic education, he worked for the post and telegraph service until <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>. He then moved to New Zealand, briefly taking up gum digging before returning to telegraphs. In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>, he joined the railways, eventually becoming an engine-driver.</p>
<p>During his railway career, he became active in the rail-workers union, and in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>, he became its president. In comparison to other unionists at the time, Veitch was relatively moderate in his views, but was still dissatisfied with the government's response to various grievances. Believing that workers' goals were better served by political action than <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">strikes</a>, Veitch contested the <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wanganui.html" title="Wanganui">Wanganui</a> seat in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_general_election_1911_7e21.html" title="New Zealand general election 1911">1911 election</a>, and defeated the incumbent MP, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hogan_36e0.html" title="James Hogan">James Hogan</a> of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Liberal_Party_1c8b.html" title="New Zealand Liberal Party">Liberal Party</a>. Despite there being two labour-aligned parties contesting the election, Veitch chose to stand as an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_%28politician%29.html" title="Independent (politician)">independent</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Parliamentary_career" id="Parliamentary_career"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Veitch_ba54.html" title="Edit section: Parliamentary career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Parliamentary career</span></h2>
<p>In Parliament, Veitch initially voted against the Liberal government of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Ward_aed2.html" title="Joseph Ward">Joseph Ward</a>. This was part agreement he had made with the opposition <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Reform_Party_4b81.html" title="New Zealand Reform Party">Reform Party</a>, which had offered him support in his election bid. After discharging this obligation, however, he immediately became a Liberal Party supporter, voting in favour of Ward only two days later. He considered joining the Liberal Party, but when the new <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Labour_Party_%28New_Zealand%29_e5c2.html" title="United Labour Party (New Zealand)">United Labour Party</a> (ULP) was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>, Veitch joined that instead.</p>
<p>The following year, when the ULP agreed to merge with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Socialist_Party_41a4.html" title="New Zealand Socialist Party">Socialist Party</a> to form the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Democratic_Party_%28New_Zealand%29_cb4c.html" title="Social Democratic Party (New Zealand)">Social Democratic Party</a>, Veitch was among those who rejected the move, and continued to work under the ULP banner. His primary concern with the new Social Democrats were clauses which required the party to support strikes, which Veitch believed were ineffective and unnecessarily disruptive to society. Most of the ULP dissenters were eventually re-united with the Social Democrats when the modern <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Labour_Party_8ef8.html" title="New Zealand Labour Party">Labour Party</a> was formed, but Veitch remained in Parliament as an independent. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, he unsuccessfully contested the Wanganui mayoralty.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a>, he finally joined what remained of the Liberal Party. The Liberals were disunited and disorganised, and Veitch was a significant figure in the party's rejuvenation. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>, Veitch joined his faction of the Liberals with others led by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_William_Forbes_d09e.html" title="George William Forbes">George Forbes</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Davy_e006.html" title="Albert Davy">Albert Davy</a>, creating the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Party_%28New_Zealand%29_e4dc.html" title="United Party (New Zealand)">United Party</a>. Veitch and Forbes contested the leadership of the new group, but in the end, the position was given to <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Ward_aed2.html" title="Joseph Ward">Joseph Ward</a>, a former Liberal <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand_9eee.html" title="Prime Minister of New Zealand">Prime Minister</a> brought in by Davy as a compromise candidate.</p>
<p>When the United Party formed a government, Veitch became a member of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Cabinet_4434.html" title="New Zealand Cabinet">Cabinet</a>, holding the mining, labour, and transport portfolios. Later, when Forbes succeeded Ward as Prime Minister, Veitch dropped the mining and labour portfolios and was made <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minister_of_Railways_%28New_Zealand%29_a7a9.html" title="Minister of Railways (New Zealand)">Minister of Railways</a>. When United formed a coalition with the Reform Party, Veitch lost his position to make room for ministers from Reform. Later, when the coalition government <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devaluation.html" title="Devaluation">devalued</a> the currency, Veitch began to reject his party's leadership, and tried to convince William Downie Stewart to form a new party. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, when Albert Davy launched the "anti-socialist" <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_Democrat_Party_d3a9.html" title="New Zealand Democrat Party">Democrat Party</a>, Veitch joined it, but was defeated in his re-election bid by the Labour candidate. Considerably later, in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a>, Veitch stood for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_National_Party_f015.html" title="New Zealand National Party">National Party</a> (the ultimate outcome of the United-Reform coalition) in a <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellington.html" title="Wellington">Wellington</a> electorate, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Veitch died in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraparaumu.html" title="Paraparaumu">Paraparaumu</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a>.</p>
