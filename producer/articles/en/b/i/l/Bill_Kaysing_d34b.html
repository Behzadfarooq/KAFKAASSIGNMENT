<p>In 1940, Kaysing joined the Navy as a Midshipman and eventually was sent to Officer's training school which led to his attending <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Southern_California_4e4b.html" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.

<p>Kaysing asserted that during his tenure at Rocketdyne he was privy to documents pertaining to the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Mercury_e770.html" title="Project Mercury">Mercury</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Gemini_2905.html" title="Project Gemini">Gemini</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlas_%28missile%29.html" title="Atlas (missile)">Atlas</a>, and Apollo programs, arguing that one does not need an engineering or science degree to determine that a hoax was being perpetrated. Even before July 1969, he had "a hunch, an intuition, ... a true conviction" and decided that he didn't believe that anyone was going to the moon <span class="reference" id="ref_Kaysing2002"><a href="#endnote_Kaysing2002" title="">(Kaysing 2002:7)</a></span>. Kaysing wrote a book entitled <i>We Never Went to the Moon</i>, which was self-published in 1974, listing Randy Reid as a coauthor <span class="reference" id="ref_Plait2002"><a href="#endnote_Plait2002" title="">(Plait 2002:157)</a></span>. It was republished in 2002 by Health Research Books, with no coauthor listed. In his book, Kaysing introduced arguments that proved, according to his standards of evidence, that the moon landings were faked. Claims in the book and subsequent sources include:</p>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Kaysing also claims that NASA staged both the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_1.html" title="Apollo 1">Apollo 1</a> fire and the <a href="../../../s/t/s/STS-51-L_2b54.html" title="STS-51-L">Challenger</a> accident, deliberately <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murdering</a> the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronauts.html" title="Astronauts">astronauts</a> on board. His suggestion is that NASA might have learned that these astronauts were about to expose the conspiracy and needed to guarantee their silence. A vocal advocate of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theories.html" title="Conspiracy theories">conspiracy theories</a>, Kaysing believed that there is a high level conspiracy involving the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_599e.html" title="Federal Reserve">Federal Reserve</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_Revenue_Service_5a55.html" title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</a> and other government agencies to <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html" title="Mind control">brain wash</a> the American public, poison their <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">food</a> supply and control the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">media</a>. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> He also implies that the death of NASA safety inspector Thomas Ronald Baron in a traffic accident with a train a week after he testified before <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress.html" title="Congress">Congress</a>, and the disappearance of his 500-page report, was not an accident. He was also a participant in the <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox</a> documentary <i>Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?</i>, which aired on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_15.html" title="February 15">February 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997.html" title="1997">1997</a>, Kaysing filed a lawsuit against astronaut <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Lovell_cfeb.html" title="Jim Lovell">Jim Lovell</a> for <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slander_and_libel.html" title="Slander and libel">libel</a> when Lovell called Kaysing's claims "wacky" in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Jose_Metro_4e40.html" title="San Jose Metro">San José Metro News</a>, July 25-31, 1996.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>The case was dismissed in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> <span class="reference" id="ref_Plait2002"><a href="#endnote_Plait2002" title="">(Plait 2002:173)</a></span> following the granting of a Motion for <a href="../../../s/u/m/Summary_judgment.html" title="Summary judgment">Summary Judgment</a> filed by San Francisco attorney John Hardy, representing James Lovell.

<p>Kaysing believed that there was a conspiracy against him. Some of the items of evidence he gave for that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_7.html" title="December 7">December 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, Kaysing was on a three-hour radio program on <a href="../../../k/o/m/KOME_182b.html" title="KOME">KOME</a> in San Jose. In the middle of the program, the transmitter went off the air. Kaysing claims that the FCC and police initially said that someone burned the transmitter with a helicopter. Later no police reports or newspaper accounts indicated a fire, and KOME said that a relay went bad <span class="reference" id="ref_Kaysing_2002"><a href="#endnote_Kaysing_2002" title="">(Kaysing 2002:74, 81)</a></span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kaysing got a phone call from a woman in Portland, Oregon who said that she met a hooker in Reno, Nevada in 1970 who told her that two NASA engineers had told her that the moon trips were a hoax. Kaysing contacted the hooker in February 1976 and she denied knowing anything about the engineers or a hoax. Afterward, two police questioned Kaysing, saying that he had threatened her <span class="reference" id="ref_Kaysing_2002"><a href="#endnote_Kaysing_2002" title="">(Kaysing 2002:74)</a></span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1975, Kaysing was on the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tomorrow_Show_6c20.html" title="The Tomorrow Show">The Tomorrow Show</a> with <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Snyder_1db9.html" title="Tom Snyder">Tom Snyder</a>.

Kaysing wonders why only one such letter was forwarded <span class="reference" id="ref_Kaysing_2002"><a href="#endnote_Kaysing_2002" title="">(Kaysing 2002:78)</a></span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kaysing had a contract with <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price_Stern_Sloan_6bdf.html" title="Price Stern Sloan">Price Stern Sloan</a> Publishers to publish his book, and they paid him a small advance. After receiving the manuscript, they wrote back:
<blockquote>
<p>I'm afraid we disavow it. You need to read it objectively and critically and perhaps ORGANIZE IT. As it is it wanders all over the landscape. Several interesting paragraphs but they don't hold together, link together. You've also wandered from third to first person. It needs a lot of work. You don't really have a manuscript here - seemed more like random notes about what you WOULD write about if you got around to it. What I mean, it reads like notes to the AUTHOR.</p>
</blockquote>
Kaysing wonders why the publisher didn't want to have anything more to do with the book <span class="reference" id="ref_Kaysing_2002"><a href="#endnote_Kaysing_2002" title="">(Kaysing 2002:74, 85)</a></span>.</li>
