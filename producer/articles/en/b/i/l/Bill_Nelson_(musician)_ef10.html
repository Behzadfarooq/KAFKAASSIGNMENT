<p>Nelson was educated at the Wakefield College of Art, where he developed an interest in the work of <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poet.html" title="Poet">poet</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filmmaker.html" title="Filmmaker">filmmaker</a> <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Cocteau_981a.html" title="Jean Cocteau">Jean Cocteau</a>. At this time he was also developing as a musician, drawing upon <a href="../../../d/u/a/Duane_Eddy_b18b.html" title="Duane Eddy">Duane Eddy</a> as a primary guitar influence. His first recording was a brief contribution on an album entitled "<a href="../../../a/-/a/A-Austr_121f.html" title="A-Austr">A-Austr</a>" with Chris Coombs, Brian Calvert and Mike Levon. Levon recorded and produced the album "A-Austr: Musics from Holyground" which appeared on <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holyground_Records_7fca.html" title="Holyground Records">Holyground Records</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a>. After that Bill appeared in a much more substantial role on three Chris Coombs tracks on the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holyground.html" title="Holyground">Holyground</a> album Astral Navigation released in 1971. One track from this also gave Bill his first airplay by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Peel_dd69.html" title="John Peel">John Peel</a>: "Yesterday" by Chris Coombs, where Bill's lead guitars were recorded by Mike Levon in an acid-rock style, supporting Chris's Stylophone riff. After this, Bill's solo album was recorded and co-produced by Mike at Holyground, also in 1971. Bill's solo album titled <i>Northern Dream</i> drew more attention from famed British DJ <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Peel_dd69.html" title="John Peel">John Peel</a>, and this eventually led to Nelson's new band, <a href="../../../b/e/_/Be_Bop_Deluxe_bf13.html" title="Be Bop Deluxe">Be Bop Deluxe</a>, signing to <a href="../../../e/m/i/EMI_68e5.html" title="EMI">EMI</a>. The band's first recordings were also made at Holyground. All the Bill Nelson recordings made there were released in February 2001 by Holyground on a CD called "Electrotype". Shortly after this they were signed to EMI, releasing "Axe Victim". On stage the band developed a reputation built upon Nelson's electric guitar stylings, which have been described as "pyrotechnic".</p>
<p>After the breakup of Be Bop Deluxe, Nelson attempted another band project called Red Noise (releasing the seminal <i>Sound on Sound</i> album), but eventually settled into a career as a solo musician, recording iconoclastic albums in the early <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electropop.html" title="Electropop">electropop</a> vein such as <i>The Love That Whirls</i> and <i>Quit Dreaming and Get On the Beam</i>. Many of these albums also shipped with bonus records featuring experimental <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient_music.html" title="Ambient music">ambient</a> instrumentals, and this was a genre of music Nelson would embrace more fully in the future.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Nelson_%28musician%29_ef10.html" title="Edit section: 1980s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1980s</span></h3>
<p>A notable contribution to the work of another electronically oriented artist, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Numan_1986.html" title="Gary Numan">Gary Numan</a>, occurred in 1983 when Numan, an admirer of Be Bop Deluxe, began to co-produce his <i>Warriors</i> album with the veteran artist. In spite of a difference of opinions and a general falling out (which led Numan to remix the co-produced version of the album — hence the lack of a production credit), Nelson's dream-like guitar work adds to the LP's ambiguous, warm and distinctly jazzy feel.</p>
<p>Nelson had bad luck with major labels in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>. A deal with <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_Records_59ae.html" title="CBS Records">CBS Records</a> went sour, leaving one admired album, <i>Getting the Holy Ghost Across</i> (US title: <i>On a Blue Wing</i>). Nelson and his manager Mark Rye had formed the Cocteau Records label in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_in_music.html" title="1981 in music">1981</a>, and for many years this label handled the majority of Nelson's output, which often included multiple albums per year. Among the more ambitious Cocteau releases were the four-record boxed set of experimental electronic music, <i>Trial by Intimacy (The Book of Splendors)</i>, and the later ambient collection, <i>Chance Encounters in the Garden of Lights</i>, which contained music informed by Nelson's <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnosticism.html" title="Gnosticism">Gnostic</a> beliefs. In the late 1980s, Nelson signed to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a> label <a href="../../../e/n/i/Enigma_Records_ab88.html" title="Enigma Records">Enigma Records</a>, and though they re-released his entire Cocteau catalogue and seemed to be giving him a big push, the label soon went out of business.</p>
<p>As the 1980s ended, Nelson suffered a tremendous series of personal setbacks, including a divorce, tax problems, and an acrimonious falling-out with his manager over his back catalogue rights. In the case of one album, the unreleased <i>Simplex</i>, his manager had been selling copies via mail order without Nelson's authorisation; Nelson claims he never received any royalties from these sales.</p>
<p>Nelson channelled his troubles into his music, with the result that the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> proved an even more prolific period for him. His divorce inspired a 4-CD boxed set, <i>Demonstrations of Affection</i>, and he worked on some guitar-based instrumental projects such as the albums <i>Crimsworth</i> and <i>Practically Wired, or How I Became Guitar Boy</i>. With <i>Demonstrations</i>, Nelson perfected a songwriting ethic based on the immediacy of creative inspiration; each song was recorded almost as soon as it was written, taking only an average of two hours to complete. This technique enabled Nelson to produce a staggering amount of new music into the new century, which resulted in such large-scale releases as the 4-CD set <i>My Secret Studio</i> and the 6-CD set <i>Noise Candy</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Nelson_%28musician%29_ef10.html" title="Edit section: Recent Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Recent Years</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, Nelson's troubles with his former manager were resolved in a lawsuit which enabled Nelson to recover much of his back catalogue. A fully authorized version of the <i>Simplex</i> album was released in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, Nelson created the Populuxe Records label, with a distribution arrangement with <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Fripp_bbc4.html" title="Robert Fripp">Robert Fripp</a>'s <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discipline_Global_Mobile_627f.html" title="Discipline Global Mobile">Discipline Global Mobile</a>, but the relationship with DGM has stagnated and Nelson's last DGM release was <i>Atom Shop</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>. Subsequent releases have been on other imprints such as Toneswoon and Voiceprint as well as direct mail-order releases. In recent years Nelson has begun to perform live again.</p>
<p>2002 saw the release of <i>Three White Roses and a Budd</i> (CD Single, with <a href="../../../f/i/l/Fila_Brazillia_7b81.html" title="Fila Brazillia">Fila Brazillia</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Budd_5d95.html" title="Harold Budd">Harold Budd</a>) on <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentythree_Records_93e0.html" title="Twentythree Records">Twentythree Records</a>.</p>
<p>In late 2005 through 2006, Universal Music (UK) re-issued the classic 3 Mercury albums on CD. <i>Quit Dreaming and Get on the Beam</i>, <i>The Love that Whirls</i>, and <i>Chimera</i> all have been remastered and released with bonus tracks. The lone CBS album, <i>Getting the Holy Ghost Across/On a Blue Wing</i>, has also been issued on CD for the first time after over 20 years, with all the original tracks and extras on Nelson's Sonoluxe imprint (12/06).</p>
