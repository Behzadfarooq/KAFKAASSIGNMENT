<p>Bill's father was a <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_colonel.html" title="Lieutenant colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> in the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_a5db.html" title="Air Force">Air Force</a>, who had master's degrees in math and control engineering from the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Institute_of_Technology_dfbf.html" title="Air Force Institute of Technology">Air Force Institute of Technology</a> in <a href="../../../d/a/y/Dayton%2C_Ohio_88d9.html" title="Dayton, Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, where Bill had been born. While in the Air Force he was head of Command, Control, Communications, and Security for the Minuteman Missile system, versions I, II, and III. He also played a role in the development of "Deep Switch," the secure communications network by which the President could speak to the nation without having to deal with countless individual networks.</p>
<p>Mr. Still recounted his father's story during a speech he gave on August 20, 2006. <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=%22bill+still%22+%22tax+freedom+rally%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=%22bill+still%22+%22tax+freedom+rally%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>In October, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>, as they watched the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate.html" title="Watergate">Watergate</a> hearings, his father revealed that a couple of weeks earlier he'd been approached and asked how he would feel about a coup to install <a href="../../../n/i/x/Nixon.html" title="Nixon">Nixon</a> in a third term and possibly more ensuing terms. He was told that there were unlimited funds behind the effort and that a military officer could name his price.</p>
<p>Bill convinced his father to go to the press. Woodward and Bernstein of the Washington Post gave them an appointment at Woodward's apartment, but he "blew them off" by sending down only the eventual editor of their book, "All the President's Men", Bob Fink. As Still would later tell it, "Woodward and Bernstein already had their story line in place and didn't want to be bothered with the possibility of opening up to a deeper conspiracy the purpose of which was to significantly change basic Constitutional freedoms." Eventually the rumor was published in the now defunct "Washington Star" by journalist Carl Rowan on October 26, 1973. The story basically died until it was revived in 1983 with an excellent piece by Seymour Hersh in the August edition of "Atlantic Monthly." Here is a quote from that piece:</p>
<p>"[Then Secretary of Defense James] Schlesinger began to investigate what forces could be assembled at his order as a counterweight to the Marines, if Nixon - in a crisis - chose to subvert the Constitution. The notion that Nixon could at any time resort to extraordinary steps to preserve his presidency was far more widespread in the government than the public perceived in the early days of Watergate or perceives today."</p>

<p>Mr. Still later wrote of Ed's large influence,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was Ed Durell's personal contact with me 14 years ago, which started me on the path to investigate the missing gold in particular, and U.S. monetary policy in general ... United States of America owes a great debt to Ed Durell ... After his death in 1988, he endowed the Durell Foundation with $11 mililion to carry on his work.

<p>From 1982 to 1992, Mr. Still as a freelance investigative reporter was published in <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Today_69f3.html" title="USA Today">USA Today</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saturday_Evening_Post_4fca.html" title="The Saturday Evening Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Los_Angeles_Times_d281.html" title="The Los Angeles Times">The Los Angeles Times</a> Syndicate.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Still_8e0b.html" title="Edit section: The Monetary Reform movement and the Monetary Reform Act">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Monetary Reform movement and the Monetary Reform Act</span></h4>
<p>Still is convinced that only effective monetary reform -- the reform of the way the quantity of a nation's money is manipulated -- can prevent a gradual economic collapse of the U.S. economy of unprecedented proportions, brought on by the economically unsound policies endorsed by the America's privately-owned central bank, the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_599e.html" title="Federal Reserve">Federal Reserve</a>. The solution Still has proposed is the same system that was employed by President Abraham Lincoln, that U.S. Notes be issued directly from the Congress of the United States. In addition, he proposes that the other money manipulation tools currently employed by the Federal Reserve System be significantly limited and/or put into the hands of Congress.</p>
<p>In 1995, Mr. Still wrote a highly-touted book, "On the Horns of the Beast" (Winchester, Virginia, Reinhardt &amp; Still Publishers, 1995) which was the first widely popular book to offer this monetary reform alternative. This was followed up the next year with a 3 hr 23 min. video documentary, "The MoneyMasters" (originally entitled "Capital Crimes") that has won praise worldwide and continues to sell in ever-increasing numbers more than a decade after it's initial release date. In a personal letter to Mr. Still, <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economist.html" title="Economist">economist</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Friedman_66cc.html" title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> wrote that he was "entirely sympathetic with [its] objectives." <a href="http://www.themoneymasters.com/mra.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.themoneymasters.com/mra.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. He has also received letters of support from <a href="../../../g/2E/_/G._Edward_Griffin_66c3.html" title="G. Edward Griffin">G. Edward Griffin</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malachi_Martin_114e.html" title="Malachi Martin">Malachi Martin</a>, and Mahatma Gandhi's grandson, Arun Gandhi, of the M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence."</p>
<p>Mr. Still sees the privately-owned central bank system (which is currently in control of every nation's money supply) as a system designed to maximize profit for the world's banking interests and thereby is the primary exacerbant of world poverty.</p>
<p>"The privately-owned central bank system is typically disguised to appear to be a nationally-owned system (e.g., The Federal Reserve System, Bank of England, Bank of France, Deutsche Bank), but they are not. These privately-owned central banks do not operate in the public interest, only in the interests of their respective banking lobbys. Entrusting the quantity of a nation's money to these private entities is the greatest threat to democratic institutions within national systems," says Still, "because their prime goal is to centralize money to the greatest possible degree, and thereby, in essence to return humanity to a modern-day version of the plutocracy of the Middle Ages."</p>
<p>Still believes this deliberate devolution towards plutocracy is the theme that links the Nixon/Watergate machinations of the 1972-74 era with his research into the poverty-creation mechanism of the privately-owned central bank system. "The history of humankind has been a long, slow struggle to claw its way out of serfdom, and escape the plutocracy of the Middle Ages. This escape from serfdom reached its pinnacle with the founding of the United States of America. We have our freedom now; the question for future generations is can we hold on to it?"</p>
<p>Still believes that what's needed is for the United States to again take the lead among nations by returning to the Congress of the United States the ability to manipulate the quantity of America's money. This is the essence of the "monetary reform" movement. Still has been the primary champion of monetary reform of his generation. He believes there are two possible roads to monetary reform: 1. Have Congress pass legislation, or; 2. Amend the U.S. Constitution to put decisions about manipulating the quantity of the money supply only into the hands of Congress, and also limiting their ability to do so.</p>
<p>He believes this Constitutional Amendment would be most effectively raised from the State legislatures. The wording for this amendment would be as follows:</p>
<p>“Only Congress may issue this nation’s money. Congress must insure that the quantity of the money supply shall remain constant, varying only with population; except during times when Congress declares a state of war.”</p>
<p>Mr. Still's producer, attorney Pat Carmack, has authored a bill which would follow the Congressional legislative route, "The Monetary Reform Act." This Act, if passed would</p>
<ul>
<li>require the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treasury_Department_3ae5.html" title="Treasury Department">Treasury Department</a> to buy all public national debt held with money issued by the Treasury itself (United States Notes as opposed to <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_Notes_d015.html" title="Federal Reserve Notes">Federal Reserve Notes</a>).</li>
<li>allow the Bureau of Engraving to actually print money as directed by the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_the_Treasury_05ff.html" title="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a>, to purchase the Federal Reserve Notes, which will be removed from the currency system.</li>
<li>amend Section 19(b)(2)(A-D) of the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_Act_of_1913_cb4e.html" title="Federal Reserve Act of 1913">Federal Reserve Act of 1913</a>, thereby requiring the Federal Reserve "to raise the Reserve Requirement ratio for financial institutions, in equal monthly increments of eight and one-half percent (8.5%), to one hundred percent (100%)" over a year period beginning 30 days after the Act's passage. This is the end of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fractional_Reserve_Banking_1e16.html" title="Fractional Reserve Banking">Fractional Reserve Banking</a>. Also, during this year period, the Treasury Department would buy public debt (bonds and other debt securities) with Treasury Deposits and Treasury Notes.</li>
<li>require any organization calling itself a bank to treat all deposits as trust-funds received, keeping them on full 100% reserve for their clients. Banks would no longer be able to lend money except on the open market.</li>
<li>penalize any organization not having full reserve of funds transferred via check, credit card or wire transfer, with fraud, subject to criminal penalties.</li>
<li>allow the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treasury_Department_3ae5.html" title="Treasury Department">Treasury Department</a> to grow the money supply by 3% annually (to keep up with population expansion)</li>
<li>allow other institutions such as "investment trusts, mutual funds, brokerage or lending houses, to sell stock, to receive, borrow, lend or invest money at interest" (but not banks).</li>
<li>repeal conflicting Acts, namely the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Banking_Act_3166.html" title="National Banking Act">National Banking Act</a> of 1864 and the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_Act_a851.html" title="Federal Reserve Act">Federal Reserve Act</a> of 1913.</li>
<li>withdraw the United States from its participation in world banks such as the <a href="../../../i/m/f/IMF_5a61.html" title="IMF">IMF</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_for_International_Settlements_7346.html" title="Bank for International Settlements">Bank for International Settlements</a>.</li>
<li>allow the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_the_Treasury_05ff.html" title="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> power to preserve the domestic value of currency only by manipulating our foreign currency reserves, as well as maintain imports and exports in equilibrium by tariffs. In this way, foreign exchange rates will not affect the currency growth of 3%.</li>
<li>subject itself, through a "Severability" clause to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_of_the_United_States_01a7.html" title="Constitution of the United States">Constitution of the United States</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basis of Mr. Still's argument against our current monetary policy is largely based on the premise that the Federal Reserve serves the interest of banking interests primarily.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Still:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_599e.html" title="Federal Reserve">Federal Reserve</a> is not federal, and has no reserves. It is a privately-owned corporation that has never been audited and meets in secret</li>
<li>cabals of banking families (eg. the <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rothschilds.html" title="Rothschilds">Rothschilds</a>) have realized that governments make much more profitable clients than private citizens. Loans to governments can be backed by taxation, and during wartime, governments borrow more or less unreservedly</li>
<li>these families amassed their initial wealth through <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fractional-reserve_banking.html" title="Fractional-reserve banking">fractional-reserve banking</a> (the practice of lending more money than the bank has reserves for, about ten times more money), a practice that privately-owned central banks --such as the Fed -- continue to facilitate</li>
<li>these families have a three-part plan. First, centralize each nation's monetary supply around a private central bank. Then do the same at a regional level. Finally, through the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Bank_2c67.html" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/f/IMF_5a61.html" title="IMF">IMF</a>, control the entire world's money supply</li>
<li>these families over time have become adept at manipulating governments, media and markets, and are more powerful than any individual government</li>
<li>they are able to profit from bear markets as well as bull markets. What is commonly known as <i>the business cycle</i> is, in fact, a contrived cycle in which money is lent out liberally at low interest, and then a certain percentage of assets are repossessed during shifts to periods of high interest.</li>
<li>these families have had a very large presence in history, and have to some degree driven historical events since the 17th century.</li>

<li>Later in Coughlin's book, Mr. Still's work is used to reinforce a connection between the Rothschild banking family and the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illuminati.html" title="Illuminati">Illuminati</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0520238052/ref=sib_dp_pt/103-5656096-8454246#reader-link" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0520238052/ref=sib_dp_pt/103-5656096-8454246#reader-link" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>
<li>In "Rule by Secrecy" by <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Marrs_29c6.html" title="Jim Marrs">Jim Marrs</a>, Mr. Still is quoted as saying that the Rothschild family worked through <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_9499.html" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</a> firms such as <a href="../../../k/u/h/Kuhn%2C_Loeb_%26_Co._e622.html" title="Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.">Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.</a> and <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._P._Morgan_%26_Co._c91d.html" title="J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.">J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.</a> financed American industrialists <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_D._Rockefeller_a11c.html" title="John D. Rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Henry_Harriman_dcf1.html" title="Edward Henry Harriman">Edward Henry Harriman</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Carnegie_cfa0.html" title="Andrew Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>.</li>
<li>According to authors Chip Berlet and Matthew Lyons, Mr. Still's book inspired some of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Robertson_25ef.html" title="Pat Robertson">Pat Robertson</a>'s views. However, Mr. Still has said of Mr. Robertson's book, "New World Order": "It was not a good book, filled with inaccuracies and exaggerations, pretty much your typical badly researched conspiracy book." (2006, Reinhardt &amp; Still Publishers, Winchester, VA., "New World Order 2", by William T. Still, p.5)</li>
