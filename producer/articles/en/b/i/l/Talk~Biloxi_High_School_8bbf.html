<dd>I disagree. With all due respect, they're high school students. They're also likely elected or nominated each semester or year thus leading to issues related to the WP:DATING policy. It's simply not information that should be presented in a global encyclopedia as Wikipedia is neither a directory nor an indiscriminate collection of information. It creates a maintenance problem, is useful or interesting to a very tiny minority of visitors, and fails to rise to the expected level of notability for inclusion in an encyclopedia. I'd recommend moving this conversation to the Talk page of the article if we're to continue discussing this issue. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 03:44, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We elect our officers for each club on a year to year basis with the Broadcasting Journalism ,WBHS, rarely ever changing within a 3-4 year period. Biloxi High School is considered the nicest and most respected public High School in the southeast I believe after Hurricane Katrina, having a reference to the only public high school in Biloxi, Ms ,The most damaged town on the Gulf Coast, is absolutely necessary and with myself and others from the school keeping a close eye on the site we can keep it very updated.

<dd>That helps to address the <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATED_d285.html" title="WP:DATED">WP:DATED</a> concern (but not completely). But it fails to address my other concerns. I also don't recall seeing this kind of information listed in other Wikipedia articles, including high schools and colleges. Although I am sympathetic to the folks on the Gulf Coast (having spent several years there myself, including living in Pensacola through Hurricane Ivan, and still having family in the area, including Biloxi), I remain unswayed by your arguments. But I'm only one editor. Let's let this sit out here for a bit to see what others think. In the meantime, if you want to add the information back into the article I won't remove it. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 04:01, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand what you are saying about the dating policy, but I still do not see why students involved in clubs cannot be listed. One would generally expect the visitors to this page to either be students or alumni of Biloxi High, or to be involved with the high school in some way. As a student, I enjoy having this information about our school available, and I believe alumni would be interested as well. - Sarah McDonnell <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.92.245.72_289a.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.92.245.72">69.92.245.72</a> (talk) 21:43, 12 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I have carried out some badly needed cleaning up. In particular I have deleted lists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>curriculum topics</li>
<li>sports</li>
<li>clubs</li>
</ul>
<p>These are suited to the school website but not here.</p>
<p>I have also removed some sections on organisations that seem to be local chapters of national organisations rather than notable features for the School. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 03:25, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The user <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficerPhil_6784.html" title="User:OfficerPhil">OfficerPhil</a> has continued to make wrongful edits to the page. He has deleted extremely relevant information, and I believe him to be an extremist student at the above stated school. He deletes information that has already been entered as notable. The page is already up for deletion for non-notability and the information that he is deleting is what makes the school notable.

<p>Please, everyone involved, remind yourselves of two things: one, that we are <i>working together</i> to make a good article; two, that we need to take the long view of it: not what's here right this minute, but what will be here in a year or ten years. So it might seem really, really urgent to rid the page of this or that, or conversely to reinstate it, but is it really? Could you not discuss it here? Just post here what you want included or removed, rather than going ahead and doing it. We can all talk about it and try to agree. That way, we avoid yelling at each other that we're vandals and so on. Kgregory, I caution you that the 3RR policy exists to cool down edit wars. Quibbling over whether you were reverting vandal or a proper edit will not save you are blocked for it. Vandalism needs to be unambiguously in bad faith. You cannot judge something as vandalism simply because you don't agree with it. Take care with that.</p>
<p>And OfficerPhil, I agree with your position but you need to stay calm and negotiate here rather than battle it out in the editing. Because you are quite right in what you say, you can expect to prevail. If you don't, which will only be because the page is swamped with meatpuppets, you will be able to use <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">other avenues</a>, so stay cool.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:36, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please don't make lists of everything. First of all, lists of student officers are not acceptable. Wikipedia is not a directory and does not include lists of officeholders or the like. There are several reasons not to and I direct you to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">this page</a> to get a better idea of what Wikipedia includes. Please also consider <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">this policy</a>, or at least the thought behind it. People have a right to privacy that many here feel Wikipedia should be careful not to infringe needlessly. Second, lists of school subjects are just boring. Really, they are. The point of an article is to tell us how this school differs from others. Only those facts that express that should be included. "You can learn maths there" is not a salient fact in this context. If the principal had outlawed maths, well... <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 07:28, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The lists of students I have given up on and I agree with you all. As for the subject lists, ya'll were asking for notability and I am trying to give it, these lists only add to the notability by showing what the school has to offer and they are not boring if you should be a prospective student to BHS, seeing as we get over 100 applicants a week, and I will be replacing the lists that you have deleted because I view it as vandalism. <a href="../../../k/g/r/User%7EKgregory_3461.html" title="User:Kgregory">kgregory</a>
<dl>
<dd>It's not vandalism - it's a content dispute. Please don't accuse other editors of vandalism simply because you disagree with their edits. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 17:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Lists of subjects do not speak to "notability". As I noted, you must include what is <i>distinctive</i> about this school, not what it has in common with any other school. A note that it has a very broad curriculum is fine. A list of subjects is not. I caution you that continuing to describe others' edits as vandalism is <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">against the rules here</a>. Please familiarise yourself with the policies of Wikipedia before editing any further, because you are going to run into trouble if you continue with this belligerent and aggressive style of editing. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 22:48, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree. It's not improved any for having them. Kgregory, why not do some research into the history of the school?
