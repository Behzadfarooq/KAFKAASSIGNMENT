<p>He has not corrected his error about Malmedy. Instead he offered that he confused it with a massacre perpetrated by American troops slightly later in the war. Of course, there was no such massacre. This is not an apology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then offer those details you listed above. Wikipedia has a reponsibility in reporting accuratley and leaving details out like that is not only biased but it is irresponsible.</li>

<p>He got it confused with chenogne which Americans did massacre German SS soldiers.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Inflamatory comment added</span></h2>
<p>There is a lot of play below about the tens of thousands of people who claim that Mr O'Reilly tells lies. All this shows is that the man has tens of thousands of enemies (not surprising considering tha that there are a lot of webites who tell their readers to attack O'Reilly) - not that he tells lies. As for presenting Mr Letterman as an unbiased judge..... well that is a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p>I should point out that I am not a Roman Catholic or an American (nor am I a great fan of President Bush or the Iraq war) - so I have no personal reason for defending Mr O'Reilly.</p>

<dd>It's not really vandalism. It's true, but it does need a citation. Just as an example, he argued that the economy of France had been affected by a personal boycott of his and when challenged, he cited the "Paris Business Review" confidently and unequivocally. It was later found out that there is no "Paris Business Review".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>David Letterman has accused O'Reilly twice of fabricating information in his last two visits to the show. In particular, it was found that the examples he cited regarding "the war on Christmas" were also made up. He also accused U.S. American troops of torturing and executing POWs in Malmedy in support of his argument, when the opposite was actually true.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Media Matters has transcripts of these incidents and Bill O'Reilly's "The O'Reilly Factor" does, too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, if you do a search on Google for "Bill O'Reilly fabrications" you get 300,000 results, most accusing Bill O'Reilly of fabrications. When you do the same search for another journalist say, Wolf Blitzer, you get only 2,000 results, and the fabrications are attributed to people <i>other</i> than Wolf Blitzer (namely guests).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He also claimed multiple times to have received a Peabody award for his show Inside Edition, which at the time had never won a Peabody award.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most people don't even know what a Peabody award is, and the ones that do would likely immediately know he didn't win one. Why would O'Reilly intentionally lie about something that he could so easily be found out on?</p>
<dl>
<dd>If this information is true, and you can check the transcripts, it's not vandalism, and it is not libel. If Wikipedia is going to have an entry about Bill O'Reilly, it might as well be factual. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepstratagem_27fb.html" title="User:Deepstratagem">Deepstratagem</a> 03:59, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sure your intentions are noble but your arguments are filled with assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) It is at best a leap of faith go from acknowledging that the "Paris Business Review" doesn't exist to stating "and O'Reilly fabricated the idea of its existence." Perhaps he did and perhaps he was just misinformed. Until there is uncontrovertible proof, any charges leveled at him of "fabrication" are POV and probably inappropriate for the article.</li>
<li>2) Well if David Letterman accuses O'Reilly (twice!), that's good enough for me. NOT! Re the Malmedy controversy, again, there needs to be proof before labeling what could have been an honest mistake as outright fabrication.</li>
<li>3) Unfortunately, I don't think the sheer number of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">google</a> results is good indicator of their validity.</li>
<li>4) I'm starting to see a pattern here. If I recall, one time O'Reilly told me it would rain over the weekend and it <u>didn't</u>. <b>LIAR!</b></li>
</ul>
<p>You should really read up on <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_Sources_f4fe.html" title="WP:Reliable Sources">WP:Reliable Sources</a>, etc. <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b-blp_dd60.html" title="User:Lawyer2b-blp">Lawyer2b-blp</a> 04:43, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think you should sue Bill O'Reilly for falsely telling you it would rain over the weekend, you have my deep sympathy for your loss. As for (1) he either made it up or was misinformed. There aren't many other options. (2) David Letterman is one of several people who have accused him of this, and it happens regularly on his show, where he is regularly called a spin doctor. (3) No, the number isn't the only factor, he's a statistical outlier when it comes to internet statements about his fabrications, and the number of sources attributed to his fabrications within those results.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally keep in mind the number of times he repeats such statements before he corrects himself. How do you honestly believe that you've won a Peabody award if you didn't, tell everyone about it incessantly, then deny that you ever claimed it, and then tell people you misspoke each time?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Seems like an outright lie to me. So don't take Letterman as an isolated incident. Everybody knows (deleted by <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>).</dd>

<dd>From the GC "The parties to a conflict must at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants in order to spare the civilian population and civilian property." which certainly implies uniforms.

<dd>The uniform "requirement" is found in several places of the 1977 revisions, particularly Protocol I. However it is irrelevant whether it is found there or not. The article says it is Bill O'Reilly's reason. Since the article is about Bill O'Reilly rather than about the Geneva Conventions, it is Bill O'Reilly's interpretation (which is pretty much the common interpretation) that is important. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 16:19, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please don't suggest that Bill O'Reilly's interpretation is "the common one". If the uniform requirement is a matter of interpretation, we need to make that clear. If it isn't, we should clarify that. So which is it? -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 16:32, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why shouldn't I say that if it is true? It is the common interpretation. The Geneva Conventions specifically mention uniforms. However, recognizing that some more impoverished combatants may not have "regular" uniforms, the Conventions also allow for insignias and other such items "recognized at a distance" as being functionally equivalent. However, the most common phrasing when describing this requirement is to use the term "uniforms". Why is this a problem? --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 17:06, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Incidentally there are some folks who do not need uniforms or identifying insignia. These include civilians of a non-occupied territory who spontaneously take up arms to defend their country against an invading force, and have not had time or means to organize into an actual commanded army. Also civilians who accompany armed forces (such as reporters) do not need such ID to be protected under the Conventions. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 17:15, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To get a clearer picture, I have re-read the source. The reference cited has three significant quotes from O'Reilly:</p>
<ul>
<li>"According to the Geneva Convention, to be a POW and to get protections under it, you've gotta wear a uniform, Judge. They don't wear uniforms."</li>
<li>"I don't think that was torture. Torture is takin' off a limb. Torture is takin' somebody's eye, somethin' like that."</li>
<li>"Military tribunals, yes. Geneva Convention, no."</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these statements, do we need to determine that the convention explicitely states "you've gotta wear a uniform"? Or can we rephrase it so that it talks about his interpretation that uniforms are required? I will play with the wording and let me know what you think. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 21:48, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This is what he gets</span></h2>
<p>Bill O'Reilly has fought vehemently against the anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-faith sludge being spewed out by the mass media. He has opposed the ACLU which has fought for the removal of God from the schools and public places and against anti-American, anti-military rants that have found a safe-haven in liberal universities across the U.S. and around the world. Of course he is wrong in some respects but I give him credit for standing up for his beliefs, my beliefs Christianity and America in general. God Bless</p>

<li>Hello, look at the article. He really is a dumb old conservative neo-con idiot but according to wikipedia standards we're not allowed to put that in articles, hence it's not in there. So don't whine about people hating him, most of us do, but we'll make sure not to put that in an encyclopedia. 68.40.190.172 02:57, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>I agree-- It's so funny that this guy says that 'most of us hate' O'Reilly when the truth is that he has one of the top rated shows in the entire country.</b> A better guess might be that there are those on the 'far-Left' as Bill calls it, who are incapale of self-criticism-- in fact they 'hate it' since they already have all the 'answers' figured out.</p>
<p><b>Equally funny is the tendency of many non-FOX reporters to call him a "Conservative Journalist".</b> Anyone who watches OReilly and actually pays attention knows that the <b>he has a mixture of views</b> that variously <b>range from</b> what could be traditionally considered to be '<b>Moderately Liberal'</b> on the one hand (he is not opposed to Civil Unions for gay couples, he hates racism, he wants to protect the environment without going overboard, he is not anti-Union and he is no fan of corporate fat cat CEOs who exploit their workers pension funds) all the way over to <b>moderately Conservative on other issues</b> (he believes in self responsibility over bailouts, he doesn't like political correctness, is anti-abortion, supports the War on Terror, he is tough on crime and believes in higher testing standards for students and tougher vetting of teachers).</p>
<p>In other words, the O'Reilly doesn't follow any ideology-- he basically thinks by the issue and figures it out for himself. <b>He is tough in some ways and compassionate in others-- overall he is a Moderate Centrist or, as he says-- a 'traditionalist' with little patience for ideologues of the far-Left OR the far-Right.</b> But he is tough on the politically-correct far-Left set and doesn't hide the fact that he hates their formulaic and impractical neo-socialist thinking-- and so they label him as a 'Conservative'. What a laugh!</p>

<li>He's a muckraker first and foremost, and a major league egotist. Never forget that. He's also good entertainment. I like the shouting matches he gets into; never mind the constant liberal straw men, and characters like Al Franken (that book publishers' TV show encounter was priceless); how about his arguments with folks like his supposed friend Donald Trump, or Fox co-workers like Geraldo Rivera, or neo-cons ranging from Newt Gingrich to Ann Coulter. Not to mention picking fights with other right-leaning hosts such as Neil Boortz and Rush Limbaugh. It's a refreshing change from the Sean Hannitys who fawn over those right-wingers. I'm sure it's no accident that they never have O'Reilly and Hannity on together. That would be good for pay-per-view, to see those two highly opinionated "Fighting Irish" slug it out. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 07:56, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Mr O'Relly has some odd opinions. For example, his belief that high oil prices were created by speculators and that this is proof that the oil market is rigged.</p>
<p>Of course all commodity markets have people trading in futures - such "speculation" is nothing to do with "rigging" a market.</p>
<p>Whether people decide to call such opinions "liberal" or "conservative" is up to them.</p>
<p>On the general government provision for the poor area, Mr O'Reilly is clearly in favour of government schemes, but thinks they have grown a bit too far. Given the size of (for example) Social Security now (compared to its start in 1935-1937) or Medicare and Medicaid now (compared to their start in 1965), it is hard to believe that F.D.R. and L.B.J. would not have agreed with him.</p>

<li>The media made a big thing of suicides there shortly after his visit, and shortly after he went on TV and said everything was peachy there (as detention sites go, that is). It's that aspect of the story that makes it relevant. However, that key point is not developed in the article. It should either be developed, by someone better than I, or should be zapped.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stephen Colbert's Parody</span></h2>
<p>I am almost positive that soon after Colbert's show premiered he clarified that he was satirizing pundits in general and not specifically O'Reilly. While segments like "The Word" obviously satirize certain parts of O'Reilly's show is it worth putting Colbert in O'Reilly's article? I apologize for the lack of sources, maybe someone else can find where Colbert said this. Martin 05:27, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>[Sorry to disagree. Colbert's show is primarily a direct parody of Bill O'Reilly, no question about it. Colbert refers to O'Reilly as "Papa Bear", he patterns at least the first two segments, and the interview segment, directly after "The Factor", and the title of the show is lifted directly from O'Reilly (and there's the portrait). While Colbert certainly includes embarrassing and idiotic characteristics of other "commentators", these characteristics are most concentrated in (and many were introduced by) Bill O'Reilly. There is no question that The Colbert Report is parody of The O'Reilly Factor.]</p>

<dd>I don't see why. The Media Matters website contains both transcripts and videos. Those are essentially primary sources. In addition Media Matters hardly inserts any commentary. The focus of Media Matters may be biased against the right, BUT, the individual articles are not. If Bill O'Reilly makes some outrageous statement and later denies it Media Matters may compile a list of dates when it occured. See <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200607200003" class="external text" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200607200003" rel="nofollow">this</a> as an example. Each quote is taken from a transcript and the commentary is kept to a minimum. Most of the time, the entire transcript of a particular segment is shown in it's entirety. Can someone point out the alleged bias? <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepstratagem_27fb.html" title="User:Deepstratagem">Deepstratagem</a> 21:04, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is, that MMFA does its own transcripts, which bring up the reliable publisher issue regarding transcripts. Also, their commentary is always biased against the conservative. There have been times where their criticism has fallen flat because they're commentary has been misleading. And then there's my big concern about using it as a source in articles; if you click down to comments, you are likely to be exposed to all manner of defamation re: the living person. If <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is to protect Wikipedia from defamation suits and embarassing situations, should there be some consideration of where Wikipedia leads its readers? <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 02:01, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a very good point. Perhaps someone more familar with the purpose of BLP can address the question of where Wikipedia leads its readers. That aside, FOX News edits Bill O'Reilly's transcripts to sanitize them every now and then (frequently enough to question FOX's transcripts). From the point of view of FOX, it's advantageous to sanitize the transcripts. From the point of view of Media Matters, it's advantageous to be as accurate as possible. Thus, Media Matters' transcripts are probably more reliable (and to be sure, one can watch the videos). <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepstratagem_27fb.html" title="User:Deepstratagem">Deepstratagem</a> 02:43, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would not be at all suprised to find that they don't research thoroughly. In fact, I figure once they find anything, however skewed or out of context, supports their claims, they will publish it as 100% verified fact. Anything that support Bill O'Rielly? They will bury that by either omitting it or mentioning it only as a minor footnote that gets lost in the stream. Their reason?

<dd>I would like to point out that the goal isn't to find incriminating quotes from any single source, but to look at many sources and reflect the overall pattern of opinion of the person (in this case O'Reilly). A good example is O'Reilly's views on Jessica's Law. Clearly he has opinions there, and they are clearly stated in his interviews, radio program as well as essays. And he has a ton of essays. It should be easy to find verifiable references from him without going to a secondary source. Also, his essays are more verifiable than transcripts because they are penned with thought and not spoken in the heat of debate, and are less subjective. Not that ither sources aren't valid, but given the choice to quote Media Matters, or an essay from O'Reily, the choice is obvious. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 08:42, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see how quoting from his essays is more subjective than quoting from his interviews.

<dl>
<dd>but if the Media Matters article is quoting O'Reilly on a speicific subject, is is far better to find an essay on the subject and use a reference there. If he is quoted as saying "I believe in X", find an essay written by him that says the same thing. Go for the primary source first. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 19:22, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, but that's not a good reason to delete all Media Matters references. Doing so implies that all Media Matters transcripts and videos are unreliable, which no one has established. In matters of opinion, I agree that the best source might be O'Reilly's essays, though why omit what he has said or done on his show? He is inconsistent, and the best way to establish that reliably is to cross-reference. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepstratagem_27fb.html" title="User:Deepstratagem">Deepstratagem</a> 20:32, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As stated above, I do have a problem with MMFA --the defamation-- so I'd never use it. But in terms of reliablility (if there were no comments section), I wouldn't support deleting every citation to MMFA here. There is video along with the transcripts, so the readers can see and hear for themselves what O'Reilly said. But even with that MMFA should be used as a last resort, and never for it's commentary. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 20:47, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's why (outside of my unrelated objection stated above), I don't think MMFA is a inherently bad source provided it is used in the narrow manner I mention. The problem is editors here don't like to write "On X date Bill O'Reilly said Y" with a citation to MMFA. They prefer to write "Bill O'Reilly is a (blank)" with the citation to MMFA or "Bill O'Reilly is a (blank) because he said this" with the cite to MMFA. The first sentence seems to be non-BLP violating way to use MMFA (again outside my other objection). <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamsquire_182a.html" title="User talk:Ramsquire">(throw me a line)</a></sup> 23:08, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly, if MMFA (or any source) is going to be used, the word choice must be neutral and specific to the instance sourced. Context should be provided to avoid blanket statements. Seems that the major issue is really poor wording by editors or inaccurate blanket statements (vandalism?) rather than MMFA being inaccurate. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepstratagem_27fb.html" title="User:Deepstratagem">Deepstratagem</a> 23:29, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Scare Quotes</span></h2>
<p>I just reverted a bunch of edits that added "<a href="../../../s/c/a/Scare_quotes.html" title="Scare quotes">scare quotes</a>", expository and nNPOV section headings, and other biasing info. Sorry to the IP editor who added them, but if you want to take issue with words like "radical", "liberal", and "agenda", adding "quotes" around the words doesn't really accomplish your goal in a good-writing way. It just makes the article, "harder to read," and it looks a little "sarcastic". It would be better perhaps to cite a source that offers an opinion on the way that O'Reilly uses those "words". Don't write it yourself, but find a source and quote it briefly; Wikipedia says, "<a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a>."

<dd>O'Reilly frequently takes liberals to task, but he denies being a conservative, but rather calls himself an independent. He delights in reading e-mails that take him to task when he doesn't kiss up to the Bush Republicans, and warns his viewers not to expect "ideological stroking". I would say the majority of his views align with the conservative checklist, but he's totally at odds with some of them. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 13:08, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rather than having a paragraph about FAIR and the ""Oh Really?" Factor, why not use the book as a source? This article should not be about labeling either side as liberal or conservative. That judgement should be left to the reader. If he claims they are a liberal group, find the citation and note it. If they call him a conservative, cite it as well. Wikipedia presents verifiable facts, not opinions. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 19:09, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Surely dismissing issues due to liberal bias is a choice left to the reader? When judging a historical source, for example, one should not only look at the comments themselves, but also who made them. I think the addition of "liberal" helps clarify what background the issues raised are from. Is it any better if the liberal reference goes at the end of the paragraph, so that it reads something along the lines of: <i>The book catalogues what are argued to be distortions and inaccuracies on the part of O'Reilly from a liberal perspective.</i>? <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Brown_8bca.html" title="User:Oliver Brown">Ollie</a> 19:32, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Have you read the book? I haven't. But some or all of their claims about O'Reilly could be factually true even if <i>not</i> viewed from a "liberal perspective". An obvious example is the Peabody vs. Polk award fiasco. It does not require a "liberal perspective" to assert and prove that <i>Inside Edition</i> got the latter and not the former. Whether it's a mistake important enough to deserve a flogging from Al Franken is another matter altogether. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:02, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good example. So do you write "O'Reilly lied about getting a Peabody" or "Left Wingers attack O'Reily claiming..."? No, you write "He has been criticized for claims that he got a Peabody.(reference) He explained his mistake that he mispoke and meant that it was a Polk. (reference)" Now Franken may be referenced specifically if O'Reilly criticized him specifically, or talked about "Left winger" attacks mentioning this specific incident, but it is not up to us to put labels on people without references. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 00:09, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact of the matter is that he (or his researchers) got it wrong in the book. Then, if you want to bring O'Reilly back to <i>Inside Edition</i>, you could talk about the catfight that he and Al Franken got into thanks to Franken beating that minor issue to death on C-SPAN. Or, you ask yourself if it's worth even mentioning in the article. He has acknowledged that it was a "mistake". Of course, he also says the grounds for invasion of Iraq were a "mistake". All in all, the latter mistake seems a tad more important to the course of human events than the former does. The point being: yes, stick to the facts. Labeling FAIR as "liberal" is not representing a "fact", it's an <i>opinion</i>. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:39, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have usually just reverted any change to this section, as I assumed that the comment implied some sort of factual correctness / consensus. But having actually looked into this a bit further, I realise the issue is not as clear cut as that.</dd>
<dd>The article that the comment refers to (<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies_bce5.html#Controversy_about_O.27Reilly.27s_childhood_home" title="Bill O'Reilly controversies">Bill O'Reilly controversies#Controversy about O'Reilly's childhood home</a>) does not seem to me to reach a firm conclusion. The correct name of the place seems to change with time, and hence the place to name in the article depends on which time is referenced. The choice of name seems to be very POV loaded and ought to be sorted.</dd>
<dd>I can see two possible compromise solutions:
<ul>
<li>Name the place twice, as it was at the time of O'Reilly's birth and the current name. For example, something to the effect of <i>O'Reilly lived in Levittown, but the address is now in Westbury</i>.</li>
<li>Name a broader geographical area and refer to the controversy page, allowing the reader look into the controvery themselves, should they so wish. For example, something to the effect of <i>O'Reilly lived in Long Island, New York, but there is some controversy over the actual address.</i></li>

<p>This is still inaccurate. O'Reilly is not from Levittown, he is from Westbury, and there is a difference. The reference cited above to the frankenlies.com webpage specifically says "It may help to know that, beginning in 1947, William Levitt built thousands of homes in Island Trees (renamed to Levittown). He then continued his development within the villages of Wantagh, Hicksville, and Westbury, and these newly developed subdivisions were often identified together with Levittown.2" So, Westbury, as well as other subdivisions, were lumped together generically. In addition, his own mother in a Washington Post article dated 12/13/2000 is quoted as saying he grew up in Westbury "a middle-class suburb a few miles from Levittown." But she's probably just another factually inaccurate secular progressive out to bring down the mighty Bill. 141.156.162.171 00:31, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I have just read the article on Mr O'Reilly and my memory of the article is that it says comes from "Westbury". As pointed out above he actually produced the title deed of the house and it says "Levittown".</p>
<p>It is rather like the choice of the words "private school" rather than "Catholic school" to describe where this person was educated. My aim is clearly to imply that Mr O'Relly's family were well off - which they were not. Mr Frankin has stated that the source of his information on the O'Reilly family is Bill O'Reilly's mother - as this lady has been suffering from dementia for some years such a source (even if any interview really took place) is not reliable. For example, the regular family trips to Florida (a claim by Mr Frankin) turns out to be one trip to Florida - a trip made by bus.</p>
<p>Just because Mr Frankin (or mediawatch or whoever) says the O'Reilly family were well off does not alter the fact that they were not well off.</p>
<p>I write as the product of a government school and from a government (or as we say in Britain "Council") house.</p>

<p>Actually, as conservative as Bill is, I believe he supports equal rights for gays and lesbians, and may even support gay marriage....I remember him being sort of like "just leave gay people alone; I wish I was gay, maybe someone would ask me out" and that is very similar to what he said on his show few years ago, the radical right was shocked. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.77.116.91_604b.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.77.116.91">72.77.116.91</a> (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.77.116.91.html" title="User talk:72.77.116.91">talk</a>) 03:28, 10 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<li>While his views on gay rights are fair, he does not approve of gay "marriage", at least not if sanctioned by courts rather than by the citizenry through legislation. He also doesn't believe in public flaunting of sexuality in general, which is a very traditionalistic viewpoint. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:55, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Mr O'Reilly has stated (for example in his recent book "Culture Warrior") that he supports homosexuals being allowed to foster and adopt children. This clearly puts himself outside the teaching of the Church (the Roman Catholic) that he belongs to.</p>
<p>On "gay marriage" (as opposed to "miserable marriage"?), the position of this person would seem to be against homosexual marriage, but in favour of civil unions. It seems to be the word "marriage" that Mr O'Reilly draws the line at.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">O'Reilly's comments on kidnapped boy</span></h2>
<p>Curious whether O'Reilly comments on the Shawn Hornbeck case are notable enough to be included. Here's a partial transcript:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bill O'Reilly: You know the Stockholm syndrome thing, I don't buy it, I never bought it, I don't think It happened in the Patty Hearst Case. I don't think it happened here...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Greta van Susteren: Woah, Can I just say something?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bill O'Reilly: Yeah go ahead and jump in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>GVS: First of all we don't know all the facts, Don't forget that Elizabeth Smart likewise had an opportunity to leave and she did not. She was on the public street for some reason when young people are picked up and taken under the influence of adults they are very receptive of what adults do. So I would not dismiss the Stockholm syndrome --</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BOR: The difference in the Smart case, and correct me if I am wrong, was this guy was always around the little girl and she wasn't gone for the long period of time as this guy was. Now what we have learned -- and this is why I don't believe in Stockholm -- this guy Shawn Hornbeck gone four years from 11-15. Authorities actually say that he taunted his own parents on his website. He's got these piercing this is a troubled kid in my opinion --</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>GVS: The piercings, a lot of kids do the piercings. As far as the taunting goes on the website I think what can be established is that someone on this particular login taunted the parents. Was it done from this particular computer? If it was done from this particular computer that means that Michael Devlin did it, or Shawn did it or someone with access to the computer... let's not forget he is a kid.... He may be 15 now...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BOR: No, I am not buying this if you're 11 years old or 12 years old or 13 and you have a strong bond with your family. Even if the guy threatens you this and that. You're riding your bike around, you got friends -- the kid didn't go to school. There's all kinds of stuff, if you can get away, you get away. If you're 11 --</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>GVS: Bill it seems bizarre to me, I agree it seems bizarre. Why not run, why not yell, why not scream? But the thing I keep going back to is, what was Patti Hearst's story...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BOR: I didn't buy that Patti Hearst story for a second.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>GVS: Why was she so willing to sign up with her kidnappers and like wise Elizabeth Smart, she had opportunity -- nice kid, nice family, why was she unwilling to run...?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BOR: Let me answer your question. This is what I believe in the Hearst case and in this case. The situation that Hearst found herself in was exciting. She had a boring life, child of privilege. All of a sudden she's in with a bunch of charismatic thugs and she enjoyed it. The situation here with this kid is looks to me to be a lot more fun then when he had under his own parents. He didn't have to go to school, He could run around and do what he wanted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>GVS: Some kids like school --</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BOR: Well I don't believe this kid did. And I think when it all comes down what's going to happen is there was an element here that this kid liked about his circumstances... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.101.41.89_0634.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.101.41.89">67.101.41.89</a> (talk) 18:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>I think it probably isn't noteworthy in and of itself, but if it can be used in conjunction with his overall opinion on a subject, such as child exploitation, then it can be included. He also made comments about the Smart girl's kidnapping, and others, and how relavant are they now? <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytebear_2aa8.html" title="User:Bytebear">Bytebear</a> 19:31, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The story is on going (for example in yesterday's "Factor" Mr O'Reilly reported a "Newsweek" article directly relevant to the case). It would be unwise to include anything about the case in a Wikipedia article before the facts are fully known.</p>
<p>Of course in a British context Mr O'Reilly's comments would not be allowed (as they might bias a jury in the forthcomming trial). However, Mr O'Reilly is an American commenting on an American case.</p>
<p>Indeed, from what I have seen, Mr O'Reilly is normally very strict on child abuse matters - regarding (for example) the punishment of child abusers in Vermont as far too mild.</p>
<p>As for Pattie Hearst: this women claims she was raped by her captors - hardly "exciting". I hope Mr O'Reilly is correct in thinking that nothing like that happened (but I doubt he is correct).</p>
<p>There are also such things as the behaviour of American P.O.W.s in Korea and Vietnam. The "Stockholm Syndrome" may indeed be very rare, but there are various ways of making even adults speak and act as their captors would wish.</p>

<li>It is hard to figure why O'Reilly has taken the stance he has in this case. I suspect there's a double-standard here. That is, I suspect he thinks boys should be held more accountable somehow. He is certainly getting some heat for this, though. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 16:17, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've rephrased the blurb about O'Reilly's commentary on the Hornbeck case. The previous version was phrased as such: <i>O'Reilly...stated that a Missouri pre-teen, Shawn Hornbeck, who was abducted and held prisoner for four years by an alleged child molester...</i> which, to be fair, implies that Delvin had already been charged with a sex crime prior to O'Reilly's comments. I changed the section to reflect that formal charges had not been brought against the kidnapper at the time O'Reilly made his comments. I personally disagree with O'Reilly's take on this issue, but to be fair, he was apparently speaking from the angle that no sex charges had been brought upon Delvin at the time. Though it seems that O'Reilly is the only person around that doubted that the boy was abused. Anyway, I hope I made sense here... --<i><a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckdj_d3e9.html" title="User:Buckdj">buck</a> 23:21, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</i>

<dd>It sounded like he always thought that the boy had been molested, but he knew that if he didn't pretend to give him the benefit of the doubt after telling off the leader of the Black Panthers over the Duke Rape Case that he would be called a hypocrite again, and that he would have no way to refute the accusations.

<dd>If the structure is poor, clean it up. Get rid of the controversies and weave them into his various positions. When I found this article, it was a bullet list of his opinions, and good thing they were referenced. I went through the references and found the true point of each of his articles (most of the references are from his weekly column), and put them into coherent paragraphs. So, if there is a criticism, find where it fits into the paragraphs of his beliefs and weave it it.

<dd>O'Reilly shouldn't be portrayed as a centrist. He is a traditionalist, and that is what he should be portrayed as. However, since in the minds of many, including myself, traditionalist = conservative when a bunch of liberals have to write the article (this talk page confirms that) it is going to be biased. There is no way to avoid it. I know that it hasn't been done on purpose, but it still happened. 1,000,000 monkeys will write Shakespeare, but 1,000,000 communist monkeys will write the Communist Manifesto&#160;;). Something along those lines happened here, but it was 1,000,000 liberal monkeys, and it was about Bill O'Reilly. We need some conservative monkeys to balance this out.

<dd>I have heard him refer to himself as a traditionalist, but that is a very vague label considering his views on certain traditions. For example I understand he would support civil unions for homosexuals, which seems to acknowledge he doesn't mind a homosexual couple pledging to live together in monogamy as long as it isn't called a marriage. "Traditionally" speaking a gay couple seeking recognition of a marriage-like situation might get beaten or killed. Can anyone point to a page that expands what should define a traditionalist as O'Reilly sees it. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 02:04, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Traditionalist" is pretty slippery as a label, but that's what he calls himself. He is by no means a gay rights advocate. I think he sees civil unions as a reasonable alternative to the presumed sanctity of marriage. It's safe to say that in general, he is not happy about the "gay agenda" being pushed. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 02:30, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NCMEC Dinner</span></h2>
<p>It may not yet be worth noting in the article, but their statement seems to imply his cancelled appearance may not be so much about his comments about Shwan Hornbeck as it was popular demand. <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=3059" class="external text" title="http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=3059" rel="nofollow">NCMEC annoncement 09 Feb 07</a> <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 01:01, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>But the popular demand was driven by people's reaction to O'Reilly's comments, which makes it, in effect, the reason why he was dumped. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfo999_cfa4.html" title="User:Info999">Info999</a> 03:49, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with you, but the NCMEC has left itself an "out" by not citing the specific comments they were receiving. I wonder if they fear a lawsuit from him, otherwise I'd think that an organization like NCMEC wouldn't let anyone in the media say the stuff he did without voicing a reaction. <a href="../../../a/n/y/User%7EAnynobody_bd2c.html" title="User:Anynobody">Anynobody</a> 06:44, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
