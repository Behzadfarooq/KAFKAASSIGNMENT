<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Hayden_2a7d.html" title="Edit section: Politics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
<p>He became active in the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Labor_Party_d687.html" title="Australian Labor Party">Labor Party</a>, and in the 1961 federal election he surprised everyone including himself by winning the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_House_of_Representatives_e683.html" title="Australian House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a> seat of <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_of_Oxley_258c.html" title="Division of Oxley">Oxley</a>, defeating <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Alastair_Cameron_5521.html" title="Donald Alastair Cameron">Don Cameron</a>, the Minister for Health in the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Menzies_62a5.html" title="Robert Menzies">Menzies</a> <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Australia_e08b.html" title="Liberal Party of Australia">Liberal</a> government.</p>
<p>Hayden was a diligent member of parliament and in 1969 he joined the Opposition front bench. When Labor under <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gough_Whitlam_3876.html" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> won the 1972 elections, Hayden became Minister for Social Security, and in that capacity introduced <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medicare_%28Australia%29_87b6.html" title="Medicare (Australia)">Medibank</a>, Australia's first system of universal health insurance. In June 1975 he was appointed <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treasurer_of_Australia_9e43.html" title="Treasurer of Australia">Treasurer</a> (finance minister), a position he held until the Whitlam Government was dismissed by the Governor-General, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerr_7ecc.html" title="John Kerr">Sir John Kerr</a>, on November 11.</p>
<p>When Labor lost the 1977 election, Whitlam retired as leader and Hayden was elected to succeed him. His political views had shifted to the centre and he advocated economic policies which favoured the private sector and supported the American alliance. At the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_general_election%2C_1980.html" title="Australian general election, 1980">1980 elections</a> he improved Labor's position but failed to defeat <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malcolm_Fraser_2bbe.html" title="Malcolm Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a>'s Liberal government. At this election the popular union leader <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Hawke_e803.html" title="Bob Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>, known to harbour leadership ambitions, was elected to Parliament.</p>
<p>By 1982 it was clear that Fraser was manoeuvring to call an early election, and Hawke began mobilising his supporters to challenge Hayden's leadership. On 16 July Hayden narrowly defeated Hawke's challenge in a party ballot, but Hawke continued to plot against Hayden. In December Labor failed to win the vital Flinders by-election, reinforcing doubts about Hayden's ability to win an election.</p>
<p>On 3 February 1983, in a meeting in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane.html" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, Hayden's closest supporters told him that he must resign, which he did. Hawke was then elected leader unopposed. Later that morning, unaware of the events in Brisbane, Fraser in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> called a snap election for 5 March. At a press conference that afternoon Hayden, still emotional, said that "a drover's dog could lead the Labor Party to victory at the present time". Labor under Hawke won <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_legislative_election%2C_1983.html" title="Australian legislative election, 1983">the 1983 election</a>, and Hayden became Minister for Foreign Affairs, a position he held until 1988, performing competently but without evident enthusiasm.</p>
<p>As Foreign Minister, Hayden advocated closer integration between Australia and its Asian neighbours. In a remarkable 1983 speech, he stated: "Australia is changing. We're an anomaly as a European country in this part of the world. There's already a large and growing Asian population in Australia and it is inevitable in my view that Australia will become a Eurasian country... I happen to think that's desirable."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Hayden_2a7d.html" title="Edit section: Governor-General">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Governor-General</span></h2>
<p>After the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_legislative_election%2C_1987.html" title="Australian legislative election, 1987">1987 federal election</a> Hawke offered Hayden the post of <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor-General_of_Australia_3807.html" title="Governor-General of Australia">Governor-General</a> to give him a dignified exit from politics and some consolation for having robbed him of the chance to become Prime Minister. Hayden's appointment as the next Governor-General to succeed <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Ninian_Stephen_f879.html" title="Sir Ninian Stephen">Sir Ninian Stephen</a> was publicly announced in mid-1988, and he immediately left parliament and severed all connections with the Labor Party. He assumed the post in early 1989, and served with discretion during the transition from the Hawke government to the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Keating_03a3.html" title="Paul Keating">Keating</a> government in <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1991.html" title="December 1991">December 1991</a>. Early in his term, he accepted a Companionship of the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_Australia_61eb.html" title="Order of Australia">Order of Australia</a> to fulfil the Governor-General's role as Chancellor of the Order, despite having previously said he would never accept any honours.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Hayden_2a7d.html" title="Edit section: After politics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">After politics</span></h2>
<p>In 1996 Hayden was recognised as the Australian <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanist_%28life_stance%29.html" title="Humanist (life stance)">Humanist</a> of the Year by the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_of_Australian_Humanist_Societies_4a2b.html" title="Council of Australian Humanist Societies">Council of Australian Humanist Societies</a>.</p>
<p>After Hayden left office in 1996, however, it became apparent that he still resented how he had been treated by the Labor Party. He had a particular animus against Paul Keating, who, he believed, had engineered the 1983 leadership change. In 1998 he used the occasion of a defamation case involving <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Ellis_ee08.html" title="Bob Ellis">Bob Ellis</a> and two Liberal cabinet ministers, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Abbott_1654.html" title="Tony Abbott">Tony Abbott</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Costello_4af7.html" title="Peter Costello">Peter Costello</a>, and their wives, to deliberately publicise rumours about Keating's personal life. By the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> Hayden had become a conservative, joining the board of the conservative magazine <i><a href="../../../q/u/a/Quadrant_%28magazine%29.html" title="Quadrant (magazine)">Quadrant</a></i>. During the 1999 debate on an Australian republic, Hayden adopted a monarchist position, completing his alienation from his former party and the left generally.</p>
