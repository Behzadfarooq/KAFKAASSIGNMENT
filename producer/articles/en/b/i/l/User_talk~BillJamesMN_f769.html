	    <p>Hello BillJamesMN. I don't believe that <a href="../../../j/p/o/JPods_3b1e.html" title="JPods">JPods</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_automated_mobility.html" title="Personal automated mobility">Personal automated mobility</a> are worthy of Wikipedia articles. I did a Google search on "personal automated mobility" and got <i>zero</i> results, so this does not seem to be a common term. Also, JPods has been added and deleted at least a few times, and I can almost guarantee this latest version will get deleted too; see <a href="../../../j/p/o/User_talk%7EJpods_7cca.html" title="User talk:Jpods">this note</a> for a nice explanation of why it keeps getting deleted.</p>
<p>A Google search on JPods seems to return nothing meaningful except the JPods website, which contains very few details about the project. It seems to be a very immature concept at this point. But I may have missed something, so if there are reliable sources of detailed information on JPods, please point me to them. <i>If</i> reliable sources exist then maybe a short note on JPods could be added to the main PRT article. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 03:41, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> this innocuous little note has gotten the attention of the <a href="http://dumpmarkolson.blogspot.com/2006/07/more-personal-rapid-transit-wackiness.html" class="external text" title="http://dumpmarkolson.blogspot.com/2006/07/more-personal-rapid-transit-wackiness.html" rel="nofollow">Minnesota anti-PRT activist</a>. It's nice to know that I'm now famous enough that something as miniscule as this gets me blog coverage! Thanks for the plug, Ken!&#160;:-D <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 15:53, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Update:</b> from BillJamesMN. There will be a lot of news coming out on this in the next few months. In 1985 few people had heard of the Internet. What is about to happen will be substanitive. Here are a few quotes to consider before you delete the entree:</p>
<p>Barbara Johnson, President of Minneapolis City Council: "As a City Council Member of our stateâ€™s largest city, I firmly believe that strong leadership in a public/private alliance can quickly implement break through technologies such as yours. Our community can ill afford to wait for another war or another natural disaster to take action. Minneapolis will step up as a leader and support technologies that keeps our air cleaner, our streets less cluttered and creates long-term jobs."</p>
<p>Mark Stenglein, Vice-Chair Hennepin County, Board of Commissioners "Intelligent Transportation's approach to the energy and transportation needs of our community is one whose time has come. Computerized networks can automate repetitive travel such as transporting children to and from school, shoppers to and from retail centers, and commuters to and from work.</p>
<p>I appreciate that your networks do not limit personal mobility when someone is too young, too old, too poor, or too incapacitated to operate a car. Personal mobility gives access to economic, social and educational opportunities....</p>
<p>...The scale of these networks indicates millions of jobs may be created, revitalizing our infrastructure while shifting trade balances."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nonetheless, there is very little substantial there. The quotes you mention are endorsements of your efforts, not of any particular product. Lacking any details on the product or project itself, it's difficult to assess the validity of the JPods effort. So I anticipate it will get deleted soon, and I honestly can't say I disagree with deletion. There's just too little there for an encyclopedia. Also, Wikipedia frowns upon editors submitting information about projects with which they are personally involved, especially if there's a financial involvement. All of these factors support the decision to delete.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If there are published academic papers, media articles from respected outlets, or other more specific and reliable sources of information, then please present them and perhaps JPods will get a mention in the main PRT article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, don't be offended by a deletion, should it happen. This is just the way Wikipedia works. The requirements for article inclusion are strict, for the simple reason that the existence of unverifiable or inaccurate articles dilutes the entire effort. Once the JPods effort gets more verifiable, in the form of news articles, published papers, or even publicly viewable system prototypes, then perhaps it will merit an article. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 19:52, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Update:</b> from BillJamesMN. I will not be offended if it gets deleted. There will be enough news soon. It is just kind of silly that concepts that have no physical examples are listed and one that has a physical vehicle and 3 letters of intent to build networks is not. If you wish to read the letters please visit our web site (Project and Leadership list letters)</p>
<p>In this time of rising gas prices and high risk to energy supplies suppressing information seems unsound without reading the documents that define and authenticate a solution. The idea that if a Google spider has not read the documents they do not exist seems short sighted. If solutions to the energy and congestion crisis were known, it is likely they would be implemented. The fact that they are just becoming known does not diminish their validity or the documentation of them.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The letters you reference are too vague. They indicate only that you have people enthusiastic to work with you; they provide no specifics about proposed projects, costs, engineering, etc. Even if they did, it probably wouldn't be enough because there is very little in the way of third-party validation of the JPods concept or design (which doesn't seem to be documented <i>anywhere</i> - and I looked).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>See the following Wikipedia policy pages for more detailed reasons why the JPods article is inappropriate: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (especially the point about an encyclopedia being a tertiary source). Also, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">not a crystal ball</a> so if there's a bunch that's going to happen soon with JPods, you're probably going to have to wait for it to happen first before you try to post it here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>BTW, I agree with much of what you say in the last paragraph, but the fact is, there is a big difference between something that is true or valid, and something that is <i>encyclopedic</i>. JPods may be real, it may be the next great thing, it may be a household word in 6 months... but there's no way to know that now, and an encyclopedia is about what <i>is</i> or <i>has been</i>, not about what <i>will be</i>. So unless you can provide detailed, <i><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a></i> information about what JPods is today, the article <i>will</i> be deleted, and soon. That's just the way it works. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 05:33, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
<b>Update:</b> from BillJamesMN. Thanks for the thoughts. If necessary we can wait. Although I believe part of what makes Wikipedia as viable is that it adapts to what is knowable by a consensus of interested people. It might be good for you to consult with industry thinkers like ATRA (<a href="http://www.advancedtransit.org" class="external free" title="http://www.advancedtransit.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.advancedtransit.org</a>) and Larry Fabian who publishes a book for urban planners (lfabian21@earthlink.net).</p>
<p>There are a number of systems in this field. Two are listed in the PRT section. Six months ago, neither would have qualified to pass you consensus test. Unimodal should still fail. I believe that listing all systems with vehicles and all systems that are pushing the concepts of Personal Automate Mobility and Personal Rapid Transit forward should be listed. More examples of efforts expands the imagination of what is possible. Maybe none of the current ideas will be successful. The fact that they have made efforts is history. More people were involved in inventing flight than the Wright Brothers. Efforts of failures are often important to future success.</p>
<p>Consider studies coming out of Europe: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transport/extra/web/downloadfunction.cfm?docname=200603/20060322_114105_50368_other-modes_D2D_2-5_issue1-0_030306.pdf&amp;apptype=application/pdf" class="external free" title="http://ec.europa.eu/transport/extra/web/downloadfunction.cfm?docname=200603/20060322_114105_50368_other-modes_D2D_2-5_issue1-0_030306.pdf&amp;apptype=application/pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ec.europa.eu/transport/extra/web/downloadfunction.cfm?docname=200603/20060322_114105_50368_other-modes_D2D_2-5_issue1-0_030306.pdf&amp;apptype=application/pdf</a> And out of Princeton University: <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~alaink/Orf467F04/NJ%20PRT%20Final%20Small.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.princeton.edu/~alaink/Orf467F04/NJ%20PRT%20Final%20Small.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.princeton.edu/~alaink/Orf467F04/NJ%20PRT%20Final%20Small.pdf</a></p>
<p>Wikipedia requires consensus. Before editing out content, please consider getting a consensus of others who are experts in the PRT/PAM field.</p>
<p>I am curious, you have a clear and viable logic in your approach. What is your background and interest in PRT/PAM? What is your interest in transportation?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bill, let me clarify a bit. I <i>like</i> PRT. I think it has potential. I'm looking forward to ULTra getting built to see how well it works (I might even find an excuse to fly to Heathrow to see it up close). And I wish you success with JPods. See <a href="../../../p/e/r/Talk%7EPersonal_rapid_transit_Avidor_e31e.html" title="Talk:Personal rapid transit/Avidor">my early battles</a> with <a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvidor_6e12.html" title="User:Avidor">a certain Minneapolis anti-PRT activist</a> if you think I'm hostile to your position.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But the line has to be drawn somewhere. Unimodal was deleted, then added again, then nearly deleted again, then vastly truncated. Unimodal was a borderline case and only survived because it's been around a while and has gotten some mainstream press coverage. Still the Unimodal article is very short and filled with disclaimers about it being little more than a concept, because there is not a lot <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> about Unimodal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For JPods, there is much less than even Unimodal: no design documentation, no mainstream press coverage (unless you can point me to examples of either specifically mentioning JPods). And Wikipedia is <b>not</b> about reaching consensus among experts -- it's about <b>reporting</b> the results of experts who have published their ideas somewhere else. As an encyclopedia it is not a primary source and does not publish <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. When you see debates about content, they're usually about how to <i>present</i> material from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (especially when the topics are inherently contentious). We are <i>editors</i>, not <i>authors</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So again, please don't take this the wrong way. This is just the way things work here. The best thing you can do is either wait for JPods to develop and mature, or point us to academic papers, detailed documentation, and/or press coverage on the JPods concept. Perhaps it will merit a mention in the main PRT article, but I doubt it will merit a separate article unless there's a ton of verifiable information on JPods that we've missed. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 15:03, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
<b>Update:</b> from BillJamesMN. Thanks. I am content to know the rules. We can wait. It will not take long. You are more than welcome to come to Minneapolis and ride in our JPod. We will have it in Santa Cruz in November. You can ride it there. Where are you located?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bill: Thanks for the offer. I live in western New York State, and I don't anticipate being in Minneapolis or Santa Cruz any time soon. But if I do get to either of those places I'll be sure to look you up. It sounds like you have some interesting stuff going on there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And, by all means, if there is anything you can publish, i.e. pics, videos, design specs, project details, etc, please do. It's probably not enough to get JPods an article (that would require some extensive independent sources) but it would certainly increase your credibility. And it would satisfy <i>my</i> curiosity.&#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>Good luck in your efforts. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 05:14, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Update:</b> from BillJamesMN. I enjoy both your discipline and intellect. It will be great to keep you informed. Please visit our website regularly. We are much better inventors than PR people.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Update:</b> from BillJamesMN. I have a point of curiosity: the US Patent and international patent authorities have issued documentation of uniqueness of a documented idea. Would that not satisfy the third party perspective?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I don't think so. Patent offices don't comment on practicality or feasibility. A patent basically says that they've paid the fee and there doesn't <i>seem</i> to be any other patents for the exact same thing. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 21:01, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Bill, I'm not an expert on patents and I can't speak to the applicability of this document of uniqueness you speak of. If you can, maybe you can post specific details here and we can get the opinion of those more versed in patents and their applicability as a Wikipedia source. However, in my limited experience, it would seem that a single patent might not stand up well enough on its own, without supporting documentation from either trusted media or peer-reviewed sources. As JJLatWiki says, the existence of a patent doesn't say anything about feasibility. The best you can do, I think, is continue to develop your prototype and get some media coverage. Also, it wouldn't hurt to put some more information up on your web site (e.g. system design specifications, details on ongoing projects). That alone would likely still fail to meet the strict Wikipedia standard for acceptance, but it might spur others to evaluate and comment on your design. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 18:38, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh BillJamesMN. I hope the Jpods website is going to do a better job of <i>informing</i> us than you. Of the 5 links you provided, the ONLY one that actually talked about Jpods was the anti-PRT blog. Three links contained only a single simple hyperlink back to the Jpods website, and the Italian PDF simply lists, "JPods (Minneapolis)". So I hope you were joking when you called these "links to third party PUBLISHINGS ON Jpods". So far, you've provided us with nothing of substance. Be advised, there are some hard-core anti-PRT people out there who will see your links as a disinformation attempt and use it to tar and feather you. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 16:59, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Bill, I'm afraid I agree with JJLatWiki here. The existence of a link back to your website doesn't prove anything other than the fact that someone has come across your site and found it interesting. There's still no specs or prototype or third-party <i>validation</i> that can be used as justification for a mention in the articles.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look at Taxi 2000 for comparison. This system doesn't even have an article, despite the fact that they have a fully functioning prototype vehicle (with a small section of track, though not a complete loop) and detailed engineering specs. JE Anderson has published much of the engineering that went into Taxi 2000, in peer-reviewed journals and text books. If you look hard enough you can find almost everything you want to know about that system, from control algorithms, to switching and propulsion design, to safety engineering and fault tolerance, to guideway stress analyses. In contrast, we have almost <i>nothing</i> for JPods, other than a few pictures of a prototype vehicle which may or may not be functional. Anything we could add about JPods would be almost pure speculation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I wish you well and I hope to hear news of progress soon, but for now there's nothing on which to base even a mention of JPods in the articles. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 01:38, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
<b>Update:</b> from BillJamesMN. That is all fair. We will have to publish more of the specs but even when we do, since they will come from us it is difficult to see how that will qualify to be listed. I think our best action is to have commercial success and let information flow from that. Please contact me anytime. You both seem thoughtful and interesting. Bill</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bill, any documentation, even if it's just posted on your website, would be a good first step; and the more detail, the better. Even better would be a conference or journal article describing your design. Many of Anderson's work is in Journal of Advanced Transportation. Journal articles are generally preferred because they are usually peer reviewed. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 14:46, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Quite right Bill. The absolute best is to acheive commercial success. Nothing would change the debate more. The worst, I think, is what Jpods has now, which is a lot of photographs of a handmade mockup on casters that is zip-tied to some kind of support beam mockup, and a lot computer drawn still images that have no resemblance to the physical mockup. Detailed specs and computer simulation (not animation) are good fodder for engineering debates. Prototype tests, with at least limited functionality of the major subsystems, are better still. But independent, peer-reviewed research is highly valued as a source of written information. I wish you the best of luck. PRT may have some insurmountable obstacles, especially in the U.S., so I don't envy you. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 21:22, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Update:</b> from BillJamesMN. JJLatWiki, please look at the Edina Jun 06 images to see a working model set up at Edina City Hall. It is suspended from the rail and computer controlled.</p>
<p>I do disagree with your thought PRT has some insurmountable obstacles. Here are my thoughts:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Personal mobility accounts for 97% of trips in the US (80% in Europe). That is cars.</dd>
<dd>The most successful form of public transportation based on riders per day is the elevator. Again the mode is on-demand, personal mobility.</dd>
<dd>A network of ultra-light horizontal elevators can move people without congestion.</dd>
<dd>There is no problem with technology. The mechanics are essentially roller coasters. The network is essentially a Physical-Internet (my patent is on distributed collaborative networks moving physical packets, switch to data packets an you have something few people knew of in 1980, the Internet).</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think the key is to "solve someone's problem". Not to try to solve the worlds problems. We are doing this with specific installations. You can review our letters of interest to see how we are progressing. Once networks begin to solve problems they propagate at amazing rates.</p>
<p>We will see what happens. I am betting that congestion is not decreasing and gas prices will increase.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bill, I believe the "insurmountable obstacles" JJLatWiki refers to are mainly political, especially here in the US where certain elements have had some success convincing the public that "pro-PRT" == "anti-transit". Public transit is so politicized in this country that without mainstream political support PRT doesn't have a chance of getting a public installation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree in principle with your approach to scale it down and solve smaller problems. In many ways I believe people like JE Anderson have aimed too high, going after cities first with a state-of-the-art system. The market has rejected this as too risky. Now, in your case with JPods, and with ULTra at Heathrow, the approach has been different: solve a smaller problem with (perhaps) a simpler design. The benefit of this approach is systems have a better chance of getting built. But there is one significant drawback: it feeds into the fallacy that PRT is <i>incapable</i> of larger installations. I'm sure once ULTra gets built (and maybe JPods) and is shown to be a success, we will hear from skeptics who say "Sure, it works in an airport, but it'll <i>never</i> scale up to a city-wide installation." Even though many of the people that make these claims don't know the first thing about PRT technology, research, or systems (i.e. Vuchic, Setty, Demery, et. al.) they are considered "transportation experts" and therefore their words are taken as fact. So even if ULTra and perhaps JPods are successful with smaller installations, the leap to large networks is not necessarily a given, at least not in this country. <a href="../../../a/_/t/User%7EA_Transportation_Enthusiast_1571.html" title="User:A Transportation Enthusiast">A Transportation Enthusiast</a> 14:53, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, ATE is correct that I feel the potentially insurmountables are mainly political. No one in America is allowed to simply "solve someone's problem", as you put it. Your solution will have to comply with a myriad of government regulations that efficiently and effectively prevent many perfect solutions from seeing the light of day. For example, now that obesity is a "disease", you'll have to consider rider loads of 3 morbidly obese passengers and at least one in a wheelchair and another with a guide dog. Not to mention tons of noise regulations and complaints and protection against washers, rubber shavings, and lubricant falling from the track and cars.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>As far as the pictures from the Edina parking lot are concerned, I was hoping you would not mention them as "working". The frame looks like approximate 1" O.D. steel tubing and using maybe 5/32" bolts. I guarantee 2 high school football players feeling a little destructive could rip the bolts out of the tubing with just a little rocking. And what does the belt drive do? Hopefully not the main drive. As for "computer controlled"... since there seems to be no switch sections on the "demo" rail, what is being controlled by the computer? Just the starting and stopping of the main drive motor? What about coordinating multiple cars and merging cars into traffic? What about the apparent lack of a door? And back to government regulations, the working model seems to have very little room for a wheelchair to turn around inside or even face forward. All that the carpeted seats shows too little refinement.</dd>

<dd>If only getting PRT going was as simple as comparing internet network protocols to the physical world. I think the literal implementation will be extraordinarily more difficult though. And TCP/IP doesn't have competition or spoilers who think it's better to take your 3 packets to a central station and make them wait with hundreds of other packets for the next scheduled packet train to take them to one stop at a time to another station somewhat closer to your ultimate destination. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 01:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Update:</b> from BillJamesMN. JJLatWiki, the regulations that apply are those for Automated People Movers and Roller Coasters. They are well documented.</p>
<p>As for the frame, drive, etc... they are a proof of concept so people can ride in it. The regular rail is much heavier but still ultra-light compared to any other rail system. Keep watching, I think you will be surprised by the speed this industry and our technology evolves and is deployed.</p>

<dd>BillJamesMN, you didn't mention the ADA as one of the regulations, but maybe you consider them to be just some trivial part of the regulations regarding APM's and roller coasters. When it comes time to build a public system, I think ADA and the battery of similar state and local regulations will be among the least trivial with which Jpods will have to deal. ADA killed a great solution to public toilets in NYC. ADA and local disability regulations kill or wildly increase the cost of many improvements to private businesses and even private residences around the country. Don't sell it short.</dd>

<dd>I can't help but be sarcastic about the "proof of concept" you're talking about. I'm sorry. It could move only about 4 feet in either direction, it had no track switching mechanism, the only apparent position sensor is the proximity targets spring-clamped to the back side of the rail. What part of the design did it prove? It still seems to be a far cry from a "proof of concept" or an actual "working model". It's a simple "mockup".</dd>

<dd>Now please don't confuse my pessimistic sarcasm for opposition or doubt of the PRT concept in any way. I've been familiar with PRT for over 10 years now, and I would love to be surprised by a deployment. Likewise, I really hope it goes as smoothly as you hope. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 15:21, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BillJamesMN, Key is to keep scopes achievable. ADA must be accommodated. We will do that with specialty vehicles. Not every car is equipped to manage wheel chairs, you cannot roll wheel chairs in airplanes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There will be many specialy vehicles; TrashPods, GurneyPods, CargoPods, JPods, etc.... The Wright Brother's aiplane did not look like a 747. Beginning the process is critical to refining the process.</p>
