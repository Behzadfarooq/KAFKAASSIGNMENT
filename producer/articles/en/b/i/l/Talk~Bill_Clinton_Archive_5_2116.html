<h2><span class="mw-headline">Budget surplus?</span></h2>
<p>Can someone please explain to me why it says that Clinton achieved a budget surplus, when the following table (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_U.S._public_debt" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_U.S._public_debt" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_U.S._public_debt</a>) shows a costant increase in the Public Debt? Which of these is wrong? It can't be the second one, because it's the data taken from the U.S. Bureau of the Public Debt.</p>
<p>–– This actually isn't inconsistent. A "budget surplus" is when there is money left in the federal budget after allocating funds. The debt is the amount of money that has been borrowed, by way of treasury bonds, for example, over time. Both can co-exist, as odd as that may sound. In addition, the debt would continue to climb even if there is a surplus because of interest that must be paid. Mborrelli 00:43, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Redundancy in the main article</span></h2>
<p>Clinton being the first Democrat elected to two tems since FDR is mentioned twice. At the end of the second paragraph and again almost immediately at the beginning of the fifth paragraph. Since the article is s-locked to prevent vandalism, (or so I gather from the discussions), it behooves someone with more authority than me to unlock it and clean it up a bit. IdioT.SavanT.i4 07:20 CDST 11 August 2006</p>
<p>Also, there is no need to say that the impeachment vote was "along party lines" and that "Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay exercised tight party disclipline" This piece of information is unnecessary to the introduction.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Revisiting neutrality on the Clinton entry</span></h2>
<p>I edited some content about the Richard Mellon Scape adversarial relationship with Clinton that dogged his career for 8 years and even after he left office. Many of the controversies raised during Clinton's term were a DIRECT result of the Scape Arkansas Project and to see any reference to Richard Mellon Scape's part in Clinton's troubles just "disappear" seems like a very "right-wing-view" sanitization of the Wikipedia. As the, arguably, most important adversary of Clinton for a lengthy portion of Clinton's political career, to obliterate any mention of this relationship comes close to censorship. R.M. Scape is one of two very large and looming forces at work in American politics in the early 21st century, the other being George Soros on the left. Their fingerprints, from behind the curtain, certainly draw analogies to the Wizard(s) of Oz. Please note that I did not vote for Clinton either time, being somewhat more conservative, but I have noticed an apparent right shifted bias developing in areas that touch upon politically related items in the Wikipedia lately - and "it ain't good" as they say.</p>
<p>This slow erosion of complete disclosure concerning what is stylized as "right wing leaning" viewpoints and the retention of those things which critisize "left wing leaning" viewpoints is subtle but steady - not just here, but across many places on the Wikipedia. While they make me smile sometimes, my inclination toward keeping Wikipedia neutral reins in my mirth.</p>
<p>I would encourage the group to rethink the neutrality of Wikipedia &amp; work very hard to balance the influences on both sides to prevent any more of this "shading" of the Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I know it is very hard to remain absolutely objective but it is imperative that we do so in order to remain a respected source. To remain COMPLETELY factual without opinionated bias, it seems to me Wikipedia should error on the side of INclusion rather than EXclusion.</p>

<p>I personally like the ToC's new position. I am not sure if this is within Wikipedia's official policy, but I would be interested to know. I feel that it makes the page more accessable and professional.-<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhattyFatt_4f87.html" title="User:PhattyFatt">PhattyFatt</a> 14:32, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ann Coulter</span></h2>
<p>I have reverted the edit because the information presented was obviously biased. The text:</p>
<p>Ann Coulter, whose antagonistic relationship with Clinton goes back to the Paula Jones case, has publically criticized Clinton on numerous occassions. In July 2006, Coulter stated that she believed Clinton displayed behavior consistent with "latent homosexuality." She has also claimed that Clinton is a rapist and that he molested Monica Lewinsky.</p>
<p>has two main faults. The first sentence, presenting the antagonistic relationship, is acceptable. However, presenting Coulter's heavily biased opinions, which have no evidence to merit them, are simply unnecessary and biased. Presenting the idea that Clinton is a rapist, molestor, and latent homosexual is inappropriate to this article for so many reasons. -<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhattyFatt_4f87.html" title="User:PhattyFatt">PhattyFatt</a> 23:56, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>-- Even those of us with more conservative inclinations are somewhat ashamed of this woman, she is a rather tawdry excuse for sensible discussion. IdioT.SavanT.i4 06:57 CDST 11 August 2006</p>

<p>It is perfectly legal to report any facts from any source, including Infotrac. Facts can never be copyrighted --although the specific text that discusses the facts can be copyrighted, so Wiki editors should rephrase the facts in their own words. Be sure to include the proper footnote. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 12:33, 3 August 2006 (UTC) Hello there. I've got a school research database (which is accessable from my anywhere with a school password) that has plenty of information, pro and con, on Clinton. It has lots of poll data (once found), economic data, etc. I am hesitant to use it because it is a school database and am unsure if Wikipedia would accept a citation that no one can verify without a school password. If I give the password (which is easy to get anyways), can the database sue Wikipedia? Or if I cite from it?</p>
<p>I don't know, but here is the link to the database (no password provided, no warranty, etc. etc.) <a href="http://infotrac.galegroup.com/galenet/culp72437" class="external free" title="http://infotrac.galegroup.com/galenet/culp72437" rel="nofollow">http://infotrac.galegroup.com/galenet/culp72437</a></p>
<p>Here is a copy of the terms of use. I'm assuming that I'm not allowed to use it here, because of this, but it can't hurt to ask, can it?</p>

What he did and what people think of it are very different things to me. Another way of phrasing the copyright relates to finding the original source, especially if you can find another copy. 216.234.170.66 12:17, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no reason not to bring W's and Clinton's pages closer to similarity. I understand that Wikipedia is liberal dominated, but calling an entire section 'right wing conspiracies' or some variation is taking it a bit far. Objectively speaking, there are many, many more conspiracies surrounding Bush, and none of them are dismissed outright on his page. I think Clinton was dodgy, and most people would agree, and even as a Conservative Christian, I'd say the same about W. But the pages should match, and not be so blatantly opinionated. I see from lack of discussion you've discredited yourself enough that Conservatives have given up. The classic open source solution.</p>
<p>My other suggestion is just to break the pardons paragraph off on it's own, maybe include a statement about his staff vandalizing the White House, and call it 'Last Day' or something.</p>
<p>68.81.77.76 22:16, 13 August 2006 (UTC)potential scandals that turn out to be a lot of smoke and mirrors should be labeled as such in comparison to scandals that turn out to be real. To use another example, you would want to differentiate the 'Swiftboat Veterans for Truth' scandal in the biography of John Kerry from the potential scandal about him molesting one of his coworkers that turned out to be a complete fabrication which both parties dismissed. They are two types of scandals.</p>
<p>And for the love of God keep these talk pages away from politics. It's okay to say "such and such section/phrase seems biased in the article" but useless to say things such as "but, hey, whatever, Wikipedia is run by liberals and liberals hate America and own the media and want to control our lives..." The more comments like that, the worse wikipedia's credibility. And the more annoying it becomes on these talk pages.</p>

<dd>I don't like president Bush or Bill Clinton very much. However, the facts are the facts, and cannot be changed. I have been trying to get some negative facts on this page to contrast the rest of the article, which I feel is pro-Clinton. In my mind, and based upon all the facts that I have, the success or failure of Clinton as president revolves around economy vs. national security. The first he succeded (or at very worst, got lucky on, but I think he did well here), the second was a disasterous failure involving massive military cuts and a failure to kill Osama bin Laden even when he was exactly located. Wikipedia should report all the facts, positive or negative, and let the reader draw his conclusion. As for the military, the only real mention of it is the gays in the military issue (which pales in comparison with the 800,000 or so troops cut by Clinton as a matter of importance), and a reference to him deploying the military "hesitantly."<a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELoco_en_el_coco_9605.html" title="User:Loco en el coco">Loco en el coco</a> 21:22, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Is this the speculation of the author, or an opinion by someone in a position to make such a statement? If it is the latter, it should be reworded for clairity. If it is the former, it should be removed. Come to think of it, as a speculative statement, it should be removed regardless of who said it.--<a href="../../../b/a/y/User%7EBayyoc_0098.html" title="User:Bayyoc">Bayyoc</a> 20:37, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Vandalism? I think it is nothing but political correctness. Here's the factual paragraph that I added but was deleted. Judge for yourself whether it helps the reader get a deeper understanding of Bill Clinton:</p>
<p>Numerous other allegations of infidelity and sexual misconduct have arisen. Dolly Kyle Browning, a real estate lawyer and Clinton high school classmate said she had an off-and-on-again romance with Mr. Clinton for 30 years. Sally Perdue, a former Miss Arkansas, said she had a four-month affair with him in 1983. Connie Hamzy, a self-proclaimed rock-and-roll groupie, said Mr. Clinton propositioned her in 1984 while she was sunbathing by a Little Rock hotel pool. Juanita Broaddrick, a gubernatorial campaign volunteer said Mr. Clinton raped her during a nursing-home-operators convention in Little Rock in April 1978. Bobbie Ann Williams, a one-time Little Rock prostitute said Mr. Clinton fathered a child by her when he was the governor of Arkansas. Eileen Wellstone said Mr. Clinton sexually assaulted her after she met him at a pub near Oxford University where Mr. Clinton was a student in 1969. Sandra Allen James, a former Washington, D.C., political fund-raiser said Mr. Clinton invited her to his hotel room during a 1991 campaign trip, pinned her against the wall and put his hand under her dress. Christy Zercher, an airline flight attendant on Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign plane, said Mr. Clinton exposed himself and grabbed her breasts. Lencola Sullivan, a former Miss Arkansas and fourth runner-up in the Miss America pageant, said Clinton made unwanted sexual advances, as did Elizabeth Ward, a former Miss Arkansas and Miss America and Susie Whitacre, press aide to Mr. Clinton when he was governor.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">the 92 election, impeachment, bosnia and marc rich</span></h2>
<p>1. Okay, I removed the three paragraph discussion of why Bush lost the 1992 election. That kind of detailed explanation belongs on the Bush page, not the Clinton page.</p>
<p>2. On impeachment, I added the fact that he was cleared of impeachment charges because no one could specify which line of testimony was perjurious - that is information is essential to understanding why impeachment failed.. If the prosecutor cannot point to a line of testimony and state definitively that it is perjury, then it becomes difficult to convict on perjury - which tends to be fairly black and white. That's what happened with Clinton. Neither Ken Starr, Lindsay Graham, or Henry Hyde when asked, could point to a single line of testimony that rose to the rigorous standards of perjury.</p>
<p>3. We did remain in Bosnia but under the auspices of the UN. I removed the link to the Fox article because it's an opinion piece, not a journalistic source and is, in point of fact, misleading.</p>
<p>4. Linda Tripp stated publicly that Kathleen Willey was lying about her encounter with Clinton and Willey was caught lying several times to Ken Starr. Juanita Broaderick's story was also suspect, and she would not tell her story under oath when given the chance. She did not hesitate to tell it in public though when she couldn't held legally accountable for it. An examination of news stories published at the time reveals that Clinton could not have been where she says he was when she says he was.</p>
<p>5. Lastly, I cleaned up the pardon section a bit. As with all Clinton scandals, there are good reasons why he wasn't charged, and while the allegations are present in this article, the reasons that no charges were pursued is lacking. Most people are unaware that Rich received a $100 million dollar find, and most are unaware of the year and a half gap between Denise Rich's last donation, and Rich's attorney's even discussing approaching her about pardoning Clinton. Roger Clinton had long since served his complete prison sentence, and all the pardon did was erase it from his record.</p>

<dd>I see no reason for these removals. Clinton's 92 campaign was known for the sexual harassment allegations as well as the "did not inhale" incident. Removing these incidents is known as whitewashing. The three paragraphs about reasons for Clinton's victory are appropriate and neutral. I am not sure why you are claiming that it belongs on Bush's page, since it deals with Clinton's campaign techniques and his image when compared to Bush.

<dd>Why Bush lost belongs on Bush's page. Clinton won - you don't need to offer up excuses for Bush's loss which is how it comes across. I removed Juanita's Broaderick's tale because she claimed under oath that it wasn't true. If you insist on adding it, then I suppose the fair thing to do is point out that when offered the chance to tell her story under oath where she could held legally accountable for what she did, she refused it. Kathleen Willey, of course, was caught lying numerous times by the Starr investigation.

Since he was NOT convicted of perjury, we cannot say that he "perjured himself" any more than we can say OJ murdered. Additionally, perjury requires a specific site of "willful falsehood" (absent in the charge) and, per 18 USC, it must be a "material matter which he does not believe to be true". So, in addition to specifying the exact nature of the lie, they would need to prove that he knew it was a lie (which is tough) and that it (re cheating on his wife) was MATERIAL to the investigation in question (a bad land deal).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Marc Rich, Broadrick, Willey and Roger</span></h2>
<p>Alright, i pulled out a few of my Clinton books, and cleaned up that section slightly. I have more work to do on the actual impeachment paragraph as well.</p>
<p>I fleshed out why Willey and Broaderick's charges went nowhere - how Willey was caught lying numerous times to Starr and how Broaderick first stated under oath that Clinton had never made an unwelcome advance.</p>
<p>Roger Clinton was NOT serving a prison sentence when he was pardoned - that's a flat out lie.</p>
<p>With the Marc Rich paragragh, as with the Willey/Broaderick subject, the allegations were listed but there was no discussion as to why there were no further charges. I explained a bit more as to why the prosecutors did not file charges against Clinton as it related to Rich - namely, that Denise Rich had given her last donation a year before emails revealed that her attorney's even discussed asking her to lobby Clinton, and included that Dan Burton dropped his investigation after listening to taped conversations of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak lobbying passionately on Rich's behalf for a pardon.</p>
<p>I'm going to spend some time over the next few weeks getting this section straightened out - there is a lot of mythology referenced without a lot of substance to clear things up. If we're going to have sections about scandals, then it must be dense and sourced as to the resolution and the reasons for the resolution. Simply saying that "no charges were filed" after listing directly what the accusation is, is unfair to a person who was never charged. If we know why no charges were filed, it's fair to both parties to list succintly what those reasons are.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sub-articles</span></h2>
<p>By consensus, here on talk, several sub-articles were spun off about 1.5 years ago. The reason was that the "controversies" section was quite long and detailed relative to the rest of the article, which is inconsistent with the undue weight provision of the NPOV policy. The idea was not that the controversies should be censored. Rather, a full article allowed them to be explored in even greater depth for the interested reader. And, a summary here informed the typical reader about the issue, while wiki-linking to the full article. However, repeatedly, great detail ends up being added here for the controversies, sometimes to the extent that the treatment here is longer than the full article. This is human nature, and it's going to keep happening unless we draw the line on it.</p>
<p>Every so often, I have shortened some of the treatments here, consistent with the rationale for the sub-articles. I intended to reduce the "pardons" criticism to a couple sentences today, with a link to the sub-article. To put that in perspective, it's as long as "Investigation and impeachment" — and I surely no sane person would find them in any way comparable in gravity. One is a standard exercise of Constitutional authority, though criticized by some; the other is an effort to remove the president from office for the first time in history. However, I've decided to get a consensus here first. I think we should either merge and re-direct the various sub-articles on the controversies back here. Or, we should actually make it policy to use them, holding the coverage here to a reasonable summary that describes the basic issue briefly. Maybe consensus has changed on the sub-article idea, but I personally think that excessively detailed coverage here runs afoul of the undue weight provision. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 18:31, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree. I think the standard for sub-articles should be to keep the info limited to one or two paragraphs. The "other controversies" section is a mess. It should be trimmed, drasticly. I really don't think this needs consensus, however. As long as the gist remains I don't think anyone will complain if you just went and did it. The intro should be trimmed down to three paragraphs as well. Just my 2 cents.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayzel68_b0f1.html" title="User:Jayzel68">Jayzel</a> 19:05, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>On second glance, the "Friendship with George H.W. Bush" section can can be trimmed down to one paragraph too. And the "Public approval" section should not be more than two paragraph. Also, the accompanying graph needs to be reduced; many of copyrighted pictures should go due to overcrowding; the list of honors in the "Post-presidential career" section should be turned into prose. Then there is the overall lack of citations throughout the article.

<p>I still to this day cannot understand why the public was so shocked at Bill Clinton's infidelities, when John F. Kennedy used to bang a different prostitute every single day when his wife was away. He admitted this himself, yet nobody seemed to care. Bill Clinton was a prude compared with JFK!</p>
<dl>
<dd>The resurgence of American puritanism/fundamentalism. After JFK, things were very soon completely different. Even take a look at the incredible hit Carter took when he said "I have lust in my heart", admitting a purely natural weakness, while having no sign whatsoever of actually being unfaithful. At the same time, post-JFK, the optimism of the early 60s was replaced with a (possibly Vietnam-caused) cynicism, protests rose to extreme and violent degrees, the civil rights movement really propelled forward, and those who are least able to sanely handle change in social structures (they call themselves conservatives, but really they are using that fairly noble title inappropriately) fought back strong and vocally. As all of us know, those who yell loudest, and donate most, get the most from government. The current administration is a perfect example of this reaction to the changes. --<span style="background: #CCEECC;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickstart70_e0ea.html" title="User:Kickstart70">Kickstart70</a></span>-<span style="background: #CCCCEE;"><a href="../../../k/i/c/User_talk%7EKickstart70_36c5.html" title="User talk:Kickstart70">T</a></span>-<span style="background: #EECCEE;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kickstart70_b60c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kickstart70">C</a></span> 18:05, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Coulter "criticism"</span></h2>
<p>Edits by <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHandface_86cc.html" title="User:Handface">Handface</a> indicate that <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> asserts that Clinton is homosexual. This section is beyond absurd and I do not anticipate an edit war need ensure over it. But if you insist:</p>
<ol>
<li><strike>Sourcing the statement in the edit summary is insufficient. Please follow the citation style used in the rest of the article.</strike></li>
<li>You have missed the point -- "criticism tends to be inflammatory" is not the issue. The issue is that filing "Clinton may be homosexual" under "criticism" is inflammatory -- i.e., the <i>edit</i> is inflammatory. At the least you need to find a different location in the article for this claim.</li>
<li>Ann Coulter is not an authority on Clinton. This specific criticism is useless in this article. It belongs in the Coulter article.</li>
<li>A statement by one individual is grossly incogruous with the other miscellaneous criticisms in this section. Please justify that this is a <i>notable</i> criticism of Clinton.</li>
<li>A statement on a topic by Coulter does not warrant its inclusion in the article on that topic. Coulter makes many statements every day. These are more usefully grouped into the article on Coulter.</li>

<p>Is Coulter an authority on Clinton's personal life? Why are her claims alone sufficient for verifying that Clinton has committed rape and molestation, and that he may be a homosexual?

<p>Handface has said why: "Coulter is an important ... voice in politics." If that is the case, it would seem to be a deficiency not to include her, although it should be made clear exactly what her position is and how she is regarded generally.

<dd>Agreed -- these edits say something verifiable about Coulter, but very little about Clinton. That's why I have no dispute with them being included in <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a>. As for being an important voice in politics — Coulter surely has a good grasp of contemporary American conservative positions, but even an important voice for those <i>positions</i> does not indicate sufficient authority to present claims about the <i>personal life</i> of a former president. Even a psychologist specializing in sexual behavior would not be in a position to make those claims given the amount and nature of Coulter's contact with Clinton. If her claims were of a policy-oriented nature it would be different, but as written I cannot see how the edit is anything but off-topic. --<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">Ptkfgs</a> 06:17, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV-Foreign Policy</span></h2>
<p>The foreign policy section looks like it has been written by Newt Gingrich. It is filled with bias, including the accusation that Clinton violated international law and the claim that documents relating to Rwanda "undermined Clinton's earlier defence of ignorance causing many to once again attack his lack of honesty." Those are just two examples but no matter where you look, the section is blantantly bias. I will try to sift through this mess a rewrite a section on foreign policy worthy of an encyclopedia. I will appreciate any help.

<p>While this is true -- FDR was reelected in 1944, and in 1940 and in 1936 -- I think it misses the point, which is that Clinton was the first Democratic president to win a second term, which is pretty much all one can do these days.

<p>Wiki is an encyclopedia that provides the consensus of experts regarding major acts of public figures. That makes it immune from libel suits. The provisions of WP:LIVING do not limit this kind of historical analysis. Of course, every editor has a POV when it comes to such a controversial and visible figure. Out goal should be to represent all major interpretations of his actions, whether these are favorable or not. As for the speech episode in 1988, all the experts agree that Clinton's speech was a disaster for him--as does Clinton himself, so it is not POV to point that out. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 22:13, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looking at the scholarly books on Clinton it's striking how much they are in agreement on 9 of 10 major issues and most minor ones as well.

<dd>Okay. Then it sounds to me that all that you (or anyone else) need to do is to cite those scholarly books. The last few iterations of the section in question have either been completely unsourced or the one source cited (a) appeared to be linked to one particular quote and not the entire section (although I could be wrong about that!) and (b) didn't appear to support the claims that "many experts said this" or "several people believed this" as only one source was cited. If there were multiple experts quoted in that one source, I suggest making that clear in the footnote so others don't make the same mistake that I am making. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 22:26, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rjensen, I like Clinton, and was tempted to remove that bit about his 1988 speech, but I looked into it and that actually does seem to be (close to) the consensus on it - everything I read from reputable sources did say it was a poor speech. As far as I'm concerned, if it's sourced well and appropriate to the article (ie compliant with <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) then I'm content to let it stand.

<dd>I for one, hate when an article gets boiled down too far to avoid perception of "bias" so as to remove all meaningful context on the person.

<dd>The problem with what Rjensen is doing is that it WAS a poor speech. But he's not pleased with it saying it was a poor speech and not well-received. It has to be "a disaster" where "he was nearly booed off the stage." That's crap writing, and POV, and doesn't even make sense. How the hell does somebody get NEARLY booed off a stage? What, exactly, is the action by which someone determines this? And not one of his links mentions any boos AT ALL. It DOES say that there was SILENCE and the loudest applause was when he said "In conclusion." But that's not booing. And the fact that most here barely REMEMBER it sort of proves that it wasn't a "DISASTER," doesn't it? <a href="../../../c/f/o/User%7ECfortunato_1679.html" title="User:Cfortunato">Carlo</a> 02:23, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To further support the claim that Clinton is an Irish-American, there is evidence to suggest that Clinton was seen eating a bowl of lucky charms in feburary of 2004. There is some debate as to whether or not he was wearing a green hat with a buckle on it at the time. An artist's rendition of this event was previously available at www.billsluckycharms.com however, this website and all of the material therein was classified by the FBI and will not be released to the public until 2065.</p>

<dd>He was not removed from office and he got to finish his term as president, that must mean he got impeached, that does not make since yes he was charge but he was not convicvted/lost his right to be president, thast means he <b>was never</b> impeached, so even if he was charged that doesn't mean he was impeached, it means he was the second president to get question are being impeached. <b>Not</b> the secsond president to be impeached. So, for all the statements saying he was impeached change it to there was talk of him being impeached, or something along the lines where it is he almost got impeached but didn't.

<dd>With all due respect, I don't think you understand the impeachment process. Clinton was impeached, which means that the House of Representatives charged him with perjury, but he was not convicted by the Senate, which means he was not removed from office. Quite a few people think "impeachment" equates to "conviction," when the more appropriate equivalent would probably be "indictment." Easy enough mistake to make, though. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 17:00, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Economic Growth &amp; Prosperity</span></h2>
<p>Reading through the stats on President Clinton's economic record I found several things that I wondered about. Maybe someone can address these if needed.</p>
<p><i>Creation of more than 22.5 million jobs—the most jobs ever created under a single administration, and more than were created in the previous 12 years. Of the total new jobs, 20.7 million, or 92 percent, were in the private sector.</i> Wouldn't one need to factor in 8 years of population growth here?</p>
<p><i>Economic gains spurred an increase in family incomes for all Americans. Since 1993, real median family income increased by $6,338, from $42,612 in 1993 to $48,950 in 1999 (in 1999 dollars).</i> We'd need to discount inflation/standard of living for this to be meaningful, wouldn't we?</p>
<p><i>The surplus in fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third consecutive surplus and the largest surplus ever.</i> Well I'm sure it is. But that's like people saying Bush got more votes than any other president in history, while ignoring population growth. How does 2000 compare to other historical surpluses if discounted for inflation?</p>
<p>Also none of these stats are specifically sourced - I'm assuming that the references section at the bottom covers them. If not, we need to get sources for all this stuff. <a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubc0724_51dd.html" title="User:Dubc0724">Dubc0724</a> 17:27, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarification of a quote from 2006-09-24 interview</span></h2>
<p>The quote "While I was there, they refused to certify. So that meant I would have had to send a few hundred special forces in helicopters, refuel at night." (last in the paragraph) could use some clarification. The way this paragraph has been written, the "they" in the quote seems to refer to "the right-wingers who are attacking me now", but as i understood it from the full interview, Clinton was refering to the CIA and FBI would not certify that bin Linden &amp; Al-Qaeda is responsible for the USS Cole bombing so Clinton could not do what he wanted with teh special forces and the refueling.</p>
<p>Of course, please check to make sure that my understanding of Clinton's comment is correct before making the changes.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversy section</span></h2>
<p>I have cut down large amounts of the text in the controversy section to make a more ordered list of interwikipedia webpages. When I have more time tonight or tomorrow I plan on putting summaries in front of those and maybe working on the sub-articles themselves. My goal is to make this article confom to discussion above under the heading of sub-articles. Any help would be appreciated. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 15:56, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">economic record not neutral</span></h2>
<p>The section on the economy is not neutral, many economists feel that the economic growth during his presidency was due to the internet bubble and the Federal Reserve's management of interest rates, specifically letting unemployment fall much further than would've in the past since they felt the "New Economy" would allow gains in productivity that wouldn't spark inflation. This viewpoint that Clinton wasn't responsible for the growth that occurred during his presidency should be presented.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Counterterrorism &amp; Osama bin Laden</span></h2>
<p>On February 26, 1993—thirty-six days after Clinton took office, terrorists who the CIA would later reveal were working under the direction of Osama bin Laden detonated a timed car bomb in the parking garage below Tower One of the World Trade Center in New York City. (See World Trade Center bombing) President Clinton responded by ordering his National Security Council, under the direction of Anthony Lake, and the FBI to find and punish those responsible. The FBI was able to quickly identify the vehicle used in the bomb from a remnant found in the rubble: a Ryder rental van, which had been reported stolen in Jersey City, New Jersey the day before. The truck was rented by Mohammed Salameh, whom the FBI immediately detained. Similar evidence led to the arrests of other plotters behind the attack, including Nidal Ayyad, Mahmoud Abouhalima, Ahmad Ajaj, and Ramzi Yousef—who was identified as the key player in the bombing. All men were tried and convicted for the bombing and other terrorists activities.[49]</p>
<p>And the other 10 paragraphs should be developed into its own page. Was this a cut and paste job from a different article? If so, we should link it. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 01:34, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, this was not a "cut and paste job." I wrote the section based on the various sources named throughout. Others mentioned expanding the section to include an account of President Clinton's Counterterrorism policy, which is what I did. I don't think you could make this into its own article, since it is just a summary of the counterterrorism policy of the Clinton administration. It is a good foundation for a separate article, but I would have to add much more. <a href="../../../m/t/m/User%7EMtmdem_61bf.html" title="User:Mtmdem">Mtmdem</a> 19:55, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's okay—I took no offense. I understood yout concern and didn't intend my reply to be negative. I've been working on it since the interview on Fox, but I didn't want to put it into the article unto I had all my facts straight and my sources correct. Thank's for your response. <a href="../../../m/t/m/User%7EMtmdem_61bf.html" title="User:Mtmdem">Mtmdem</a> 14:01, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
