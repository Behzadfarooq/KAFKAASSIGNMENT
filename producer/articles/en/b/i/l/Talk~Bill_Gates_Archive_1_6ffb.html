<p>"Chairman Bill Gates has been working on a solution to the film industry’s piracy problem since making a now legendary pitch to the industry in September 2002. <b>Showing a video of himself dressed in a sailor suit</b> pretending to audition for the blockbuster Titanic, Gates pitched Hollywood with the proposition that only Microsoft could solve its piracy problem by making its DRM software a standard across every home entertainment playback and recording device."<a href="http://thebusinessonline.com/Stories.aspx?Microsoft%20invents%20a%20%E2%80%98one-play%20only%E2%80%99%20DVD%20to%20combat%20Hollywood%20piracy&amp;StoryID=B7480068-F1F6-4C7B-A7A5-EEFCED0320CB&amp;SectionID=F3B76EF0-7991-4389-B72E-D07EB5AA1CEE" class="external autonumber" title="http://thebusinessonline.com/Stories.aspx?Microsoft%20invents%20a%20%E2%80%98one-play%20only%E2%80%99%20DVD%20to%20combat%20Hollywood%20piracy&amp;StoryID=B7480068-F1F6-4C7B-A7A5-EEFCED0320CB&amp;SectionID=F3B76EF0-7991-4389-B72E-D07EB5AA1CEE" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversial Paragraph</span></h2>
<p>I removed this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Still, and in spite of all the criticism that is so frequently levied against him, it is important to remember that Gates has been instrumental in creating an important new industry, bringing compelling new technologies to the mass marketplace, and making computers available to millions of people. To put the matter in perspective, it is fruitful-- and revealing -- to compare Gates to certain executives of <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enron.html" title="Enron">Enron</a>, who ran Enron as if the company -- and all of its employees and stockholders -- were little more than pawns to be used for their personal enrichment. To be sure, Gates has made plenty of money for himself. But he has also made plenty of money for his employees and stockholders, and made significant contributions to the U.S. and world economies.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As it is riddled with errors. Taking them one by one:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>it is important to remember that Gates has been instrumental in creating an important new industry</i>. The industry came along without Gates help; there were many, many people who played significant parts. The primary contribution Gates made was to Microsoft BASIC - an important but hardly vital thing - where he was only one of three.</li>
<li><i>bringing compelling new technologies to the mass marketplace</i> Complete nonsense. Please name three "compelling new technologies" that Gates was responsible for. Hell - please name <i>one</i>.</li>
<li><i>and making computers available to millions of people</i>. An even sillier statement. Far from "making computers available to millions", Gates and Microsoft have been a major restricting factor. You make computers "available to the masses" by making them affordable, and the decrease in the cost of computer ownership over the last twenty years or so is <i>entirely</i> due to the massive improvements made to computer hardware: the cost of software, in particular operating software, has not dropped. In real terms (i.e., after adjusting for inflation/deflation) it now costs around 12 times as much to buy operating software as it did immediately prior to Microsoft finally establishing their OS monopoly in 1995 to '96. Hardware, in the same period, has gone from 66MHz to 2000MHz (CPUs), from 0.2 or 0.5GB to 40 and 80GB (hard drives), from 14" interlaced to 17 and 19" flat screen non-interlaced (screens), from 4MB at 33MHz to 256MB at 333MHz (RAM) - <i>and costs less than half of what it did</i>. By stifiling competition and innovation in the software indistry and causing the flight of venture capital from the industry, Gates has held back the progress of computing (on the software side) by an unknown but large amount: somewhere between five and ten years is a reasonable estimate. By increasing the cost of operating software by an order of magnitude (compared to free market prices), Gates has raised the financial bar to computing, and kept millions of people <i>out</i>, not "made computers available to millions".</li>
<li><i>he has also made plenty of money for his employees and stockholders</i> This is undoubtedly correct. One might question if those same employees and stockholders might not have made similar anmounts of money elsewhere, doing more productive work in lean, mean free market companies. My assessment is that no, they would not: few businesses are as profitable as a monopoly.</li>
<li><i>made significant contributions to the U.S. and world economies.</i> And here we have the greatest absurdity of all. The net result of the software monopoly on the US economy is (as monopolies almost always are) negative. It simply transfers wealth from more productive activities into the less-productive monopoly activity. Monopolies are almost never as efficient as free market competitors (because they become lazy, because they siphon off surplus funds for unproductive activity, and above all because they must devote a large part of their revenue to the task of preserving the monopoly rather than to doing something economically useful). Then there are the flow-on effects, which are far greater in aggregate. Because monopolies produce goods of a lower standard than are produced by multiple competitors in the dog-eat-dog world of a free market, the productivity of businesses that depend on those goods is in turn reduced. Because the quality of software produced by a monopoly is lower than that of a free market, businesses waste more time and create fewer results. (And because of monopoly pricing, their ability to retain profits for investment in new plant is also reduced, of course.) As for the world economy, the points just made remain valid, but in this case, the benefits mentioned in point #4 do not apply.</li>

<dd>Well.... having written most of the above, I must say that I am in sympathy with the rebuttal. It's just that I wish that the rebuttal could be made part of the article! I was trying to tell the other side of the story; you've competently supplied the opposing viewpoint (with which, to be honest, I fully agree). Why not synthesize these views and add it to the article? jeez, I'm repeating myself.... pfaff de pfaffenblog</dd>

<dd>Well, as an example of <i>bringing compelling new technologies to the mass marketplace</i>, I name <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Explorer_6bc1.html" title="Internet Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>. No, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> did not invent the "web browser." Heck, I think Gates even wrote off the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a> early on. After they decided to exploit the web, they started bundling IE with their OS'es. Most people used IE because it was right there on the desktop and they probably wouldn't have gone to the trouble of figuring out how to download Netscape or used the Internet if the software to use it weren't so accessible. Yes, pushing their browser and making it free was anti-competitive (since everyone used MS OS's). Yes, once everyone started using the Internet with IE, it was very unlikely they would change to another browser (actually, to many people IE <i>is</i> the Internet!). But, by doing so, they opened up the Internet to a lot of people who otherwise wouldn't have known how to even <i>attempt</i> to use it. —<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> 13:54, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm... An interesting argument, Frecklefoot. But, now that you cause me to cast my mind back to 94 or 95, it ain't so. In fact, if I recall correctly, Windows was the <i>last</i> major operating system to include web access as a standard feature. OS/2 certainly had IBM Web Explorer and various assorted other accesory products long before IE 1.0 came out, Apple were in bed with Netscape, and in any case, most new computers came bundled with internet access products courtesy of the OEM. Ours certainly did (Netscape and ... er .. Eudora, I think it was, plus Trumpet Winsock) and we were only going along with the industry-wide trend. Nope: nice try, and an interesting thought, but we can't give Mr Gates credit for that one. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 14:10, 26 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If anything, Microsoft has been transformed into a monopoly. I'm only 14, but even I can see the effects of Microsoft's programs. Every few years they release a new Operating System, version of Office, or some other program filled with errors. They distribute these programs to large companies like IBM and Gateway, and then wait for the complaints to come in. In turn, they charge a ton of money to fix the programs that they intentionally filled with errors and shipped. And yet nobody has taken serious note of this legal issue. Microsoft rushed to finish up XP, and even with all of these service packs, it still has many errors. Luckily I am using 98, which is probably the best version out so far. I can only hope they won't rush Longhorn, and will actually correct all of the previous problems. Still, I think I might just buy Mac OSx Tiger when it is released. You can always count on Apple to do something correct. - Zeerus</p>
<p>And on another note, how has Microsoft, a company that only makes software and some hardware, made computers available to the millions? It doesn't even make computers. It only distributes its products to computer companies. - Zeerus</p>
<dl>
<dd>Microsoft distributes bug fixes for <i>free</i>. Even XPSP2 was free.</dd>
<dd>And, yes, Microsoft has now taken a more security-orientated approach to its software, XPSP2 and the latest CTP build of Vista is proof of that.</dd>
<dd>But getting back to the original subject, I believe that no browser yet includes a phishing filter, or natively supports RSS/Atom/Web Feeds, both of which are present in Internet Explorer 7 Beta 1 and later releases included with the Windows Vista builds. And I believe that what the original writer was trying to convey by <i>bringing compelling new technologies to the mass marketplace</i> was that MS was bringing compelling new technologies to the <i>mass market</i> i.e. the technology wasn't in mass use previously (however this is also technically incorrect). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkKB_23a6.html" title="User:MarkKB">MarkKB</a> 19:09, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I may have been the one who reverted the caption. I reverted it because it <i>looked</i> like vandalism. The photo just looks like a photo of Gates as a teen (or young 20-something)—especially since he's smiling. But now that you mention it, I do see that string. If it is indeed a mugshot, mention the circumstances of the arrest in the article, preferably right next to the photo to give it some context. To just have a photo and claim it's a mugshot doesn't help at all. It needs some context.

<dl>
<dd>AFAIK, Wikipedia doesn't support subpages anymore (well, the s/w supports them, but I think it is against the recommended style). This is just an observation I've made where several sub-topics of articles are made into top-level articles, not subpages of the main article. So, if you get the green light on this, make it a top-level article with something like <i>Bill Gates Arrest Record</i>. Personally, I'm not against mentioning his arrest record, though being arrested doesn't make him a "crminal." Stating it as such may be why your additions were removed.</dd>

<p>The original phrasing made it seem like Gates just strolled in, pulled the rug out from under these poor Ham radio operators, and created a commercial empire at their expense. I know, this being the wikipedia, that there is some bias towards the open source way of things, but the entry for Bill Gates should not become propaganda for open source. Promote open source by making good articles and good software, not by putting your bias into the articles. Please, keep my recent changes, which are both described as NPOV, and, honestly, are quite subtle anyway.</p>

<dd>I've made another pass at the wording. It's important because it represented a significant change of direction in the PC industry, too soon to know whether it's a permanent change or a detour though (the retail software market turns out not that great of a business to be in unless you are a game publisher or a monopoly, something that a lot of commercial companies have had to learn the hard way&#160;:-) ) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 16:50, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I specifically don't like the wording of "freely" and "shocked". When someone creates proprietary software, they get more freedoms than if they open sourced it. Also, when there is a market, consumers get more freedom of choice. Sure, it's popular to use freedom when talking about GPL, but not everyone sees it that way. Stop creating a false dillema between freedom and propriatary software. I would be much happier if you put the bias in the Open Letter page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So I'm biased, but you're not? Uh-huh... If you don't like "shocked", how about "stunned" or "astonished"? Saying "the community was shocked" doesn't necessarily mean 100% - as far as I know, nobody took a poll at the time - but there were very few people who reacted <i>at the time</i> with "hey, makes sense". By the end of 1976, there were a lot more people excited by Bill's vision, and jumping into software business. But tell ya what - WP is supposed to be a secondary source relying on published original research, so let's find a reputable history of early micros and see what it says. I wouldn't worry about anonymity; unless you're bgates himself, no one is going to be interested in mailbombing you. I've been in plenty of heated controversies in the past year, got a total of three mail messages, two of which were asking for help, the third was a complaint from some guy who thought he had the right to post copyright-violating text. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 20:46, 22 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, so why not say it drew mixed emotions from the crowd: some were shocked, others were excited... and eventually more and more people grew to like the idea. And, trust me, my minor revision isn't as biased as the current one is: I admit that I believe some open source rhetoric goes way off the deep end, but I'm not letting that difference opinion get in the way of how I re-edited it. I think I was even handed; I'm not exactly jumping up here saying how capitalism will save the world. I mean, why not add something like "Some hobbyist were intruged by the idea that they could make a career from what they enjoyed."?</dd>

<dd>I also object to "freely". It isn't needed and just acts like Mr. Gates was ruining freedoms.

<dd>Ok, let's get rid of the word "shocked" and put in "unpopular with some" and created "controversy." Controversy gives it a fairer light, because it implies there was debate on either side about it, not just one side. Also, the entry has gotta describe the people who liked the idea. You cannot possibly consider it NPOV unless you mention that.</dd>

He either refused to respond, or said only that the story sounded plausible, without describing his source. Wendy Rohm's <i>The Microsoft File</i> is a basic hack-job and soap opera which frequently has Mrs. Rohm playing mind-reader. <i>Hard Drive</i>, although careful about sourcing, contains material that has been outdated by subsequent research.

<li>It depends on how you define the terms. <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">Atheism</a> can be defined as "not believing in God". By this definition <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnosticism.html" title="Agnosticism">Agnosticism</a> is a form of atheism, and one can be both. A narrow definition of <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> is that is the denial of the existence of God. On this definition, agnostics are not atheists because they don't believe there is enough evidence either to assert or deny the existence of God. Gates has been somewhat evasive about his beliefs, and his statements are consistent with agnosticism and the weak form of atheism. It may be that he believes that God does not exist, making him a strong atheist, but he has not said this on the record, so far as I know. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 12:43, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article says: "Pirates of Silicon Valley (1999) — a dramatized but historically true film about the history of Apple and Microsoft, with Anthony Michael Hall playing Bill Gates." Pirates of Silicon Valley is a very INACCURATE film. It fails on some key issues that are related to Bill Gates. The story of how Microsoft had their first contact with IBM for example: They say there that he planned the meeting with IBM and made the contact with them while the opposite is true - IBM made the first contact with him and offered him to do an OS for them. Initially he directed them to another company, a thing which is ENTIRELY dismissed in "Pirates of Silicon Valley" and is a key aspect. There are many more examples for how "Pirates of Silicon Valley" is an inaccurate film and not "historically true". In the meantime I removed those words.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bill Gates vs General Motors</span></h2>
<p>For all of us who feel only the deepest love and affection for the way computers have enhanced our lives, read on. At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated, "If General Motors had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon."</p>
<p><br />
In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics (and I just love this part):</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.</li>
<li>Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.</li>
<li>Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For some reason you would simply accept this.</li>
<li>Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.</li>
<li>Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive -- but would run on only five percent of the roads.</li>
<li>The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single "This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation" warning light.</li>
<li>The airbag system would ask "Are you sure?" before deploying.</li>
<li>Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.</li>
<li>Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.</li>
<li>You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the engine off.</li>

<li>I once predicted that Tim Fischer (a former Australian politician) and Bill Gates have Asperger syndrome, and while I was working on it my prediction about Tim Fischer was confirmed when he said that he has some autistic traits (one of his children is autistic). But if wikipedia were to deal with this kind of topic, I'd fear that hundreds, if not thousands, might be the target of (probably not good faith) speculation as to whether or not X has Asperger syndrome.

<p>Removed this quote, it's not memorable, it's not a "nugget of wisdom", it's not in anyway revealing about its originator, nor history, or society, or current state of affairs, it begs the answer that it's not a matter of choice whether one respects government or not is he or she purport to be citizens of the u.s.a. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 62.74.9.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.74.9.77_1566.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.74.9.77">contribs</a>) 15:22, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>In fact the quote is memorable and very revealing about the attitude of the speaker and his place as a member of the uppermost class of the American aristocracy who feel that they were born to rule and government and the law are for little people. The answer that is it not a matter of choice actually is the whole point of showing the quote: what sort of person THINKS it is a matter of choice and feels a need to say so?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
<p>Why isn't ther a paragraph focusing on the varied criticism which has been levelled at Bill Gates along his long and highly controversial career. I presume he's got a lot of money flowing into hired hands "expurgating" this page at regular intervals (and i am right to suppose this since he's bussiness practises have demonstrated time and again that he is not above this, on the contrary. The number of trials settled out of court for once, is a clear indication he likes to buy his way out of "problems") and what's left is imo a sub par skeletal article mentioning some basic facts and a canonizing paragraph on his role as "philanthropist". This is really an article lacking in many respects, I am sorry i dont have the time to go through the previous edits and source some valuable criticism that should be preserved, but i hope someone has the time to do so and bring this up to wikipedia standards and not the press release direct from gate's headquarters that it is right now. I cannot stress this enough, such a controversial figure (and that is also a fact, just do a bill gates criticism search on an engine, a staggering 2.820.000 results in google) SHOULD NOT be without a criticism section. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 62.74.9.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.74.9.77_1566.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.74.9.77">contribs</a>) 15:22, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>Bill Gates is no benefit to the society nor to humanity. Delete the article, because it is not wisdom nor knowledge but pure information on volatile human development or should I rather say undevelopment?</p>
<p>To put it plainly, Bill Gates and his comrades destroyed a culture, that of the computer science, and with it that of the industry and with it that of the society. They caused irreversible disruption of what we call preservation of culture and cultural intent, they commercialized culture where there was no commercialization before and they monopolized where other companies long have finally grown adult and matured by their mistakes. Bill nor Microsoft ever matured. Ever listened to one of his so-called prophetic blurbs? How come that one of that stand must always recite the "you know" at least three times between "er" and "errm" with no content whatsoever in between?</p>

I also recall reading that it was quite common for female MS staff to persue BG and indeed there was some standard way they signalled their interest (I have to say this because I know someone else will, it was NOT sex).

<p>Investigative journalist <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Palast_4ebc.html" title="Greg Palast">Greg Palast</a> has accused Gates of using the Bill &amp; Melinda foundation to cover up global harm that he is part responsible for. This is a serious accusation, and Palast is a respected journalist. The text I've added to the article is:</p>
<p><i>Journalist <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greg_Palast_4ebc.html" title="Greg Palast">Greg Palast</a> suggests that The Gates Foundation is used to make tactical donations to hide media sensitive humanitarian side effects of treaties, such as <a href="../../../t/r/i/TRIPS_f48c.html" title="TRIPS">TRIPS</a>, which have been supported by Gates and are responsible for the deaths of millions in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>.<a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/detail.cfm?artid=241&amp;row=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gregpalast.com/detail.cfm?artid=241&amp;row=1" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></i></p>

I'll leave it this time, but I removed the part which states as a fact that TRIPS is "responsible for the deaths of millions in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>". We just can't say things like that in a neutral article.

<dd>Looking in the history, you reworded it (although you may also have later removed it, but I won't search 750 edits to confirm). I've reworded your new rewording - removing the "anti-globalisationists" remark. Palast's explanation of how TRIPS kills is from his book "The Best Democracy Money Can Buy". I'm not sure how to reference that though, since it's not online. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 21:19, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wasn't joking when I wrote that anti-globalization groups oppose TRIPS. I think it is opinionated for the article to state on one hand that Bill Gates supports the treaty, and then on the other hand explain the supposed drawbacks of the treaty. If we say that Bill Gates supports the treaty with no explanation, we should simply say that the radical anti-WTO crowd (including Palast) opposes the treaty. Basically you are discussing <i>who</i> supports the treaty without going into any detail about <i>why</i>, then giving your personal opinion that the treaty is bad, without any discussion of <i>who</i> opposes the treaty. It's a tricky debate tactic. Not sure that I'm making myself clear here - please let me know if you're confused. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 23:02, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Saying that "<i>the radical anti-WTO crowd [...] opposes the treaty</i>" is an oversimplification and is incorrect. The majority of TRIPS-critics are not "anti-globalisationists" or "radicals" (whether Palast uses either of those words for himself, I don't know). It's African and South American governments, it's consumer rights organisations, it's Medicines Without Frontiers, it's Free Software Foundation, it's the vast majority of civil society. So, what would you be happy with? How about saying that Gates and/or Microsoft strongly supports the treaty, and giving two quotes from organisations that criticise the treaty? I'll come back in a few days to try another wording. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 19:35, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Historically, successful men and women in America have fallen into one of two classes: conspicuous consumption or a continuing focus on their business. William Randolph Hearst seems to have lost his passion for the newspaper business and instead wasted his fortune on a mansion in San Simeon, and Larry Ellison of Oracle is well known for his lavish yachts. Whereas Thomas Edison and Henry Ford continued to pursue the interests that enriched them, alongside, in Ford's case, an eleemosynary interest in world peace.</p>
<p>Bill Gates appears to fall into the latter category and his central passion remains technology and his company, and philanthropy."</p>
<p>Is there some kind of historical theory that divides successful people into these two classes? I sure don't know of any. These sentences just seem awfully arbitrary and seem to violate NPOV.</p>

<p>20 years ago I learned that Bill Gates has <a href="../../../e/i/d/Eidetic_memory.html" title="Eidetic memory">eidetic memory</a> (also know as photographic memory); specifically, that he could recall <i>huge slabs of his source code</i>. Since he was only a few years away from his coding days at the time, the casual statement was just something I filed away at the time. Can anyone else confirm this? It is unreasonable to claim that he still does, but in 1984? (I know of at least 3 other people with this mental faculty, so I know 'photographic memory' is a valid article.) --<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncheta_Wis_6134.html" title="User:Ancheta Wis">Ancheta Wis</a> 01:09, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think so because it's not really connected to his work. Players in competitive games such as <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">chess</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/_/Go_%28board_game%29.html" title="Go (board game)">Go</a>, where we will see them doing their distinctive habits while thinking, must have how they come up with their best moves. But except for rare public events that might make him think hard, it's not important what he does while thinking. Now suppose that Bill Gates fell from his chair because of his habit and had to be hospitalized or something, then it deserves a mention. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevth_904e.html" title="User:Revth">Revth</a> 05:42, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>KBE stands for "Knight of the British Empire," and is placed after the end of one's name who has been knighted by the monarch of the United Kingdom, but is not a citizen of the commanwealth; otherwise the title "Sir," would be added before their name.

<dd>Technically the Queen did knight the bastard but in reality it was Tony Blair for "services rendered". What services they were, we'll probably never know exactly but it's probably connected to Blair launching his election campaigns at MSUK headquarters to give Windows XP a boost. The KBE is the current low-water mark for the country's honour system and is deeply embarrassing to our country. Alas, this information would be POV in the article (POV being defined as anything which even a single zealot or shill would object to somewhere somehow).213.78.235.176

<dd>According to British law, receiving the title "Knight of the British Empire" allows one to use the initials "KBE" after their name. It does not <i>require</i> one to use KBE any more than receiving a Ph.D. or M.D. requires one to use these initials. In certain situations, such as a research lab where everyone has a Ph.D., using Ph.D. with your name is looked upon as rather presumptuous. So to determine whether "KBE" is appropriate to be used with William T. Gates, we must not look to British law but what Bill Gates himself prefers. And in the Microsoft biography of Bill Gates <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/bio.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/bio.asp" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, KBE is not used anywhere. So I don't think we should be using it in his name either. –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 12:34, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Bhargav. You seem to feel very strongly that Bill Gates should be shown with the "KBE" after his name, yet I can find no websites, other than those which are copying Wikipedia, that use the KBE. The Microsoft biography website does not use it. The New York Times does not use it. The Washington Post doesn't use it. In fact, most of the other websites I've found that mention Gates's KBE are poking fun at it <a href="http://www.entmag.com/news/rss.asp?EditorialsID=6592" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.entmag.com/news/rss.asp?EditorialsID=6592" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. I know he is entitled to use the KBE -- that is not an issue. He is entitled to use Ph.D. also since he received an honorary Ph.D. I'm just wondering why you feel the article should put a KBE after his name when no one else is doing it. Can you cite any sources that show that Gates has elected to use the KBE in his name? –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 14:57, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
