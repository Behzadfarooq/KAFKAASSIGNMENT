<p>King was often described as a renaissance man who was a voracious reader, loved to watch the ballet and opera in his spare time, and study Russian history. King was known on broadcasts for his catchphrase <i>"Holy Toledo!"</i> and recognized by his distinctive handlebar mustache and beard. He lived in <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sausalito%2C_California_f2db.html" title="Sausalito, California">Sausalito, California</a>, and would often go on long sailing trips in the baseball off-season on his ketch Varuna.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">November 1</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, in conjunction with the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Athletics_6739.html" title="Oakland Athletics">Oakland A's</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_State_Warriors_cfb7.html" title="Golden State Warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>, and <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>, a private ceremony celebrating the life of Bill King was attended by friends, family, and the media at the Arena in Oakland. There were performances by the Smuin ballet, and tributes from Bill's former broadcast partners. <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Greenwald_d631.html" title="Hank Greenwald">Hank Greenwald</a> who worked with Bill during his Warriors tenure was the master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>The most memorable tributes were from Hank, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Korach_2293.html" title="Ken Korach">Ken Korach</a>, and Raiders owner <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Davis_cbd7.html" title="Al Davis">Al Davis</a>. In his speech, Korach mentioned Bill had three rules in his broadcasts. He hated it when an announcer mentioned a <i>"grand slam home run"</i> because saying home run was redundant. Second, Bill disliked the usage of saying <i>"early on"</i> (the word "on" was improper grammar). Third, Bill never liked to be thanked by his broadcast partner when he "tossed" to him for his innings. Korach said, <i>"sorry partner, but thanks for everything."</i></p>
<p>Al Davis had arguably the most commanding and entertaining eulogy. When he first met Bill at Raiders training camp in 1966, he didn't know what to make of the small statured King with his handlebar mustache and beard who sat shirtless, sitting on a blanket and holding a yellow pad making notes of what the players were doing on the field. Davis said,</p>

<p><i>"To think it was Bill King who brought us together,"</i> Davis said, noting it's a rare day when all three Oakland teams are represented in one room. Davis sat at the same table with Warriors Hall of Famer Rick Barry.</p>

<p>Davis spoke that Bill gets a cloak of immortality because time never stops for the great ones.</p>
<p>It was Al's dream to have built a sold out stadium that seated 1 to 2 million and all the Raider fans would be listening to the voice of Bill King.</p>
<p>Bruce MacGowan of <a href="../../../k/n/b/KNBR_eff0.html" title="KNBR">KNBR</a> also had a moving speech about how he met Bill King through Lon Simmons and even worked as a Raiders statistician in the early 1970s. He once asked Bill for a ride home and MacGowan noted how beat up Bill's car was. On the drive to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marin_County_e01c.html" title="Marin County">Marin County</a>, Bruce noticed there was a draft yet the windows were rolled up. To his dismay, there was a hole in the floorboard by his feet. MacGowan asked how long Bill had been driving his car. King replied, <i>"I just got it a week ago, no sense in paying more than <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">$</a>250.00 for a car."</i></p>
<p>Besides the tributes, there was a Bill King "uncensored" segment which really opened up some eyes as the audience heard Bill's off-air banter with his broadcasters that included some rather colorful language. The best segment was the actual audio call of the "<a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother%27s_Day_d171.html" title="Mother's Day">Mother's Day</a>" incident from the Warriors game at Seattle on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">December 6</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968.html" title="1968">1968</a>. King was outraged by poor officiating from official <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_T._Rush_c492.html" title="Ed T. Rush">Ed T. Rush</a> in his rookie season. After several calls had gone against the Warriors, King took off his headset, turned off his microphone, cupped his hands and yelled a certain expletive at Rush. Unbeknownst to King, the crowd mic was on and Bill's insult went over the airwaves. The Warriors were assessed a technical foul and owner <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Mieuli_37eb.html" title="Franklin Mieuli">Franklin Mieuli</a> later had to pay the appropriate fines to the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> for the incident.</p>
<p>Years later, King would receive a Mother's day card from Ed Rush with a note stating,</p>
