He was the second of three children born to William A. and Margaret Bishop.

<p>When the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a> broke out in 1914, Bishop left the college and joined the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississauga_Horse_7903.html" title="Mississauga Horse">Mississauga Horse</a> (a cavalry regiment). He was commissioned as an officer but was ill with <a href="../../../p/n/e/Pneumonia.html" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> when the regiment was sent overseas. After recovering, he was transferred to the 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles, a horse-mounted infantry unit, then stationed in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London%2C_Ontario_c3a0.html" title="London, Ontario">London, Ontario</a>.

<p>In July 1915, frustrated with the mud of the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trench_warfare.html" title="Trench warfare">trenches</a> and the lack of action, he transferred to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Flying_Corps_45d7.html" title="Royal Flying Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> as an observer. On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">1 September</a>, he reported to 21 (Training) Squadron at Netheravon for elementary air instruction.

<p>Following his recovery, he was accepted for training as a pilot.

Bishop and a Nieuport 17 fighter</div>

<p>In March <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>, he was posted to 60 Squadron at Filescamp Farm near <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arras.html" title="Arras">Arras</a>, flying the <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nieuport_17.html" title="Nieuport 17">Nieuport 17</a> fighter. At that time, the average lifespan of a new pilot in that sector was 11 days. Bishop claimed his first victory on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_25.html" title="March 25">25 March</a>, when his was one of four Nieuports that engaged three <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albatros_D.III_ccbe.html" title="Albatros D.III">Albatros D.III</a> Scouts near St Leger. After that, his total increased rapidly. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_5.html" title="April 5">5 April</a>, he scored his fifth victory and became an ace. To celebrate, he had the cowling and struts of his plane painted bright blue. This was probably inspired by the red spinners on the plane of fellow squadron member Captain <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Ball_82e0.html" title="Albert Ball">Albert Ball</a>, at that time the Empire's highest scoring ace. He claimed 25 planes down in April alone, winning the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Cross_3e00.html" title="Military Cross">Military Cross</a> and a promotion to Captain for his participation at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Vimy_Ridge_31ed.html" title="Battle of Vimy Ridge">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a>. On April 30th, Bishop claimed to have survived an encounter with <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manfred_von_Richthofen_71a1.html" title="Manfred von Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a>, the Red Baron, although it is more likely that Bishop had actually been fighting other members of Manfred's <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasta_11.html" title="Jasta 11">Jasta</a>. In May, Bishop won the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Order_3a2e.html" title="Distinguished Service Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for shooting down two planes while being attacked by four others.</p>

His VC was the only one ever awarded in violation of the warrant requiring witnesses, and since the German records have been lost and the archived papers of his VC were lost as well, there is no way of ever knowing if there were any witnesses or not.

<dd>For most conspicuous bravery, determination, and skill. Captain Bishop, who had been sent out to work independently, flew first of all to an enemy aerodrome; finding no machines about, he flew on to another aerodrome about three miles southeast, which was at least 12 miles the other side of the line. Seven machines, some with their engines running, were on the ground. He attacked these from about fifty feet, and a mechanic, who was starting one of the engines, was seen to fall. One of the machines got off the ground, but at a height of 60 feet, Captain Bishop fired 15 rounds into it at very close range, and it crashed to the ground. A second machine got off the ground, into which he fired 30 rounds at 150 yards range, and it fell into a tree. Two more machines then rose from the aerodrome. One of these he engaged at a height of 1,000 feet, emptying the rest of his drum of ammunition. This machine crashed 300 yards from the aerodrome, after which Captain Bishop emptied a whole drum into the fourth hostile machine, and then flew back to his station. Four hostile scouts were about 1,250 feet above him for about a mile of his return journey, but they would not attack. His machine was very badly shot about by machine-gun fire from the ground.</dd>

<p>He returned home to Canada in 1917, where he was considered a hero and helped boost the morale of the Canadian public, who were growing tired of the war.

<p>Upon his return to France in April, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, Bishop was promoted to Major and given command of No. 85 Squadron, the "Flying Foxes". This was a newly formed squadron and Bishop was given the freedom to choose many of the pilots. The squadron was equipped with SE5a scouts and left for <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petit_Synthe%2C_France_a19a.html" title="Petit Synthe, France">Petit Synthe, France</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_22.html" title="May 22">22 May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>. Bishop scored his next victory on the 27th, followed by two more on the 28th.</p>
<p>The Canadian government was becoming increasingly worried about the effect on morale if Bishop were to be killed, so on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_18.html" title="June 18">18 June</a>, he was ordered to return to England to help organize the new Canadian Flying Corps. Bishop was not pleased with the order coming so soon after his return to France. He wrote to his wife: "I've never been so furious in my life. It makes me livid with rage to be pulled away just as things are getting started." The order specified that he was to leave France by noon on the 19th. On the morning of the 19th, Bishop decided to fly one last solo patrol. In just 15 minutes of combat, he added another five victories to his total. He claimed to have downed two Pfalz D.IIIa scouts, caused another two to collide with each other and shot down a German reconnaissance plane.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">5 August</a>, Bishop was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and was given the post of "Officer Commanding-designate of the Canadian Air Force Section of the General Staff, Headquarters Overseas Military Forces of Canada." He was onboard ship returning from a reporting visit to Canada when news of the armistice arrived. Bishop was discharged from the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Expeditionary_Force_627b.html" title="Canadian Expeditionary Force">Canadian Expeditionary Force</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> and returned to Canada.</p>
<p>By the end of the war, he had 72 air victories, including 55 assessed as "destroyed" with the balance "out of control". In any case, he was recognized as the leading British Empire pilot, and the second-highest ranking Allied ace behind French Lt. <a href="../../../r/e/n/Ren%C3%A9_Fonck_4081.html" title="René Fonck">René Fonck</a> with 75.</p>

<p>After the war, he established a short-lived passenger air service with fellow ace <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Barker_96c8.html" title="William Barker">William Barker</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, Bishop and his family moved to Britain, where he was quite successful. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>, he was the guest of honour at a gathering of German air aces in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> and was made an Honorary Member of the Association. Unfortunately, the family's wealth was wiped out in the crash of 1929 and they had to move back to Canada.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Bishop_bb38.html" title="Edit section: Second World War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second World War</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, he was promoted to Honorary Air Marshal of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force_3f81.html" title="Royal Canadian Air Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> and placed in charge of recruitment. He was so successful in this role that they had to turn many applicants away. He created a system for training pilots across Canada and became instrumental in setting up and promoting the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_Air_Training_Plan_7dc0.html" title="Commonwealth Air Training Plan">Commonwealth Air Training Plan</a>, which trained over 167,000 airmen in Canada during the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">Second World War</a>. In 1942, he appeared as himself in the film <i><a href="../../../c/a/p/Captains_of_the_Clouds_21b8.html" title="Captains of the Clouds">Captains of the Clouds</a></i>, a <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> tribute to the RCAF.</p>
<p>Both of Bishop's children became aviators. He presented his son, Arthur, with his wings during the Second World War; Arthur would go on to become a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarine_Spitfire_30cc.html" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> pilot. He also presented his daughter, Jackie, with a Wireless Sparks Badge as a radio operator in 1944.</p>
<p>By 1944, the stress of the war had taken a serious toll on Bishop's health, and he resigned his post in the RCAF to return to private enterprise in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>. His son later commented that he looked 70 years old on his 50th birthday in 1944. He remained active in the aviation realm however, predicting a phenomenal growth of commercial aviation in the post-war world. His efforts to bring some organization to the nascent field led to the formation of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization_93f3.html" title="International Civil Aviation Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (<a href="../../../i/c/a/ICAO_4c82.html" title="ICAO">ICAO</a>) in <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal.html" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>. He wrote a second book at this time, <i>Winged Peace</i> advocating international control of global airpower.</p>

<p>With the outbreak of the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_War_7f11.html" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>, Bishop again offered to return to his recruitment role, but was in poor health and was politely refused by the <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCAF_b14e.html" title="RCAF">RCAF</a>.

<p>His life is depicted in the famous Canadian play, <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Bishop_Goes_to_War_fb33.html" title="Billy Bishop Goes to War">Billy Bishop Goes to War</a></i>. The play was so successful that it led to Bishop once again becoming a national hero.</p>
<p>It also led indirectly to a <a href="../../../c/b/c/CBC_Television_2f39.html" title="CBC Television">CBC Television</a> documentary called <i>The Kid Who Couldn't Miss</i>, produced by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Film_Board_of_Canada_94b9.html" title="National Film Board of Canada">National Film Board of Canada</a>. The show, based around "mock interviews" with Bishop and others, suggested that Bishop faked his famous attack on the German aerodrome. In one particularly contenious scene, his mechanic claims that the damage to his plane was confined to a small circle in a non-critical area, implying that Bishop had landed his plane off-field, shot the holes in it, and then flew home with claims of damage. In fact, his mechanic was his biggest supporter in this issue and the scene was a complete fabrication, as he contended that Bishop had not fabricated his claims.</p>
<p>After years of controversy over Bishop's record, the show led to an inquiry by the Canadian government in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>. The Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology discredited the documentary, saying it was an unfair and inaccurate portrayal of Bishop.</p>
<p><i>A Hero to Me: The Billy Bishop Story - WW1 Canadian flying Ace</i> , a documentary depicting the story of "Billy" Bishop from the perspective of his grand daughter, Diana, was also produced for Global Television and TVO in 2003.</p>
<p>His decorations include the Victoria Cross, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Order_3a2e.html" title="Distinguished Service Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> &amp; Bar, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Cross_3e00.html" title="Military Cross">Military Cross</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_%28UK%29_fd17.html" title="Distinguished Flying Cross (UK)">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>, <a href="../../../l/%C3%A9/g/L%C3%A9gion_d%27honneur.html" title="Légion d'honneur">légion d'honneur</a> and the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Croix_de_Guerre_4dd9.html" title="Croix de Guerre">Croix de Guerre</a> with palm.
