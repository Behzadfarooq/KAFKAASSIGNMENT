<p>my understanding is that people who are awarded honorary doctorates are not allowed to be styled as "Dr."</p>
<p>In the case of an honorary doctorate, the recipient is allowed to place the relevent suffix after their name, in this case it would be "D.Litt.(Hon)"</p>
<p>Have a look at the wikipedia article on "doctorate" for clarification</p>

<dd>I second that. The first line should be changed to <b>Billy Connolly CBE</b> or to be consistant the CBE should be dropped since not all Wikipedia biographical articles include initial references to honorariums except perhaps knighthoods. Referring to the comment above, I think it might be OK to leave the Dr. in there if the person used it as part of their working name (whether entitled to or not). Here in Canada, a country singer named Stompin' Tom Connors often bills himself as Dr. Stompin' Tom Connors after he also received an honorary law degree a few years back. To the best of my knowledge Connolly has never used the title professionally. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:59, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Connolly doses not use the "Dr" title but it is a singulat honour, as is the CBE, that reflects the fact that this is not just another comedian but someone who is highly regarded in his own country. I have placed the "Dr" in inverted commas to indicate that it is not an official title - but is an honorary award. I know of no prohibition on holders of honorary doctorates from being addressed as "Dr". I think that <b>Billy Connolly</b> should appear in the second paragraph. <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETiles_8ba1.html" title="User:Tiles">Tiles</a> 07:56, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think that putting "Dr" in quotes is the standard way of signifying an honorary doctorate. It looks a lot like a scare-quote, or, like "Dr Stompin' Tom Connors" above, like it's just a name he goes by. He <i>is</i> a doctor, so it shouldn't be in inverted commas, but it's honorary, so I don't think it should be there. I think the first use of the name should just be "William Connolly, CBE," or, since the man is known as Billy, and that is the title of the page, "William "Billy" Connolly, CBE." -- <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> 11:13, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason I use the term "officially" regarding Whoopi Goldberg introducing Connolly to American audiences in 1990 (with the Brooklyn Academy of Music performance) is that this is time in which it is generally felt that Connolly's American career began. Connolly himself says this in Erect for 30 Years. Prior to this Connolly had made some attempts at making US appearances, including talk show appearances on Joan Rivers and Letterman, but to little success. I remember when many dates of his 1987 "Wreck on Tour" were cancelled for lack of ticket sales. As Erect for 30 Years indicates, it is Goldberg's efforts that resulted in Connolly coming to the attention of the general public in the US as well as contemporaries such as Robin Williams. Soon after that, he did Head of the Class and started to appear in major American productions. So I think it is accurate to use the term "officially" in this context, tough perhaps I should add more about why this is so. If the consensus is to remove the qualifier, it's no biggie. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:09, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you're taking the use of the word too literally. "Rock Around the Clock" is also "officially" the song that kicked off the rock and roll era, too. Nothing to do with an office.

<p>The article says that "Big Yin" is a reference to his height, yet I was under the impression the nickname originated from the fact that he refers to Jesus as "Big Yin" in his famous Crucifixion monologue. Can anyone confirm the origin of the nickname? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 08:01, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I heard in the semi-biographic video "Erect for 30 years" (or something along those lines) that he was known as 'Big Yin' simply because of the fame he has harvested during his career. 86.132.221.94 19:58, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mr 86.132.221.94 is right. "Big Yin" is a formalisation of "Biggin", a perfectly common nickname in Scotland, used for anybody who could be considered 'big', either for physical reasons (height) or social ones (fame, popularity, general standing). I am going to make the edit accordingly. 83.19.18.138 00:03, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>In the parts of Glasgow where Billy lived and grew up, any man above, say, six feet tall or in a position of authority, would be referred to as the "big yin" or the "big man". A small man, say 5 foot 6 inches would be called "wee man" or the "wee yin". An in-between man would be addressed as "Jimmy" and all women would be addressed as "hen". Connolly's nickname came from his height. <a href="../../../t/i/l/User%7ETiles_8ba1.html" title="User:Tiles">Tiles</a> 01:56, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's stated in the article that Connolly shaved his beard off for a 1990 film, but I'm pretty certain he actually shaved it off earlier, in like 1988 or 1989, not long before his HBO special with Whoopi Goldberg. I do know he was "beardless" for at least a year before joining Head of the Class. Does anyone know exactly when "The Shaving" occured? Also, what was the commercial Connolly made around this time when he wore a fake version of his beard and tore it off? I think it was for a beer but I can't remember which one. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:47, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are several quotes attributed to Connolly in this article that need citations, such as his amusing comment regarding his physical for the Territorial Army. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:07, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Both images show the older, more recent Connolly. There should also be an image of him in his younger days, perhaps a record cover or some such. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:16, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Billy Connolly is well-known (infamous, even) for his profligate use of the word "fuck". However, I have seen videos of older performances (early-mid 80s) in which he does not use this word very often. "An Audience with Billy Connolly" is one example - I think he only said "fuck" once or twice during that appearance. "Billy Bites Yer Bum" (available on DVD) is another.</p>
<p>Can anyone say whether Connolly has increased the "fuck quotient" in his more recent performances? Or did he simply tone down his act on those earlier occasions, knowing that they were being filmed for television? (20 or 25 years ago, the word "fuck" was rarely heard on British TV - needless to say, it is a lot more common now.) 217.34.39.123 10:34, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Connolly has actually discussed this a few times but I can't recall the exact reasons at the moment. If you listen to the mid-70s LP <i>Get Right Intae Him</i> he's bleeped twice, once for saying "Effin' C" in DIVORCE and again for using the F-word in another routine (though he is able to use the word "shit" on the same recording without being bleeped). I think by the late 80s restrictions on language had been lifted and he was able to be a bit more free with his words, though obviously he still tones it down for TV appearances. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 11:55, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've seen him wear it atleast twice, a black pair of pants and some tshirt with a tail? what is that?</p>
<dl>
<dd>He wore it throughout one of his 1990s tours (and probably beyond). Maybe he feels the tail gives him room to maneuver when doing visual re-enactments (such as the horizontal escalators at airports, for example), rather than having a tucked-in T-shirt or the like. - <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudesleeper_55a1.html" title="User:Dudesleeper">Dudesleeper</a> 21:37, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I imagine that Connolly came from a Catholic family. I'm not sure though. In the context of the son of an Irish immigrant living in Scotland, this is important information and should be mentioned.</p>
<p>At his London, Ontario show recently, he said religion should have been abandoned by the world a long time ago.</p>

<p>"Although Connolly had performed in North America as early as the 1970s, and had appeared in several movies that played in American theatres, he nonetheless remained relatively unknown until 1990 when he was featured in the HBO special Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Connolly in Performance, produced by New York's Brooklyn Academy of Music. Goldberg introduced Connolly, and his performance has been cited as the moment that officially launched his career in the States."</p>
<p>The above paragraph fudges Connolly's career in the USA with his career in North America as a whole. Was he well known in Canada prior to 1990? 217.155.20.163 00:08, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>He toured both Canada and the USA from the 1970s onward. His "Wreck-on-Tour" travelled throughout the continent in 1987, plus his records were widely available. (Ironically his records were easier to fine in North American stores <i>before</i> he hit it big over here. Since 1990 his material has been virtually impossible to find.) <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:22, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That wouldn't be a good reference in any case. I am quite happy to believe that his father was born in Ireland (though it still needs a reference), but does Connolly consider himself "Irish-Scots"? Or did a reputable source comment on it? I did wonder about removing it I admit, but it looked an unsafe thing to say.

<p>An unregistered user made a change claiming that Connolly is erroneously credited with recording Evil Scotsman. Having heard the recording, I'm 99% percent sure it's Connolly since I'm familiar with his singing. However, it's possible it could be an impersonator. Nonetheless the IP did not offer any source to indicate that Connolly did not record the song, so I removed the edit for now. So, let's get the facts straight -- did Connolly record "Evil Scotsman" or not, and if he didn't, then who did? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
