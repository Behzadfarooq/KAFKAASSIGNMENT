<p>From my understanding of frontcourt players in the fifties and sixties, I am not sure if Bill Russell was that undersized. While he was on the thin side (about 220 lbs), his height (between 6-9 and 6-10) seems to be average for centers around the time he played. Wes Unseld and Willis Reed are typical examples of centers during his time. In fact, it is not that uncommon today to see players around Russell's height playing center in the NBA. Alonzo Mourning and Ben Wallace (who is probably shorter)are such examples. Dinobrya 12 June 2006.</p>

<p>I conducted a large sampling of the fives who were playing during Russell's time and discovered the darndest thing. I found far more players who were 6'8 and 6'9 than I did 7 footers. In fact 6'9 was the mode {the most common height I saw). Secondly, Russell did not seem to be that much of a bean pole when compared to the vast majority of his comtemporaries. Bill Russell seemed to be undersized only in rare instances--such as his matchups with Chamberlain. 215-230 seemed to be very common for a NBA center. He was not outsized on a nightly basis.

<dd>You make a good point that Russell was not "undersized" compared to most of the other centers who played against him. However, Russell's game was a game based on speed and quickness, rather than size and power. Against Chamberlain, Walt Bellamy, and the handful of other centers at that time who were bigger than Russell, Russell used his great quickness to his advantage as he was outmatched physically against bigger centers but because of his quickness he was able to have a huge defensive impact on the other four opponents.</dd>

<dd>You'd have to remove it from the professional biography section and that might create some confusion. How exactly would you do it? Would you create a new stand alone section entitled 1956 NBA Draft? It couldn't be under the college career section obviously. Maybe a stand alone section between college career and Olympic career section. By stand alone I mean a new section with no subsections obviously. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 08:39, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think the best solution is to have a stand-alone section for the Draft.

This'll require some discussion. <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 19:27, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with eliminating some of the redundancies in those sections, however a lot of the changes you're making are just personal preferences in my opinion. I guess they're fine if both your versions and the previous versions are acceptable. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 01:20, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not changing things for the sake of changing things. I really do think some of the prose can be better than it is now. I voted support at the FAC discussion, but I also added that there were still "a few minor things to address." Let's look at some isolated phrases from past versions of the article. Am I the only one who thinks these are awkward?

<li><i>This happening would be something that would repeatedly occur throughout his career.</i></li>
<li><i>Russell contributed 12.9 points and 22.8 rebounds per game, finally not managing to average 23 boards a game after a seven-year streak.</i></li>

<dd>Back to topic . . . I think I'd like to see a merge performed on the <b>Awards and feats</b> and <b>Legacy</b> sections. There's no really natural division between the two sections, so why not have just one? The <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Robertson_696e.html" title="Oscar Robertson">Oscar Robertson</a> article, for example, doesn't have an "Awards and feats" section and I think it is perfectly fine as it is. As long as the merge doesn't lose any information contained in the current "Awards and feats" and "Legacy" sections I would be satisfied. <a href="../../../m/y/a/User%7EMyasuda_0ddc.html" title="User:Myasuda">Myasuda</a> 18:48, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would tend to disagree. Although the redundant info should be eliminated between the two sections. Legacy should not have as much statistical info but perhaps more comments from players and coaches regarding him. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 03:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>With all due respect, there are no comments/quotes are currently present, so there's no need for two sections at this time. As such, I went ahead and conducted the merge since no one has taken the initiative to remove the obvious redundancies between the two sections. We can split the Legacy section in the future as the situation warrants. <a href="../../../m/y/a/User%7EMyasuda_0ddc.html" title="User:Myasuda">Myasuda</a> 14:24, 1 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>All due respect but I completely and strongly disagree let's see if some other people chime in. I don't have time to fix it right now, but in my opinion it's a bad idea that needs to be nuked. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 18:22, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually maybe it's the title that's annoying me a "Legacy" section that incoludes a long recounting of his awards is unintuitive. Renaming would help perhaps, it's now Accomplishments and legacy. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 18:40, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I sort of agree. The majority of that section isn't really about his <i>legacy</i> (in terms of his impact on the game today), but mostly a recap of his accomplishments. However, there really wasn't much information about his legacy to begin with.</dd>
<dd>Couple of nit-picks: I think the summary of records and statistical accomplishments would actually look better in a bulleted list or a table. As it stands, the section is rather difficult to read. The amount of info is overwhelming, and every other sentence seems to begin with "Also," "In addition" "Furthermore," etc. I know this would be a major change, but I don't think it hurts to throw out the idea.</dd>
<dd>Also...does 15.1 ppg constitute a "mediocre" scoring average? That's still <i>decent</i> -- much better than most players in NBA history. Maybe we should rewrite that (or find a source calling Russell's offense mediocre). <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 15:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would characterize it as mediocre by Hall-of-Fame standards. Would you be satisfied if "by Hall of Fame standards" were appended to the description? <a href="../../../m/y/a/User%7EMyasuda_0ddc.html" title="User:Myasuda">Myasuda</a> 20:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hmmm...That might be a little bit better, although perhaps use something softer than "mediocre." "Relatively low" by Hall of Fame standards? I'm not sure if that would flow... <a href="../../../z/a/g/User%7EZagalejo_b63a.html" title="User:Zagalejo">Zagalejo</a> 20:47, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've worked on the references for an hour an half. I'm summarizing the problems here so that Project members can incorporate these changes into future articles.</p>
<ol>
<li>Named refs were not used anywhere in the article; all references were repeated every time they were used. In the few occasions that named refs were used, they weren't done correctly. Have a look at <a href="../../../f/n/_/WP%7EFN_5c8e.html" title="WP:FN">WP:FN</a> on how to use named refs. (By the way, using named refs correctly—eliminating replication—trimmed 10KB off of the article size.)</li>
<li>Publishers were listed on the cite templates under Last (which is for author last name) with first name empty, resulting in incorrectly formatted references, with publisher before article title. I changed last to publisher on all refs, and deleted the empty "first" for first name.</li>
<li>Publication dates were missing on numerous sources, and since I didn't check every one, there are probably still more.</li>
<li>Authors were missing on many sources.</li>
<li>A few retrieval dates were missing.</li>
<li>Some of the sources given had completely wrong info, including inaccurate title, author and date. In other words, if these sites ever go dead, it would have been very hard to re-find them, without even an accurate article title.</li>
<li>There are no page numbers given on book sources; hopefully this will be corrected before this article goes to the main page.</li>
<li>Please read my edit summaries to double-check my work, and to notice the kinds of changes needed. Because I did so much work at once, it would be really good if someone else checked each diff and reviewed comments in my edit summaries (in particular, about refs that were wrong).</li>
<li>NONE of the hoophall.com sites work or are correct; in other words, the article is currently missing a VERY large number of cites. These should be corrected, replaced, or found before mainpage.</li>
<li>Still to be corrected, because I got tired and gave up—none of the dashes or hyphens are done correctly, which is a big issue in a sports article when every score contains a dash. En-dashes are used between numbers; this is not done in most of the article. Pls have a look at <a href="../../../d/a/s/WP%7EDASH_9598.html" title="WP:DASH">WP:DASH</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Removed the line "even while in Boston". Boston has a reputation for extreme racism -- I've heard it called the most racist city in America --, especially in the 20th century, and even did it not, there's nothing to support this lines inclusion in the article.

<p>Some undoubtedly well intentioned anon went through and re-wrote practically the entire article adding a lot of redundant wording, and generally unecessary words. See here:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Russell&amp;diff=117268661&amp;oldid=117036768" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Russell&amp;diff=117268661&amp;oldid=117036768" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> This is generally how FA's fall below standard. One or two examples, Here's before in one example:</p>
<p>In one particular instance, Russell's father was denied service at a gasoline station until the staff had taken care of all the white customers. When his father attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face, threatening to kill him unless he stayed and waited his turn.</p>
<p>and after:</p>
<p>To illustrate this view, in one particular instance, Russell's father was denied service at a gasoline station until the staff had finished providing for all of the white customers. When his father realized the service station attendant's racist practice, he attempted to leave and find a different station, but the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him unless he stayed and waited for service.</p>
<p>"To illustrate this view" is unnecessary extra wording, it's already obvious in the previous wording that you're giving an example.</p>
<p>"When his father realized the service station attendant's racist practice" extra redundant wording that adds nothing, it's already clearly obvious he left the station in the earlier version because of the racism. Also the last half of the sentence has similar superfluous wording. In general a ton of redundancies were added and some meanings were altered, which made sentences now incorrect. In general an absolute ton of unnecessary and redundant wording was added. I just decided to blank revert them after trying to keep some, there was just too many problems. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 12:44, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also you'll notice that descriptions of him as average offensively were removed which is incorrect also. Russell was almost universally regarded as average on offense. His low fg% and mediocre offensive numbers attest to that. In addition his numbers become even more unimpressive when you consider that he played in an era when teams averaged 130-140 points a game. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 12:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course your last attempt to provide context is flat-out wrong. No NBA team has averaged more than 126.5 points per game in a season, and this occurred in the 1981-82 season. I don't object to the "average" characterization of Russell's offense, however. <a href="../../../m/y/a/User%7EMyasuda_0ddc.html" title="User:Myasuda">Myasuda</a> 13:43, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Okay I was mistaken. My bad, the point was that teams averaged more points per game in Russell's era:<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/league_stats.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/league_stats.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadzilla99_0ace.html" title="User:Quadzilla99">Quadzilla99</a> 22:49, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
