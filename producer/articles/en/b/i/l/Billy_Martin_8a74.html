<p>Martin was known for his ability to win with any team, and for arguing animatedly with umpires, including a widely parodied routine in which he kicked dust on their feet, but he was criticized for not getting along with veteran players, burning out young pitchers, and drinking too much.</p>

<p>Billy Martin was born to Joan and Alfred Martin in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley%2C_California_6eb4.html" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley, California</a>. His father was of Portuguese ancestry,<sup id="_ref-martin_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-martin" title="">[1]</a></sup> his mother of Italian ancestry.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Alfred's infidelities with <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley_70e2.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California</a> coeds soon led to their separation, and Billy was raised by his mother, who doted on her son, frequently calling him "bello," or "beautiful" in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_language.html" title="Italian language">Italian</a>. This was the origin of his nickname "Billy."</p>
<p>Billy grew up playing baseball at a city park across the street from his home, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_J._Kenney_1249.html" title="James J. Kenney">James Kenney</a> Park. Baseball pro and fellow Berkeley native <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augie_Galan_06a0.html" title="Augie Galan">Augie Galan</a> lived nearby and would bring some of his professional friends to James Kenney Park in the off-season to practice. Kids in the neighborhoood, including Martin, would come by to watch and learn.</p>
<p>While attending <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley_High_School_%28California%29_0d30.html" title="Berkeley High School (California)">Berkeley High School</a>, Billy tried out for and began playing for the Oakland Junior Oaks, affiliated with the Pacific Coast League's Oakland Oaks club. After graduation, Billy was signed to the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Oaks_%28PCL%29_efe0.html" title="Oakland Oaks (PCL)">Oakland Oaks</a> of the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Coast_League_795c.html" title="Pacific Coast League">Pacific Coast League</a>, playing for that team in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>. Martin played for <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_Stengel_d9ab.html" title="Casey Stengel">Casey Stengel</a> who was the manager of the Oakland Oaks in 1948. Stengel admired his aggressive play. When Stengel became manager in New York, he had the Yankees obtain Martin.</p>

<p>He started his major league career in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950_in_baseball.html" title="1950 in baseball">1950</a> as a second baseman for the Yankees. As a player, Martin was known for making clutch plays.</p>
<p>In 1953 Martin had career highs in home runs (15), RBIs (75), doubles (24), triples (6), and times hit by pitch (6).</p>
<p>He was the MVP of the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953_World_Series_07cb.html" title="1953 World Series">1953 World Series</a>, as he batted .500 with a .958 slugging percentage.</p>
<p>He was an <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_584d.html" title="Major League Baseball All-Star Game">All-Star</a> in 1956. In 1958 he led the league in <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sacrifice_hit.html" title="Sacrifice hit">sacrifice hits</a>, with 13.</p>
<p>Martin retired in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961_in_baseball.html" title="1961 in baseball">1961</a> with a career batting average of .257. He hit .333 in 28 World Series games for the Yankees.</p>

<p>Martin was also known for partying hard. The Yankees traded him in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1957_in_baseball.html" title="1957 in baseball">1957</a>, a month after a group of Yankees met at the famous <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copacabana_%28nightclub%29.html" title="Copacabana (nightclub)">Copacabana</a> nightclub to celebrate Martin's 29th birthday. The party ended in a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brawl.html" title="Brawl">brawl</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_manager_%28baseball%29.html" title="General manager (baseball)">general manager</a> <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Weiss_%28baseball%29_4af3.html" title="George Weiss (baseball)">George Weiss</a>, believing Martin's nightlife was a bad influence on teammates <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitey_Ford_0edc.html" title="Whitey Ford">Whitey Ford</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Mantle_2f71.html" title="Mickey Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a>, sent him to the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Athletics_6739.html" title="Oakland Athletics">Kansas City Athletics</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_4.html" title="August 4">August 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a>, Martin, then playing for the <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, charged the mound in the second inning after receiving a <a href="../../../b/r/u/Brushback_pitch.html" title="Brushback pitch">brushback pitch</a> from <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> pitcher <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Brewer_d6ce.html" title="Jim Brewer">Jim Brewer</a>. Martin threw his bat at Brewer, who picked up the bat and started to hand it to Martin as he approached. Martin punched Brewer in the right eye, breaking his cheekbone. Brewer was hospitalized for two months, and Martin served a five-day suspension. The Cubs sued Martin for $1 million for the loss of Brewer's services. While the Cubs dropped their case, Brewer pursued his, and in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969_in_baseball.html" title="1969 in baseball">1969</a>, a judge ordered Martin to pay $10,000 in damages. When informed of the judgment by the press, Billy asked sarcastically, "How do they want it? Cash or check?"</p>
<p>Martin's fights as a player also included bouts with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Piersall_6fc7.html" title="Jimmy Piersall">Jimmy Piersall</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clint_Courtney_c2c6.html" title="Clint Courtney">Clint Courtney</a> (twice), <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Batts_34c1.html" title="Matt Batts">Matt Batts</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tommy_Lasorda_c1a9.html" title="Tommy Lasorda">Tommy Lasorda</a>.</p>

<p>Martin bounced around after his 1957 trade to Kansas City. During the last 4½ years of his playing career, he played for the A's, <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, Reds, <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta_Braves_4729.html" title="Atlanta Braves">Milwaukee Braves</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>.</p>
<p>Martin spent eight years (1962-69) in the Minnesota organization after his retirement as a player. He was a <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scout_%28sports%29.html" title="Scout (sports)">scout</a> from 1962-64, the <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coach_%28baseball%29.html" title="Coach (baseball)">third-base coach</a> of the Twins from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965_in_baseball.html" title="1965 in baseball">1965</a> through mid-June <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_in_baseball.html" title="1968 in baseball">1968</a>, and manager of their AAA affiliate, the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Bears_2464.html" title="Denver Bears">Denver Bears</a>, for the last half of the 1968 campaign. He succeeded <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Ermer_575f.html" title="Cal Ermer">Cal Ermer</a> as Minnesota's big-league manager following the '68 season.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969_in_baseball.html" title="1969 in baseball">1969</a>, Martin's only season as manager of the Twins, he won a division championship in his first season. He was fired after the season following a fight with one of his pitchers, Dave Boswell, and spent the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970_in_baseball.html" title="1970 in baseball">1970</a> season out of baseball.</p>
<p>Martin managed the Tigers from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971_in_baseball.html" title="1971 in baseball">1971</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_in_baseball.html" title="1973 in baseball">1973</a>, taking the team to first place in 1972 but was fired in 1973 for ordering his pitchers to throw at batters.</p>
<p>He then moved to the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Rangers_%28baseball%29_b4f3.html" title="Texas Rangers (baseball)">Texas Rangers</a>, where he took the club from last place to second place in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974_in_baseball.html" title="1974 in baseball">1974</a>, but was fired in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_in_baseball.html" title="1975 in baseball">1975</a>.</p>
<p>He returned to the Yankees for the first of his managerial stints in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_in_baseball.html" title="1975 in baseball">1975</a>, and took the Yankees to the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_World_Series_630f.html" title="1976 World Series">World Series</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_in_baseball.html" title="1976 in baseball">1976</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_in_baseball.html" title="1977 in baseball">1977</a>, winning the 1977 World Series. He feuded publicly with both Yankee owner <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Steinbrenner_891c.html" title="George Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a> and star outfielder <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggie_Jackson_fe23.html" title="Reggie Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a>. He briefly resigned in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978_in_baseball.html" title="1978 in baseball">1978</a> after telling reporters, <i>"They deserve each other. One's a born liar [Jackson], and the other's convicted [Steinbrenner]"</i> (Martin was referring to Steinbrenner's conviction for making illegal donations to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_U.S._presidential_election_695f.html" title="1972 U.S. presidential election">1972</a> election campaign). He returned in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_in_baseball.html" title="1979 in baseball">1979</a>, only to be fired after a fight with a marshmallow salesman.</p>
<p>Martin resurfaced with the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Athletics_6739.html" title="Oakland Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a>, where he perfected a style of play that became known as "Billyball." He won the Western Division title in the split season of <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_in_baseball.html" title="1981 in baseball">1981</a>, swept the Royals in the special division series, and then met up with the Yankees in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_American_League_Championship_Series_d739.html" title="1981 American League Championship Series">1981 ALCS</a> where his A's were swept by the Yankees. Although his early success with the A's led to his designation as the club's <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_manager_%28baseball%29.html" title="General manager (baseball)">general manager</a> — giving him control over the baseball operations of the entire Oakland organization — in 1981, Martin was fired from both positions when the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_in_baseball.html" title="1982 in baseball">1982</a> Athletics plummeted to a 68-94 record. Martin had overused Oakland's young pitchers and they all developed sore arms. He returned to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983_in_baseball.html" title="1983 in baseball">1983</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985_in_baseball.html" title="1985 in baseball">1985</a>, and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_in_baseball.html" title="1988 in baseball">1988</a>, but never for more than one full season.

He was the perfect short-term manager as his competitive fire and daring tactics won over fans, management, and players. This love affair was always brief, especially with the players and management, as his paranoid disdain for authority figures as well as players who dared disagree with him or did not reflect his fiery temperament, were bound to create clubhouse tension and organizational turmoil.</p>
<p>Martin's sparring opponents as a manager also included two traveling secretaries (Minnesota's Howard Fox and Texas' Burt Hawkins) in a fight outside of Howard Wong's in <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomington%2C_MN_412d.html" title="Bloomington, MN">Bloomington, MN</a>; Jack Sears, a fan outside Tiger Stadium; a Chicago cab driver who preferred soccer to baseball; sportswriter Ray Hagar, in a Reno casino; <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshmallow.html" title="Marshmallow">marshmallow</a> salesman Joseph Cooper; two bar patrons, in Anaheim and in Baltimore; and two bouncers in an Arlington topless bar.</p>

The following epitaph by Billy Martin himself appears on the headstone: <i>"I may not have been the greatest Yankee to put on the uniform but I was the proudest."</i></p>
<p>At the time of his death, Martin was yet again getting ready to manage the Yankees for the 1990 season and had begun assembling a coaching staff.</p>

<ul>
<li>Despite their father-son relationship, Martin and Stengel didn't speak for years because Martin blamed his manager for failing to prevent his trade to Kansas City in 1957.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Billy Martin was involved in the 1983 <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Brett_%28baseball%29_6ead.html" title="George Brett (baseball)">George Brett</a> Pine Tar Incident. There is a rule limiting how far up the barrel a batter can put pine tar on his lumber and Brett was in violation of this rule. After Brett hit a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goose_Gossage_4b9d.html" title="Goose Gossage">Goose Gossage</a> pitch for a home run, Martin told home plate ump <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_McClelland_b69b.html" title="Tim McClelland">Tim McClelland</a>, who called Brett out, triggering Brett's meltdown. <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a> president <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_MacPhail_15d2.html" title="Lee MacPhail">Lee MacPhail</a> overturned McClelland's ruling, allowed the home run to stand. Brett's <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas_City_Royals_78c3.html" title="Kansas City Royals">Royals</a> prevailed when the game was resumed. (This passage is credited to <a href="../../../f/o/x/FOX_Sports_5505.html" title="FOX Sports">FOX Sports</a> and sportswriter Kevin Hench -- it is from Hench's October 24, 2006 FoxSports.com article.) Video of the enraged Brett is replayed often on the anniversary date of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_24.html" title="July 24">July 24</a>, and the Pine Tar Game has become part of baseball folklore.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Carew_3f61.html" title="Rod Carew">Rod Carew</a> credits Martin with teaching him how to steal home. Carew did it 7 times in 1969, the only year Martin managed him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When Martin was killed, the media reported that he was a passenger in his <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pickup_truck.html" title="Pickup truck">pickup truck</a>. However, Peter Golenbock, in his book Wild, High, and Tight: The Life and Death of Billy Martin, makes the case that Martin was the driver and that his wife and Reedy covered up the truth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>According to the HBO TV series <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autopsy_%28TV_series%29_2dab.html" title="Autopsy (TV series)">Autopsy</a> <a href="http://www.hbo.com/autopsy/episode/episode_1_billy_martin.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hbo.com/autopsy/episode/episode_1_billy_martin.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, the actual truth as to who was driving the night Martin died rightfully lies at the feet of Reedy. Forensic pathologist Dr. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Baden_e8f1.html" title="Michael Baden">Michael Baden</a> performed the autopsy on Martin and investigated the accident scene, including the pick-up truck Martin died in. The autopsy revealed that Martin's impact injuries were all on the right side, and that hair and other DNA found on the right side of the shattered windshield belonged to Martin, who was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident. The conclusion of the autopsy study was that Reedy, not Martin, was the driver of the pick-up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Steinbrenner_891c.html" title="George Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a> had a habit of firing and re-hiring Martin. (Martin both preceded and succeeded <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Piniella_4bdb.html" title="Lou Piniella">Lou Piniella</a> as the Yankees' manager.) This was lampooned in a beer commercial in which Steinbrenner tells Martin "You're fired!" to which Martin replies "Oh, no, not again!" After Martin's real-life firing and rehiring, the commercial was resurrected, only with Steinbrenner's line redubbed to say "You're <i>hired</i>!"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Martin is mentioned by <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Leary_575f.html" title="Denis Leary">Denis Leary</a> in his comedy special <i><a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Cure_For_Cancer_4d01.html" title="No Cure For Cancer">No Cure For Cancer</a></i>, in which Leary comments "I believe Billy Martin said it best when he said..."<br />
(takes a swig of beer)<br />
"...'Hey, I can drive.'"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>While posing for a baseball card as the manager for the Detroit Tigers in 1972, Martin gave photographers the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_finger.html" title="Middle finger">middle finger</a>. The gesture went unnoticed until after the card's release.</li>
