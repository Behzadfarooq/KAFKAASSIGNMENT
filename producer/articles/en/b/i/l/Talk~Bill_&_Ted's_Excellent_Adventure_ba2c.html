<dd>I notice IMDB gives the date as 1989 as we previously did, and a quick google search for the title and date gives more hits for 1989, but a fair number of 1988s (and a few 1990s). Anyone have more info on that? What are we going by, copyright registration? Premier of first public showing? Also, where is the 1988 date given on the DVD-- in the film credits, on the box, both agree?

<dd>The year goes by release date, which is 1989. Look at <a href="../../../2/0/0/Category%7E2005_films.html" title="Category:2005 films">Category:2005 films</a> or <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_film.html" title="2005 in film">2005 in film</a>. The requirement to be on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_film.html" title="2005 in film">2005 in film</a> is the release date. Wikipedia <i>uses release dates</i>. The mix-up with the dates is adequetly explained in the text. I see insufficient evidence to save the release date was not in 1989 nor that WP isn't based upon release date. The burden of proof is on 64.12.116.7 or anyone else that wants to dish out insults <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_%26_Ted%27s_Excellent_Adventure&amp;diff=15886775&amp;oldid=15885918" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_%26_Ted%27s_Excellent_Adventure&amp;diff=15886775&amp;oldid=15885918" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 23:58, Jun 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However it was apparently originally made for video in 1987, and it could be that it did have a video release prior to its theatrical run.

<dd>For the last time, Cburnett, who cares what any website says? Just leave it as <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, that's the correct year.

<p>I think Tony Sidaway's response is the wisest. I have found release dates of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004CTTA/202-4797314-6916615" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004CTTA/202-4797314-6916615" rel="nofollow">1988</a> and 1989. What I suggest is the following: <b>release date: 1988 (video); 1989 (theatrical). Is this acceptable to everyone? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 01:47, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know that that is correct. I don't see that a video was released in 1988. I presume that before the distributor ran out of money that it was to be released in 1988 on video but was postponed until 1989 when the money was available and released in the theater. I still maintain that 1989 is correct because two reputable sources â€” IMDB &amp; MGM â€” say it as such. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 01:54, Jun 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are other sources that say 1988. Mike has listed them. If it was released February 1989, and released to video first, it would make sense that this was 1988. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 01:57, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC) By the way, the BBC says 1988 too <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A907508" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A907508" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>The dates on the bottom of cases are the copyright year. Is this incorrect? All of the 1988 years that have been provided (the case, amazon, bbc, etc.) only give a year, they never explicitly state what the year is. IMDB &amp; MGM explicitly state that it's the <i>release date</i> as 1989. There's also been no evidence that there was <i>actually</i> a video release in 1988. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 02:05, Jun 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course it is correct that it said <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>.

<dd>No, Mike, you're not understanding me. I'm not questioning if the box actually says 1988 (I never have) but the date on the box doesn't say anything meaningful. The date on the box is the copyright date, which has absolutely nothing to do with the date it was released. The date on wikipedia is not the copyright date, but the release date. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 02:19, Jun 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I have taken it into consideration before this revert war started and especially so after it. I trust IMDB more than Amazon or BBC. I trust MGM more than Amazon, BBC, or IMDB. The issue is not copyright date, which knocks out your third, and final, source.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do you have any other sources other than resellers? Do you have any sources explicitly stating the what the dates are for? Any sources on Reeve's site saying contrary to the two I've linked? So far, I'm at 2 saying release date (IMDB &amp; MGM) and the Mercury confirms they are the theatrical release and the Enquirer confirms that the video release was in 1989. Given the evidence and the <i>source</i> of the evidence, I cannot conclude <i>anything</i> was released in 1988:
<ul>
<li>especially since the New York Daily says in Sep 1988 that nothing has been released.</li>
<li>The distributor who <i>released</i> the film says 1989.</li>
<li>The lead <i>actor</i> indirectly supports 1989 by having articles on his site that say it.</li>
</ul>

<dd>What else do you have for me to consider? <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 03:02, Jun 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In light of no credible evidence to counter that which I have shown, I move that the page be unprotected and the date be changed to 1989 to reflect the release date (which is what wikipedia uses). All references on <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_in_film.html" title="1988 in film">1988 in film</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_in_film.html" title="1989 in film">1989 in film</a>, etc. be changed back to 1989. Also edit the article to discuss that the copyright date is 1988 and that it appears on the DVD case (<i>it is not the release date</i>).</p>
<p>Are there any objections to this? Mike? Danny? If there are, I expect that you will have more convincing evidence that the distributor is verifyably wrong. Weyes has interjected (thanks, BTW) that he finds my evidence compelling. Tony, can I assume you agree? Anyone else?</p>

I went to see Bill and Ted on it's theatrical release date which was February 1989 when I lived in Orlando Fl at the time but as long as I can remember, movies that are put out in Janurary and February were normally credited to the previous year, in the 1970's this was true up to April but think February is the cutoff date from the previous year. ~SSM</p>

<p>When giving the 'lineup' of the historical characters in the plot synopsis, the aliases given to Bill's mom are listed with them. Perhaps these should be moved elsewhere, or better explained? As-written, it implies they don't know what half of the characters are called. Their errors in pronunciation are fine, but the section of the synopsis as written is just clunky.--<a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythicFox_93c0.html" title="User:MythicFox">MythicFox</a> 04:33, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>the trivia "During the presentation, Abraham Lincoln's character opens his speech saying "Four score and seven minutes ago..." which means 87 minutes ago, this scene happens 87 minutes into the movie." is incorrect. On the DVD release, it happens exactly 80 minutes into the movie.</p>

<p>Removed the citation needed about the time travel machine in bill and ted having a different interior to the tardis. this is too commonly well known to warrant a citation, and those who are unfamiliar with doctor who can follow the tardis link to the wikipedia article anyways.</p>

<p>I deleted the following sentence because it is written in an absurdly obtuse and pretentious style:</p>
<p>"The abundance of flagrant macroscopic time travel flouts the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronology_protection_conjecture.html" title="Chronology protection conjecture">chronology protection conjecture</a>, which one may handle via <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspension_of_disbelief.html" title="Suspension of disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a>."</p>
<p>When considering a literary work that deals with time travel, one must necessarily suspend one's belief. Thus, the quoted sentence is a tautology, and does not conform to encyclopedic standards.<small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.253.55.54 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.253.55.54_53f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.253.55.54">contribs</a>) 16:15, 28 January 2007.</small></p>
<p>While obtuse and pretentious, the sentence is not a tautology as suspension of disbelief is <b>not</b> inherently required for all films about time travel as time travel is possible if improbable, as are most things. Moreover, the reference to the chronology protection conjecture is perfectly relevant even if sentence had been a tautology. However, the sentence is most likely original research, and so should never have been submitted.21:04, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Anybody have any idea how to work in a reference to said musical (best page I've found about it is <a href="http://www.billandted.org/musicalhome.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.billandted.org/musicalhome.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>)? "In October 1998, Dean Collinson would win the Vivien Ellis Award for Best New Musical Composer for the music to Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Musical Adventure." Sounds notable enough to at least mention, even if there isn't enough material for its own article. Sukael 14:43, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the following bit of trivia is incorrect</p>
<p>'The band Primus appears on stage directly prior to Bill &amp; Ted's performance with Wild Stallions.'</p>
<p>I can only recall Primus actually appearing in Bogus Journey. I haven't deleted it myself because chances are high that I've forgotten something. Spugmeister 16:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
