<p><b>Wilhelmus Nicholaas Theodore Marie "Bill" Vander Zalm</b> (born <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_29.html" title="May 29">May 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/o/Noordwijkerhout.html" title="Noordwijkerhout">Noordwijkerhout</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Holland_8dc5.html" title="South Holland">South Holland</a>)<a href="http://encyclopediecanadienne.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTA0008312" class="external autonumber" title="http://encyclopediecanadienne.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=M1ARTA0008312" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> is a politician and entrepreneur in <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. He was the 28th <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_Columbia_premiers_a2b0.html" title="List of British Columbia premiers">Premier of British Columbia</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>.</p>
<p>He was born and raised in the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and emigrated to Canada after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, settling in the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraser_Valley_9012.html" title="Fraser Valley">Fraser Valley</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>. After leaving high school, he sold <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulip.html" title="Tulip">tulip</a> bulbs and ultimately established himself in the nursery and gardening business and also invested in <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_estate.html" title="Real estate">real estate</a>.</p>
<p>Vander Zalm was elected <a href="../../../a/l/d/Alderman.html" title="Alderman">alderman</a> of <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey%2C_British_Columbia_8970.html" title="Surrey, British Columbia">Surrey</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>, and served as the city's <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayor.html" title="Mayor">mayor</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>. His tenure was marked by his crackdown on welfare "deadbeats" (at the time, welfare in BC was a municipal responsibility). He became widely known almost overnight for his off the cuff remark that all welfare recipients ought to be given a shovel and put to work.</p>
<p>Vander Zalm was originally a supporter of both the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_1b0c.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada">Liberal Party of Canada</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_Liberal_Party_c52f.html" title="British Columbia Liberal Party">British Columbia Liberal Party</a>. He sought election to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_House_of_Commons_f3ab.html" title="Canadian House of Commons">Canadian House of Commons</a> in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_federal_election%2C_1968.html" title="Canadian federal election, 1968">1968 federal election</a> as a Liberal from Surrey. He lost by 5,000 votes. He was also a candidate at the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_Liberal_Party_leadership_conventions_cce0.html" title="British Columbia Liberal Party leadership conventions">provincial Liberal leadership convention</a>, where he lost to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Anderson_%28Canadian_politician%29_9b80.html" title="David Anderson (Canadian politician)">David Anderson</a>. He joined the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_Social_Credit_Party_eebe.html" title="British Columbia Social Credit Party">British Columbia Social Credit Party</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>.</p>
<p>He was first elected to the <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislative_Assembly_of_British_Columbia_80a1.html" title="Legislative Assembly of British Columbia">Legislative Assembly of British Columbia</a> in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_general_election%2C_1975_c02c.html" title="British Columbia general election, 1975">1975 election</a>, in which Social Credit won back power after a three-year hiatus. He served in the cabinet of Premier <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_R._Bennett_8f06.html" title="William R. Bennett">Bill Bennett</a> as Minister of Human Resources from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, where he continued his crusade against <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welfare_fraud.html" title="Welfare fraud">welfare fraud</a>. He also served as Minister of Municipal Affairs from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a> and as Minister of Education from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>. He was forced from Cabinet in 1983 after he called Bennett and his ministers "gutless".</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a>, he bought Fantasy Garden World, a theme park. That same year, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, as the candidate for the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Partisan_Association_125d.html" title="Non-Partisan Association">Non-Partisan Association</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, Bennett announced he was retiring. Vander Zalm attracted considerable attention as he considered whether he would run for the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_Social_Credit_Party_leadership_conventions_d3a8.html" title="British Columbia Social Credit Party leadership conventions">leadership of the Social Credit Party</a>. He generated more press out of the race than the other candidates did in it. At the party's convention in <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistler%2C_British_Columbia_6b43.html" title="Whistler, British Columbia">Whistler, British Columbia</a>, he won the leadership easily and became premier just a month before the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_general_election%2C_1986_0b7b.html" title="British Columbia general election, 1986">1986 election</a></p>
<p>During the campaign, "Vandermania" swept BC, and the Socreds easily won another term over the opposition <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_of_British_Columbia_0bcb.html" title="New Democratic Party of British Columbia">New Democratic Party</a>. Bill and his wife, Lillian, attracted public adoration with their high-voltage smiles, positivity and charisma.</p>
<p>The party and its leader had no public plan for when they were elected for the long term. However, the main clear goal was to have a "fresh start" after the confrontational Bennett years.</p>
<p>Once elected with a majority, Vander Zalm selected his cabinet, mostly backbenchers who had languished under Bill Bennett. Oddly, Vander Zalm decided to release the normally secret list of cabinet appointments to two <i><a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver_Sun_f28c.html" title="Vancouver Sun">Vancouver Sun</a></i> reporters hours before the official announcement was to be made.</p>
<p>The Social Credit Party had been a tenuous alliance between supporters of the federal Liberals, urban fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives in the province's Bible Belt. Fiscal conservatives had dominated the party for over a decade, but under Vander Zalm social conservatives took control. Vander Zalm himself was a social conservative, and his government once tried to cut public funding for abortions that were not medically necessary. The resulting uproar forced Vander Zalm to drop the program. His government also had a confrontational relationship with labour unions.</p>
<p>As well, he appointed David Poole, a close friend, to be his "Principal Secretary". Before resigning in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, Poole had become the second most powerful person in the province despite never having been elected. This naturally attracted the anger of numerous cabinet ministers, such as <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grace_McCarthy_2615.html" title="Grace McCarthy">Grace McCarthy</a>, an influential SoCred MLA who resigned in protest from Vander Zalm's cabinet in 1988.</p>

<p>He was also accused of influence peddling with his close friend Peter Toigo in the sale of the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expo_86.html" title="Expo 86">Expo 86</a> site.</p>
<p>Vander Zalm became embroiled in a conflict of interest controversy over the sale of his Fantasy Gardens flower garden and theme park. The conflict of interest arose because the Taiwanese buyer, Tan Yu, was provided VIP treatment and lunch with the <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant-Governor_0e59.html" title="Lieutenant-Governor">Lieutenant-Governor</a> prior to the sale. Vander Zalm claimed that control over the theme park was his wife's responsibility.</p>
<p>It was proven in BC Supreme Court that he was, in fact, intimately involved in the sale. The court case implied that Vander Zalm used his position as premier to promote his own business transactions by gaining access to cabinet ministers for Tan Yu and himself. Vander Zalm was forced to resign over the scandal in 1991. He was succeeded as Premier of BC by <a href="../../../r/i/t/Rita_Johnston_6656.html" title="Rita Johnston">Rita Johnston</a>. In the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_general_election%2C_1991_41f7.html" title="British Columbia general election, 1991">British Columbia general election, 1991</a>, the party was reduced to 7 seats, and has not won a seat in any election since.</p>
<p>After many years out of the spotlight, Vander Zalm again took a stab at office by running in Delta-South in a by-election in 1999 for the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_Reform_Party_39a6.html" title="British Columbia Reform Party">British Columbia Reform Party</a>, which had been formed after the Social Credit Party had collapsed. This by-election was notable for many reasons, including the incredibly low support the governing NDP received (coming in fourth), and marking the absolute low point for the NDP's electoral support. NDP candidate Richard Tones received just 2.44% of the vote. Vander Zalm finished second with 32.91% of the vote to Liberal Val Roddick who received 59.63%. Vander Zalm retired from politics and now resides in Surrey.</p>
<p>Since his retirement, he has appeared in advertisements, including TV spots for <a href="../../../i/c/b/ICBC_66f7.html" title="ICBC">ICBC</a> and "Way to Grow" garden supplements.</p>
<p>Curiously, (and trivially) Vander Zalm is a Dutch name, meaning from the salmon.</p>
