<hr />
<p><a href="../../../n/i/n/Nina_Simone_5158.html" title="Nina Simone">Nina Simone</a>, although I love her, is (how do I say) full of it. She's the only other person, besides Holiday, to credibly sing "Strange Fruit". That alone would invoke comparison.</p>
<p>If we want to compare Holiday to other singers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holiday is similar to <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Armstrong_a573.html" title="Louis Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> because she was able to do so much with such a poor instrument.</li>
<li>Holiday is also similar to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Parker_db29.html" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chet_Baker_1dfc.html" title="Chet Baker">Chet Baker</a> in that she was able to be a world class artist in spite of a serious addiction.</li>
<li>Holiday probably should also be compared to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinatra_d0f7.html" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> for the way they both master phrasing in support of story telling.</li>
<li>And maybe <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edith_Piaf_3705.html" title="Edith Piaf">Edith Piaf</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Cohen_d206.html" title="Leonard Cohen">Leonard Cohen</a>, or <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Brel_c77d.html" title="Jacques Brel">Jacques Brel</a> for the ability to express painful emotion through song.</li>

<p>Sinatra admitted being influenced by Holliday, and he was an enthusiastic fan and supporter of her, helping to get her important engagements in the later part of her life when nightclub owners often were scared to hire her due to her reputation as a drug addict.</p>
<hr />
<p>Noticed that my contribution on Nina Simone/Billy Holiday comparison got removed. Sorry, I'm new here, should have known to first take it to discussion, and I understand that by adding the piece to trivia other comparisons would have to follow.</p>
<p>I do think this comparison is an exceptional one because Nina refused such a compliment, even though she recorded a lot of billy holiday's songs and got a lot of credit for her recordings. But than again as stated, would be better in Nina's own section.</p>
<p>I find the first message-piece at the top of this heading (<a href="../../../n/i/n/Nina_Simone_5158.html" title="Nina Simone">Nina Simone</a> rejected all comparisons...) much better than my own unverified bit, so if you want to create a 'comparisons' heading after all, use that! <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcel_flaubert_6eea.html" title="User:Marcel flaubert">Marcel flaubert</a> 09:26, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my effort to merge the now-deleted list from the article <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_icon.html" title="Gay icon">Gay icon</a> to the Gay icons category, I have added this page to the category. I engaged in this effort as a "human script", adding everyone from the list to the category, bypassing the fact-checking stage. That is what I am relying on you to do.

<p>I think this connection would be <i>very</i> difficult to prove. I mean, I'm sure Holiday "has a significant following among the gay community," but to be fair, she has a significant following, period; how would it be possible to show she is specifically popular among gays? <a href="../../../u/t/t/User%7EUttaddmb_4f87.html" title="User:Uttaddmb">Uttaddmb</a> 04:58, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know if this is relevant, or potentially insulting, but I could see her probable bisexuality and "gutsiness"(for lack of a better word) possibly making her a gay icon along with being a generally popular figure.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<dd>Holiday definitely wasn't a lesbian. Actually, I believe she had relations with both men and women. I don't know if we can call her bisexual though, since all of her affairs with women took place during especially difficult times in her life. I know a lot of straight guys who have slept with men by accident after a night of heavy drinking. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakeHaMo_bcec.html" title="User:JakeHaMo">JakeHaMo</a> 08:38, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>if she had a 'little more than an octave', and by the end of her life her voice was battered by substance abuse, then why is she and her art so memorable? I always believed that having a unique, 'musically' impressive voice is not enough. Billie Holday's emotional availability and really astounding interpretation of any song she sung made her a hallmark in the history of modern American and world music. I read in some encyclopedia, I can't remember which one was it, that she introduced a new technique in singing and approaching a song that was unprecedented by women singers, and especially african-american singers. And I believe that is entirely true. In a very funny, ironical way she can be compared to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Callas_86c0.html" title="Maria Callas">Maria Callas</a>, rather than <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nina_Simone_5158.html" title="Nina Simone">Nina Simone</a>. As much as Nina Simone would have loved to be compared to Maria Callas [I am not saying that Nina Simone lacks the talent or is not as great as Callas was] the comparison makes more sense if compared to Billie Holiday. Callas is dubbed by musicians and many Opera fans to have a 'bad voice', and even some go to the extent that she would in many of her songs sing off-key [although thats not very likely but anyways], what again is so remarkable about Callas is her interpretation. Callas dramatic, heart-wrenching performances captured anyone who came across her songs/arias. Her emotional intensity and 'rare' skill to actually 'act' the role she is singing, was something special and rare among female Opera singers [there are many Opera singers with great voices but poor skills of interpretation, and that gave Callas a very siginificant advantage], which made Callas such a legend. I remember I once read a quote for her, and it was about someone comparing to another Opera singer who has a much better voice, and she said 'she might have [i don't which kind of violin, but the best there is,as an insttument of voice], I have a regualr violin but I have <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganini.html" title="Paganini">Paganini</a> playing', I think that sums it up, her voice might have been 'modest' and not very exceptional, very similar to Holiday's case, but she had the 'spirit' others lacked. Something that listeners to Holiday's music still feel today. One always have the feeling, when he/she listens to Billie Holiday, that this song or note was just sung two seconds ago, that the feeling is really felt. It sounds alive, very heart-felt. <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Vaughan_ac88.html" title="Sarah Vaughan">Sarah Vaughan</a> had an exceptional, divine voice [i think that she is one of best voice to grace the musical scene for the past 100 years], and she never enjoyed the popularity and the fascination Holiday did. [disregarding her, Billie Holiday that is, infamous personal life which might have been interesting for gossip lines 40 years ago, but now what remains is just the music and that is what lives on] people were impressed by the beauty of Vaughan voice, but they were stunned by the emotional intensity of Holiday Ez212 00:27, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Billie Holiday used drugs all her life. I do not believe she would be the same musician without it, just the same as if she were born a rich white kid! Her music comes from her experiences and her state of mind, which in most cases (as she seems to show in “Lady Sings the Blues") to be filled with pain and experience...she seems road weary if you will. Being a professional musician back then was a rough, poor, drugged experience. The music of the era seems to reflect this. I mean...what about Charlie Parker’s “Moose the Mooche”? It was about a guy that mooched off his stash.</p>
<p>As far as her musical technical ability, so what! She’s great! She has more style in her fingernail than many other musicians that have the ability. (I believe that Chet Baker sounded best on his horn when he had his teeth knocked out in prison.)</p>
<p>I love her music...she’s going to last forever&#160;:) 68.204.163.146 02:48, 13 January 2006 (UTC)Ryan</p>

<p>In the section, "Later Life and Death", it says, "It is unclear who first introduced Holiday to the drug, but there is consensus from historians and contemporaneous sources that she began intravenous use sometime around 1940." In the third paragraph, it says, "She married trombonist Jimmy Monroe (a small drug dealer that introduced her to opium and heroin) on August 25, 1941." If it unclear who introduced Holiday to heroin, perhaps the speculation on Monroe should be dropped.</p>

It's an item of trivia, which by definition can be irrelevant, uninteresting and verging on the ridiculous.</p>
<p>I have not seen the America's Top Model episode where this occurred since I don't watch the show. However I don't see the harm in keeping it in, particularly if it occurred on the show. If anything, the inclusion of this information shows that the memory of Billie Holiday has penetrated a show whose generation grew up more than 50 years after her death.

<p>I took the entire trivia section out of the article. I kept everything that I thought was important to the article or the reader's understanding of Miss Holiday. Some things (like the anecdote about Lester Young's death, the gardenia thing and the recently-added unsourced claim about Frank Sinatra) just didn't seem important or necessary to the article's success, so I got rid of them. I would support their re-addition to the article if we can smoothly merge them in, but having a "miscellaneous facts" addendum is quite unencyclopedic and ultimately is totally unnecessary. Comments are welcome; in fact, please comment before you revert or change something regarding this edit. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingCal_c1c8.html" title="User:SingCal">SingCal</a> 10:26, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Many pages like this have a section for trivia, small snippets of interesting information, and also where Billie Holiday is referenced in modern culture. For example, Regina Spektor wrote a song about Billie Holiday called "Lady" - that's a reference that I think should be mentioned, just as it is mentioned in James Ensor's biography that They Might Be Giants wrote a song about him.</p>

<p><br />
I agree, but I think that we can do our best to integrate that information so that there's no specific "trivia" section. Many pages have a Cultural References section which might do well for this article's purposes if there are enough instances found. As for this Regina Spektor song, there's already a paragraph discussing tributes made by other artists, and it seems like that would be a fine place for it. It may be worth creating an "Influences and Tributes" section or something to that effect so these are better recognized. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingCal_c1c8.html" title="User:SingCal">SingCal</a> 19:23, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, trivia sections are not ideal ways of placing information -- important points should be incorporated into the text of the article. If there's no logical place to add any certain bit of trivia, then it probably doesn't belong in the article at all. Remember that an encyclopedia is a broad-brush overview of a topic, not every scrap of information in existence. — <a href="../../../e/2E/_/User%7EE._Ripley_4fc7.html" title="User:E.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBillie_Holiday_f39a.html" title="Edit section: Discography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Discography</span></h2>
<p>I think the discography in this article is excessive. It includes some albums more than once ("Billie's Blues" is listed at least 4 times), it includes multiple versions of the same album ("Quintessential Volume 1" and "Quintessential Volumes 1, 2, and 3 Box Set"), and I think it's much too long. I also think the distinction between US releases and imports is much less important today, when you can buy a CD online, than it may have been when record stores had limited selections of LPs and imports were hard to find.<br />
I suggest that we take a cue from the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Parker_db29.html" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie Parker</a> article. The discography in the main article was shortened to a description of the three labels for which he made most of his recordings and a small number of important live recordings. The rest of the discography was moved to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Parker_Discography_d17b.html" title="Charlie Parker Discography">Charlie Parker Discography</a>, which mentions the important collections of studio recordings and has a longer list of live recordings.<br />
For Holiday, we could cut out the inferior "Quintessential" series and mention the complete Columbia box and one or two good compilations of her Columbia period. Ditto for Commodore, Decca, and Verve. We might mention some of the "complete recording" series that have been coming out in Europe, such as the "Masters of Jazz" series, but there's no need to mention Volumes 4, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 14 (what does Wikipedia have against the other volumes?).<br />
What do others think? — <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalik_Shabazz_a2fa.html" title="User:Malik Shabazz">Malik Shabazz</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalik_Shabazz_ad2e.html" title="User talk:Malik Shabazz">Talk</a> 23:42, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I completely agree that Billie's discography here is excessive and that it should suffice to mention a couple of comprehensive multi-CD sets. Christiern Albertson 21:16, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Didn't the article use to contain a mention of Billie Holiday's affairs with other women? Did someone delete it and if so why? It's common knowledge I believe and quite important in providing a complete picture of her. Could someone put this back in please?

<p>I am suprised that Gloomy Sunday was not mentioned in the article.

<dd>On a serious note, an article like this can only mention so many songs. If you consider "Gloomy Sunday" significant enough to Holiday's career to mention it, go ahead and add it. To me, "Lover Man" (which isn't mentioned in the article either) was a much more significant song in her career. But <a href="../../../b/e/_/WP%7EBE_BOLD_d937.html" title="WP:BE BOLD">be bold</a> and put it in there if you think it should be mentioned.</dd>

<dd>PS - FYI: It's not a big deal, but new comments are usually added to the bottom of a Talk page, not the top. — <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalik_Shabazz_a2fa.html" title="User:Malik Shabazz">Malik Shabazz</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalik_Shabazz_ad2e.html" title="User talk:Malik Shabazz">Talk</a> 22:50, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
