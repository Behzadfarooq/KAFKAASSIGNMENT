<p>I think this disambiguation page should be located at Bill O'Reilly (disambiguation) and that Bill O'Reilly (commentator) should be moved to this page - the cricket player is not as notable, is linked on 4 pages (not including lists and user pages). The talk show host is linked on over 40 articles (again not including lists, user pages and redirects) and is the person most people would be looking for if they entered Bill O'Reilly in a search - we could include a line at the top referring to the cricket player. <small><a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User%7ETr%C3%B6del_e177.html" title="User:Trödel">Trödel</a>|<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#C000C0">talk</font></a></small> 16:48, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cricket is the second most popular spectator sport on Earth and the Aussie bowler <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28cricketer%29_8189.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)">Bill O'Reilly</a> is a legend, especially given his considerable media work after he finished playing. For your information, there are more cricket fans in India alone than there are <i>people</i> in America. Some American TV "personality" who is "here today, gone tomorrow" is simply not recognised outside the country that thinks it is the centre of the universe. It's about time Americans realised that there is a huge world, the real world, outside their country. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">Jack</a> 10:05, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cricket is "the second most popular spectator sport on Earth"? That's a laughably Anglocentric view. Cricket is played in Britain and a handful of her former colonies. <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">Basketball</a> is played in virtually every country of the Americas--and is particularly popular in the United States, Brazil, and Argentina (combined population roughly 530 million)--Continental Europe (including 150 million-strong Russia), Africa, and Eastern Asia. And before you play the tired "But India has a population of 1.1 billion and I talked to this IT guy and he says it's really popular there!" argument, let me remind you that China--a basketball-mad country--has 1.3 billion people, precisely zero of whom care about cricket. A few Americans might think their country is the whole world, but many more Englishmen think their country is the whole world minus America. 151.205.96.146 21:06, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jack, you must <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. Words and phrases such as 'absolute rubbish' and 'two-bit' don't help us have a rational discussion at all.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, It's never clear to me how the figures about the number of Indian cricket fans are arrived at. There are about four times as many people in India as there are in the United States (1,080,264,388 to 296,800,000 per Wikipedia's 2005 estimates) so to a zeroth order approximation it's probably a fair enough statement -- but do you have any actual figures? --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 10:17, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologise for breaching good faith and have removed the offending phrases. I don't have actual figures but I have a lot of contacts in India through my IT work and they confirm that cricket is incredibly popular there, with huge numbers of fans in every village and city. One man told me that he would estimate a third of the population are cricket fans and that would exceed the total population of the USA. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">Jack</a> 10:34, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, if you look at both pages, the original proposer withdrew the nomination. I'm not sure why the debate took place on two pages — that seems like a mistake — but in any case it was rejected here and had no consensus over on the commentator's page, so it didn't make any difference. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStephen_Turner_5111.html" title="User talk:Stephen Turner">Talk</a>) 08:53, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The cricketeer is nowhere near as notable as the controversial talk show host, and a disambiguation page is good enough. Google for 'Bill O'Reilly FOX News' receives 625,000 results; 'Bill O'Reilly Cricket' receives 41,200 results. I would be bold and move myself, but I'm afraid that doing so might not be possible due to page histories, etc. I am requesting this page be moved to <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28disambiguation%29_6da1.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (disambiguation)">Bill O'Reilly (disambiguation)</a>, and have <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_c07d.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (commentator)">Bill O'Reilly (commentator)</a> be moved here.</p>

<dd>I disagree with your assertion that the commentator is any more notable than the cricketer. This is almost certainly true within the boundaries of the United States, but I would contest that the opposite is true in many other English-speaking territories (the UK, Australia, India, etc.). I would expect many people outside of the US never to have heard of Bill O'Reilly (commentator), whereas Bill O'Reilly (cricketer) is widely notable in those countries as one of the best <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg_spin.html" title="Leg spin">leg spinners</a> ever. Don't forget that this is an international encyclopaedia, not just an American one. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> 19:02, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I disagree. I have never heard of the commentator, but know of the cricketer. --Q 19:29, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I completely disagree. As I said above, there are more cricket fans in India alone than there are people in America. <b>And I have just carried out a little test.</b> I contacted a pal of mine in Bangalore who was contracting in England a couple of years ago. Like most Indians, he is crazy about cricket. Without any prompting, I asked him if the name "Bill O'Reilly" means anything to him. He immediately said: "Tiger O'Reilly? Yes, what a bowler he must have been." I then asked him if he knew of anyone else with the name. He thought for quite a while and said: "No, I don't think so." I told him there is an American TV show presenter and he laughed his head off. He said something to the effect that people in India have better things to do than be interested in American TV personalities. I rest my case. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">Jack</a> 10:29, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am an Indian and have been following this ....well about the no.of cricket fans in India....well One thing for sure you can count the no.of non cricket fans can be finger counted,and the rest...well you guessed it-- cricket fans.And about the obnoxious Bill Oreilly,i never heard about him until I came to the US</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>THe <i>test</i> is pretty weak. If you call a fanatical cricket fan and ask who bill oreilly is and discover hes heard of the cricketer its confirming the obvious. As for the personal testimony I would still bet he visits the Bill Oreilly (commentator) site more than he does the cricketer . Mrdthree 15:00, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the cricketer or the commentator better-known? I have no idea (server logs or something would be nice, if we could check out which is more visited). But either way, a disambiguation page to disambig only two pages is entirely pointless. Rather, this should redirect to one of the two Bill O'Reillys, and both should make use of an <a href="../../../o/t/h/Template%7EOtheruses_templates_7c2e.html" title="Template:Otheruses templates">otheruses template</a>. Thus, if someone goes to Bill O'Reilly, there's a 50% chance they'll get to the right page immediately, and a 50% chance they'll have to click once to get to their destination; as it is now, there's a 100% chance that they have to click once to get to their destination. Let's pick one and go with it—either one will improve our average clickthrough time. Can we agree on that? —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 19:30, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I disagree. I think where it's not clear what the primary meaning is, a disambiguation page is appropriate even where there are only two articles, because a disambiguation link is more subtle than a disambiguation page. It also leads to fewer arguments.</dd>

<dd>I also think you don't need an "otheruses" template on an article with an already-disambiguated title "(cricketer)" or "(commentator)", because no-one is going to reach the wrong one, so I removed the ones you added, sorry!</dd>

<dd>The Bill Oreilly cricketeer page is barely used. No one has discussed anything on the page since it was made. It averages about one edit per month (fine 1.1).The bill oreilly commentator page is used by hundreds or thousands and edited by dozens daily. Its inconvenient to have to move through a disambiguation page that is useful to only a couple people per day. As for michael moore, you are correct that in the United States he is more well known, but that is only because we never heard of the former prime minister of New Zealand or the UK politician, etc. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 17:38, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apparently some say that Bill O'Reilly is unrecognized outside the US, but he shows up as the first hit on local google pages(meaning pages based in that country) on most every english speaking nation except australia, there it depends on whether you write bill o'reilly or bill oreilly.

<dd>As has been pointed out before innumerable times, Googlecounting is pretty pointless at the best of times and almost completely useless in this particular case: it's self-evident that a controversial political commentator of the present day is going to get more hits than a cricketer from the early twentieth century, however famous. However, this doesn't make the cricketer any less notable as a figure than the commentator. --ⁿɡ͡b <a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Nick Boalch</a><span style="padding: 0 0.1em;">\</span><sup style="font-size: 70%;"><a href="../../../n/g/b/User_talk%7ENgb_2abf.html" title="User talk:Ngb">talk</a></sup> 22:01, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let's start with the basic principles here. The entire idea of responding intelligently to search queries is to try returning the page that as many readers as possible will want. If the two O'Reilly's are equally notable, then fifty percent will want one page, and fifty percent the other. But clearly, zero percent of people who type in "Bill O'Reilly" are looking for this page, which has no useful info on <i>any</i> O'Reilly, so redirecting to <i>either</i> would be better than this page's existence.

(B) opponents reject the move either because (1) there is not sufficient difference in popular interest to justify reprioritizing the dab page and the commentators page; or (2)they believe figurea with lasting notability and the same name must retain a dab page to link to the articles (regardless of the interest level or number of searches). <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 05:33, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Had anyone suggested I should look at Bill O'Reilly's page I would have assumed the cricketer was being referred to. Now I know there is a US commentator of that name, I think it's fair there should be a dab page. And I can't quite see this why should be at all controversial: this is an encyclopedia, not a competition for primacy in some abstract and unprovable notion of notability. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> 16:14, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>The issue is this. Currently, if you're looking for the cricketer, you have to click an extra time to get where you want, because there's a disambig page. If we redirect to the commentator and you're looking for the cricketer, you'll still have to click exactly one time. But someone looking for the commentator won't have to make that click. That's one less page load for every such person, which can be several seconds on slow days. So we should redirect to one or the other: nobody loses anything, but it's significantly more convenient for some people (those who want to go to the redirectee). It's win-win.</p>
<p>So why redirect to the commentator instead of to the cricketer? Well, the commentator is much more controversial, and so anything like edit count or talk page size has to be viewed with caution, but on the other hand, that very controversial nature means that more people will probably want the commentator's talk page. People probably get into arguments about something the commentator said last Wednesday all the time and go to Wikipedia to resolve their argument or get other details or whatever; while I'm sure there are many cricket fans who do the same, all available evidence suggests that the commentator probably gets more views than the cricketer: if not a hundred times more, then ten or five or two or 1.2, but very unlikely to be less.</p>
<p>On the balance, then, I see no reason to keep this page altogether, and given that we redirect to one or the other, the commentator seems to be the better choice. —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simetrical_1b33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simetrical">contribs</a>) 19:13, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As you know from our previous discussions, I disagree with your argument that there should never be a disambiguation page with only two links; let me explain why. You can use exactly the same argument to show that we should never have any disambiguation pages at all. If there were three BO'Rs, you choose one as the primary one and have two links at the top of the page, and still save time for one third of the people. Or if there were four BO'Rs, you could save time for one quarter of the people by doing away with the disambiguation page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This conclusion is wrong though. Disambiguation pages are of course useful, and I think they're still useful even if there are only two meanings, where it's not clear which is the primary meaning. This is because disambiguation pages are slightly better than disambiguation links, for the people who are forced to follow an extra link. So if one meaning is primary, a disambiguation link at the top of the page is suitable. If the meanings are roughly equal, a disambiguation page is the right answer. That way we serve all constituencies equally, <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">avoid systematic bias</a>, and <a href="../../../e/d/i/WP%7EEDITWAR_b4ad.html" title="WP:EDITWAR">avoid edit wars</a>.</dd>

<dd>Yes, we disagree. My answer to the suggestion that any number of pages could be hatnoted is that hatnotes become annoying and obtrusive if they get to be too long. {{<a href="../../../t/w/o/Template%7ETwo_other_uses_9ddc.html" title="Template:Two other uses">two other uses</a>}} should be about the limit; beyond that a separate disambig page is necessary. Once that happens, <i>two</i> extra clicks are necessary for anyone getting redirected but not wanting the target: they actually do suffer greater inconvenience, which I don't agree that they do here. Clicking a hatnote is no different to me than clicking a disambig page link.

<li>I'm not sure I understood the reasoning for 'oppose' since your arguments seem to support the move. The proposal was to make the "Bill O'Reilly" page simply point to the commentator. There would still be a page on the cricketer and a disambiguation link on the O'Reilly page. To use your Paris Hilton example, there is no disambiguation page for her so I don't know how it applies. When people type in "Paris Hilton" it is overwhelmingly to find info on the person that Wikipedia points to. THe same is true for Bill O'Reilly, except Wikipedia points to a disambiguation page instead of the commentator. The vast majority of people who type in "Bill O'Reilly" are looking for the commentator so this change is to eliminate one page of redirection for the overwhelming majority. This is not a vote to delete the page on any "Bill O'Reilly". Both of the Bill O'Reilly's in Wikipedia have encyclopaedic value. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 08:30, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is precisely my argument: since both O'Reillys have encyclopaedic value, and it's difficult to decide which is 'more notable', the present disambiguation situation is the proper one. My Paris Hilton example is simply to show that raw number of Google hits don't equate to long-term notability: she has many more Google hits than other figures who have had much more influence on the world. Bill O'Reilly the commentator has more hits than Bill O'Reilly the cricketer not because he is 'more notable' put because he is a highly controversial present-day figure. --ⁿɡ͡b <a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Nick Boalch</a><span style="padding: 0 0.1em;">\</span><sup style="font-size: 70%;"><a href="../../../n/g/b/User_talk%7ENgb_2abf.html" title="User talk:Ngb">talk</a></sup> 09:55, 22 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Disambiguation is a convenience for searchers. Disambiguation becomes a inconvenience when it is simply an extra step for people to take. Notability is fine, but interest is also important. Fans of the commentator and his opponents frequently access his page. Cricket fans rearely access tiger oreillys page and soome of the cricket fans defending the notability of tiger oerilly will or have never used his page. If you make a yearly pilgrimmage to the cricketers webpage, do you really need a disambiguation page as opposed to a link from teh commentators page.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 00:12, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No - disambiguation is primarily to resolve ambiguity where the same word or phrase is the natural title for articles on different topics.

<dd>How so? The commentator is on the air every day in front of millions of people, gets more google hits and his article more edits. We need to think of our readers here. What will our readers be looking for when they come here? Are our readers more likely to look for the commentator or the cricketier? Google hits, TV air time, and yes being controversial and alive make the commentator more likely to be searched for by out readers. Thus we should make things more convenient for our readers and move the commentator to "Bill O'Reily" w/ a link to the cricketier at the top of the page.

<p>I think it would be useful to add a brief description illustrating the respective Bill O'Reilly's notability. First, it may help explain why we have this as a disambiguation page (both are pretty notable in their field). Second, it is clear that most visitors to this page have only heard of one of the two Bill O'Reillys here - saying "hang on, there is another pretty notable one" is a perfectly good thing to say, and may encourage readers to browse the one less familiar to them too, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 18:46, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="../../../d/a/b/MOS%7EDAB_1509.html" title="MOS:DAB">MOS:DAB</a> is quite explicit that "the description associated with a link should be kept to a minimum, just sufficient to allow the reader to find the correct link". I don't see any reason to break that here.</li>
<li>It's unbalanced because it justifies the cricketer without having a parallel justification for the commentator.</li>
<li>It's liable to lead to inflation as each side justifies their own man; and edit wars in the description of the commentator. (I think that's the reason for the above guidance in <a href="../../../d/a/b/MOS%7EDAB_1509.html" title="MOS:DAB">MOS:DAB</a>, and it's a definite danger in a figure as controversial as the commentator).</li>
<li>"Australian Cricket Hall of Fame" sounds like a pretty pathetic justification for the cricketer ("what, he didn't even make the actual Cricket Hall of Fame?")</li>

<dd>Please would you let us know your criteria for deciding that a US TV commentator is "infinitely" more "notable" that an Australian international sportperson.

<dd>You have it the other way around. The commentator is well known in other countries where his broadcasts reach, including New Zealand, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, and Australia among others. The cricketeer has failed to achieve major notability outside of Australia. Ask any random person who Bill O'Reilly is a vast majority of them will recognize the commentator. You are trying to push an insignificant POV and trying to overrepresent it through the use of sockpuppets or meatpuppets.<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFistful_of_Questions_61e7.html" title="User:Fistful of Questions">Fistful of Questions</a> 15:46, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Really, you shouln't use flawed metrics to evaluate the notability criteria. Why don't you publish reports of a survey in Italy and New Zealand to state your claims? A deceased person cannot compete against a living person in terms of "brand recall", but it does not mean the deceased was not notable in his own right. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 15:50, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are only presenting that argument that they are of equal notability becaus you know that it cannot be readily "proven". But it is still a well known fact that commentator is much more well known than the cricketeer, and you know this in the back of your mind, but you are denying that your point of view is wrong and you continue to push it and overrepresent it through the use of meatpuppets.<a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFistful_of_Questions_61e7.html" title="User:Fistful of Questions">Fistful of Questions</a> 15:53, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>you keep harping that it is a well known fact, but where is it cited to be well known fact? You too cede that there is no metric to determine notability, so I suggest you not raise minor issues like this. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 15:56, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is not a minor issue, it is the sole factor in deciding notability.

<dd>Are you familiar with the Neutral Point of View policy? Please be more specific when replying, the topic seems to be heading into vague reasoning. I also refute your personal statistics wherein you state that 99.99% would think of the commentator and not the cricketer. There are a lot of people who you have discounted in India, Pakistan, South Africa, West Indies, England to name a few who can still associate the name <i>Bill O'Reilly</i> as a cricketer. As I put it, and you agreed, your metrics to determine the notability of mutually exclusive domains isn't the right way to proceed. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 16:11, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I said on my talk page: I am not sure that "more notable" is the relevant test here: notability is relevant to whether a topic is encyclopedic (and thus eligible to have a Wikipedia article) or not (and thus liable to be deleted). In this case, both are clearly notable. The question is whether one is clearly the "primary topic" (as it is called in <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a>). Many people outside the US have not heard of the commentator, but have heard of the cricketer; in the US, I understand that the position is the opposite way around. On that basis, neither person is the "primary topic", so a disambiguation page is the right result. -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 16:14, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Perhaps this will help. No one should be arguing <b>who</b> is more notable, we should be arguing who is more notable <b>now</b>. O'Reilly (commentator) averages 2 million viewers a night, and is still active in his profession. The cricketeer is undoubtedly also notable; however, the reference to the cricket article will be of much less while the other O'Reilly is still in his profession. We should be removing disambig. pages where it is possible, and on just two pages - we should be looking for the most notable <b>at the present time</b>. --75.21.241.167 04:01, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
