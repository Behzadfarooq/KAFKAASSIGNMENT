<p>The criticisms section is non-Wiki, as it has to do with conjecture and hearsay. Wikipedia is NOT A NEWS MEDIA SOURCE. It is an encyclopedia of facts (we can verify he won Super Bowl XXXVIII as the Patriots' coach in 2001, we can NOT verify with any certainty whether he has Aspergers', or whether he fosters egocentric showmanship, etc. It's NOT Wiki policy. An encyclopedic entry must have a neutral point of view. To report on a meeting in which he "appears" standoff-ish is not relevant to an encyclopedic article. Stop re-adding conjecture until we get a ruling. <a href="../../../w/s/t/User%7EWStewart07_2be2.html" title="User:WStewart07">WStewart07</a> 13:18, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Ted Johson story is neither conjecture nor hearsay - it is a major news story, and based on the recent rise of injuries and depression occurring later in life as a result of football-related injuries, it needs to be included.--Tjcthree 15:33, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>How about this quote from Ted Johnson recently? ""I don't want to place blame anywhere," Johnson said. "It probably could all go around, to a little bit of everybody. I can't sit here and honestly say that I think Bill Belichick knew what second-impact syndrome was, and if he put me in there that could potentially happen. I can't sit there and say that. I have to believe he didn't do what he did to intentionally try to hurt me physically."

<p>Then shouldn't that quote be added to the article, instead of just not mentioning any part it? it's a major story, not something arbitrary like blowing off a post-game handshake.</p>
<p>~This is something that we as Wiki-people must understand. Just because something makes news as a story, doesn't mean that it's encyclopedic. The Ted Johnson piece is "He Said" vs "He Said," and unverifiable. It made news because it was alleged. However, it was a weak allegation with no proof. If you were to have your own Wiki article entry, and I added that it is alleged you vandalized the Belichick entry (I'm not saying you are), does that make the allegation factual, or worthy of note on your Wiki? Libel is a very serious trap to dodge, Fuzzy Zoeller's recent lawsuit against Wikipedia and the anonymous user who vandalized his entry only demonstrates that danger. <a href="../../../w/s/t/User%7EWStewart07_2be2.html" title="User:WStewart07">WStewart07</a> 23:22, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's amazing how anything that can be construed as negative has been removed from this page ... the criticisms of his post game behavior, his involvement in a messy divorce case and even the Ted Johnson story which as pointed out above may have been ignorance on his part, not malice. All those things are well documented in the mainstream press and were cited for this page ... yet all were removed under the 'nothing negative can be posted here' rules. I am a Pat's fan and love what Belichick has done for the team, but there should be some balance here, Belichick is a human being and as such has faults as well as admirable qualities. Check the Wikipedia bios of any other person in the news and you will find the good and bad. For instance, check <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_La_Russa_c0f9.html" title="Tony La Russa">Tony La Russa</a>'s page. Tony LaRussda's page has a section about his recent DWI. If that page was maintained as this one is, it would not be allowed. I think this page has been taken over by Belicheck fans who will not tolerate anything negative ... thats my two cents.

<p>The text below entered the article on April 4. I've searched for confirmation of association between Belichick and Asperger's. Additionally, even if it exists, it is framed as speculation, which does not merit inclusion. I think rumor should only be included in articles where the rumor itself is central to the topic.</p>
<p>"Known for being one of the most reserved coaches in NFL history, especially to the press, his focus on the game of football have begun rumors that Belichick may have Asperger's Syndrome." <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 04:19, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In my view, it appears as though some of the criticisms levied against Bill Belichick border on the unnecessary, and unfounded. Also, I contend that these criticisms could contain potentially libelous information. For instance, LaDanian Tomlinson's recent criticism was merely speculative, and probably not legitimate, as he made those comments visually upset after losing. Nor does he have any experience under Belichick to make that claim. Before his claim, there was no history or pattern of behavior in which the Patriots were criticized for being without class, and nor was there ever an accusation that such behavior stems from a team mentality Belichick cultivated. I move that the Tomlinson critique should be removed. <a href="../../../w/s/t/User%7EWStewart07_2be2.html" title="User:WStewart07">WStewart07</a> 18:45, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think Belichick's noted behavior after the AFC Championship game somewhat reinforces Tomlinson's claims. UNSIGNED!!</p>
<p>By the way, if anonymous people are so ardent towards reporting the critiques levied against Belichick, will anyone report the latest news in which LaDanian Tomlinson admitted he erred in calling out Belichick for Hobbs' celebration after the game? Anyone? I am going to do us all a favor and eliminate the section. NOWHERE, and I mean, NOWHERE, in any other coach's Wikipedia article does there exist a section DEDICATED to criticisms. I am letting my statement stand along with the below statement for a week, then removing the Criticisms section altogether. It is probably maintained by some envious rabid anti-fan anyway. <a href="../../../w/s/t/User%7EWStewart07_2be2.html" title="User:WStewart07">WStewart07</a> 05:48, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Further, why do we even need a section on criticisms? I trust that similar sections are being written for ever NFL head coach? This should be a biography, not an anti-Belichick column or blog. Quoting barbs from Kornheiser and Tomlinson adds nothing to the biography. All of this nonsense should be removed unless every coach's bio is made to conform. 64.146.116.58</p>
<p>When one individual/columnist/reporter makes a criticism, then yes it probably doesn't merit adding to this site. However in regards to Belichick's behaviors: shoving the photographer, snubbing other coaches / players post game when he loses, and said criticism is made in all the local papers (Boston Herald, Patriot Ledger, Boston Globe) as well as in national media (ESPN and other syndicated columnists) then IMHO, it merits posting here. The fact that he is named in a pending divorce case is fact, not supposition. There are many wikipedia pages with paragraphs such as 'critics of this individual note this and that ...' Noting that an individual has been criticized by others does not imply that the writer or the site agrees with the criticism, but merely notes that it has been done.</p>

<p>I'm almost certain that his family's original Croatian name has some sort of mark over the Cs. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Belicic&amp;lr=lang_hr" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Belicic&amp;lr=lang_hr" rel="nofollow">This Google search</a> sure makes it look like it's Beličič, so I'm going to go ahead and change it. If anyone can confirm, that would be great. (UPDATE: I actually missed the distinction in his father's name, but apparently with three Is it's most often <i>Biličić</i>. ARRRRGH! My guess would be that latter one, since it appears to be a much more common Croatian surname. But I'm going to leave in my first edit for the moment.)

<p>"It said that Belichick got a contract extension in January 2006 but just recently they're saying that his contract expires this year, and that's when i saw that they extended it here. I noticed there was no source and i googled it, and I even checked the New England homepage and they don't have anything about it there. On the NE Patriots homepage it has articles dating back from the last decade so I'm sure it's not because the article was old. I'm pretty sure it's because it never happend. He never got a contract extension."</p>
<p>I don't know who wrote the above, but two things should be said:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Krafts have stated that they will not discuss the details of Belichick's contract with the media.</li>
<li>Dan Pires (a Patriots beat reporter) and Len Pasquarelli of ESPN have reported that Belichick <b>is</b> under contract for 2007. Samer 06:59, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>where he played center/tight end, alongside men such as his best friend, Alan Poon.</i></p>
<p>This statement was added, but there is no reason given for mentioning him. The fact that he is Belichick's friend is not, in and of itself, enough to justify including that information. [By comparison, Ernie Adams, another friend from Belichick's student days, is not yet mentioned, even though Adams currently works with Belichick.] Samer 07:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Continuing the controversy over his after-game demeanor, on January 21, 2007, after losing the AFC Championship Game in Indianapolis to the Colts, Belichick seemingly snubbed exchanging post-game remarks with Peyton Manning, who simply patted him on his chest and moved on. Additionally, in a postgame interview with Solomon Wilcots from CBS, as well as at the post-game press conference, Belichick was noticeably terse and short with his answers. This no doubt only adds to the growing opinion that Belichick is ungracious, both in victory and defeat.<a href="../../../1/0/s/User%7E10stone5.html" title="User:10stone5">10stone5</a> 16:26, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I simply don't see the point of this paragraph, in addition to this material not being sourced - 10stone5</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Source has been added</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The source here is still not relevant. The youtube video doesn't actually verify anything contained in that paragraph. This paragraph still is an unsubstantiated opinion. - 10stone5</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I still haven't seen any improvement in sourcing. The youtube reference is just an opinion, not a validated reference. Without this type of referral, I can't see the relevance in this paragraph - so I am removing this paragraph. - 10stone5</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several references now. And how is the youtube reference an opinion? You see him look at Manning and brush past him - that's on the screen. I understand being fair, but it's clearly visible. - tjcthree</p>
<p>It's your opinion that he appears ungracious in the youtube video. There are no guidelines for proper "gracious" behavior. <a href="../../../w/s/t/User%7EWStewart07_2be2.html" title="User:WStewart07">WStewart07</a> 20:26, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
