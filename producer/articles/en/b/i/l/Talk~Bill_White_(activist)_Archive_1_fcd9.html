<h2><span class="mw-headline">White and anarchism</span></h2>
<p>For Nahila,</p>
<p>There are some apparent intellectual contradictions in LNSGP rhetoric that make fair treatment difficult. I appreciate the difficulty presented by White's claims of both anarchist and national socialist ideology. But anarchism is the last ideology anyone can claim to exclusively own, so if people such as White want to present as an anarchist, it is simply a matter of fact that they present as anarchists. While any thinking person can cite contradictions in another's rhetoric, anarchists have no authority beyond the contradictions they can cite to claim White is not an anarchist, if he says he is. On the other hand, we are not obligated to take his word for it that his ideology is internally consistent.</p>
<p>It is important for readers to appreciate the difference between <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomie.html" title="Anomie">anomie</a>, which can express as ant<i>i-s</i>o<b>cia</b>l konTEmp <b>4</b> <i>awl</i> wrules, and ideological anarchy. It might seem to a reasonable person that White leans more toward anomie than toward anarchy. But Wikipedia is not a court of ideology, it is an encyclopedia, so we will do best to represent his position as dispassionately as we can -- hence the link to the LNSGP article.</p>
<p>The article is sourced on three contrasting advocacy publications, including an anarchist publication, to show that he is plainly not centered in any well-established ideology. But even if we are to mention his rental properties, as you suggest in your edit summary, we need to be careful not to accept the authority of an ideologically-oriented publication that these properties you or I have never seen are indeed "ghetto" properties.</p>
<p>In submitting the first version of this article, I didn't mention his unsuccessful local candidacies or his land-owner history because I had not yet verified details, the article can be encyclopedic without including every published detail of his life and nobody contracted with me to compose a complete article before any deadline. <a href="../../../s/p/y/User%7ESpyRing_f949.html" title="User:SpyRing">SpyRing</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Is White even claiming that he is an anarchist at this point? My recollection is that he started calling himself an ex-anarchist in late 2000. Either way, "anarchist" has an established meaning (see <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>) that is in direct contradition to <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_socialism.html" title="National socialism">national socialism</a>. At the very least, it should be noted that White's (past) identification as an anarchist rests on shaky grounds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please explain why "the majority of anarchists" is a conundrum. Anarchists, like any other group, can be counted and quantified. The <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-fascism.html" title="Anarcho-fascism">anarcho-fascism</a> article was already deleted and so called "nationalist anarchism" has been delt with extensively on the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html#Talk_archives" title="Talk:Anarchism">anarchism talk page</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyhow, I will try to spend some time helping with this article later in the week. Thanks for getting it started.&#160;:) - Nihila 22:16, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>His continued advocacty of libertarianism suggests where his anarchistic ideology has gone. Apparently he doesn't see libertarianism in contradiction with national socialism. We probably lack sufficient biographical expose upon which to base an explanation of his own view of his emerging ideological orientation. Interviewing him would probably comprise original research, which this encyclopedia apparently discourages.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anarchists could theoretically be counted and quantified, but they have not been, at least not in relation to any matter presented here. The text of a single anarchist publication doesn't neccessarily indicate the views of a majority of anarchists. There has not been and likely will not soon be any concensus about any notion held by "the majority of anarchists" beyond very basic precepts that anarchy is a <i>generic term</i> for movements that <i>tend</i> to advocate elimination of imposed authority. We simply lack any reliable medium for polling and assessing the current views of a majority of people who present as anarchists world-wide.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That there exists a Wikipedia article on a topic is not final evidence that the subject has an "established meaning." Whatever established meaning the article might evidence is rendered vague by the language of the article -- "Anarchism is a generic term describing various political philosophies and social movements that advocate the elimination of all forms of imposed authority, including social hierarchy and coercive power."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, a mob of anarchists such as those who threw rocks through store windows in Seattle attempts to impose authority, whether they admit it or not. So right away, we can find flaws in the Wikipedia definition which arise from a failure to challenge internal inconsistencies of the rhetoric of some professed anarchists. And pacifist anarchists, no matter how non-violent they might see their own ranks, lack authority to say those others who call their unruly movements anarchism are not indeed espousing a version of anarchy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Most accurately, "White presented himself as an anarchist at one time." It seems to me the problem arises from a predominant style of writing in this forum, with a somewhat authoritarian overreliance on the passive verb "is" rather than on more accurate active verbs that tell us what a subject has done. A sentence can either refer to the <i>writer's</i> authority that something "is", or it can tell us who did what, with attribution to a <i>published authority</i> beyond the Wikipedia writer.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Other unsubtantiated passive wiggle-words often appearing here include perceptual representations, including "is considered" and "is believed." Basic automated grammar checkers flag passive statements that suggest a perception or count without identifying or accurately quantifying the subject. Either we name <i>who</i> considered somebody to be something, or we are simply stating our own individual notion of somebody else's perception.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Bottom line is, regardless our personal views, encyclopedic writing can neither defend an exclusively noble notion of anarchism, nor disparage a particularly offensive activist who claims anarchism as an ideology. Encyclopedic treatment needs to rely on precise language to present verifiable factual representations.</dd>

<dd>I do not think that it is necessary to interview White in order to complete this article. His views are plastered all over the internet (I have been reading his articles off and on since 1999 and I have interacted with him on rare occasion). The real issue is sorting through all the BS.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the statement "White presented himself as an anarchist at one time" is accurate. However, Infoshop is not the only site to challenge White's claims that he was an anarchist. Among others, see <a href="http://www.onepeoplesproject.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=154&amp;Itemid=29" class="external text" title="http://www.onepeoplesproject.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=154&amp;Itemid=29" rel="nofollow">OnePeoplesProject.com</a>, <a href="http://www.publiceye.org/frontpage/911/About-Bill-White-2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.publiceye.org/frontpage/911/About-Bill-White-2.html" rel="nofollow">PublicEye.org</a>, and <a href="http://sf.indymedia.org/news/2002/01/113795_comment.php" class="external text" title="http://sf.indymedia.org/news/2002/01/113795_comment.php" rel="nofollow">the Barricada Collective's statement</a> on Indymedia.

<dd>If we had a baseline number of how many anarchists there are in the world, I would be interested in discussing what portion of them have formulated any opinion at all about his person. Otherwise, any summation of "anarchists" is a hasty generalization.</dd>

<dd>I don't know what you mean by "complete this article." Open collaborative writing is by its nature permanently incomplete. Even after extensively reading his written work, I would need to interview this person to report responsibly on what he considers his views at this time. At a minimum, I would need to listen to an unedited interview with an unbiased interviewer who was not working for a political advocacy publication, as all the sources for this article are. But because of his proximity to violent situations, it might have been worth my time to establish an entry here for this person. That doesn’t mean I consider open documents a reliable source for information about a person’s views.</dd>

<p>Bill White is similiar (but only slightly) to <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troy_Southgate_6038.html" title="Troy Southgate">Troy Southgate</a>. They have both espoused a variety of views (nationalistic or anarchistic -- and both). There are allegations <a href="http://www.nationalanarchist.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalanarchist.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> that Southgate is an informant or a spy. There have been suggestions made about White, also.

<p>An editor removed a link to a "One Peoples Project" bio with the followoing summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>OPP lost a libel action against White for that bio, see court transcript under Hardwick; bio deleted, no need to bring legal proceedings against Wikipedia</i></li>
</ul>
<p>I assume Hardwick is actually <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erica_Hoesch_8788.html" title="Erica Hoesch">Erica Hoesch</a>. Which court transcripts? Can you please post it here? The court links in that article don't work. Thanks, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 12:05, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>[link:<a href="http://overthrow.ws/transcript0805.txt" class="external free" title="http://overthrow.ws/transcript0805.txt" rel="nofollow">http://overthrow.ws/transcript0805.txt</a>]</p>
<p>Hardwick, Hoyt and Jenkins held a meeting to expound on a number of "facts" about Bill White that they asserted to be true -- that he is a convicted felon, former mental patient, etc. I have not read their bio on him lately, but I assume it still says the same things.</p>
<p>When questioned in court, White denied all of these charges. One of the authors of the OPP bio, Erica Hardwick, is also a convicted felon, currently in custody awaiting other felony charges, and has a history of convictions for lying to the court and to police.</p>
<p>White brought suit against Chuck Munson, original author of the "report" that served as the basis for the OPP bio, as well as ARA and several other anti-racist activists, for libel in Montgomery County, MD. I have not checked the status of that suit recently, and the results are not public info.</p>
<p>In short, the OPP bio of White is contentious, its authors do not have a character that would, say, allow them to give evidence in a court of law, and is based on information that is the subject of a lawsuit.</p>
<p>As such, it is not an appropriate source.</p>

<dd>The link is not presented as a source for any information. It is provided as a resource for further reading. Just because someone has been sued does not mean that the large amount of information in that biography is entirely false. If you can find some reliable sources for it, you can add a paragraph to the article about how misinformation is being spread about White. But the link is worthwhile.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Page name -&gt; Bill White?</span></h2>
<p>Since the subject seems to be universally known as "Bill White" I propose that we move it to Bill White (agitator). Any objections? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 22:16, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it would be annoying for everyone to update their links. Why not create a "Bill White (agitator)" page and redirect it here? Why does it matter? Why use "agitator", as opposed to "activist" or some more neutral term? <a href="../../../b/a/x/User%7EBaxter2_3a44.html" title="User:Baxter2">Baxter2</a> 23:41, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was thinking of the "Bill White" part. I see that you have been methodically "piping" the name back to Bill White, so it'd save future effort.

<dd>I've just taken a quick look at this, and so I don't know all the issues yet, but the large number of links is excessive.

<p>There is no reason to list every article that ever mentioned him. None whatsoever. The list essentially reproduced a Google search on the man, which you are free to do, but this is completely excessive and doesn't even relate to the man. This is far more listings then any other article I've ever seen, it takes this regular, even sometimes well-written page and fills it with nonsense.

<dd>It's a pity that there isn't an external website with all of these listings that we could simply link to for further information - "Wikilinks". One link that I followed turned out to be a posting on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a>'s site of one of White's "Libertarian Socialist News" items that didn't mention White and wasn't even specifically signed by him either.<a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/05/05/Zundel_FBI_report.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/05/05/Zundel_FBI_report.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> White is a prolific author/journalist/web user and has generated a large number of essays. Most of them are probably on his websites. Linking to copies of them elsewhere seems unnecessary. (That may be the only instance) Regarding the unlinked newspaper references, can these be consolidated somehow? Generally, can we connect the sources to the assertions?

<dd>The reason for the links is this: There are certain people here who only want to present the "opposition view" links. Most of the opposition view links are simply inaccurate lies that have been published about Bill White. If those links are going to be included, than the more neutral links need to be included as well. However, I don't see what harm including all the links does to Wikipedia. The links are organized by subject matter and the reader is more than able to determine which ones he or she feels is relevant. The alternative is to include no biased material, or only material authored by White, or only "neutral" material, meaning those newspapers which, while they have denounced White in editorials and sworn editorial opposition to him, are considered mainstream. I can see no fair way to present this other than to include all the material.</dd>

<li>What, specifically, about the article is dubious? Again, I think there are some people who just don't want to face the fact that some white activists are extremely personally successful, brilliant people -- people more successful and brilliant than them, and more successful and brilliant than anything they read on the TV or in the controlled news media.

<p>The first question is whether this person is worth any kind of entry, or whether this should go to VfD.

<p>I've rewritten the intro, and made the links invisible until we decide which ones, if any, to keep. The first thing is to find sources for the article, particularly the introduction. We need a source (other than White) for the property investment claim; and for the New York Times claim: it's not even clear what he means by that. And also a source for "garnered attention," whatever that means. I also deleted the blurred pic, and moved the clearer one up to the top.

<dd>White is not notable for being a property investor. His Roanoke properties have been reported on several times, including instances connected to other aspects of his life. But the size, etc, of his investment is secondary and maybe even unencyclopedic (as it is liable to change without notice). I suggest that the details of his business affairs should go later in article and that the intro should focus on the bare facts of his life and what makes him famous. Regarding the photos, if the photographers can grant us copyright permissions then I think they should stay. The two photographs are so different in appearance as to provide a useful contrast (as with photos of young and old Elvis). Again, it's too bad that there isn't an external website with this kind of additional info available that we could link to.

<dd>Actually, almost everything that's been written on White this year has focused on his property investments, except for some minor reprinting of his commentaries in the national press. I think White and his wealth have had a very strong impact on recent white nationalist politics, and played an important role in what makes him famous. I also think those opposed to him and his politics try to minimize his extreme personal success in life in order to stereotype him in a way that makes them feel more comfortable, rather than facing the facts and challenging their pre-conceived ideas as to what a "national socialist" or "white nationalist" is.</dd>

<p>The way this is organized, those incidents which have brought White to prominence this year are mentioned in the inroduction. Other controveries are later in the article.

<p>There is full citation of the articles in the references section. If every article cited required an *online* link, what you are saying is that anything published in a major newspaper before the internet does not constitute "encyclopedic" knowledge. This is not a "vanity" piece. White is presented in a neutral light. The problem you have is that, in a neutral light, White looks pretty good, and you, personally can't stand that. You are engaged in politically motivated page vandalism. If you continue, I will ask that action be taken against your account, because you are the one violating the Wikipedia policies -- and I find that disgusting.</p>

<dd>Whenever you talk about Bill White, a collection of marginal and extreme people, known for censorship and shouting down their opponents -- Scientologists, Radical Leftists, Zionist militants, etc -- emerge to lie about him. What's pathetic is that they believe is that their minority consensus is a real reflection of the world. I've always thought that folk whose ego's are so weak they cannot accept challenges to their paradgism should be barred from publishing -- but, unfortunately, in modern society, such a sensible position is a minority view. 68.10.35.153 14:07, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, don't delete the sources then claim you need to source all the views.

<dl>
<dd>Also, I don't believe the Lefkow quote, which is badly out of context, is White is "best known for". It is just what he happens to have been known for in the last two months. I mean, was the front page lead column article in the February 14, 1996 Washington Post less notable because it was ten years ago? One should not judge "notability" or permanence by the current trend or latest news. 68.10.35.153 14:10, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I read the transcript correctly, it covers a hearing in which White was attempting to get a temporary injunction against Hardwick. White testified that Hardwisk had accused him publicly of being a felon and a mental patient. He further testified that the accusations were untrue. Nobody asked Hardwick to support her allegations. The judge seemed to conclude that no harm had resulted from the accusations, and he denied the request for a temporary injunction (though warned Hardwick not to trespass again). There's no indication from this transcript that White has sued over these statements. As a very public figure, it's hard to imagine that he could win a libel case easily. Except for details of the White/Hardwick fight, there isn't much usueful info in the transcript that I can find. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 04:15, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's there to give the context of White's extraordinary remark, which I feel is notable enough for the intro, given that it was picked up by the <i>New York Times</i>. But without the Hale context, we don't explain why White would have reacted to the murders. Jay, do you think we should get rid of the White quote entirely from the intro? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:16, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the quote is indeed notable - how many other times has White been quoted in the NYT? But since his quote talks about the Hale case, but not Hale's people being involved in the murders, it might be sufficient to leave out the back story. His comment doesn't refer to <i>who</i> did the killing, only that it was "deserved". Here is a suggested variation that omits reference to the killers (original first):
<ul>
<li><i>He was in the news again in 2005 when the New York Times quoted him as having "laughed" when the husband and 89-year-old mother of United States district court judge Joan Lefkow were murdered, initially believed to have been killed by associates of white supremacist Matthew Hale, who was fined by Judge Lefkow over a trademark dispute.</i></li>
<li><i>He was in the news again in 2005 when the New York Times quoted him as having "laughed" when the husband and 89-year-old mother of United States district court judge Joan Lefkow were murdered. Lefkow had previously ruled against white supremacist Matthew Hale in a trademark dispute.</i></li>

<p>I think you're right about how it is placed in the intro; I think it should be placed further down the page, but referring to the actual incident, White is operating under the assumption of some sort of Hale connection. I think the significant facts of that Hale was the prime suspect at the time of the statement, as well as his later conviction for ordering her murder are very much germane to the context of the quote.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrza_f8cc.html" title="User:TheGrza">The</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheGrza_ecac.html" title="User talk:TheGrza"><font color="green">Grza</font></a> 22:54, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We could split the difference: say that he got a NYT mention for the "laughing" quote in the intro, then give the whole quote and context later. I am concnerd that the intro paragraph seems to focus just on his administration of Overthrow, while he has been notable more for what he has said on it (and elsewhere. Maybe if we say that he is the "principle author" of Overthrow, or something similar, that would capture his role better. I don't see a good place in the intro for the real estate stuff, unless we just say in the opening paragraph that he is currently a landlord.

<dd>I'm happy to leave the real estate thing out of the intro. Also, Will, you make a good point about the undue focus on the administration of Overthrow, as though it's a well-known entity apart from White. The only reason the website and White are known (beyond a small circle of readers) is because of certain statements White has made on the site, which have been picked up by the media. I'd say "runs" or "maintains" the far-right, anti-Semitic website Overthrow.com, rather than "adminstrator of" (which sounds like a paid position) or "principle author" (which sounds as though there are other authors). I agree with TheGraza that we should provide the context of the laughing quote, but agree with Will that it should be later on in the text, only because the intro should focus on White, and not give too much space to background. I liked the way Will had managed to make it clear and accurate but without going into detail. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:30, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I see he's added some figures to the homepage, but it would be better if we could take them from another source, or from the website's site tracker if it's accessible. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:13, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding the court transcript, White has weakened its authority somewhat by having added comments to it, albeit in square brackets. The transcript shows him denying that he's been convicted of a felony or that he's spent time in a mental institution. Baxter, does White have any kind of a criminal record? Also, I'd say the Erica Hardwick incident isn't worth mentioning further, as it's what I would call a domestic incident.</dd>

<dd>Sam, his list was not a list of references, as in sources. White is calling it The Bill White Article Collection on his website, and linking to it for the benefit of his readers, though many of the articles have little or nothing to do with him. Quite a few are online even though he hasn't provided the links, so I suggest you read through them to see for yourself. What we need to do is rewrite the article, building up a references section as we go along. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:44, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sam's edits</span></h2>
<p>Sam, I'm mystified as to what your intentions are here. For example, could you explain your reasoning for the following changes?</p>
<p>1) Your intro said the LSN publishes news of extremist groups, but you deleted my edit "whose ideas are not disseminated elsewhere," yet you retained the link to the source that said that. My aim in putting that in is that this is how White describes the LSN himself in the Pravda interview I linked to, and it's arguably a positive thing to say about him: that he's prepared to provide a platform for groups that might otherwise not be heard from. So why did you delete it, and yet retain the link that said it?</p>
<p>2) Why did you delete that he was a Pravda columnist for four months and didn't get paid? We should either retain that information, or delete entirely that he was a columnist, because being unpaid and being very temporary places the claim of employment in context. Instead, you delete the context but retain the claim. What's your reasoning?</p>
<p>3) You restored that he's the owner of White Homes and Land, LLC, and that he has invested in excess of $3 million in the impoverished West End neighborhood of <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roanoke%2C_VA_96bb.html" title="Roanoke, VA">Roanoke, VA</a>. What's your source for these three claims: (a) that he owns LLC, (b) that he invested three million in Roanoke, and (c) that it was invested in an impoverished neighborhood? If you don't have a source, why did you restore the claims; and if you do have a source, why didn't you link to it?</p>
<p>4) You restored that "White also holds business interests in a number of internet and computer related companies, the full extent of which is not known." How do you know that he holds these business interests, and how do you know that the full extent of the interests are not known?</p>
<p>I hope you agree that we can't take Baxter3's word for any of this, particularly as he claims not to be Bill White, and also says he doesn't know him, but has only read his website. And of course even if he were Bill White, we'd also have to base our edits on independent sources where possible, and only on his website when we have to (and then we should make clear that's what we've done). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:00, Jun 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>I thought it was probably untrue, there are lots of nazi / white power sites out there reporting stuff.</li>
<li>It was based on a forum, which I give no credit to. We know he worked for Pravda, other links support this implicity. For how long, and how much he was paid would need a valid cite, not some forum.</li>
<li>I wasn't aware there was any denial of this claim, but I believe it has been cited now<a href="http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/news/story169446.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/news/story169446.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, so thats a moot point.</li>
<li>Well, I know that I never heard of the guy before reading this article, so their dern sure not known by me!&#160;;) If you want a cite on that, ask the person who 1st put it there. My understanding was that these claims were accepted, and being deleted as irrelevent, which I disagree w.</li>
</ol>
<p>The article needs alot of work, and the 2 versions need merged.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Inaccuracies</span></h2>
<p>Baxter, you wrote in an edit summary that the new version contains inaccuracies. I'd be happy to go through it with you section by section, and you can point out what you feel is inaccurate or unfair.</p>
<p>There were some issues with your version that had to be changed. Just one example — Your second sentence states: "He is also the owner of White Homes and Land, LLC, a real estate investment and development company which, according to the <i>Roanoke Times</i> <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/news/story169446.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/news/story169446.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, has invested $3 million in the impoverished West End neighborhood of Roanoke, VA."</p>
<p>First, White is not notable for being a real-estate developer. He's notable for the issues reported in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, and <i>Reuters</i>, and Wikipedia has to go with the major third-party sources before we focus on anything else.</p>
<p>Second, the sentence doesn't reflect what its source says. The <i>Roanoke Times</i> article you linked to doesn't say he's invested $3 million. It says: "He said he has nine single- and multifamily properties in the 1500 and 1600 blocks of Chapman and Patterson avenues either in his possession or under contract. He said he <i>expects to</i> spend a total of $3 million over two years, swelling his number of properties to 45 or 50." (my emphasis)</p>
<p>There were a number of similar issues throughout the old version, which is why I think the new one is an improvement, but if it can be improved further, in terms of accuracy and fairness, please work with us to achieve that. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:24, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is he had it as the second sentence, and while it's normal to keep a person's current employment or position high up in the intro, I couldn't find any third-party source that calls him a real-estate developer. The more partisan sources say he's a slum landlord, and the neutral ones, like the <i>Roanoake Times</i>, just say landlord. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:09, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Being a landlord is important to White's recent life. But if that was all he had done then no one outside of Roanoke would care about him. He is significant and notable because of his political and internet activities.

<dd>I've added "He is the owner of several rental properties in Roanoke, Virginia" to the intro, which is as much as any of the sources confirm.</dd>
<dd>I'm also wondering about this sentence in the intro: "White also runs a news service, <i>Libertarian Socialist News</i>, which publishes news of extremist groups whose ideas are not disseminated elsewhere. <a href="http://english.pravda.ru/main/2002/01/10/25248.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.pravda.ru/main/2002/01/10/25248.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Looking at the website, it's not clear that the news service is separate from the website; or if it used to be, that it still is; so I'm thinking of deleting that sentence.

<dd>The "news service" seems to involve a e-mail list. I've found many of the releases reprinted on forums and usenet groups, but I haven't found any newspapers crediting the service. It appears that White presaged the blog era by creating his own outlet for opinion. I think that the Libertarian Socialist News should be treated as one of his interrelated web offerings. I'm still looking for a suitable reference to ShopWhite, which apparently was a business fiasco that left many national alliance-types gnashing their teeth. White is better known for that in many circles than for his real estate dealings. However, all the references that I've found so far have been on forums and other dubious sources. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 02:48, Jun 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Plus there are many sources among forums, etc, there is wide agreement agreement on the basics. I think we can roll this stuff into a two-paragraph (or so) section: Overthrow and the News Service are simple sites focused on advocacy, and the ShopWhite and VNN were mainly commercial businesses where he served in a technical and ownership capacity. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 00:21, Jun 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">From the One People's Project website</span></h2>
<p>The One People's Project website has the following commentary on its front page:</p>
<p>PROOF THAT BILL WHITE NEEDS A LIFE Many of us who trapse about the internet have found our way to an online encyclopedia called Wikipedia. This encyclopedia allows visitors to publish and edit entries on a person, topic, etc. Of course, this policy lends itself to abuse, and the operators of the website have often deleted entries that are questionable. That may need to happen soon.</p>
<p>This week, a few entries that a user named "Baxter2" seems to have a hand in authoring were published. One of them is for Bill White. Another is for Erica Hardwick, another for Chuck Munson of Infoshop.org, yet another for Tad Kepley of Anarchy! Magazine and then one for One People's Project. All of them put a negative light on all of their subjects, except one - Bill. In fact, the negative things said about each of the other subjects are exactly the same charges and same spin that Bill puts on these subjects on his own site, Overthrow.com. In his user info page, "Baxter2" notes that he had came to Wikipedia to "flesh out" the article on Bill White, and while he was there contribute to the other entries. He listed the entries he had also contributed to, which included the above as well as one for Jennifer Adams, who White lived with for a spell in Missouri (we think it has since been deleted). It should be noted that Bill was bitching earlier this week about a Wikipedia entry on him, and it is very curious to us how "Baxter2" has the same writing style and talking points that Bill has. Based on this, we think that Bill is the actual author of all of these entries, and is basically trying to use Wikipedia to give credibility to the BS he normally posts on Overthrow that has long been discounted as a credible source.</p>
<p>We have contacted the folks at Wikipedia and asked them to investigate the matter, and we hope to hear from them soon. As much as we would like the entry, truly there are better authors than Bill--we mean "Baxter2". We are posting this to let our readers know not to trust the current entry on us or any that "Baxter2" is associated with.</p>
<p>Oh, and Bill? Get over yourself. With the ongoing investigations of HUD and the FBI (no they did not drop them, you idiot), one would have thought that <i>something</i> would have broken past your dellusion that you are accomplishing something.</p>

<dd>Do others think it matters that he was an unpaid columnist?

<dd>As a former professional journalist, I find it highly relevant that he was an unpaid contributor. I think that the information needs to be presented, otherwise the reader is wrongly left with the impression that White enjoyed the full legitimacy of being a professional journalist, which clearly he was not. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 17:15, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm glad to see you admit there's obvious problems with relying on that source, particularly since on the 8th here you wrote "No matter what, forums are NEVER an acceptable source for an encyclopedia" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABill_White_%28activist%29&amp;diff=14887730&amp;oldid=14884644" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABill_White_%28activist%29&amp;diff=14887730&amp;oldid=14884644" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. As support for keeping the fact that White was an unpaid contributor to Pravda, that reference is only useful as a source for viewing his own spin. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 17:15, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm concerned about the <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pravda.html" title="Pravda">Pravda</a> mention because it may be misleading. My guess is that most folks would remember Pravda from the old Soviet era and assume it was still a communist news service. I'm not exactly sure how to properly characterize it now, but it is just about the opposite of what it once was (the WP article calls it "nationalist"). If we're going to mention Pravda then I think we need to characterize it. However that would disturb introduction's flow. Should we move it down to a chronological point and give it a fuller treatment? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 01:21, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why not leave the mention in the intro (which is perfectly valid in its brevity), and allow the reader to click it if they want to know more about pravda.

<dd>I find that distroted. Their programme/s says they are not; they are just using some symbols and claim to be <i>socialist</i>. They (both) have pronounced fascistic tendencies, I learned that first hand from a brief polemic I engaged in with some NBP, USA represntatives. Anyway, I think perhaps a footnote would be better employed in this case, so as to not disturb the flow of the lead. But I'm, of course, willing to entertain alternative rephrasing of the intro on that front, too. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 01:59, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The tiresome and endless debate about what is and is not socialist is a needless distraction here. Suffice it to say there are differences of opinion on the matter, and that there is no need for us to label Pravda one way or the other in this article. If anyone would like to set to work on the <a href="../../../p/r/a/Pravda.html" title="Pravda">pravda</a> article itself, I would hope they keep a sharp eye for neutrality, since it is a rather touchy subject, with alot of interesting angles. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 14:28, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My only concern about including the Pravda reference, but excluding that he was unpaid, is that it makes him sound as though he's a journalist, which is misleading. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:32, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. If this is to be mentioned, it needs to be qualified (professional, paid journalist <i>viz.</i> lack thereof). <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 22:56, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Indeed. As I said eariler, as the passage currently exists the reader is wrongly left with the impression that White was a professional journalist, which he never was, and gained some legitimacy from that role, which he never did. The fact that he was an unpaid contributor goes to that point. I'll be reinserting the fact, as it is highly relevant and largely clears up the issue. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeloniousMonk_89ab.html" title="User:FeloniousMonk">FeloniousMonk</a> 23:01, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you want to say such things, cite a reliable source.

<dd>Well, it's clear he wasn't paid for working for Pravda, regardless.

<p>read the article, esp. ext links, it is cited copiously. I find it disturbing that you accept that crappy forum cite only in ways which make him look bad, and are ready to disregard it if it could make him look even worse.

<dd>This is really a tiny detail. Let's not fight about it. Anyway, it's on his own website too.
<ul>
<li><i>I have been publishing on my website for years, and it is because of the popularity my material had there that Pravda made the offer to have me write a column, which I do without compensation, for the purpose of drawing traffic to Pravda's website (which my material does quite well).</i> <a href="http://www.overthrow.com/lsn/news.asp?articleID=1708" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.overthrow.com/lsn/news.asp?articleID=1708" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Again, should we just move this down to the chronological point? 2002. White's tenure as a Pravda correspondent is important to include in the article, but maybe it isn't a key detail that needs to be so prominently placed in the introduction. Or we can split it: mention the Pravda in passing in the intro, and give it a full sentence later. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 23:11, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Though we might use White as a source for this fact, I am unsure of the accuracy of White on matters that he is personally involved in. I have read many accounts of the ShopWhite/VNN controversy on forums. Though individually dubious, they gain a credibility through numbers. White just wrote a new account of the episode which is sharply at odds with the other accounts, and puts his own involvement in a very favorable light. I would rather omit the "fact" of his unpaid status than set a precedent for accepting White's version of events without corroboration. Any other thoughts? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 04:43, Jun 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wouldn't the right thing to do be to quote him or cite him (or whoever) for what he says, rather than accepting it or excluding it at face value? I'd prefer than everything be cited, rather than nothing, if you follow my meaning. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 17:52, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
