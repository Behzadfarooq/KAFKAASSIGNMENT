<p>Unfortunately the liberal extremists do indeed pollute this and many other sites. If you look at the revision history there are so many acts of vandalism that take place, this is simply due to the militant mindset of the liberals extremists who instead of engaging in intelligent debate and making useful contributions express themselves through moronic vandalism.</p>
<p>Edit:It appears the article is getting better, and the tags could be removed soon. Although vandalism watch is still in effect.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Absurd article</span></h2>
<p>This article needs to be cleaned up. Citing bush hating sites does not fit the standers Wikipedia. The part where it is alledged that Oreilly braged about serving in the military, when after 4 years of watching his show, constantly stated that he never served, is highly unlikely. That site he cited is titled "bush is an idiot"; what the hell is this? His source either made it up, or took a comment out of context; a liberal trait.</p>
<p>It is odd how almost every conservative/traditiobnalist personality listed in wikipedia must be cleaned up, yet liberal personalities remain untouched.</p>
<p><b>Rebuttal to above:</b> First I am a McCain Republican, who voted for Bush in 2000 and Kerry in 2004. The Republican party has been hi-jacked by extreme right wing zealots. I am sure George Sr would agree. Keep in mind W's reckless fiscal policy tax cuts without corresponding spending cuts are creating massive budget deficits. This seems to get lost in the W spin machine. Many economist have suggested that this fact along with massive war debt will bankrupt Social Security. Keep in mind that the general fund borrows money from the Social Security. This fact is lost on O'Really as I call him. So the criticism of Bush and O'Reilly is not only from liberals but also from highly educated successful mainstream Republicans. O'Reilly's radio program is much better because at least Bush critics get to voice an occasionally rebuttal to the W Spin. So W supporters tell us how the reckless fiscal policy isn't bad for the country. Tell us how the war in Iraq had anything to do with 9/11. O'Reilly in his simplistic tabloid manner lumped Sadam and Bin Laden together. <i>His shows are Jerry Springer like in their simplicity.</i></p>

<p>This is just plain stupid. I am mostly liberal, I find O'Reilly's show to be garbage ... but at the same time, I like Wikipedia, and I hate to see it becoming a pointless liberal watchdog site. Every day, people who obsessively hate O'Reilly come here and bog the article down with POV nonsense. If you think you are going to change somebody's mind about the man by flooding his article w/ unflattering entries - even those based in truth - you're seriously deluded. Remember, he constantly warns his faithful audience not to trust anything negative written about him on the internet.</p>
<p>If you really want to unseat old Bill, go to broadcasting school and then beat him at his own game. In the meantime, try and keep this article encyclopedic. There are plenty of blogs out there for you to vent your frustrations. -- <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastic_editor_1eff.html" title="User:Plastic editor">Plastic Editor</a> 12:26, 3 December 2005</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Proof O'Reilly is a bullshitter is PoV?</span></h3>
<p>It's like Jon Stewart once said, are those reporting the news anti-Bush or is the news itself anti-Bush? In this case, the news is against Bill O'Reilly. I put on there that O'Reilly said a town in New York state was named after an "Indian" tribe when in fact no such Native American tribe exists. It isn't PoV to say he wasn't telling the truth, but it isn't apparent that he was really lying but just that he was trying to act like he knew something when he didn't. That's bullshitting, I go to college, I see it all the time. And it isn't PoV to point out objective facts, objective facts are in the NPoV tutorial under "What Not To Avoid." So if anyone wants to revert the facts away, they should here state why the facts are not worth presenting. Maprovonsha172 03:53, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Canandaigua" was the name of a Seneca village and was also the name of a treaty between the Iroquois tribe and the confederacy. So there is a fairly reasonable chance that this was an honest mistake. At the very least, no, it is not "apparent" what he was thinking when he made the statement. Your conjecture is not "proof" nor is it "objective facts" so to call him a "bullshitter" is baseless and POV. And without that bit, your remaining contribution is pretty worthless. There are many more well-publicized and widely scrutinized instances of O'Reilly's dishonesty as well as sources that compile them, both of which are already referenced in the article. Your edit doesn't add anything of value. To put it plainly we don't need a play-by-play of every show the guy puts out. The article references Media Matters; should we include a few sentences about each of the 200-plus items they've compiled on O'Reilly? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavetrainer_9745.html" title="User:Davetrainer">Davetrainer</a> 16:43, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wonder if you watched yesterday's show. I did. He said "the Indian tribe" quite confidantly and abruptly right after correcting his pronounciation. It's not an honest mistake, its bullshitting. He needed to bullshit that "the Indian tribe" stuff after correcting himself so as to save face. Some people think he is a liar, some people think he is a saint, here is an instance of him bullshitting. I think that is very important, alongside more important instances like when he said he was "in combat" and all sorts of things like that. We can reword if you like but the information is valid.</dd>

<dd>That he said something confidently and abruptly does not rule out the possibility that he made an honest mistake, and it certainly is not a sufficient basis for calling him a "bullshitter". Again, it isn't apparent to anyone what he was thinking when he made the statement, so for you to infer that he was "bullshitting" "to save face" is POV. And yes, it is also original research. I'm pretty certain that no amount of rewording can reconcile any of these problems. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavetrainer_9745.html" title="User:Davetrainer">Davetrainer</a> 21:49, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I suppose it is original research, so I will retract it for that reason. But it is a perfect example of O'Reilly bullshitting, acting as though he were familiar with a Native American tribe that doesn't and never has existed.

<dd>There's a difference - and I know this is a difference that many people have difficult distinguishing these days - between being mistaken and lying. To show that he was lying, one must prove that he knew that it was not an "Indian tribe" while saying that it was. That's much bigger than simply being caught in an error - all reporters make all kinds of errors all the time.

<li>I'm curious why, if you're not a fan of Google searches, that in this case you are. An American media personality is obviously going to have more Google hits than a dead Australian cricketer - but that doesn't neccessarily translate into <i>notability</i>.

<li>I am not a fan because sometimes Google searches can be misleading or discussions when close to same hits are erronious. In this case it is not even close.

<li>It is not true that cricket is an "extremely minor sport". It is followed by more people across the world than any other sport except soccer. It is a very minor sport in the USA, certainly, but worldwide it is more significant than any American sport.

<li>He has an impact <i><u>in the United States</u></i>. From the international point of view he may just be a regular tv anchor. From Wikipedia's article on the commentator, the only international events that the commentator can be credited to is the coverage of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and his (really stupid IMO) edict against French goods. Please do not claim "global" impact. His realm of influence is North America. The cricketer's influence is much more widespread. Keep the dab page as both are notable.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. Your argument is based on an <b>assumption</b> that "millions" in Australia and GB know who your TV "personality" is. I can tell you for a fact that he is unknown in England, though Tiger O'Reilly is well known even to people with a passing interest in cricket. In Australia, Tiger O'Reilly's native land, he is an absolute legend and an Aussie pal of mine has just confirmed over the phone that he has never heard of anyone else called Bill O'Reilly. Please do not assume that the rest of the world is taken in by American hype and propaganda. Frankly, we are just not interested in America. A good example came up in my conversation with my Aussie pal when we asked each other how many baseball names we know. We both agreed we had heard of Babe Ruth and then we were really struggling. My mate says he read something about one called Strawberry Fields (unless that was a Beatles song!) and he mentioned another called Jeter(?). The only other one I can think of is Billy Bonds' namesake. Given that my friend and I are both knowledgeable people who are widely travelled and are both huge sports fans, I would say that we are a good example of the complete indifference to Americana that is common throughout the world apart from in the USA itself. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">Jack</a> 12:04, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

I disagree with your assertion that the commentator is any more notable than the cricketer.

I would expect many people outside of the US never to have heard of Bill O'Reilly (commentator), whereas Bill O'Reilly (cricketer) is widely notable in those countries as one of the best <a href="../../../l/e/g/Leg_spin.html" title="Leg spin">leg spinners</a> ever.

<dd>Where is the hypocrisy there? It is a case of <b>consistency</b>, not hypocrisy. Cricket is a major world sport while the insect is of interest to insectologists, of whom there are far fewer than there are cricket fans. As far as an individual like Bill (Tiger) O'Reilly is concerned, there is always the possibility that he will have a namesake who is well known in some quarters and you have to be prepared to disambiguate there. I have, for example, come across a situation only this morning regarding a cricket writer called Christopher Lee and I accept that his namesake, the actor, is better known; another cricket writer is called John Ford and he is nowhere near so well known as the film director. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">Jack</a> 12:32, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sortan, I tend to agree with you that they should both be dab pages, but let's please not start the name-calling again — it's not "hypocrisy", or even contradictory, to believe that cricket (sport) is much more prominent than cricket (insect), and that neither Bill O'Reilly is much more prominent than the other. In fact they're rather consistent views; it depends how notable you think cricket (sport) and cricketers are. So although I disagree with those people's conclusions, I think they hold a perfectly sensible point of view. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Turner_b872.html" title="User:Stephen Turner">Stephen Turner</a> 18:04, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was attracted here by the note on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Cricket_9cf1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Cricket">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Cricket</a>. It is impossible for me to judge how well known and influential the commentator is in absolute terms, as I had never even heard of him before. He demonstrably does not have a high profile in many countries outside the USA. Likewise, it is impossible for people who do not know much about cricket to gauge the fame and importance of the cricketer. I suggest that either party in this disagreement making claims about the notereity of the other O'Reilly is talking about something of which they are largely ignorant. That is not a good way to come to an agreement about their relative importance, as we can see. Judging purely on the facts available to me, I conclude the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cricketer is one of the best known players of his era, in a sport of large global importance. He is of significant historical importance in the sport, and well known to many cricket followers.</li>
<li>Cricket has more followers than any other sport in the world except for soccer. It is not a minor sport. Therefore, it would be reasonable to say that more people in the world know of O'Reilly the cricketer than, for example, <a href="../../../c/y/_/Cy_Young_29a6.html" title="Cy Young">Cy Young</a> the baseball player - a player of similar importance in baseball to O'Reilly's importance in cricket.</li>
<li>However, I would not be surprised if considerably more people searching Wikipedia for "Bill O'Reilly" were looking for the commentator than for the cricketer. I base this conclusion on the fact that the cricketer is, indeed, dead and not frequently thought of by current cricket followers, whereas the commentator is clearly a contemporary figure and has a significant following in the USA. If Cy Young was the name of a significant political commentator in England, I suspect more people would be searching for Cy Young the commentator than Cy Young the baseball player, for the same reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, I do not oppose the proposal to move this page. But I am unable to form a solid opinion on how notable O'Reilly the commentator really is, so I cannot vote in support either. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 09:17, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The American is unknown outside his own country and, let's be honest, this is yet another baseless assumption by Americans that, if someone is well known in the USA, it follows they are internationally famous. The rest of the world is not interested in America and this TV personality is completely unknown in the real (i.e., rest of the) world. As you have said, Bill (Tiger) O'Reilly remains a famous figure in the world's second most popular sport. Oh, and by the way, thanks for telling us all about Cy Young. I can now name <b>three</b> baseball players: Babe Ruth; Billy Bonds' namesake; and Cy Young. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">Jack</a> 12:32, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jack, you're an idiot. If you took a little less time to tell us how little you care about America, your claim might seem a little more sincere. It's pretty clear that you're bitterly jealous of a country that is much more prominent than your own. Say what you want about selection bias, but the truth is that most of the people reading this are indeed American, so when the debate is over who is "more noteable," someone who is well known to an American audience has an inherent edge.</p>

<dd>Being the #2 sport in the West Indies and India does not make it a major sport. There are at least 100 more major sports in the world in the olympics, which cricket is not, having been removed.

<dd>By population it is a major sport. Conservatively speaking I would put the number of cricket fans in India at 25% the total population.

<dd>Only a complete idiot would regard Google results as "evidence" and cricket is noted for the intelligence of its participants. Besides being the 2nd most popular sport on Earth after football, it is also the 2nd most tactical, after chess. As for the Olympics, there is no doubt whatsoever that football is the most popular sport on the planet but it treats the Olympics with utter contempt (and quite right too because the Olympics is riddled with corruption and drug abuse). In the Olympics, a handful of under-21 football teams compete for "Olympic glory".

<dd>A small point of fact that I can contribute. Since 1900 cricket has never been <i>eligible</i> to be in the Olympics. IOC rules set guidelines for number of countries in which a sport must be established to be included in the Olympics (which cricket easily passes), and also that <i>both men's and women's versions of the sport must be administrated by a single administrative body</i>. The International Cricket Council and International Women's Cricket Councils merged only this year. Cricket's absence from the Olympics says nothing whatsoever about its global presence, as IOC rules prohibited it from being included for a different reason. This argument is getting us nowhere, by the way. I suggest we have an admin look over what has passed, make a decision, and stop fussing over it. -<a href="../../../d/m/m/User%7EDmmaus_1358.html" title="User:Dmmaus">dmmaus</a> 01:43, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Fair enough. Let's get it on.</p>
<p>One of the easiest things to correct, as it's pervasive throughout the entire entry, is the cheap shot at the end.</p>
<p>My grandfather used to teach me that you can learn the most about someone by the way they enter and the way they leave.</p>
<p>There are countless paragraphs in this entry that have a pretense of objectivity, but always end with a shot at O'Reilly.</p>
<p>You'd think the liberals who wrote this would know better than to overplay their hand, but I guess not.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the egregious examples:</p>
<p>NOTE: These are the last sentences of sections pertaining to subjects or people O'Reilly has confronted on the air.</p>
<p>CINDY SHEEHAN "Sheehan subsequently refused to appear on O'Reilly's show, calling The O'Reilly Factor "an obscenity to the truth and an obscenity to humanity."[36]."</p>
<p>LUDACRIS</p>
<p>"O'Reilly, who had voiced strong opposition towards Ludacris' alleged degradation of women, had no retort."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>NEIL BOORTZ</p>
<p>"To this day, Boortz retains a general disdain for O'Reilly, which he shares with fellow Atlantian and occasional studio guest, Ludacris."</p>
<p><br />
JEREMY GLICK</p>
<p>"Glick and his supporters deny O'Reilly's allegations, and maintain that the transcripts show that he said nothing of the sort."</p>
<p>IRAQ &amp; TERRORISM</p>
<p>Actually, it seems like someone cleaned this one up already. It used to be some outright attack from MMFA. Now it just ascribes their disagreement to them. That's a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>But I could go on and on with these last second cheapshots.</p>
<p>Each taken individually by themselves MIGHT BE, by the lowest possible standards, excusable.</p>
<p>But taken as a whole, it paints a picture. A horribly biased picture where, in virtually every SINGLE disagreement, O'Reilly turns out to be wrong.</p>
<p>Even in the French boycott section, where O'Reilly's claim of a one billion dollar trade loss was confirmed, it was phrased in a way that cloaked his vindication.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a hatchet job... straight up.</p>
<p>And I can't believe no one has called Wik out on this before...</p>
<p>big daddy</p>
<p>Ps To break it apart line by line is NOT the way to correct this. I'd say begin by gutting all these unnecessary entries about Glick and Sheehan, all of which add NOTHING to understanding O'Reilly other than to help his political enemies make him out to be an ogre.</p>
<p>In fact, if you read the entire entry from start to scratch, the ultimate conclusion you come away with is that O'Reilly is a right wing bully who pretends to be something he isn't.</p>
<p>What a coincidence!</p>
<p>That's EXACTLY what his political ENEMIES want you to conclude.</p>
<p>This entry is a classic example of old school liberal bias -</p>
<p>Arrange the facts in such a way that no SINGLE point can be entirely disputed but ultimately leaves you with the conclusion THEY want you to have.</p>
<p>Sorry, that is NOT neutrality.</p>

Hip,</p>
<p>I still can't get past the fact that no one...I mean NO ONE. has objected to this HATCHET JOB before.</p>
<p>Check this little piece of the O'Reilly entry out and tell me it's not a TOTAL SMEAR -</p>
<p>" FAIR, a media watchdog group, published a book, The Oh Really? Factor, documenting false accusations and inaccurate statements that O'Reilly has made on his show. FAIR notes that O'Reilly distorts the news by framing it through his bias.[38] For example, after the Supreme Court ruled that public hospitals could not test pregnant women for drugs and send the results to the police without consent, O'Reilly commented: "Coming next, drug addicted pregnant women no longer have anything to fear from the authorities thanks to the Supreme Court. Both sides on this in a moment" (O'Reilly Factor, March 23, 2001)."</p>

<dd>Its day 3 of your wikipedia career--I'll give you a few months. You triggered a bunch of peoples "vandalalarms" with the usertalk in article space, and so the world looked harsher than it was. Conservaburnout seems reasonably prevalant - I'm not going to posit on why. Bold isn't reckless - if you write something, and you think it might piss someone off, best to write it to the talk page first, let people hack at it, and then, if you listen and incorporate the right changes into your proposed change, it's always good. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:51, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For starters, I suggest we replace this entry:</p>
<p>Some critics contend that O'Reilly often makes up facts and figures to support his points. FAIR, a media watchdog group, published a book, The Oh Really? Factor, documenting false accusations and inaccurate statements that O'Reilly has made on his show. FAIR notes that O'Reilly distorts the news by framing it through his bias.[38] For example, after the Supreme Court ruled that public hospitals could not test pregnant women for drugs and send the results to the police without consent, O'Reilly commented: "Coming next, drug addicted pregnant women no longer have anything to fear from the authorities thanks to the Supreme Court. Both sides on this in a moment" (O'Reilly Factor, March 23, 2001).</p>
<p>With....</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
That's right, nothing.</p>
<p>Just get rid of it. It's an unredeemable hatchet job by a left wing organization not even named as such.</p>
<p>If some of you want to defend it's inclusion, knock yourself out. It woul then be only fair to include a section in the Al Franken entry articulating Bill O'Reilly's grievances with him...</p>
<p>After all, we want to remain POV neutral, right?</p>
<p>Big Daddy 03:49, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Could you explain what's wrong with the paragraph without talking about liberal bias or doing bad things to someone else's article? Is FAIR a liberal media watchdog group? I'm done doing research, but the change that I see to that paragraph is "FAIR, a liberal media watchdog group, accuses" <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 04:15, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hip,</p>
<p>The answer to your question is found in your question itself. You asked "Could you explain what's wrong..without..doing bad things to someone else's article?"</p>
<p>Well, the only 'bad' thing I suggested doing to 'someone else's article' is what was done here to O'Reilly. So apparently we are in agreement that it's bad, right?</p>
<p>Ps I've read portions of 'The O'Really Factor' it's a nit picking hatchet job that only brings up tiny minutae that have no bearing on the overall theme of O'Reilly's messages.</p>
<p>It is true that O'Reilly, being kind of an old guy, stumbles on his words a bit and sometimes isn't too artful in expressing his views. (He has gotten a little better lately.)</p>
<p>But to EXPLOIT these insignificant tendencies and leverage them to an entire book is just sad.</p>
<p>And that's what FAIR did. They are his enemies.</p>
<p>Reference to this book has NO place in this article.</p>
<p>They do NOT document false accusations etc. They only SAY they do.</p>
<p>But again, if this is fair game, keep it in. I only want to be evenhanded here. I've got a few comments from O'Reilly and Limbaugh about Al Franken, Bill Maher and Bill Moyers that I'll be HAPPY to include on their pages.</p>

<dd>You can't negotiate tit-for-tat. That's not how it works. Make this article better. I suggested one change to the paragraph, which you failed to comment on. What you suggested was "This article is terrible, and unless I'm able to do with it what I will, I will make this other article just as bad! I don't think this article is bad per-se, but I see areas for improvement. You should feel free to do the same.

<dd>Big Daddy, you say you "only want to be evenhanded here," but it appears that you object to almost every single criticism of Bill O'Reilly in this entry. How is it a fair and evenhanded discussion if the whole entry is candy and flowers, and fails to explain why he is such a controversial figure? The FAIR book is an excellent source for understanding this controversy, even if you don't agree with it. Bill O'Reilly isn't perfect, and as this is supposed to be an objective entry, so both his strengths <i>and</i> his weaknesses should be described objectively and with references. Ignoring half of the story by expunging any criticism is neither fair nor balanced, to coin a phrase. 71.242.227.80 08:48, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hip,</p>
<p>It should be eliminated. Period.</p>
<p>Ps Also the Sheehan segment should go. What the hell does this have to do with Bill O'Reilly? The liberals have tried to turn this into a left wing blog. There's no long term significance to the way O'Reilly covered the Sheehan story.</p>
<p>I edited out that last comment from her about his show. It was TOTALLY gratutious, mean-spirited and hateful. IOW, it's completely consistent with the way non-liberals are treated here in Wikipedi! lol!</p>
<p>I also took out that sentence where Media Matters (of all people) tried to 'clarify her intent' regarding the discrepancy between her first and second interviews about the Bush meetings.</p>
<p>Now THAT is pure liberal spin. Let the facts speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Interview #1: Effusive praise for how Bush handled himself and posed for a photo being kissed by him and holding his hand.</p>
<p>Interview #2: Bush is the anti-Christ.</p>
<p>None of this belongs on O'Reilly's page anyway but let's all please curtail the liberal hack job on every single commentator they don't like.</p>
<p>This is not metafilter.</p>

<dd>I find it incredibly difficult to treat you with respect when you have such utter disrespect for an institution that I have grown to love, and the contributors that have made it what it is. Wikipedia is not about "fighting battles," or "defeating liberals."

<p>Hip writes:</p>
<p>"I find it incredibly difficult to treat you with respect when you have such utter disrespect for an institution..."</p>
<p>Well, I hope you'll re-think that position. I would never disrespect another human being just because I disagree with them about an institution.</p>
<p>If you don't think that, at present, there's just a few reasonable people fighting off an ONSLAUGHT of liberal bias in the articles pertaining to non-liberal commentators, then we're just not reading the same Wikipedia. If you look at the talk page for Ann Coulter and see the nitpicking, church-lady, vicious attacks on her about why she's such a liar and makes stuff up and all the typical boilerplate liberal caluminty, it makes you wonder if you're on Wik or dailykos.com</p>
<p>Not to mention the countless times dailykos, democratic underground and media matters are used as SOURCES! I would never think to use lucianne.com or freerepublic.com etc as resources. It just seems too unseemly.</p>
<p>So, like it or not, this is what I see.</p>
<p>And I think it's a little disingenous of you to play the 'disrespect' card when it's blatantly obvious to any reasonable person just how tilted left these entries are.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, I'm encouraged by the changes that have recently been made.</p>
<p>Plus, I realize in my zeal to propose these changes, I violated several aspects of Wiketiquette which is why I've scaled back my work here so as to get a better feel for how the Wik community operates.</p>
<p>It IS very exciting to be part of something that has such great potential like Wik.</p>
<p>An internationally collaborative effort like this has never been attempted (or even been possible) before.</p>
<p>But it is biased. I'm sorry if that offends you. It's got an inherent bias because so many of the editors are liberals like yourself but somehow think a whole bunch of 'fair-minded' liberals' (which you also are) can create a bias-free encyclopedia.</p>
<p>But, that's just not true. Wik, in my view, needs to admit it has a problem in this regard and go out of it's way to recruit conservative editors.</p>
<p>I notice when I bring these points up you always try to deflect them but never counter with articles that disprove my point.</p>
<p>I think there's a reason for this. You probably can't.</p>
<p>The articles about Al Franken and Michael Moore don't have separate sections, primarily sourced by their SWORN ENEMIES, filled with endless attacks about how bogus they are. Maybe a choice quote here and there, but not complete sections.</p>
<p>But the articles on Coulter, O'Reilly do. (BTW, for a few laughs, go to the Sean Hannity article. It's almost got as much cheap shot criticism and far left liberal links than it does a basic bio!)</p>
<p>In conclusion Hip, I think an apology is more in order. An apology that Wik has been allowed to be OVERRUN by left wing editors that have allowed this stuff to go on for so long.</p>
<p>But, if you want to personally attack my analysis, go ahead. That's another thing that makes Wikipedia great.</p>

HipOCRITE,</p>
<p>I am beginning to question your abilities as an editor here at Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You seem to lack the most basic skills of reading comprehension in addtion to a glaringly obvious lack of common sense. However, I do not want to make this a personal attack. I'm just questioning how you could write the above and consider it a serious response to my comments.</p>
<p>I'm not concerned about a PERSONAL apology to ME.</p>
<p>For one, I'm not offended. But you and all other liberal editors at Wik (and conserative ones for that matter) OWE THE INTERNET COMMUNITY an apology for positing Wikipedia as something that it is not. Neutral. At least not now. (I hope that can change.)</p>
<p>Secondly, if you wanted to apologize, who said you had to 'do it here.' You certainly could have left a message on the Big Daddy Talk page, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, I did provide a 'substantive encyclopedic change' as you put it.</p>
<p>I excised this statement regarding Roger Ailes of Fox News:</p>
<p>"(and architect of the infamous <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Horton_c2c6.html" title="Willie Horton">Willie Horton</a> <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_ad.html" title="Attack ad">attack ad</a>)"</p>
<p>I'm sure you're intelligent enough to figure out why, but for those not quite as bright, let me break it down....</p>
<p>You liberals are insane!! You are so DRIPPING WITH HATE FOR FOX NEWS that you can't even mention Roger Ailes without cheap shotting him?</p>
<p>Why not just say ...'Roger Ailes of Fox News, who has a large ass boil on his right butt cheek!'???</p>
<p>Because that's how the inclusion of that totally out of left field Willy Horton comment in the Bill O'Reilly article appears to any REASONABLE person.</p>
<p>Good God liberals....chill out. The constant oozing of all that hate can't be good for your health...</p>

<p>I edited out this section for the time being. Not because it tries to paint O'Reilly in a bad light or suggest he is a liar (God Forbid!) but because there's no substantiation for it and cable subscriber numbers are as ephemeral as Lindsay Lohan's weigh-ins.</p>
<p>"In actual fact, Fox News Channel is only available on digital cable in Canada, and only has a few thousand viewers; digital cable in general has less than one million subscribers across the country at present."</p>
<p>Does anybody have up to date info regarding Fox in Canada? And, even if you do, will it be up to date 3 months from now? Does this kind of nitpicking even belong in an encyclopedic entry?</p>

<dd>That <i>is</i> the up-to-date situation for Fox News Channel in Canada. Digital cable is not growing that rapidly; <i>particularly</i> not to the point of O'Reilly's claimed eight million viewers. The <b>OTA</b> networks in Canada don't even get eight million viewers for a single program. And as for your editing of the CBC section to read "Critics dispute these numbers and claim that CBC does not have a monopoly on television news in Canada", that the CBC does not have a monopoly on Canadian TV news is not a disputable POV claim, it is an incontrovertible <i>fact</i> (unless you're claiming that <a href="../../../c/t/v/CTV_Newsnet_7a81.html" title="CTV Newsnet">CTV Newsnet</a>, <i><a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_National_434d.html" title="Global National">Global National</a></i> and <a href="../../../c/a/b/CablePulse_24_d1fb.html" title="CablePulse 24">CablePulse 24</a> don't even <i>exist</i>, which is demonstrably false.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:43, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is the purpose of the lengthy 'controversies' section?</span></h2>
<p>The area is easily full of biases, where editors can insert little 'facts' where they attempt to make Bill O'Reilly look bad. While I think his show is terrible, it unsettles me to see an entire list of 'conflicts' akin to the kind of lists you'd find in the 50-Cent article. Many of these do not seem to have any long term significance. For instance, "O'Reilly <i>briefly</i> focused his attention on Barbara Boxer," "<i>Most recently</i> O'Reilly has spoken out against University of Colorado leftist professor Ward Churchill," repeated uses of the 'In X Month of Y Year O'Reilly did Z', many of which again do not have any long term significance or impact on what an encyclopedia article should present.</p>
<p>In fact, most of these little excerpts seem to be deliberately created to pose even more embarassment on Bill O'Reilly. While many of these are valid points that work towards discrediting O'Reilly as a TV commentator, I don't see how these pertain to the standard of quality of an informative encyclopedia that Wikipedia is. In fact, it alarms me that editors would so willfully insert such flagrant bias in these articles. While I myself am not an editor, I am merely giving one casual reader's point of view. I just found this article too ridiculous to not post a comment about this issue. Also, Iraq and Terrorism are not an 'individual', nor is 'Gangsta Rap'. Thanks.</p>
<p>Oh you poor misguided soul...</p>
<p>Don't you know that the liberal editors at Wikipedia feel it is their MISSION TO "discredit O'Reilly as a TV commentator"??</p>
<p>Do you know why, as you put it, "Most of these little excerpts seem to be deliberately created to pose even more embarassment on Bill O'Reilly."?</p>
<p>It's because THEY ARE!!!!</p>
<p>Perhaps, after a little re-programming at the liberal university of some Wikipedia's liberal editor's choice, you'll be able to see the light and recognize that, for many people at Wik, UNFAIRLY trashing those who refuse to tow the liberal party line is what it's all about...</p>

Ps I edited this hit piece on O'Reilly regarding Bill Moyers. It seems the editors who kept this section in were engaging in a little 'selective' editing... I know...Shocked!</p>
<p>Here's how it looks now:</p>
<p>" Moyers responded in print that he never called O'Reilly a warmonger, (but only because "It didn't occur to me")<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_www.truthout.com.765"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_Archive_2_9e2c.html#endnote_www.truthout.com.765" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_Archive_2_9e2c.html#endnote_www.truthout.com.765" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></sup></span> claimed that his share of distribution money from the show is minuscule, and that the <i>Columbia Journalism Review</i> doesn't pick the winner of the duPont-Columbia Award <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_www.truthout.com.765"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_Archive_2_9e2c.html#endnote_www.truthout.com.765" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_Archive_2_9e2c.html#endnote_www.truthout.com.765" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></sup></span> although the Columbia University website states it's responsibilities include "the publication of the Columbia Journalism Review" and "the administration of the ...duPont-Columbia Awards in broadcast journalism."<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/96_99/19019.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/96_99/19019.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> In addition Moyers admitted that his charitable organization, the Schumann Foundation, did provide a grant to the Columbia Journalism Review.</p>
<p>In 2003, O'Reilly criticized Bill Moyers again, saying that Moyers' position that taxes should be raised is "classic socialism" and that he "can't understand why Bill Moyers just doesn't move to <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana.html" title="Havana">Havana</a>". <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_www.foxnews.com.766"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_Archive_2_9e2c.html#endnote_www.foxnews.com.766" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_Archive_2_9e2c.html#endnote_www.foxnews.com.766" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></sup></span>"</p>
<p>Big Daddy 04:22, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Really, how much relevancy does even having the Bill Moyers specific section there in the first place? As well as the whole slew of other people/countries/organizations?</p>
<p>Anyway, should the Andrea Mackis incident remain somewhere lost in the sea of 'disputes' O'Reilly has instead of being its own legitimate section? This is an actual legal allegation of sexual harassment, instead of the continuing petty potshots that these pundits and personalities are taking at each other. I would suggest moving it to its own small section, much like how the O'Reilly apology about the Bush invasion in Iraq near the end of the article got its own.</p>
<p>I've been seeing a couple of other problems, like the BBC section. It begins with <i>O'Reilly, like many other Fox News commentators, regularly accuses the BBC of liberal bias with regard to the war on terror.</i> First of all, the reader has no way of knowing whether or not "many" of these Fox personalities do indeed criticize BBC. Secondly, even if this is true (and true being MANY Fox commentators, not just O'Reilly and Hannity), this has nothing to do with this whole list of disputes being made by O'Reilly and others. Is there any particular reason that this is there, or is this another attempt to surreptiously insert another POV statement for the editor's pleasure? Little things like these filling up the face of this article make me seriously question the validity of Wikipedia as a serious source of information in regards to this article and related topics.</p>
<p>Also, where is the source for the French Embassy document? The article states that <i>France did indeed suffer a 10% loss in exports to the USA - down from $10 to $9 Billion.</i> This doesn't state which year this occurred (though the 'En 2002' in the French part gives the clue, it should still be clarified). Additionally, I am not sure if this is being translated correctly, because according to the Census Bureau data from the link given in the CBC section (number 46), the US imported 30,408,000,000 US dollars worth of goods in 2001, while in 2002 this figure was 28,240,000,000. Since then, the importation of French goods has been increasing.</p>

<p>Wow! So I WAS right about Wikipedia. Look at this quote from a long time Wik editor I uncovered:</p>
<p>"you can only edit the Wikipedia if you conform to the groupthink espoused by the Wikipedia’s core constituency; those who deviate or espouse fundamental changes ... they are persecuted. The rulers of Wikimedia claim to want volunteers to come provide them with “peer-review”; but, when people actually do suggest changes, they are generally ignored – when they ‘unilaterally’ make those changes, they are confronted by hypocrisy and ego."</p>
<p>Hello, hip???? LOL!!!</p>
<p>And listen to this quote from an actual employee: "Former Wikimedia employee Larry Sanger has noted, “[There is] a certain poisonous social [and] political atmosphere in the project.”"</p>
<p><br />
"Politically poisoned atmosphere"...Hmmm...Wonder what kind of politics he's talking about? LOL~!!!</p>

<p>Since I've been here (all of 4 days) I've been called everything from an asswipe to flaccid to you name it. I can't figure out why. All I did was suggest the editors were too liberal in general. I guess trashing and marginalizing conservatives is just part of the Wik culture, huh?</p>

Wow! I feel like Bob Dole. Quit lying about my record! lol!!</p>
<p>For the record, I have received letters of gratitude from conservative editors. How you would know I haven't is curious. Has your stalking of me become so obsessive that you hacked in to my email? lol!!</p>
<p>But I have. I did not make this up and you look very foolish asserting something you would have no knowledge of.</p>
<p>I'm not looking for a fight. I'm looking for fairness. Perhaps to liberals like you, that means a fight. Not to me. But I won't back down either.</p>
<p>"You're lucky that I'm not just shunning you like the rest of the people who know better."</p>
<p>TRANSLATION: The other liberal editors in here, which are legion, are just hoping I'll burnout and go away like so many conservatives before me. Fat chance, sister.</p>
<p>"I asked you to point out diffs where you were called "an asswipe" or "flaccid." I'd very much like to report such eggregious violations of NPA. Please point out the diffs."</p>
<p>I'm not sure what a 'diff' is, but someone sent a letter to my Talk page calling me an asswipe. It was already reported to someone with REAL authority (in the UK) and he told me he reprimanded the person even though it was sent anonymously (apparently zey have zhere ways of finding out zeese zhings!&#160;:)</p>
<p>Plus, one guy (Salty Pig I think) called me LIMPdaddy on several occasions. It was either in the O'Reilly or Coulter Talk pages. While quite discerning in gathering HOW I got my nickname, he certainly was as inaccurate in his characterization as he has been with all his other edits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it may have been removed, but early on someone slammed me with some obscenity. Heck, you follow me wherever I go...just look at what people say to me. You'll see what I'm talking about. (To be fair, some folks have been quite proper.)</p>
<p>But you know, with you being so wrong on almost all the facts here, I think this qualifies you to write an article about ME for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Ps While it's been sorta fun sparring with you Hipocrite, you really are no match for me. I'm actually starting to feel sorry for you now.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can recruit some reinforcements from this 'Silent Majority' you mentioned to make it a little fairer?</p>

<p>Big Daddy 19:45, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good news! I may have found an editor I can work with to form a consensus. Sure, he's a liberal (what wik editor ISN'T? lol!) but he seems fair.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been following this soap opera, it should be painfully obvious by now that the liberal editor hipocrite has completely disqualified herself as any kind of objective voice. Although she first attempted to appear neutral, her most recent posts reflect a quick descent into mean-spirited and, quite frankly chilling, pettiness.</p>
<p>But this other guy, who's gonna first start by working with me on Ann Coulter, seems like he could be good.</p>
<p>One of the first things I want to propose is that if liberals are gonna continue to turn the O'Reilly article into a left wing blog, posting every negative thing about O'Reilly as quickly as they get their marchiing orders from DailyKos, Media Matters or that awful Huffington Report, then we should AT LEAST put it into context.</p>
<p>And here's the context -</p>
<p>"O'Reilly's supporters believe his critics on the left attack him because they resent the fact that a traditionalist wields as much influence in the public sector as O'Reilly."</p>
<p>That's it. Short and sweet.</p>
<p>But then going forward, every time some liberal kook decides to trash the O'Reilly article by adding yet another nitpicking cheap shot to the endless litany already included...</p>
<p><br />
...at least people will understand why.</p>

See what I mean? Petty vindictiveness. Pretty sad, huh?</p>

<p>Flat out accusing me of lying with no evidence presented as in this instance " The conservative editors have not sent you any letters of gratitude." certainly qualifies as a MAJOR&#160;:<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> violation, wouldn't you think?</p>
<p>Same with the implication that I was simply making up the flurry of verbal attacks I've received from liberals since arriving here.</p>
<p>But, though you should be BANNED for Wikipedia for your unconscionable behavior and dereliction of duty to uphold Wik articles as nPOV in this and many other articles, I'll leave that decision to others whom I've also made aware of your crusade against me.</p>
<p>I found a liberal editor who I think is reasonable. We, along with others, should be able to come to a concensus. It's been fun Hip (for me at least) perhaps next time you'll think twice before trashing someone's ideas and motives and then hiding behind the very violations you accuse me of as justification.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">OK - Let's get started on a(n objective) clean-up</span></h2>
<p>I agree that this article has gotten way, way out of control. Theres certainly something to the fact that O'Reilly has sparred with so many public figures - but that's also his gimmick, and what makes his show so entertaining. He chastizes a new politician, tv personality or newspaper columnist every single day! Right now we have a system where as soon as one of them fights back, it ends up as a sub-section in this wikipedia article.</p>
<p>It's simple: if somebody wants to hear about each and every O'Reilly half-truth, they can visit Media Matters or listen to the Al Franken show.</p>
<p>I don't think O'Reilly is much of a calculating liar, he just seems to be one of those people who will pull something out of his a** if the need arises. Which sucks for wikipedia, because everytime he does that somebody adds it to this entry.</p>
<p><b>THE SOLUTION?</b> What we can all agree on is that O'Reilly has a lot of strained relationships in the media, due in part to his strong political views and arguementative approach to interviewing. I think we can boil that sentiment down to less than the hundreds of paragraphs currently dedicated to it.</p>
<p>Perhaps a (short) list of *major* disgressions, with a sentence or two for each? The Glick incident was widely reported and practically the heart of 'Outfoxed', it would surely belong. The PBS-Buster Bunny incident? Has it's place elsewhere on wikipedia, and should not take up space in O'Reilly's entry.</p>
<p>I may make a few major edits to this effect. Even if some of them are reversed, I hope it draws some attention to the clean-up effort.</p>

<p>I have a problem with the lastest addition to that section stating that O'Reilly's allegation is not supported by a transcript of the interview. I read the transcript and it sounds like Glick was so close to blaming Bush for 9/11 that I don't think its appropriate to say O'Reilly's allegation is not supported by it. -- <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 00:56, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. Glick was playing the 'grieving' Sheehan card (before even Sheehan could play it) to get some airtime and then went off on this wacky sermon about the US's role in precipitating 911. I think O'Reilly's claim that he was blaming Bush is accurate. But it's mainly Bush Sr. that Glick ascribes much blame. As for O'Reilly's claim that Glick said Bush Jr. knew about 911, I don't know that he made such a claim, but if he did, I don't believe that can be backed up by just the transcript. Perhaps it was said off air. I think that's what O'Reilly would claim. Big Daddy 14:37, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>The transcript does not not support O'Reilly's recent claim that Glick said that Bush "orchestrated" 9-11. Did he say that to O'Reilly off the air? Total speculation: really grasping at straws. 68.9.184.173 20:22, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I sure hope so. Teflon Don 04:11, 22 October 2005 (UTC) I fear in two more years, Bill O'Reilly, America's top leading news analysis may pass away from heart failure after all that blood pressure rising from screaming. It must affect his heart! After taking a blunt attack from Phil Donahue, Cindy Sheehan, Michael Moore, New Hampshire, and Al Franken it seems like O'Reilly is slowly taking care of his health. He may one day loose his mind and one day say the <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">f-word</a> while interviewing a hard-hitter liberal or conservative that doesn't agree with his twisted views. Unfortunately I have to be the one to see this tragedy. As much as I don't like the guy, it would be a great shame to see someone of that calibar to die over some oddball nonsense. I mean, to loose O'Reilly is a big lost to the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatives.html" title="Conservatives">far right's</a> mouthpiece. Not to be funny, but I am telling you the truth. I hope the man takes this vacation to relieve him of the stress of liberal media and retorts to his lies. <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELILVOKA_f991.html" title="User:LILVOKA">LILVOKA</a>.</p>

<dd>Well, I hope O'Reilly isn't really dying, but what is dying (albeit <i>very</i> slowly) is the outrageous POV that's permeated this article since my arrival. And that's a good thing, right?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The latest casualty to fairness is the edit I made in the section on the French Boycott. I deleted the non-sourced and snarky cheap shot that starts out "(strangely enough, he did not call for a boycott of German products" I also labeled Media Matters as a liberal group which they are.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, no one should have a problem with this. I suppose, the way it's been explained to me, if you can find an impartial notable source that actually said 'strangely enough, blah, blah, blah...' you can put it back in, but why bother?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also took out this <i>gratuitous</i> cheap shot: <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Show_9046.html" title="Daily Show">Daily Show</a> host <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Stewart_101d.html" title="Jon Stewart">Jon Stewart</a> referred to this incident as a "grandiose example of douchebaggery."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I withheld adding this line "Media Matters, which O'Reilly has referred to as a vicious far left wing website."</dd>

<p>This accusation against O'Reilly is alleged to be false. I will remove it to here for now to prevent the use of wikipedia to spread lies any further until we can get to the bottom of this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>===Regarding His background===</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bill O'Reilly has long noted his working-class roots as his inspiration for speaking up for average Americans, or what he calls 'the folks'. He often points to his boyhood home in lower-middle-class Levittown, New York as a credential. As with most details surrounding the man, this has been the subject of much debate:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Al Franken, the <i><a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i>, and others have asserted that O'Reilly did not grow up in Levittown, but instead in a more affluent neighboring village, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westbury%2C_New_York_c746.html" title="Westbury, New York">Westbury</a>. The source the <i>Post</i> used for their assertion was O'Reilly's mother, who at the time a profile of O'Reilly was published in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> still lived in O'Reilly's boyhood home.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_farhi"><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_Archive_2_9e2c.html#endnote_farhi" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_Archive_2_9e2c.html#endnote_farhi" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></sup></span> O'Reilly has indicated in interviews since the article was published, notably including his 2004 appearance on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Late_Show_with_David_Letterman_e8f9.html" title="The Late Show with David Letterman">The Late Show with David Letterman</a></i>, that his mother felt as though she was misinterpreted.</dd>

Franken and O'Reilly critics are playing jurisdictional games as to the location of the house in relation to political boundaries on a map, while O'Reilly and his allies think that Levittown is a state of mind and a reference to the type of people that live there. Unfortunately, that copy of the deed proves nothing because it doesn't have the street address, or else I would compare the location to a map of city limits in 1951 and we would be settled. Of course, there are good reasons not to print the street address of a currently existing house. So my edit, by readding information about <i>O'Reilly's youth</i> in Levittown (which, by the way, should have <b>never been deleted</b> as it is all public information), and being "fair and balanced" about the debate at the end, should please (or at least try to please) all sides. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 05:27, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>we aren't required to please all sides, only to stick to verifiable facts. It is a verifiable fact for which there can be found multiple credible sources that state O'Reilly grew up in an area of tract housing built by the Levitt company and called the <i>Westbury section of Levittown</i><a href="http://www.biography.com/tv/listings/oreilly_b.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biography.com/tv/listings/oreilly_b.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, exactly the answer he gave to Franken, for which Franken called him a liar. There is no burden on O'Reilly to give away his mother's address for your personal satisfaction. As for criticizing deletions, look at the article from a month ago when the section was over three paragraphs long and there were actually some arguments and references in O'Reilly's defense. Here is one of them: <a href="http://www.antonnews.com/levittowntribune/2003/10/24/opinion/manton.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antonnews.com/levittowntribune/2003/10/24/opinion/manton.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. 67.124.200.240 12:38, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Disagree. The article from the Levittown Tribune that you linked clearly states that O'Reilly grew up <i>in the incorporated Village of Westbury</i>, a functioning political jurisdiction. I think Al Franken is trying to make to imply things about Westbury based on the city he grew up in, but even the local Levittown paper doesn't deny that he grew up in <i>the village of Westbury</i>. And there is a burden on O'Reilly to give away information if it proves his case. If he doesn't want to (and <i>not for my own personal satisfaction</i> either, a cheap shot on your part), that's fine, but that stills means this is in inconclusive. Sure he grew up in Levittown, with a Levittown post office, but he was receiving municipal services from Westbury, which because of a bigger tax base might have been better that Billy Joel's municipal services in Hicksville.

As reporter Jack Shafer noted in Slate on July 16, 2004: "O'Reilly said on the July 14 broadcast that he has the deed to his parents' house. I have no reason to doubt him. But as reader Martin J. Gaynes points out, the document on O'Reilly Web site that I linked to is a copy of a portion of his parents' mortgage. A mortgage document doesn't necessarily prove location. A copy of the deed would be more persuasive."</p>
<p>The document I read that O'Reilly posted was in fact a mortgage, not a deed, so I made the appropriate change to the article. --Parkerss 17:31, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bill O'Reilly: <i>"Fox has succeeded by mixing a populist-traditional, pro-American editorial posture with lively debate that includes voices the traditional network news organizations would never allow airtime." "The accusation that Fox is a conservative network is pure propaganda. Poll after poll has demonstrated that Fox's audience is across the board, ideologically and demographically. The latest survey taken by Mediamark Research finds that more ultraconservative viewers watch CNN than Fox."</i> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/109845p-99223c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/109845p-99223c.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. Looks to me like "Traditional" is O'Reilly's weasel word for Conservative, same with "Populist". Funny contradiction there too, First he says Fox is "populist-traditional and pro-American", and then he turns around and says "Fox's audience is across the board". - <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Tibbs_efc1.html" title="User:Mr. Tibbs">Mr. Tibbs</a> 03:47, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fox News is conservative. To deny that would be as big a lie as to say that the ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN are <i>not</i> liberal. I think "traditional" probably is a euphemism for conservative but "populist" is something different. O'Reilly generally is quite conservative but after hearing his complaints recently about big oil companies making too much money recently from gouging I'd entertain the argument he's "populist" or even "authoritarian". Just as with the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> article, I really believe some kind of political description should be in his header section. -- <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 04:15, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alistair, I agree.

IMHO, If we put the word traditionalist in, it should link to a page that gives it some meaning and until then we should leave it out. However, I'm not in favor of having people described solely by their own choice of adjective when many would disagree. If how O'Reilly describes himself, as a <a href="../../../m/o/d/Moderate.html" title="Moderate">moderate</a> is going to be included perhaps something else should be referenced like, "...but many feel he is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">conservative</a> in his views." -- <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawyer2b_bf4c.html" title="User:Lawyer2b">Lawyer2b</a> 20:42, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Until that is done, I have removed that particular entry from this page.</p>
<p>Instead I replaced it with words stating that it is possibly edited for clarity, but I am not certain if he even makes those kinds of edits (which are common for all news shows actually.) The only edits I have known for him to make are splitting the interviews in order to accomodate commercial breaks.</p>

And I also have yet to find evidence of splicing of actual interviews. -- <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Tibbs_efc1.html" title="User:Mr. Tibbs">Mr. Tibbs</a> 18:32, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What should be done, <b>in my oppinion</b> is to allude to the "videogate" incident, to include brief (e.g. 1-3 sentence) synopsis about what the critics believe to have happened, as well as an equally sized synopsis of an official response from either somebody at fox, or O'Reilly himself. Do not link to any biased or one sided sources/links on this particular item (this is a bit of a pet peve of mine on wikipedia, people often link to sources that paint a completely one sided picture, treating the NPOV rules as if they absolutely do not apply to sources) and restrict the information to just the facts. Also a single sentence note about this incident being part of his political commentary (which AFAICT is intended to be Bills oppinion on the issues, and not actual facts) and not an interview would probably be merited as well.</dd>
<dd>Also, on the note of the interviews, it should be noted that even on his most publicised one with Jeremy Glick, he left the whole thing intact. Even where he told the producer to cut his mic, where he told him to shut up, and even where he was giving hand gestures to the studio crew just before the cut to the commercial. One should figure that if he does edit his interviews, that one would have been edited the most of all.</dd>

<dd>I went ahead and modified this particular section to further reflect my suggested changes, except for one thing. I created a wikipedia link to a Videogate page. Somebody should write up an unbiased description of Videogate on that particular page as I don't think any unbiased sources explaning videogate exist anywhere else on the internet.</dd>
