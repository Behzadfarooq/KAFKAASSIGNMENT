<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilden_b635.html" title="Edit section: Personal life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
<p>Tilden was born into a wealthy family that was overshadowed by the death of three older siblings. He lost his semi-invalid mother when he was 15 and, even though his father was still alive and maintained a large house staffed with servants, was sent a few houses away to live with a maiden aunt. The subsequent loss of his father at 19 marked him deeply and tennis was apparently a means of recovery. He dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and began to practice his game against a backboard. According to his biographer, Frank DeFord, because of his early family losses Tilden spent all of his adult life attempting to create a father-son relationship with a long succession of ballboys and youthful tennis protégés, of whom <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinnie_Richards_a211.html" title="Vinnie Richards">Vinnie Richards</a> was the most noted. In spite of his world-wide travels, Tilden lived at his aunt's house until 1941 when he was 48 years old. Tilden had no sexual relationships with women at all and apparently very few sexual encounters with members of his own sex until he was well into his 40s and becoming increasingly effeminate in his mannerisms, particularly in the more liberal atmosphere of 1930s Europe.</p>
<p>Although Tilden almost never drank, he smoked heavily and disdained what today would be considered a healthy life style for an athlete; for most of his life his diet consisted of 3 enormous meals a day of steak and potatoes, with, perhaps, the occasional lamb chop.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilden_b635.html" title="Edit section: Influence on tennis">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influence on tennis</span></h2>
<p>Tilden was a champion player of the 1920s and 1930s who was the single most influential person in the history of tennis. He was also perhaps the most paradoxical figure in the history of any sport — a gay man who almost single-handedly changed the image of tennis from that of a "sissy" country-club sport played only by rich white people in long white pants or ankle-length skirts to that of a major sport played by robust, world-class athletes. The effeminate image of men's tennis during that era was so pervasive that it led <a href="../../../w/2E/c/W.C._Fields_3388.html" title="W.C. Fields">W.C. Fields</a> to comment in one film about two brothers he knew: "One's a tennis player; the other's a manly sort of fellow." (Fields, in real life, also played tennis).</p>
<p>In the United States' sports-mad decade of the <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roaring_Twenties_f9df.html" title="Roaring Twenties">Roaring Twenties</a> Tilden was one of the five dominant figures of the "Golden Era of Sport", along with <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babe_Ruth_8c7f.html" title="Babe Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Grange_b05e.html" title="Red Grange">Red Grange</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Jones_%28golfer%29_9c93.html" title="Bobby Jones (golfer)">Bobby Jones</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Dempsey_2f5f.html" title="Jack Dempsey">Jack Dempsey</a>. His subsequent arrests and convictions on charges of soliciting underage males cast a shadow over his illustrious career.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilden_b635.html" title="Edit section: Greatness as a player">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Greatness as a player</span></h2>
<p>Except for an extended period in the 1950s when <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancho_Gonzales_7fcb.html" title="Pancho Gonzales">Pancho Gonzales</a> completely ruled the men's professional tour, there has never been an era in tennis more dominated by a single player. During a 7-year period in the 1920s it was said that Tilden never lost a single important match, particularly in the <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davis_Cup_b83e.html" title="Davis Cup">Davis Cup</a> matches, which in those days had far more importance than they do today. Among his many achievements, he won the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Open_%28tennis%29_8c25.html" title="U.S. Open (tennis)">United States amateur championship</a> 6 times in succession and 7 times altogether. And from 1920 through 1926 he led the United States team to 7 consecutive Davis Cup victories, a record that is still unequalled.</p>
<p>In the article <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_number_one_male_tennis_player_rankings.html" title="World number one male tennis player rankings">World number one male tennis player rankings</a> with its unofficial but sourced rankings, Tilden is the world's best player for 7 years, second only to Gonzales's 8 No. 1 ratings, tied with <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Laver_74d3.html" title="Rod Laver">Rod Laver</a> but ahead of <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kramer_f483.html" title="Jack Kramer">Jack Kramer</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Rosewall_dfef.html" title="Ken Rosewall">Ken Rosewall</a>, and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Sampras_c14e.html" title="Pete Sampras">Pete Sampras</a>, all of whom had 6.</p>
<p>Unique among tennis players, Tilden became a great player only at the relatively advanced age of 27. Prior to 1920 he had won a number of national doubles titles but had lost to Lindley Murray and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Johnston_1eb0.html" title="Bill Johnston">"Little Bill" Johnston</a> in the 1918 and 1919 singles championships. In the winter of 1919-20 he moved to Rhode Island where, on an indoor court, he devoted himself to remodeling his relatively ineffective backhand. It was all he needed. He emerged with a new grip and a powerful new backhand in the summer of 1920 and for the rest of the decade dominated world tennis.</p>
<p>Tall, lean, and gangly, with long arms, enormous hands, and exceptionally broad shoulders, Tilden possessed what was called at the time a "cannonball" service. Although he could serve aces almost at will, he had little interest in advancing to the net behind his serve. He primarily used spin and slice serves, reserving his famous cannonball for crucial moments in the match. <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allison_Danzig_e1e2.html" title="Allison Danzig">Allison Danzig</a>, the main tennis writer for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a> from 1923 through 1968 and the editor of "The Fireside Book of Tennis", called Tilden the greatest tennis player he had ever seen. "He could run like a deer," Danzig told CBS Sports.</p>
<p>It was little known at the time, but mid-way through the 20s the tip of Tilden's middle finger on his hand that gripped the racquet became infected and had to be amputated. He also had a chronic knee problem that hindered him seriously from time to time. This too was concealed from the public and hardly seemed to impede him in his long string of victories.</p>
<p>In spite of his powerful serve, Tilden preferred to play mostly from the backcourt, where he dazzled opponents with his ever-changing tactics: a mixture of guile, of chopped and sliced shots, of dropshots and lobs, and of sudden powerful ground strokes deep to the corners. He hit superbly angled shots on nearly impossible returns and liked nothing better than to face an opponent who threw powerful serves and ground strokes at him and who rushed the net -- one way or another Tilden would find a way to hit the ball past him.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1941.html" title="1941">1941</a>, when Bill Tilden was 48 years old, he toured the United States playing head-to-head matches with <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Budge_a8ce.html" title="Don Budge">Don Budge</a>, who at that time was incontestably the greatest player in the world. Tilden lost 51 matches to the 25-year-old Budge — but somehow found the means to beat him 7 times. In the whole history of tennis, only <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pancho_Gonzales_7fcb.html" title="Pancho Gonzales">Pancho Gonzales</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Rosewall_dfef.html" title="Ken Rosewall">Ken Rosewall</a> have ever approached the sustained level of Tilden's greatness after reaching the age of 40.</p>
<p>An iconic photograph of Tilden shows him leaping high into the air to hit an overhead smash with classic footwork, form, and power. Some contemporaries, however, considered Tilden's overhead to be the single weakness in his game. Some later commentators felt that a <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960s</a> player such as Ken Rosewall would have been able to exploit this weakness by the deft use of offensive lobs.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilden_b635.html" title="Edit section: Tilden the intellectual">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tilden the intellectual</span></h2>
<p>Tilden may have spent more time analyzing the game of tennis than anyone before or since. He wrote two books about the game, <i>The Art of Lawn Tennis</i> (<a href="http://www.tops4tennis.com/tilden/tilden-intro.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tops4tennis.com/tilden/tilden-intro.html" rel="nofollow">online text</a>) and <i>Match Play and the Spin of the Ball</i>, the latter of which is still in print and is the definitive work on the subject. Besides his great physical abilities, he was an extremely cerebral player, a master of both strategy and tactics, adept at adapting himself to his opponent's style and turning his strengths against him. He was also known for his showmanship, which occasionally veered into what his opponents might have called <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamesmanship.html" title="Gamesmanship">gamesmanship</a>. He always tried to give his paying audience its money's worth and it was frequently written, though never confirmed by Tilden himself, that he would deliberately lose the opening sets of a match in order to prolong the battle and to make it more interesting for both himself and the spectators. (This ploy was confirmed in 1963 by William Lufler, who played on Tilden's pro tour for several years. Lufler, who had become a highly regarded teaching pro — he was instrumental in forming the USPTA, and served as its president 1963-1966 — claimed that Tilden threw the early sets in most matches.) In spite of his occasional overly colorful behavior he was a devout believer in sportsmanship at all costs and above all other aspects of the game, including the final score; he would readily (and dramatically) cede points to his opponent if he thought the umpire had miscalled a shot in Tilden's favor.</p>
<p>Tilden the consummate showman on the court was also a ham and showman in the larger world. He wrote many unsuccessful short stories and novels about misunderstood but sportsman-like tennis players, and dreamed of being a star on <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway_theatre.html" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> and in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. Much of his off-the-court time — as well as his money — was devoted to these pursuits, with failure the inevitable result.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilden_b635.html" title="Edit section: Professional tennis career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Professional tennis career</span></h2>
<p>In the late <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> the great French players known as the <a href="../../../22/f/o/_Four_Musketeers__4205.html" title="&quot;Four Musketeers&quot;">"Four Musketeers"</a> finally wrested the Davis Cup away from Tilden and the United States, as well as his domination of the singles titles at <a href="../../../w/i/m/Wimbledon_Championships_126c.html" title="Wimbledon Championships">Wimbledon</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Hills_475e.html" title="Forest Hills">Forest Hills</a>. Tilden had long been at odds with the draconianly rigid amateur directors of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Tennis_Association_5915.html" title="United States Tennis Association">United States Lawn Tennis Association</a> about his income derived from newspaper articles about tennis. He won his last major championship at Wimbledon in 1930 at the age of 37 but was no longer able to win titles at will. In 1931, in need of money, he turned professional and joined the fledgling pro tour, which had begun only in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>. For the next 15 years he and a handful of other professionals such as <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Nusslein_525e.html" title="Hans Nusslein">Hans Nusslein</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karel_Ko%C5%BEeluh_767f.html" title="Karel Koželuh">Karel Koželuh</a> barnstormed across the United States and Europe in a series of one-night stands, with Tilden still the player that people primarily paid to see. Even with greats such as <a href="../../../e/l/l/Ellsworth_Vines_1d55.html" title="Ellsworth Vines">Ellsworth Vines</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Perry_1cb2.html" title="Fred Perry">Fred Perry</a>, and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Budge_a8ce.html" title="Don Budge">Don Budge</a> as his opponents, all of them current or recent <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_number_one_male_tennis_player_rankings.html" title="World number one male tennis player rankings"><b>World No. 1</b></a> players, it was often Tilden who ensured the box-office receipts -- and who could still hold his own against the much younger players for a first set or even an occasional match. In 1934, he won 11 out of his first 20 matches against Vines. And in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> the 52-year old Tilden and his long-time doubles partner <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vinnie_Richards_a211.html" title="Vinnie Richards">Vinnie Richards</a> won the professional doubles championship -- they had won the United States amateur title 27 years earlier in 1918.</p>

<p>For approximately 35 years, from about 1920 to the mid-1950s, Tilden was generally considered the greatest player who had ever lived, his only rivals being Vines, Budge, and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Kramer_%28tennis_player%29_54cf.html" title="Jack Kramer (tennis player)">Jack Kramer</a>. In the mid-1950s many people began to think that Gonzales had claimed that title. Since then, however, public opinion has swung away from the now nearly forgotten Gonzales to champions of the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_era.html" title="Open era">Open era</a>, first to <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Laver_74d3.html" title="Rod Laver">Rod Laver</a>, then to <a href="../../../b/j/%C3%B6/Bj%C3%B6rn_Borg_3b7a.html" title="Björn Borg">Björn Borg</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McEnroe_e772.html" title="John McEnroe">John McEnroe</a>, and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Sampras_c14e.html" title="Pete Sampras">Pete Sampras</a>, and now perhaps to <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Federer_203b.html" title="Roger Federer">Roger Federer</a>. In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, included Tilden in his list of the 6 greatest players of all time.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tilden, who was one of the most famous athletes in the world for many years, today is not widely remembered despite his former renown. During his lifetime, however, he was a flamboyant character who was never out of the public eye, acting in both movies and plays as well as playing tennis. He also had two arrests for sexual misbehavior with teenage boys in the late 1940s; these led to incarcerations in the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> area. In 1950, in spite of his legal record, which caused him to be shunned by much of the tennis world, an Associated Press poll named Bill Tilden the greatest tennis player of the half-century by a wider margin than that given to any athlete in any other sport.</p>
<p><a name="Prison_terms" id="Prison_terms"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilden_b635.html" title="Edit section: Prison terms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Prison terms</span></h2>
<p>Tilden was first arrested on Nov. 23, 1946 on Sunset Boulevard when he was caught placing his hand in a teenage boy's pants (the boy was a prostitute whose services Tilden had solicited). He could have been charged with a felony ("lewd and lascivious behavior with a minor"), but was charged only with a misdemeanor ("contributing to the delinquency of a minor"). He was sentenced to a year in prison and served 7 1/2 months.</p>
<p>He was arrested again on Jan. 28, 1949, after picking up a 16-year-old hitchhiker and making advances. The new charge could have been prosecuted as a felony, but the judge merely sentenced Tilden to a year on his probation violation and let the punishment for the new molesting charge run concurrently. He served 10 months.</p>
<p>In both cases, apparently, Tilden sincerely believed that his celebrity and his longtime friendship with <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> names such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Chaplin_90da.html" title="Charles Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> were enough to keep him from paying the consequences of his acts. He therefore defended himself in court in both cases in a far less than vigorous fashion.</p>
<p>After his second incarceration Tilden was increasingly shunned by the tennis world. He was unable to give lessons at most clubs and even on public courts he had fewer clients. At one point he was invited to play at a prestigious professional tournament being held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel; at the last moment he was told that he could not participate.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Tilden_b635.html" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>Although Tilden had been born to wealth, and earned large sums of money during his long career, particularly in his early years on the pro tour, he spent it lavishly, keeping a suite at the Algonquin Hotel. Much of his income went towards financing Broadway shows that he wrote, produced, and starred in. The last part of his life was spent quietly and away from his family, occasionally participating in celebrity tennis matches. He died penniless in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, at the age of 60.
