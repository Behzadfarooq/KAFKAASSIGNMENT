<p>Please see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Gothard is a controversial figure, and much of that controversy centers around his authoritarian teaching, and how that has been applied or misapplied--most specifically under his direct authority and leadership. So the controversies belong to his biography, and not just the organization's article. Please do not remove information simply because it is critical or negative. If it is incorrect, please edit it, but do so in a way that adds detail rather than removes detail. Thanks. --<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuckerj_13eb.html" title="User:Stuckerj">Gandalf2000</a> 06:03, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, your request that "any" edits be discussed first is absurd. That isn't how Wikipedia works and you know it.</dd>
<dd>Next, putting uncited (e.g. alleged) sex scandal information about a co-worker and Gothard's brother adds nothing to Gothard's entry. With your logic, we should include the names of every person who has attempted using his teachings and failed. If there is a place for those things, it is on his organization's web site; or better yet, on the individuals' pages and not Bill Gothard's.--<a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a> 06:08, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Jason, thank you for participating. Perhaps you should review the history of this article. Many controversial statements have been deleted without explanation. The controversial statements are substantiated, though I agree citations are thin. It would be better to add a <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> template or do what I did with the sourceless acclamations and endorsements--move the content into the Talk page rather than deleting it. Please remember that it takes effort to summarize and add information to an article, and you're deleting other editors' work with very little respect.--<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuckerj_13eb.html" title="User:Stuckerj">Gandalf2000</a> 06:35, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have put the controversial information back in, with citations. And please re-read my first statement. I did not ask for discussion of "any" edits first. I asked for discussion about <i>removing</i> content. Making factual corrections or style improvements, as well as adding material, is great.--<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuckerj_13eb.html" title="User:Stuckerj">Gandalf2000</a> 06:54, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to explain why I deleted the link to [<a href="http://www.wthr.com/global/story.asp?s=818906&amp;ClientType=Printable" class="external text" title="http://www.wthr.com/global/story.asp?s=818906&amp;ClientType=Printable" rel="nofollow">this</a>] article (linked as "Investigative report of Gothard's Indianapolis Training Center"), it's because [<a href="http://iblp.org/iblp/news/2003/04/002/" class="external text" title="http://iblp.org/iblp/news/2003/04/002/" rel="nofollow">this</a>] other article explains that the charges in the former one are "false, unsubstantiated, and unfounded." Yes, I know that the latter link is from the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_in_Basic_Life_Principles_1370.html" title="Institute in Basic Life Principles">Institute in Basic Life Principles</a>, the organization charged, but an included PDF from the IBLP site is also there as a signed council resolution for what IBLP is saying. Furthermore, searching the [<a href="http://www.wthr.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.wthr.com/" rel="nofollow">WTHR</a>] (news station hosting the article) website for many of the key words in the "Dark Secrets" article (such as "Gothard") provides no results, meaning at least that it's not an article that they've continued to hold in their archives (it's also undated).</p>
<p>Hope this is a sufficient explanation for my actions ^^ (I'm still a newbie, so any corrections will be accepted kindly, yes they will!). Thanks, <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeien_ea45.html" title="User:Weien">Weien</a> 04:45, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>A perfectly reasonable perspective. I'll take a closer look at it, later. My thinking, actually, is that all of this should be merged under a Gothard article. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 17:46, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This [<a href="http://www.midwestoutreach.org/02-Information/02-OnlineReference/04-Etc/02-TreeHuggersReader/News/2002Q1/2002-03-22GothardITC.html" class="external text" title="http://www.midwestoutreach.org/02-Information/02-OnlineReference/04-Etc/02-TreeHuggersReader/News/2002Q1/2002-03-22GothardITC.html" rel="nofollow">Midwest Christian Outreach article</a>] provides a middle perspective on this series of events. It is important to recognize that the WTHR article provides very typical examples of many of the objections to Gothard and IBLP, though clearly with a negative POV.--<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuckerj_13eb.html" title="User:Stuckerj">Gandalf2000</a> 16:14, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>My suggestion would be to summarize and include links to both the WTHR article and the city council resolution, which together would provide balanced, NPOV.--<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuckerj_13eb.html" title="User:Stuckerj">Gandalf2000</a> 16:18, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The MCO article indeed speaks from a rather fair viewpoint ^^. But linking to both the WTHR article and the resolution--doesn't the resolution kind of cancel out the WTHR? Or, with that point conceded, would they be presented as a pair, where "WTHR said such-and-such, and in response the city council said such-and-such?" One thought I have been chewing over (but have been too afraid to voice ^^) is possibly creating a "Gothard Controversies" article (linked to in the normal <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gothard_56b6.html" title="Bill Gothard">Bill Gothard</a> article), for a tighter presentation of the hotter issues concerning both Gothard and <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_in_Basic_Life_Principles_1370.html" title="Institute in Basic Life Principles">IBLP</a>. After all, from what I see, one of (if not the) main things that those two articles have in common (i.e. overlap) is the controveries and criticism (notice how the "controversies" section of the IBLP article kinda takes over XD). Then again, there are many in favor of deleting the Bill Gothard/IBLP articles altogether, so I think the last thing they want is <i>another</i> related article. Ideas?</li>

<dd>At a minimum, I agree that this episode is a good illustration of the controversy(ies), and MCO summarizes the issues quite well.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To address your other point, I think these two articles are progressing quite well. There is a summary of issues on Gothard's page, relating to him as a central figure, and more details on the IBLP page. I think the normal editing process will take care of it, without any drastic reorganization or restructuring. Of course, if someone with a boatload of relevant information wants to add to the pages, that's great, and may justify overhaul, but I think the AfD and merge suggestions are completely unnecessary.--<a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuckerj_13eb.html" title="User:Stuckerj">Gandalf2000</a> 23:43, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True enough; though it might need at least a semi-significant amount of "the normal editing process" to make Bill Gothard look like less of a monster that everyone hates (rather than simply a controversial figure in the Christian world). At least, that's being said as almost every section in the article has something to say along the lines of his controversies and criticisms (including the summary). And correct me if I'm wrong, but the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_in_Basic_Life_Principles_1370.html" title="Institute in Basic Life Principles">IBLP</a> page seems to follow a similar pattern. On the bright side, the "See Also" section doesn't mention any scandals at all&#160;;). Anyway, sorry about the rant... hopefully I'll be able to justify it by adding some relatively tame information to these pages in the future. And again, thanks for your replies (let me know if I'm getting out of line!). <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeien_ea45.html" title="User:Weien">Weien</a> 06:22, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Harvestdancer, if we add substantially to both the <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gothard_56b6.html" title="Bill Gothard">Bill Gothard</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_in_Basic_Life_Principles_1370.html" title="Institute in Basic Life Principles">IBLP</a> pages (resulting in two related but distinct articles as opposed to two articles both focusing about the IBLP/Gothard controveries) in the mid-future, would that warrant that the two articles remain separate? Or would a merge still be in order regardless? But regarding the Forty-nine character virtues article, perhaps it could just go altogether, or work better as part of Character First!

<dd>They are seminars or workshops, though, not "churches." These are very different things. A church has members who regularly attend worship, generally at a particular place of worhip, and has a hierarchy of pastoral staff (sometimes this does not hold true, although it almost certainly would for any "megachurch"). These seminars were not designed to take the place of the attendees' regular church activities, but rather to supplement them with relatively short, (usually) one-time workshops. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">Dick Clark</a> 21:00, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I edited the brief description of Mr. Hill.

Mr. Hill is the retired chairman of a company that makes supplies for oil and gas pipelines. They are a manufacturing company, and therefore Mr. Hill is no more an oil tycoon than Bill Ford, Jr. (For the record, Mr. Hill is an acquaintance of mine.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Gothard_412a.html" title="Edit section: FeloniousMonk reversion of improvements June 8, 2006">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">FeloniousMonk reversion of improvements June 8, 2006</span></h2>
<p>I made a number of improvements and additions to this article which user FeloniousMonk has recently reverted by saying "whitewash POV" or something similiar. He advised me to discuss my changes on the talk page, which I will do, but I intend for FeloniousMonk to explain his deletion of information from this article as well. It is unfair that only I should be participating in these discussions, while FeloniousMonk sits on a big revert button, erasing lots of hard work and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable information</a> that improved the article.</p>
<p>I improved the article thusly:</p>
<p>1. Originally there was a sentence that read: "His solution to family and youth problems is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">conservative</a>, some argue <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultraconservative.html" title="Ultraconservative">ultraconservative</a>, view of family life" This sentence doesn't even make sense. How can a "view of family life" be a "solution to family and youth problems"? Also, including the term <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultraconservative.html" title="Ultraconservative">ultraconservative</a> with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">conservative</a> in the same sentence, when both wikilinked terms lead to the exact same article is silly. I changed this sentence thusly: "His views on how to handle family and youth problems are considered very <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative.html" title="Conservative">conservative</a>." My sentence actually make sense and still leaves the reader with the notion that Gothard is on the more conservative side of the spectrum without using biased terms such as "ultraconservative".</p>
<p>2. The article used to have this sentence: <i>"Yet, critics of Gothard and IBLP believe that it is <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarian.html" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legalism_%28theology%29.html" title="Legalism (theology)">legalistic</a> in nature, and that he does not always "practice what he preaches".</i>. I changed this to read: "However at least one critic of Gothard believes that his views are too <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarian.html" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legalism_%28theology%29.html" title="Legalism (theology)">legalistic</a> in nature, and some critics have even accused Gothard of hypocrisy." There is only one critic that was cited that wrote that Gothard's view are too <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authoritarian.html" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legalism_%28theology%29.html" title="Legalism (theology)">legalistic</a> in nature. Really there is only one citation that shows that Gothard was accused of not always "practice what he preaches", so perhaps even my version leaves the reader with an undue idea that there are numerous critics of Gothard that have stated that he was a hypocrite. Using terms like, "Critics say" are <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a> that should be avoided. We should specify exactly who these critics are, especially since it appears as though the number of cited critics of the man is approximately 2 people.</p>
<p>3. I also made a number of improvements to the references section and in the article itself where blank references to web pages were left with no "ref" tags to explain who or what the person is that made the claim. I also named some references so that they could be reused, since there was duplication in the references section and a single reference was being used for numerous claims in the article.</p>
<p>4. I did a major improvement to the controversies and criticism section. I explained that Gothard is being criticized mainly by two seperate small groups that print quarterly religious journals about groups they believe to be cultic in nature. These groups are primarily the work of a few individuals and these two groups cannot be said to speak for the "evangelical" movement or even a significant portion of that movement. The two quarterly journals are not widely read well-respected journals in the field of religion. They are not peer-reviewed. Using them as sources for information presents problems with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, and also with the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">guidelines on how we are to create articles about living persons</a>. However, I am willing to leave the fact that Gothard has been criticized by a few people, but I want it to be made perfectly clear exactly who or what is criticizing him.</p>
<p>5. I removed claims where the only source of information was provided as <a href="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard" class="external free" title="http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard" rel="nofollow">http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard</a>. This is a personal website that belongs to John &amp; Kathy Beardsley. These people are not qualified to speak on Bill Gothard. According to the policy of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and the guidelines of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, personal websites such as this are not appropriate to be used as sources for information in an encyclopedia article -- especially for one that is critical of a living person -- for which the guidelines about <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living persons</a> says we should take extra precaution to make sure that the claims presented are verifiable. Here is a relevant section from WP:BLP to consider: "<b>Opinions of critics, opponents, and detractors</b>: The views of critics should be represented if their views are relevant to the subject's notability and are based on reliable sources, and so long as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article or appear to side with the critics' material. Be careful not to give a disproportionate amount of space to critics in case you represent a minority view as if it were the majority one. If the criticism represents the views of a tiny minority, it has no place in the article. Criticism should be sourced to reliable sources and should be about the subject of the article specifically. Beware of claims that rely on guilt by association."</p>
<p>I am willing to discuss these issues with the ultimate goal of reaching a consensus or compromise on how to best present the information in this article. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 21:07, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Peer review for religious journals? Religion ain't science</i> There exist hundreds of peer-reviewed religious journals. These exist to evaluate the factual claims that are made by other writers and researchers in the field of religion. They can also evaluate the philosophy and the logic used by other religious researchers. And we aren't even talking about "evaluating a religion". These "religious journals" are being used in these articles to make positive assertions that people have committed certain acts or that certain events have happened. Non-peer-reviewed self-published journals by biased sources are not an acceptable place to find this kind of information.

<dd><i>If he were criticized in writing by a hundred people, would you want refs for all hundred people?</i>. If he were criticized in writing by a hundred people then there would be multiple references that would say he has been criticized by over a hundred different people...or that he as been criticized by a large number of people. My suggestion to specify the actual names and identities of critics is what is appropriate. Please read the style guide <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words</a>, where it says, "Here are some weasel words that are often found in Wikipedia articles (but shouldn't be):" and then lists, ""Critics/experts say that..." Then later on the style guide tells us how to deal with such weasel words and specifically gives an example how to change a statement from "Critics say...." to "So and so wrote that...". Now certainly there can be exceptions to this, as the guide suggests, such as when "the holders of the opinion are too diverse or numerous to qualify". But it is clear that the holders of this opinion are absolutely not too diverse or numerous to qualify. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 16:53, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In fact, BDM is a "group" where you can discover such things as: TBN (home to the 700 Club) and Pat Robertson are blasphemers helping spread secular filth, that someone is wearing Hitler’s secret Mormon underwear, that Elvis Presley is burning in Hell (and Billy Graham will be joining him there), and of course that Bob Jones University is anything but a bastion of Bible Christianity. Did you know that Bob Jones allows sodomites to view his collection of blasphemous “sacred art” and sponsors a demonic karate team? <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 00:33, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article used weasel words, like "some critics" and "critics said". I have added information that provides the proper citations for the exact claims made and information identifying the critics that made those claims. It is not appropriate, especially in an article that is a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biography of a living person</a> to make these types of poorly sourced claims. This is exactly the kind of article that Jimbo Wales was referring to when he talked about how editors should NOT handle biographies of living people. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 01:20, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "coverage" of the sex scandal was published by one man in one book, however in this article it was written about as if it was a factual claim of Wikipedia that these things happened, when it was only an allegation made by this man in his book. All you need to do is properly specify who is making the claims and the authority that they have to make those claims. And again you seem to indicate that you think I have a POV -- which you have also claimed in other places. So again, I will state emphatically that my POV with respect to Bill Gothard is that I do not like him. I do not support his ministry. I am not a Christian. I am not religious at all. My only concern is that Felonious Monk and his very tiny cabal have decided that they can ignore the policies and guidelines of Wikipedia when it gives them a chance to make fun of or disparage people that they don't like -- which in FeloniousMonk's case, involves a number of Conservative Christian ministers. Now I don't like these people either, but that doesn't give FeloniousMonk or myself the right to violate Wikipedia policies in order to defame them with poorly sourced or unsourced claims. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 08:46, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>MTIA never claimed to be a medical school, so including this information in the article is unwarranted and looks childish and ridiculous. And I haven't seen how promoting prayer to reduce a woman's fear is medical advice that contradicts conventional medicine. You are trying to make it seem like Gothard is telling people to ignore conventional medical therapy and seek a prayer alternative, like the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Scientists_7430.html" title="Christian Scientists">Christian Scientists</a> do, but I nothing sourced that makes that assertion. Is it really controversial that a preacher would suggest prayer to someone that is sick? Will you also include this information for every other religion on the face of the earth that also prays over the sick and dying? It seems pretty superfluous to me. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 21:55, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is important to include the fact that it is a certified non-profit by the IRS to the article. This certainly doesn't mean that it is a completely legitimate organization, but the IRS does require certain standards to be met to become certified as a religious charitable organization, lots of groups don't make the cut, but IBLP does. However, your point is taken, that they could have had a net income that was reinvested. As the <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-profit.html" title="Non-profit">non-profit</a> article discusses, the proper term should be not-for-profit. <a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaldi_8033.html" title="User:Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a> (<a href="../../../v/i/v/User_talk%7EVivaldi_d6d0.html" title="User talk:Vivaldi">talk</a>) 03:11, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You watch your POV. You've let your desire to defame Gothard cloud your judgement. You also reverted the addition of ref tags! What possible reason could you have for that? Also, MTIA doesn't purport to be a medical school, it never has. And this article isn't the place to get into a debate about the effectivity of prayer. There are numerous people on both sides of that issue, and a number of them are medical schools and hospitals that are affiliated with religious organizations. I personally don't think prayer does anything more than placebo, but again this isn't the place for that debate. This line is completely out of place in this section. If you want to cite some sources that explain how Gothard advises people to ignore conventional medicine and seek prayer therapy instead then go ahead and do that and put the information in a section about why some people have criticized Gothard. I don't see anything in his work where he suggests people shouldn't follow the advice of their chosen doctor, but if you have that information, then add it to the article and cite your sources. Also, you may remember that Gothard is a living person and thus this article is subject to the guidelines at <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. Keep that in mind next time you add a statement that defames a living person.

<dd>FWIW, I looked at his edits, and I agree. Clear agenda. And it's not the agenda that's bad...everyone has one...it's bring that agenda into Wikipedia and violating NPOV that is harmful. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 14:45, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Gothard_412a.html" title="Edit section: NPOV">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">NPOV</span></h2>
<p>Hey guys. A line about Bill Gothard with the weasel words "considered even by many evangelical to be cultish" in the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Courtship_9489.html" title="Biblical Courtship">Biblical Courtship</a> article brought me here. For the record...I'm familiar with Gothard's ministry and teachings, would probably agree with a good portion (as I suspect even critics would if they were honest) but also strongly disagree with a good portion (views on homeschooling, women in the church and music in particular). So that's my background, though I don't have any agenda for Wikipedia other than fairness.</p>
<p>This article - to me - reeks of NPOV. Why? Not because of uncited sources...but because 40% of the article is dedicated to who Gothard is (biography) and 60% is dedicated to criticisms. Let's have some balance, maybe? I'm all for criticisms, but I'm dead-set against Wikipedia becoming an encyclopedia of so-called "Christian watchdog" opinions.</p>
<p>What I think would be better is to either (1) reduce the number of words in the criticism section to be more in line with a true biographic article, or (2) add a section that gives the details of his teachings. It's NPOV to spend half a sentance discussing Gothard's views on authority and then five sentances discussing the criticism of that view.</p>
<p>I'm tempted to put up the NPOV flag immediately, but there seems to have been discussion here recently and if anyone is still watching this page, leave your comments. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Schroder_d6a6.html" title="User:David Schroder">David Schroder</a> 14:40, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
