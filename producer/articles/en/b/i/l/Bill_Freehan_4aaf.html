<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Freehan_4aaf.html" title="Edit section: Career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
<p>Freehan attended the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Michigan_a8fd.html" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, where he set an all-time <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Ten_Conference_77c8.html" title="Big Ten Conference">Big Ten Conference</a> batting mark of .585 in 1961 and also played <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_football.html" title="College football">football</a>. He signed with his hometown Tigers in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961_in_baseball.html" title="1961 in baseball">1961</a> for a $100,000 bonus, which his father withheld until he graduated in 1966, and broke in briefly with 4 games at the end of the season before returning to the minors in 1962. In 1963 he arrived in the majors to stay, working with former catcher <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Ferrell_9386.html" title="Rick Ferrell">Rick Ferrell</a> on his defense and splitting catching duties with <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gus_Triandos_5c14.html" title="Gus Triandos">Gus Triandos</a>, who was traded following the season. The <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_in_baseball.html" title="1964 in baseball">1964</a> campaign gave indications of what was to come; he <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batted</a> .300 to finish sixth in the AL, along with 18 home runs and 80 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_batted_in.html" title="Run batted in">runs batted in</a>. He also earned the first of ten consecutive All-Star selections, and placed seventh in the MVP balloting. In 1965 he led the AL in putouts for the first of six times, and received his first of his five consecutive Gold Gloves. In 1966 he again led the league in putouts, and also led in fielding average for the first of three times.</p>
<p><a href="../../../1/9/6/1967_in_baseball.html" title="1967 in baseball">1967</a> was his best season yet, as he batted .282 – ninth in the AL as averages hit an all-time low – with 20 home runs, and broke <a href="../../../e/l/s/Elston_Howard_80d0.html" title="Elston Howard">Elston Howard</a>'s <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_in_baseball.html" title="1964 in baseball">1964</a> AL single-season records with 950 putouts and 1021 total chances. Freehan led the league in both <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intentional_base_on_balls.html" title="Intentional base on balls">intentional walks</a> and times <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_by_pitch.html" title="Hit by pitch">hit by pitch</a>, and finished third in the MVP voting after Detroit came within one game of the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> for the AL pennant.</p>
<p>He had an even better year in 1968 as he was considered the quiet leader of the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_World_Series_461d.html" title="1968 World Series">1968 World Series</a> championship squad, posting career highs with 25 home runs and 84 RBI, fifth and sixth in the AL respectively. McLain won 31 games and Lolich won 17 as the Tigers ran away with the pennant; despite playing in hitter-friendly <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tiger_Stadium_%28Detroit%29_4914.html" title="Tiger Stadium (Detroit)">Tiger Stadium</a>, the team was third in the AL with a staff <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_run_average.html" title="Earned run average">earned run average</a> of 2.71. Freehan broke his own records with 971 putouts and 1050 total chances, marks which remained AL records until <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Wilson_%28baseball_player%29_5de9.html" title="Dan Wilson (baseball player)">Dan Wilson</a> topped them with the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_in_baseball.html" title="1997 in baseball">1997</a> <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_Mariners_8d2e.html" title="Seattle Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a>; Wilson broke his record for career fielding average in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_in_baseball.html" title="2002 in baseball">2002</a>. He was also hit by 24 pitches, the most in the AL since <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kid_Elberfeld_a82d.html" title="Kid Elberfeld">Kid Elberfeld</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911_in_baseball.html" title="1911 in baseball">1911</a>. He finished second to McLain in the MVP voting; he and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Yastrzemski_7d82.html" title="Carl Yastrzemski">Carl Yastrzemski</a> were the only players to finish in the top ten of the voting in both 1967 and 1968, and only Yastrzemski reached base more often in 1968. He capped his season by recording the final out of the World Series against the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, retiring <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_McCarver_072d.html" title="Tim McCarver">Tim McCarver</a> on a popup. He also made a pivotal play in Game 5, with the Cardinals leading the Series 3-1 and the game 3-2. In the fifth inning, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Brock_e26f.html" title="Lou Brock">Lou Brock</a> – whom Freehan had thrown out on an attempted <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stolen_base.html" title="Stolen base">steal</a> in the third inning – <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_%28baseball%29.html" title="Double (baseball)">doubled</a> with one out and attempted to score on <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julian_Javier_421f.html" title="Julian Javier">Julian Javier</a>'s single, but Freehan held on to the ball even though Brock came in standing up in an attempt to knock the ball loose. Detroit won by scoring three runs in the seventh inning, and went on to take the last two games.</p>
<p>Although his later seasons rarely approached the brilliance of those two campaigns, he continued to turn out All-Star years for the Tigers. In 1971 he batted .277 with 21 home runs, and he hit .262 for the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_in_baseball.html" title="1972 in baseball">1972</a> Eastern Division champions. He missed the first two games (both losses) of the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972_American_League_Championship_Series_ac15.html" title="1972 American League Championship Series">1972 American League Championship Series</a> against the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Athletics_6739.html" title="Oakland Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> while recovering from a hairline fracture of his thumb, then doubled and homered in a 3-0 Game 3 win, in which <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Coleman_%28MLB_pitcher_1965-1979%29_cc67.html" title="Joe Coleman (MLB pitcher 1965-1979)">Joe Coleman</a> set an LCS record with 14 <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strikeout.html" title="Strikeout">strikeouts</a>. Freehan drove in the first of three runs in the tenth inning of Game 4 in a memorable 4-3 come-from-behind victory which tied the series; he also drove in Detroit's only run in the 2-1 Game 5 loss. In 1974, playing primarily at <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_baseman.html" title="First baseman">first base</a>, he finished fifth in the AL in <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slugging_average.html" title="Slugging average">slugging average</a> with a .479 mark. He moved back behind the plate the following year to earn his eleventh All-Star berth. In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973_in_baseball.html" title="1973 in baseball">1973</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974_in_baseball.html" title="1974 in baseball">1974</a> he surpassed Berra to become the AL's all-time leader in putouts and total chances; he broke <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Roseboro_9948.html" title="Johnny Roseboro">Johnny Roseboro</a>'s major league marks in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_in_baseball.html" title="1975 in baseball">1975</a>. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Boone_6807.html" title="Bob Boone">Bob Boone</a> broke his major league mark for career total chances in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_in_baseball.html" title="1987 in baseball">1987</a>, and Boone and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Carter_fefb.html" title="Gary Carter">Gary Carter</a> surpassed his putouts total in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988_in_baseball.html" title="1988 in baseball">1988</a>; <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton_Fisk_a877.html" title="Carlton Fisk">Carlton Fisk</a> broke his AL records in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989_in_baseball.html" title="1989 in baseball">1989</a> (total chances) and <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990_in_baseball.html" title="1990 in baseball">1990</a> (putouts). Freehan ended his career in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_in_baseball.html" title="1976 in baseball">1976</a>, batting .270.</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Freehan was a .262 hitter with 241 doubles and 758 RBI in 1774 games. In addition to his HRs and total bases, his .412 slugging average and totals of 1591 <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_%28baseball%29.html" title="Hit (baseball)">hits</a>, 706 <a href="../../../r/u/n/Run_%28baseball%29.html" title="Run (baseball)">runs</a> and 476 <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra_base_hit.html" title="Extra base hit">extra base hits</a> all put him among the top five AL catchers to that time. His batting totals are particularly remarkable in light of the fact that offense was at a low throughout the sport during his career, with a decided advantage toward <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcher.html" title="Pitcher">pitchers</a>. He also ranked sixth in AL history with 114 times being hit by a pitch.</p>
<p>After retiring, he coached Tigers catcher <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lance_Parrish_8250.html" title="Lance Parrish">Lance Parrish</a> on the fine points of playing his position. He returned to the University of Michigan as head coach of the baseball team from 1989 to 1995.</p>
