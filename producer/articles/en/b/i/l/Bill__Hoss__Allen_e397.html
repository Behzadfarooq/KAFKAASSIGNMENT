<p>Allen was reared in the small town of Gallatin, some 35 miles northeast of Nashville, by an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> domestic who worked for his grandparents. Because she was primarily responsible for his nurturing and upbringing (which included taking the young Bill Allen to church with her on Sundays, where he first heard gospel music), he identified primarily with black youngsters as playmates and peers, something highly unusual for the still strongly-segregated <a href="../../../s/o/u/South.html" title="South">South</a>. Allen got the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickname.html" title="Nickname">nickname</a> "Hoss" from his grandfather, because of his tall, athletic frame.</p>
<p>He became a <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> musician as a youngster and played, during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, in <a href="../../../u/s/o/USO_aad2.html" title="USO">USO</a> shows abroad. After peace came, he enrolled as an English major at <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanderbilt_University_3e3f.html" title="Vanderbilt University">Vanderbilt University</a>, where he developed a reputation as a strong amateur actor. Although he considered joining the professional theater at one point, Allen decided instead to enter the more promising field of radio instead, going to work for Gallatin station WIHN in 1948. There, he imitated Gene Nobles' routine of playing R&amp;B and jazz tunes, mixed in with standard <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop music</a>. His success was so great, that, after only a few months, he got the courage to approach WLAC for a job there.</p>

<p>Much like John Richbourg, Allen first went on air at WLAC as, of all things, a talk-show host, but eventually parlayed that into selling ads and producing programs. But the real aim of his labors would open itself up in the mid-1950s, when Nobles took a several-years-long leave of absence from his nightly program. Allen established himself in that slot, peppering liberal amounts of songs by the likes of <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Charles_5e75.html" title="Ray Charles">Ray Charles</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Richard_892a.html" title="Little Richard">Little Richard</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fats_Domino_5ed0.html" title="Fats Domino">Fats Domino</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lee_Hooker_e754.html" title="John Lee Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a> with "jive talk"-style commercials, most notably for sponsors Royal Crown Hair Dressing (unrelated to the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Crown_Cola_6023.html" title="Royal Crown Cola">cola drink</a>) and Buckley's Record Shop, a Nashville-based mail-order business.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill__Hoss__Allen_e397.html" title="Edit section: The &quot;Hugh Baby&quot; interlude">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The "Hugh Baby" interlude</span></h2>
<p>Allen's popularity grew steadily until the early 1960s, when he decided to branch out into the record business itself, taking a job with a label as a field representative. Replacing him at the station for several years was "Hugh Baby" Jarrett, a former member of The Jordannaires vocal group, which backed <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> at his height of stardom. Jarrett took the "hep cat" idiom into a younger direction, staging <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sock_hop.html" title="Sock hop">sock hop</a> dances, rotating more <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockabilly.html" title="Rockabilly">rockabilly</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_and_roll.html" title="Rock and roll">rock and roll</a> into the blues/R&amp;B playlist, and "pushing the envelope" by dropping sexually suggestive <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_entendres.html" title="Double entendres">double entendres</a> in the product advertisements. The latter practice eventually led to his termination by WLAC, after receiving a reprimand by the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> over an incident; Jarrett later lived down that career mistake by compiling a lengthy run on several <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlanta.html" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>-area stations. Happily, Allen was willing to return to the station afterward, and he resumed his nightly programs.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill__Hoss__Allen_e397.html" title="Edit section: Keeping the beat into the 1970s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Keeping the beat into the 1970s</span></h2>
<p>Allen kept spinning the newest releases from the likes of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Cooke_7cb2.html" title="Sam Cooke">Sam Cooke</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/d/Muddy_Waters_a6ef.html" title="Muddy Waters">Muddy Waters</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/e/Aretha_Franklin_5ce5.html" title="Aretha Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a>, while paying attention to the new soul scenes developing in the mid-1960s in two nearby cities: <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muscle_Shoals%2C_Alabama_2ba6.html" title="Muscle Shoals, Alabama">Muscle Shoals</a>. His playlist varied from Richbourg, Nobles, and Grizzard mainly in that he emphasized, to a somewhat greater extent, newer releases on his one-to-two-hour shows, heard six nights per week.</p>
<p>Furthermore, "the Hossman" took full advantage of his fame to indulge in passions such as drinking and womanizing, according to Wes Smith, author of "The Pied Pipers of Rock 'n' Roll: Radio Deejays of the 50s and 60s" (Longstreet Press, 1989). These activities led to several run-ins with station management and the occasional problem with police. But Allen finally admitted to <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a> in the early 1970s and obtained treatment for his condition, quite likely prolonging his life.</p>
<p>Allen hosted a short-lived <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_syndication.html" title="Television syndication">syndicated</a> television show in 1966 titled <b>"The!!!Beat"</b>. This program, of course, featured most of the same artists he played on radio. Episodes of this program were recorded at a <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas.html" title="Dallas">Dallas</a> television station, where color facilities were available, something none of the Nashville stations had yet.</p>
<p>All 26 episodes of the show are currently available on DVD. Allen hosts all but the last show. Reportedly, Allen was so distraught that the show had been cancelled, that his drinking got the best of him and he was unable to host the final show. A very understanding and enthusiastic <a href="../../../o/t/i/Otis_Redding_097d.html" title="Otis Redding">Otis Redding</a> stepped in as host.</p>
<p><a name="Surviving_the_purge" id="Surviving_the_purge"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill__Hoss__Allen_e397.html" title="Edit section: Surviving the purge">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Surviving the purge</span></h2>
<p>In the early 1970s, when longtime cohorts Richbourg and Nobles decided to quit rather than tailor their programs to a new management's desire for the entire station schedule to conform to a pop hits format, Allen opted instead, because he was years away from retirement age, to quietly adjust toward more <a href="../../../f/u/n/Funk.html" title="Funk">funk</a> and smooth soul offerings, discontinuing most of the oldies he had been playing. By early 1975, "the Hossman" was the lone jockey still working at WLAC from five years earlier; after a brief absence from the airwaves, he reformatted his show as "Early Morning Gospel Time With The Hossman," a showcase for national and regional soul gospel acts, moving it to the overnight shift from late evening. Since he had been taping his programs from about 1970 onward, this proved to be little if any problem.</p>
<p>For about ten years after that move, Allen assumed a much lower public profile, working in his off-station time as a music producer for several local acts. However, WLAC's sister station, WLAC-FM (now <a href="../../../w/n/r/WNRQ_3410.html" title="WNRQ">WNRQ</a>), used his voice in the mid-1980s for a promotional campaign. This brought his memorable drawling sound back to public consciousness, and ad agencies began to enlist him to supply voiceovers on various radio and television commercials. This became a quite lucrative business for him for several years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Allen continued his gospel show, a favorite among his old African-American listeners in particular, until 1993, some years after WLAC abandoned all other music altogether in favor of a news and talk format in the daytime and paid religion in the evening hours. Although he made a brief attempt to revive his R&amp;B/soul/blues show on Saturday evenings in 1986 and 1987, it collapsed due to lack of promotion and pre-emptions by Vanderbilt football and basketball coverage, to which WLAC held the rights at the time.</p>
<p>After stepping down from regular work on radio, Allen continued his instantly recognizable voiceover projects until about a year or so before his death. Allen was the final of the four jockeys that constituted what fans termed "the 50,000 Watt Quartet."</p>

<b>"Bless your heart"</b>--Allen used this phrase constantly; derived from a traditional <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern.html" title="Southern">Southern</a> religious greeting<br />
<b>"Camelot time"</b>--informal name for his nightly shows<br />
<b>"Git down time"</b>--phrase originally referred, in the mid 20th-century, to the beginning of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a> activities at nightfall in places like Gallatin and Nashville; later became a teenage/African-American <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a> term for dancing, thanks to Allen's frequent use<br />
<b>"Just a touch ... means so DOG-GONE much!"</b>--slogan for Royal Crown Hair Dressing and Pomade<br />
<b>"Well, hello, darlin', hello, darlin'"</b>--Allen's standard greeting to begin his shows<br />
<b>"That's Randy, R-A-N-D-Y, Gallatin, G-A-L-L-A-T-I-N ... Gallatin, Tennessee!"</b>--the closing catch phrase used on 60-second commercials for Randy's Record Shop, a sponsor of "The Hossman"'s (and also Gene Nobles') program for many years on WLAC<br />
<b>"...then YOU have a DISEASED SCALP! And now it's time to CURE UP that diseased scalp...you don't want no itchy head!"</b>--another catch phrase used in the middle of a 60-second spot for a certain mail-order product used to treat <a href="../../../p/s/o/Psoriasis.html" title="Psoriasis">psoriasis</a> voiced by Hoss Allen. Commercials for mail-order products and services such as these were a frequent mainstay during his overnight gospel program.</p>
