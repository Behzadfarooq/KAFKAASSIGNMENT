<dd>Agreed. I'm reverting the article until we can find proper sources, but we can't do HTTP links to material because it is in a paid archive.

<dd>Seriously though, it's often the case that some facts in the article are misrepresented. As an example, the "Vice President of Common Sense" mentioned in the article is presented by you know-it-all editors as someone who can "veto any team move." By your description, this should include minor trades, free agent signings, draft choices, and other largely insignificant yet commonplace day-to-day personnel decisions. This is clearly not what Simmons is trying to get across. Would the VCPS care that the Red Sox optioned Javier Lopez to AAA and called up Kason Gabbard? Clearly not. In fact, if you cared to read the original article, he only mentions "big decisions" as lying within the jurisdiction of the VPCS:</dd>

<dd>"I’m becoming more and more convinced that every professional sports team needs to hire a Vice President of Common Sense, someone who cracks the inner circle of the decision-making process along with the GM, assistant GM, head scout, head coach, owner and whomever else. One catch: the VP of CS doesn’t attend meetings, scout prospects, watch any film or listen to any inside information or opinions; he lives the life of a common fan. They just bring him in when they’re ready to make a big decision, lay everything out and wait for his unbiased reaction."</dd>

<dd>I'm befuddled. Obviously, I misremembered Simmons' description of the VP of Common Sense, so I'm glad that you were able to make it more accurate. I'm not sure where you're going from there. Since you haven't changed the article appropriately, it seems like you're more interested in bitching about not letting the "common folk" correct things than actually making Wikipedia better. The issue on the table is, how do we make a reliable article when the vast majority of the primary sources aren't available to the vast majority of readers. I (and, apparently SGreenwell) believe that a full deletion is a less desirable result than having fairly knowledgable, experienced editors work from memory. When we're wrong, it's a good thing to have others come in and correct us- that's the beauty of Wikipedia. But I really don't see how your class war analogy helps anything, or even where it's coming from. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilgar135_370a.html" title="User:Stilgar135">Stilgar135</a> 02:25, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not really sure what class wars have to do with anything. My problem is, I fail to understand (a) why new or unregistered users are prevented from editing this page, and (b) why no mention of this is made on the page itself (eg - the person who blocked editing could have put up at the top of the page a "partially blocked" tag, or whatever the right terminology is). I for one was pretty confused when I tried to edit the page and couldn't find any "edit" markers - it's annoying that one has to browse the talk page for this kind of information.</dd>

<p>My bad- I didn't realize that the page was blocked, either. A lot of people like to complain about what they see as elitism of Wikipedia, and I guess I automatically lumped you in with them; as always, I tried to be clever and metaphorical. Thus, "class wars". Anyway, I agree that protected pages should definitely have that fact posted on the front. I also don't think that this page is really a good candidate for protection- the problem isn't unregistered users vandalizing, it's that the information is so hard to verify. I guess all I can say is make good edits, become an "established user" and, if you see anything else in the article you think needs fixing before then, post it here. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStilgar135_370a.html" title="User:Stilgar135">Stilgar135</a> 16:25, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>First, I fixed some of the replying earlier in this thread, to make it more clear who was responding to who. Second, I'm guessing the block is up because of some of the past edits to the page. I've generally been lenient on things that have been added (i.e. the Reggie Cleveland All-Star team) because we haven't really talked out consensus on this talk page. I think if we're now interested in chopping the article down, we should try to talk it out instead of just engaging in edit wars. Finally, please try to sign comments with the four tildes, even if you don't have an account. It makes the talk page easier to read. <a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESGreenwell_25be.html" title="User:SGreenwell">SGreenwell</a> 17:51, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Simmons got his masters in political science from Holy Cross, not a degree in sports journalism. I'm positive of this, but I don't remember where I read it. He did however used to have a column in the college's paper. BallingOutFull 05:52, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Can anyone provide a picture of his wife? He mentions her enough times and now with her weekly rants (which sound JUST like you'd expect bill simmons as a girl to write), i'd like to verify you know, thats shes actually a real person.</p>
<dl>
<dd>He's mentioned her many times over the years, as has other people like Adam Carolla; Carolla talks about going out with his wife and Bill and Bill's wife at one point. I don't think there are any pictures of her online, at least there weren't when I was curious about the subject a few months ago. Seeing as there's no pictures of Bill currently on this page, it would be hard to justify a picture of his wife instead. <a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESGreenwell_25be.html" title="User:SGreenwell">SGreenwell</a> 18:48, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I think the page misrepresents the Ewing Theory, a theory which I love. The key aspect of the Ewing Theory is not that the team has unusual success (which is vague) when a superstar leaves, but instead that the team is <b>more</b> successful sans-superstar than it was with-superstar. Either because of injury or because of departure, the Knicks performed better without Ewing than they did with Ewing. Implicit in the "Ewing theory" is a concession that the superstar is, Yes, a superstar. But his presence inexplicably damages the team. I'm not a Wikipedia guy, and I have no idea what will happen if I paste a URL here for proof, but here's a column addressing the issue specifically: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1193711&amp;type=package" class="external free" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1193711&amp;type=package" rel="nofollow">http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1193711&amp;type=package</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I changed it based on your suggestion. Please note that the Knicks were never better without Ewing (look at the stats and records), which destroys the Theory. It should be named the Drew Bledsoe theory...but I still like Simmons.<a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 21:36, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think he calls it the Ewing Theory because the one-time the Knicks made the finals in the past 15 years, Ewing was on the bench (Sprewell-Houston years). <a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESGreenwell_25be.html" title="User:SGreenwell">SGreenwell</a> 21:47, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They were in the Finals with Ewing in '94 (made it all the way to Game 7), and he played all but nine games in '99, the time you are talking about. The Knick's record in those nine games? 4-5! Plus, after going to the 2nd round of the playoffs every year once Riley took over, and four Eastern Conference finals, they haven't sniffed the second round since he left. I don't count the inspired effort one night in Milwaukee during the regular season (as Simmons and many Knicks fan did to back up this theory) as showing the Knicks would be a better team without Ewing. They never were, and they certainly haven't been since. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamsquire_2238.html" title="User:Ramsquire">Ramsquire</a> 22:11, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, non-Wikipedia guy again. I think it is valid to question the legitimacy of the Ewing Theory. All of the ridiculous debate on the Ewing Theory page, for instance, demonstrates that labeling players as "Ewing Theory" eligible is a fool's errand. Maybe Ewing shouldn't even be considered, as you've pointed out. But, anyway, I think there should be one additional clause in the definition which you changed: "...increased success after the departure or temporary absence of a superstar." As you've indicated above, if a player is missing even for a short while, and the team succeeds, that players suddenly becomes potential "Ewing Theory" fodder. Also, just for fun, I want to say here that the only value of the Ewing Theory is entertainment value. Understanding the premise of the Ewing Theory allows my friends and me to argue at length about who is, and who isn't, a Ewing Theory guy.</dd>

<p>Since "<b>The Sports Guy</b>" is essentially his nickname, shouldn't it be bolded (every other nickname on Wikipedia follows that format) - 192.187.4.162 02:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually it's not (or at least it shouldn't be) just any nickname that's bolded. What should be bolded are phrases that would legitimately serve as alternate titles to the article. Basically, if it's bolded, then there really ought to be a page under that phrase in bold that redirects to the main page. In this case, though, "The Sports Guy" does indeed yield such a page that redirects here. So bolding is appropriate, and I have added it. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 03:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
