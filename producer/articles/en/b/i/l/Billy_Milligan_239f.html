<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Milligan_239f.html" title="Edit section: Childhood">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Childhood</span></h2>
<p>Billy's mother Dorothy had grown up in Ohio farm country. She had married Dick Jonas and they lived in Circleville, Ohio. They divorced and she later set-up with Johnny Morrison, a still-married, Jewish comedian, while she was a singer in and around Miami.</p>
<p>Dorothy and Johnny had a son Jim in October, 1953, and then Billy Milligan was born February 1955, in Miami Beach, Florida, as William Morrison. At this time, Johnny was 36 years old.</p>
<p>Their third child together, Kathy Jo Morrison was born December 1956. Keyes states that "Meeting the medical expenses overwhelmed Johnny. He borrowed more, gambled more, drank more...[he] was hopitalized for acute alcoholism and depression in...1958...[Dorothy] found him slumped over the table, half a bottle of Scotch and an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the floor." It was an apparent suicide attempt, but did not succeed. However a few months later, on <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_17.html" title="Jan 17">Jan 17</a>, 1959 he committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Dorothy took her children and eventually moved back to Circleville, Ohio, where she remarried her ex-husband Dick Jonas. This marriage lasted about a year. In 1962 she met Chalmer Milligan (1927-88)<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>. Chalmer's first wife Bernice divorced him on "grounds of gross neglect".<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> He had a daughter Challa the same age as Billy, and another daughter who was a nurse. They married in Circleville, Ohio on <a href="../../../o/c/t/Oct_27.html" title="Oct 27">Oct 27</a>, 1963. (Keyes, p135-9)</p>
<p>At his later trial, it would be Chalmer who would be blamed for abusing Billy and thereby causing some of the multiples, but Keyes makes it clear that Billy had multiples from a much earlier age, his first three (noname boy, Christene, and Shawn) evidently awakening by the time he was five years old.</p>
<p>One self who eventually came out, Arthur, developed the ability to sense the other selves and become a sort-of overseer. He would eventually develop the ability to control who came to consciousness and who went to sleep. Arthur would be in control in "safe" environments.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Milligan_239f.html" title="Edit section: Arrest">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arrest</span></h2>
<p>In the 1970s Billy did some time at Ohio's <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon_Correctional_Institution_8aa4.html" title="Lebanon Correctional Institution">Lebanon Correctional Institution</a>, for felonies including rape and armed robbery. He was released in early 1977, but on parole. He was also onfile as a sex offender. Three rapes on the Ohio State University campus in October, led to his arrest. He was identified by one of his victims, from existing police mug shots of sex offenders, and from fingerprints lifted from another victims car. (Keyes, p6-7)</p>
<p>Since he had used a gun and guns were found in a search of his residence, he had violated his parole as well. He was indicted on "...three counts of kidnapping, three counts of aggravated robbery and four counts of rape." (Keyes, p 16)</p>
<p>In the course of preparing his defense, he underwent a psychological examination by Dr. Willis C Driscoll who diagnosed acute schizophrenia. He was then examined by psychologist Dorothy Turner of Southwest Community Mental Health Center in Columbus. During this examination it was determined that he had the signs of multiple personality disorder.</p>
<p>During this time, Adalana first made herself known to outsiders. She claimed she was the only self to have the ability to "wish" the others to go to sleep. She told Dorothy that it was her who had taken consciousness at the time of the rapes because she was "...desperate to be held and caressed and loved." (Keyes, p 54)</p>
<p>His public defenders, Gary Schweickart and Judy Stevenson, pleaded an insanity defense and he was commmitted "...until such time as he regains sanity."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Milligan_239f.html" title="Edit section: Mental incarceration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mental incarceration</span></h2>
<p>He was sent to a series of state-run mental hospitals, such as the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens_Lunatic_Asylum_c1a1.html" title="Athens Lunatic Asylum">Athens Lunatic Asylum</a>, where, by his report, he received very little help. While he was in these hospitals, Milligan displayed 10 selves. Among these were Arthur, a prim and proper Englishman, Allen, a con man and manipulator, Ragen Vadascovinich, a <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugoslavs.html" title="Yugoslavs">Yugoslavian</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">communist</a> who had committed the robberies in a kind of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_a190.html" title="Robin Hood">Robin Hood</a> spirit, and Adalana, a nineteen-year-old lesbian who craved affection and who had supposedly committed the rapes.</p>
<p>Finally Milligan received treatment from psychiatrist David Caul, who identified an additional 14 selves and helped him and the other "selves" to communicate with each other, and to work out a method by which he could voluntarily integrate all of his selves. However, when Milligan maintained this mindset for any protracted length of time, he reported that the talents his selves possessed as individuals were diminished. In interviews, Milligan still refers to this situation with the words "The whole was less than the sum of the parts."<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Caul's famous quote on treating multiples is "It seems to me that after treatment you want a functional unit, be it a corporation, a partnership, or a one-owner business."<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
