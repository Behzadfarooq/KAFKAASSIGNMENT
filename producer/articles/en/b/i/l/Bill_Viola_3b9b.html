<p>Bill Viola was born on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_25.html" title="January 25">January 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a> and grew up in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queens%2C_New_York_7318.html" title="Queens, New York">Queens</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westbury%2C_New_York_c746.html" title="Westbury, New York">Westbury, New York</a>. He attended P.S. 20, where he was Captain of the TV Squad, and went on to <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse_University_d1c9.html" title="Syracuse University">Syracuse University</a>, where he studied in the Experimental Studios of the College of Visual and Performing Arts, including the Synapse experimental program, which evolved into <a href="../../../h/i/l/HillTV_5b85.html" title="HillTV">HillTV</a>. In 1973 he graduated from <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syracuse_University_d1c9.html" title="Syracuse University">Syracuse</a> with a Bachelor in Fine Arts. His first job on graduation was as a video technician at the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everson_Museum_of_Art_8f3b.html" title="Everson Museum of Art">Everson Museum of Art</a> in Syracuse. From 1973 to 1980 he studied and performed with composer <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Tudor_531e.html" title="David Tudor">David Tudor</a> in the new music group "Rainforest" (later called "Composers Inside Electronics"). From 1974-1976 Viola worked as technical director at Art/Tapes/22, a pioneering video studio in Florence, Italy where he encountered video artists <a href="../../../n/a/m/Nam_June_Paik_bf7f.html" title="Nam June Paik">Nam June Paik</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Nauman_50c4.html" title="Bruce Nauman">Bruce Nauman</a>, and <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Acconci_befc.html" title="Vito Acconci">Vito Acconci</a>. From 1976-1983 he was artist-in-residence at WNET Thirteen Television Laboratory in New York. In 1976 and 1977 he travelled to the Solomon Islands, Java, Indonesia to record traditional performing arts.</p>
<p>In 1977 Viola was invited to show work at <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Trobe_University_e4b2.html" title="La Trobe University">La Trobe University</a> (Melbourne, Australia) by cultural arts director Kira Perov. Viola and Perov later married, beginning an important lifelong collaboration in working and travelling together. In 1980, they lived in Japan for a year and a half on a Japan/U.S. cultural exchange fellowship where they studied Buddhism with <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen.html" title="Zen">Zen</a> Master Daien Tanaka. During this time Viola was also artist-in-residence at Sony Corporation's Atsugi Laboratories.</p>
<p>In 1983 became an instructor in Advanced Video, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Institute_of_the_Arts_ca76.html" title="California Institute of the Arts">California Institute of the Arts</a>, Valencia, California. In 1995 Viola represented the United States at the 46th <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venice_Biennale_e864.html" title="Venice Biennale">Venice Biennale</a>, for which he produced a series of works <i>Buried Secrets</i>, including one of his best know works <i>The Greeting</i>, a contemporary interpretation of <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontormo.html" title="Pontormo">Pontormo</a>'s <i>The Visitation</i>. In 1997 a major retrospective of 25 years of Bill Viola's work was organised and internationally toured by the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art_4e48.html" title="Whitney Museum of American Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>.</p>
<p>In 1998 he was Getty Scholar-in-residence at <a href="../../../g/e/t/Getty_Center_3564.html" title="Getty Center">The Getty Research Institute</a>, Los Angeles. Viola was elected to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences_4625.html" title="American Academy of Arts and Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, in 2000. In 2002, Viola completed <i>Going Forth By Day</i>, a digital “fresco” cycle in High-Definition video, commissioned by the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin and the <a href="../../../g/u/g/Guggenheim_Museum_6e28.html" title="Guggenheim Museum">Guggenheim Museum</a>, New York. In 2003,<i>The Passions</i>was exhibited in Los Angeles, London, Madrid and Canberra. This was a major collection of Viola's emotionally charged slow motion works inspired by traditions within <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> devotional painting.</p>
<p>In 2004 Viola began work on a new production of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Wagner_c988.html" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>’s opera <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>, a collaboration with director Peter Sellars, conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen and executive producer Kira Perov. The opera was premiered at the <a href="../../../o/p/%C3%A9/Op%C3%A9ra_National_de_Paris_9cd9.html" title="Opéra National de Paris">Opéra National de Paris</a> in 2005 and Viola's video work was subsequently shown as <i>LOVE/DEATH The Tristan Project</i> at the Haunch of Venison Gallery and St Olave's School, London, in 2006.</p>

<p>Bill Viola's exhibition profile, which includes the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Gallery%2C_London_89f8.html" title="National Gallery, London">National Gallery, London</a>, Guggenheim Berlin, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon_R._Guggenheim_Museum_8b81.html" title="Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum">Guggenheim New York</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_Museum_of_American_Art_4e48.html" title="Whitney Museum of American Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>,<a href="../../../g/e/t/Getty_Center_3564.html" title="Getty Center">Getty</a> <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles%2C_California_b493.html" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>, and the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_e36a.html" title="Metropolitan Museum of Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> marks him as a major contemporary artist.</p>
<p>Viola's art deals largely with the central themes of human consciousness and experience - birth, death, love, emotion and a kind of humanist spirituality. Throughout his career he has drawn meaning and inspiration from his deep interest in mystical traditions, especially <a href="../../../z/e/n/Zen_Buddhism_af30.html" title="Zen Buddhism">Zen Buddhism</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_mysticism.html" title="Christian mysticism">Christian mysticism</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufism.html" title="Sufism">Islamic Sufism</a>, often evident in the transcendental quality of some of his works. Equally, the subject matter and manner of western <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">renaissance</a> devotional art have informed his aesthetic.</p>
<p>Viola's work often exhibits a beautiful painterly quality, his use of ultra-slow motion video encouraging the viewer to sink into to the image and connect deeply to the meanings contained within it. This quality makes his work perhaps unusually accessible within a contemporary art context. As a consequence, his work often receives mixed reviews from critics, some of whom have noted a tendency toward grandiosity and obviousness in some of his work. Yet it is this very ambitiousness, his striving toward meaning, his attempts to deal with the big themes of human life, that also makes his work so clearly appreciated by other critics, his audiences and collectors.</p>
<p>His early work established his fascination with issues that continue to inform his work today. In particular, Viola's obsession with capturing the essence of <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotion.html" title="Emotion">emotion</a> through recording of its extreme display began at least as early as his <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976.html" title="1976">1976</a> work, <i>The Space Between the Teeth</i>, a video of himself screaming, and continues to this day with such works as the 45-second <i>Silent Mountain</i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>), which shows two actors in states of anguish.</p>
<p>If Viola's depictions of emotional states with no <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objective_correlative.html" title="Objective correlative">objective correlative</a> -- emotional states for which the viewer has no external object or event to understand them by -- are one striking feature of many of his works, another, which has come to the forefront, is his reference to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medieval.html" title="Medieval">medieval</a> and <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classicism.html" title="Classicism">classical</a> depictions of emotion. Most immediately, his subdued <i>Catherine's Room</i> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, has many scene by scene parallels with Andrea di Bartolo's <a href="../../../1/3/9/1393.html" title="1393">1393</a> <i><a href="../../../c/a/t/Catherine_of_Siena_0bd7.html" title="Catherine of Siena">St. Catherine of Siena Praying</a></i>.</p>
<p>While many video artists have been quick to adopt new technologies to their medium, Viola relies little on computer editing. Perhaps the most technically challenging part of his work -- and that which has benefitted most from the advances since his earliest pieces -- is his use of extreme slow motion. <i>The Quintet Series</i> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> is one such piece (actually a set of four separate videos), that shows the unfolding expressions of five actors in such slow motion that every minute detail of their changing expressions can be detected. The series is a challenging one for the viewer, because the concentration required to follow the facial expressions over time must last for minutes or more. In general, the distortion of time, along with the lack of sound or voice over, form the most immediately ""new"" aspects of Viola's work for the first-time viewer.</p>
<p>In 2000, Bill Viola collaborated with the popular band <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nine_Inch_Nails_f615.html" title="Nine Inch Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a>, and its lead singer <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trent_Reznor_5818.html" title="Trent Reznor">Trent Reznor</a> to create a large <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triptych.html" title="Triptych">triptych</a> for the band's tour. The triptych mainly is focused on water imagery and was supposed to be integral with the songs that were played.</p>
<p><i>Observance</i> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, is a work which may be taken partly as a response to the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_Terrorist_Attacks_8526.html" title="September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks">September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks</a>. <i>Observance</i> places the camera at eye level facing the head of a line of people of a wide variety of ages. As <i>Observance</i> unfolds, the line slowly advances, with each person pausing at the front of the line in a state of intense -- though quiet -- grief, before ceding their place to the next person in line.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, Viola embarked on <i>The Tristan Project</i>. At the invitation of opera director <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Sellars_10dc.html" title="Peter Sellars">Peter Sellars</a>, he created video sequences to be shown as a backdrop to the action on stage during the performance of <a href="../../../w/a/g/Wagner.html" title="Wagner">Wagner</a>'s opera <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tristan_und_Isolde_623a.html" title="Tristan und Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>. Using his trademark extreme slow motion, Viola's pieces used actors to portray the metaphorical story behind Wagner's story, seeing for example the first act as an extended ritual of purification in which the characters disrobe and wash themselves before finally plunging headlong into water together (in Wagner's story, the two characters maintain the facade of being indifferent to each other (necessary because Isolde is betrothed to Tristan's uncle) before, mistakenly believing they are going to die anyway, they reveal their true feelings). Viola trademarks such as fire and water are much in evidence here. The piece was first performed in Los Angeles at Disney Hall on 3 separate evenings in 2004, one act at a time, then given complete performances at the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bastille_Opera_8aa3.html" title="Bastille Opera">Bastille Opera</a> in Paris in April and November 2005. The video pieces were later shown in London without Wagner's music in June to September 2006, at the Haunch of Venison Gallery and St Olave's College, London.</p>
<p>Viola's work has received many critical accolades. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marjorie_Perloff_3cb9.html" title="Marjorie Perloff">Marjorie Perloff</a>, best known for her poetry criticism and her promotion of <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avant-garde.html" title="Avant-garde">avant-garde</a> writers and styles, singles him out for praise. Perloff, who has written at length about the necessity of poetic works responding to and taking advantage of contemporary computer technologies, has written of Viola as an example of how new technology -- in his case, the video camera -- can create entirely new <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aesthetic.html" title="Aesthetic">aesthetic</a> criteria and possibilities that did not exist in previous incarnations of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">genre</a> -- in this case, theater.</p>
