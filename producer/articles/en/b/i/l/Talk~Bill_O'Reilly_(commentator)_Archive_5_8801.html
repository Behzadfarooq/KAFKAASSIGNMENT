<h2><span class="mw-headline">Addition of NPOV tag</span></h2>
<p>I want to know why everyone keeps deleting my VAILD ARTICLE POSTING. Bill O'Reilly falsely claimed he did not have option to register as an independent, correct? The article is from a vaild source in MediaMatters.org, correct? It is not an article from a small third-party news source, correct? Bill O'Reilly was not being honest, so why can I not post this article on here? If you like Bill, then fine. If you agree with him, then fine. But not everyone views him as being completely honest with his viewers. So why can I not post a vaild article listing such a case? It is a realy article, not slander. I think others on here have nothing else better to do then sit around deleting things they do not like. If I am posting it in the wrong way, then tell me how to correct it. Or you can make the changes yourself. But I am sick of seeing the listing deleted because some people want to act like little, power hungry children. Enough already! The article is vaild, so just leave it be. _________</p>
<p><br />
The source of most of the controversies surrounding O'Reilly or criticisms of him is <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_Matters_696f.html" title="Media Matters">Media Matters</a>, a known left-wing political website. Is it unfair to call the article neutral if the source of the controversies is itself a questionable or neutral source. Other sources are needed (non left-wing).</p>
<p><br />
Who says it is a known Left-Wing web site? That is your opinion, show me proof. If you do not agree that is one thing, but I posted a vaild article. Here is another article pointing this out. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/23/60minutes/main645202.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/23/60minutes/main645202.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/23/60minutes/main645202.shtml</a></p>
<p>But I don't think it will matter to those conservative people in here. They will keep looking at Bill as being 100% honest, and an independent. Show me proof that Bill did not registered as an independent. Until then, there is still articles claiming that he did.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I feel that the Political Beliefs and Point of View (renamed from "bias" - isn't a commentator supposed to have a point of view? O'Reilly constantly points out that he does not do "straight" news, but rather "news analysis") is somewhat fair, but the "bias" in the heading was just too much.</p>
<p>Also, the controversies section seems unfair. Of thousands of shows, it seems stacked in favor of O'Reilly's most negative moments.</p>
<p>As someone who is ambivalent about the guy, overall I think this is a negative article. He's the most-watched personality in cable news, yet the article has an unfairly negative bias.</p>
<p>I feel some of the article editors have allowed their obvious dislike of the guy to creep in here.</p>

<p>Addendum - <i>Alleged</i> liberal bias at the New York Times, LA Times, Washington Post, BBC, CBC? Surely you guys jest. They are all at the political left <i>of the United States</i>. Uclajd 09:44, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Don't get me wrong, but ANYTHING is to the left of Fox News. Why people insist on labeling newspapers which aren't myopically "conservative" as "liberal" is beyond me. Let's not get into this argument here, in any case. Let's deal with what's said by O'Reilly, what others say about him (relevant quotes, please), and facts. For example, can you back up "the most watched personality in cable news"? I agree that we must be very watchful of this article, but a balanced view of the man's professional career is the way this article should be. Your criticism of the article based upon a dislike of the balanced view given seems somewhat ironic. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 09:53, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Second what <a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> said -- except for first sentence. (While I *personally* am a centrist, AND have a similar viewpoint to ABQCat's as to Fox News' clear and demonstrated bias (and allowing for hyperbole) -- that is ALSO not the point.) I DO think a case can be made that, as a group and individually, the journalistic standards and guidelines of the {NY Times, LA Times, WashPost, BBC, CBC} regarding objectivity is EASILY defended as being far more stringent than that of Fox News, which has been quite well documented as having a conservative agenda from Murdoch &amp; Ailes on down. This is not Red-Said-Blue-Said -- it's clearly documented and on record, beyond dispute, that Fox News instructs its reporters to express a particular (conservative) viewpoint, down to prescribing particular phrases. Former Fox News reporters, staff, producers, and more have testified to this, on camera. NO comparable allegations involving this "liberal media cabal" are documented, on record, or known. (And, the recent Jayson Blair and Judith Miller affairs show the NY Times, e.g., has NO problem airing its own dirty laundry.) --A Doon</dd>

<p><br />
I believe the neutrality of the article is in question because the bulk of the text is a debate of where people believe O'Reilly stands on issues; rather than sticking to factual information, the article focuses more on controversy and interpretation of O'Reilly's beliefs. It goes without saying that all journalists/commentators have opinions - but I don't see the same scrutiny given to other pundits who some argue have a liberal bias. In a sense, this wikipedia entry is doing exactly what the article/authors are accusing O'Reilly of - letting their perspective on events become the news story, rather than simply providing an account of facts. -- Jedunc 18:10, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of NPOV tag</span></h2>
<p>Hello all -- I have removed the NPOV (actually "totallydisputed") tag from the article because I have been unable to find specific discussion of the issues on the talk page.</p>
<p>Please, it is OK to replace the tag, but you are expected to discuss your reasons for doing so, with particular examples of facts or statements you find POV or untrue. I encourage others who find the tag replaced without discussion here on the talk page to go ahead and remove it.</p>
<p>Note that the possibility that the page may <i>become</i> NPOV later is not an acceptable use of the tag. The tag should only be on the article when the actual text of the article is POV. If you find someone has stuck in a chunk of POV, the best thing to do is go over the edits to regain NPOV.</p>
<p>Thanks, <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 21:35, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You'll get no opposition from anybody on this, as the only person who insisted on the tag being there was Fluterst.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 01:07, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of Disputed tag</span></h2>
<p>OK, um, again -- someone just put in the "disputed" tag, questioning factual statements in the article. Again, I've gone ahead and removed it because no discussion has occured on the talk page regarding factual inaccuracies in the article. If you find a factual problem, best thing to do is just fix it yourself -- either remove the statement, or find a source to prove it. Second best is to complain on the talk page.</p>
<p>Please use tags sparingly, and find ways to do things without them!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bill O'Reilly the cricketer</span></h2>
<p>I reverted the removal of the disambiguation of Bill O'Reilly the cricketer may by user:Ilyag. It seems very reasonable to have it here. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenwmccrary58_d710.html" title="User:Stevenwmccrary58">Steven McCrary</a> 23:05, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've removed it again for one reason: That comment was added as per Fluterst's attempt to rename article from <b>Bill O'Reilly (commentator)</b> to <b>Bill O'Reilly</b>. That attempt failed in a vote, and the article was returned to normal. The mere fact that the article's name says "(commentator)" means that this is NOT an ambiguous article.

<b>First paragraph</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The O'Reilly Factor is not among the most popular news programs on cable news, it is number one by a long distance. To omit that fact is clear evidence of bias.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that listing exact viewership numbers is sufficiently less biased than saying how awesomely popular his show is. The article currently does, in fact, list his exact viewership in the opening paragraph. As you are a fan of "encyclopedic" content, I'm surprised that you don't think that an exact number is more encyclopedic than a verbal description of those numbers. HOWEVER, I will say that I would not object to apending those numbers with the statement along the lines of "...this makes it the top rated show of all the cable news stations." --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 06:16, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't say it should be called awesomely popular but again I say that explaining it is top rating program on cable news is a vital fact that explains why we're all interested in him in the first place.

<li>O'Reilly is 'confrontational' but if called 'no-nonsense' that must be preceded by 'self-described.' Who says he's confrontational. No source. Just opinion from an anonymous person.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe 'confrontational' is a poor choice here. I agree with you in replacing it, but only if the replacing terminology refers to his particular style (whatever you choose to call it), because it is quite noteworthy and significantly important for the article. His style is what separates him from the likes of Larry King and Tim Russert, and this needs to be noted. --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 06:16, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think "confrontational" or "provocational" is the best term here, as it accurately describes how O'Reilly deals with guests: he does his best to "push buttons". Perhaps the best NPOV to do this is to note (with sources) descriptions of O'Reilly's style. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 11:35, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>O'Reilly is regularly criticized for being too liberal by people writing into the show, is that mentioned? No, nor his liberal views on many subjects. Instead a very liberal Harvard publication and a generally liberal CBS News report are mentioned as sources for O'Reilly 'promoting a conservative agenda'. As it happens the sources don't even claim that but they look the part so perhaps no one will notice.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>These "people" who write into Bill O'Reilly's show calling him liberal could be just as credible as the "Paris Business Gazette" that backed up his claim that his boycot of French goods was crippling the French economy despite the fact that trading between the US and France increased during that time. Stats shown on The O'Reilly Factor are just as debateable as the opinions shown on it. The majority of people who watch the O'Reilly Factor are not liberals,just because his viewers have a more far right wing view then Bill O'Reilly does not make him liberal by any stretch.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So you're saying the multiple books, websites, documentaries, and newspaper articles that have dogged the man about a conservative bias are just as noteworthy as a few angry letters he gets alleging he's too liberal? The wikipedia article header doesn't even grant these claims any creedence, it just mentions their existence, as does O'Reilly on many broadcasts. --<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.224.182.201.html" title="User:72.224.182.201">72.224.182.201</a> 03:47, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He gets letters on the show very regularly accusing him of being a liberal. A CBS interview<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/23/60minutes/main645202.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/23/60minutes/main645202.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> of him expressed surprise at his liberal views on the death penalty and other issues. His views are not easily categorized and I think attempts to characterize him by liberals (or conservatives) are merely an attempt to attack him for whatever reason. None of it is encyclopedic. None of it is interesting. Elsewhere the issue of his political beliefs is examined (albeit in a hamfisted way) and even that analysis makes more sense the above. I have no doubt he is to the left on many issues than <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Lieberman_34c5.html" title="Joe Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> and to the right of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Buchanan_f2c9.html" title="Pat Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a> on others. The bottom line is that you're on very dangerous territory accusing someone of being a conservative or a leftist when they deny it and when the truth is a complex mix of views. He is a <a href="../../../p/o/p/Populist.html" title="Populist">populist</a> by his own description and I think the desire to paint him as something else using unambiguously left-wing sources proves my case that this article is not fact-based and not neutral.

<dd>In response to Fluterst article, The major 'controversy' between Bill O'Reilly and the majority of people is that neither Bill O'Reilly or Fox News will ever claim to be biased. No matter how many stats, opinions or anything get thrown in their faces they will deny any bias no matter what. An analogy to this would be trying to argue with somebody who never thinks they're wrong. You could have the entire world agreeing with you but if that other party you are arguing with does not believe it what can you do? It doesn't matter if the entire world sees the faults, the only perspective that you are concerned with wont ever change. If Bill O'Reilly and the people at Fox News really believe that they are unbiased and concerned with letting the viewer decide there is pretty much nothing anybody can do about it except complain about the biases as they see them.</dd>

<dd>The assumption that the muck that's up there is valid and that any change needs to be agreed by a group of anonymous leftists is a deeply flawed process in my view. I am quite a reasonable person most of the time. I compromise in my job every single day, every hour. I negotiate for a living. But this is not a negotiation, look at the 'commentator' issue. A no-brainer issue really, he is a journalist, calls himself one, is called one even by foes, his colleagues doing the same work are journalists and yet he will not be called on Wikipedia because it's a hoot to stick it to the man. I just wonder how long all of this can last. A day of reckoning must surely approach, as it does all of us. Fluterst 08:38, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fluterst, please try to stick to the particular issues in the article. In particular, please let Ilyag and others know if his suggestions are acceptable, and if not, why; further, please continue either to edit the article directly to achieve NPOV, or discuss your problems here on the talk page.</p>
<p>The "commentator" issue is considered generally settled by the other editors, but if you wish to dispute it further there is nothing to stop you. However, you should be aware that name-calling is unlikely to get people to come around to your side. You will find most people here are open to compromise when confronted with someone polite and reasonable. The best way to get people to agree on that particular issue is to cite major media organizations (New York Times, Washington Post, Washington Times, National Review) using the term "journalist" to describe O'Reilly.</p>
<p>Please also remember to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> in your dealings with others here, even if you think you shouldn't have to.

<p>The first two paragraphs (now) do not improve the quality of the content of the introduction. As it was, the introduction was succinct and fair.

<p>What do you think is unfair about the new introduction? I note someone else has reverted my changes without discussion, which I find somewhat rude. I don't mind moving that stuff somewhere else in the article, but please note that it is in my opinion the only substantial discussion of O'Reilly's broad political positions as viewed by a reasonably "mainstream" source (not that other sources cited in the article are bad, only that CBS is a big deal.)</p>

Steve, you are much better about reference format than I -- I just use those inline ones, and hope someone else can sort it out.

<p>Greetings all,</p>

<ul>
<li>I have considered this long and hard, and I know that I am going to have to spend hours defending it, but I must voice my objection to the title of the page. I am replacing the POV tag because I believe that the bias against O'Reilly is slanting the POV of the page.</li>
<li>O'Reilly is a journalist regardless of his current job.
<ul>
<li><i>The O'Reilly Factor</i> is FOX News version of the newspaper "op ed"; and we certainly consider "op ed" to a part of the news. Yes, it is commentary as well, but that is the nature of this type of journalism, and we do not characterize editors as commentators. In addition, the show does more than provide commentary. Even though it is a filtered look at the news, it is still news. Granted, it is not a news show like Paula Zahn or Anderson Cooper, but it is still news. Plus, the fact that this show represents a mere portion of his life should be sufficient enough.</li>
<li>The word commentator implies that he is some sort of a ring-side sports analyst. This is certainly not what the show is about. Again, the show is about analysis, but not like a sports commentator.</li>

<p>I think you are right about problems with the "commentator" label, and I think I was wrong above to oppose a move to "journalist". At the same time, it's important to acknoledge that the "Factor", his most famous product, is purely op-ed/commentary, in the same way Paul Krugman's work is. Whether this needs an NPOV tag, or just a restart of the previous move debate, is up to you. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 14:23, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Sdedeo for the considered response. I agree, that the show is largely op-ed and commentary, still it is journalism. Yes different from typical new shows, but still news. Yes he is part of the debate, so what, that does not make it any less newsworthy. It is op-ed news. I guess my main concern about the title is that is disparaging to the career of an individual who has spent a lifetime in journalism. I know that the majority of previous editors were against the move, and I have read their reasons, but I believe that those views only point to a POV that needs to be fleshed out.

<p>I believe the NPOV tag should be removed. In my view, the use of the term "commentator" instead of "journalist" does not taint the entire article with bias. If you wish to put up the whole "commentator" versus "journalist" thing for vote again, thats fine. But the NPOV tag should go (in my opinion).<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 14:42, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see absolutely no bias in either the term "journalist" or in the term "commentator". Neither one is more 'favorable' to O'Reilly. I must point out that this is what seems to be debated here: Users like Fluterst and some others want a more favorable article of O'Reilly, while other users want a more negative and critical article. I honestly don't see how either of these terms accomplishes these tasks. To me, one of the terms is a blanket statement that isn't at all indicative of who O'Reilly is or why he is famous, and the other one is far more descriptive ("commentator"). This is the sole reason I oppose changing this term. Commentator is a factual description -- he <b>COMMENTS</b> on the news. The other term is more akin to what O'Reilly would put on a resume to advertise his supposed neutrality on the issues which, through the nature of his debate show, he doesn't have (he takes concrete positions on everything he debates). --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 17:19, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The problem I see here is not whether or not O'Reilly is a commentator or a journalist. It is the misapplication of the word journalist to other articles describing such people in WP. Anderson Cooper is no more or less a journalist than Bill O'Reilly. Even the dictionary (not Wiktionary) definition(s) of the word(s) leave yards and yards of wiggle room. 71.244.163.156 23:25, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
To resolve this issue, I visited his webpage and looked at his "bio" which lists "Blending news analysis with investigative reporting." Take from that what you will. I have never thought of Bill O'Reilly as a journalist as he tends not to report news, rather analyse it. Though there are instances where he does report on stories that are not, or hardly, covered anywhere else. I think description of "Commentator" conveys the point that he comments/analyses the news. You could solve it by making the tag more detailed, "Commentator, Editor, Publisher, Writer, Producer, Loud Mouth..." With all this said, I don't really consider other simular shows to be "journalists" either, being that the funtion they perform is analyzing the news, or having debates and interviewing people. Bill may be a journalist to some extant in what he does, but it is not his primary function. His primary function would best be described as "Commentator" in which, I see no bias about the use of that word. Would those that disagree rather have "Chief Commentator"&#160;? Well those are my thoughts regarding the issue.</p>

<p>Hello all -- just a brief very general thought or two. Please remember all that wikipedia is not a democracy; it's fine to take votes, but really that's not how decisions get made and votes are never binding except in rare circumstances. Really discussion is what's important. Fluterst generated a lot of ill will in the way he went about doing the (commentator) -&gt; (journalist) stuff, so waiting a few days or a week to revisit the issue might be a good idea. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 22:00, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The 'Political Beleifs' section is again getting stretched out and worse, it's starting to organize his opinions into liberal/conservative files again. At this rate, it's not long before we're back to the old liberal/moderate/conservative/libertarian opinions scorecard again (which has spontaneously generated in this article twice before.)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My concerns here</span></h2>
<p>Hello all -- I have not been active in editing the page, but I am concerned by what editors have been doing here. I looked at the diff from when I first got involved to the most recent edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29&amp;diff=33125576&amp;oldid=32996128" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29&amp;diff=33125576&amp;oldid=32996128" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and I have to say the only thing that's happened here after all this work is some minor rewording of the intro and the <i>removal</i> of what I think is an important section (the stuff on O'Reilly's reaction to the WMD assertions.)</p>
<p>I'm not going to make a fuss about the fact that all the material I provided from the CBS news interview was removed. But my concern here is that editors who have been working on this article for a long time have become "attached" to a particular version and are reluctant to accept further development.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that you should work <i>with</i> what others bring to the article. Err on the side of including information, rather than deleting it because you think it unimportant. Usually "firestorms" on the talk page are followed by an article's expansion and material improvement in particulars. This does not seem to be the case here; the only major change to the article has been the removal of information.</p>
<p>I think editors need to take a step back here and allow the article to develop.</p>

<dd>Whoa, calm down. I'm the one who deleted the WMD fiasco and it wasn't a whitewash - it's because you moved the issue to the section about his political beliefs, and I forgot to put it back under 'disputes' after I manually reverted your edits. I think it definitely belongs in the article.</dd>

<dd>However, once again I'll say that your remodeling of the 'Political Beliefs/Bias' section is ridiculous. It follows a narrative based on a 60 Minutes story, which is more like a People Magazine article than what you should find in an encyclopedia. Also, it once again tries to hash his beliefs up into liberal/conservative tally cards, and that's an invite to chaos around here. <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlastic_editor_1eff.html" title="User:Plastic editor">relaxathon</a> 05:06, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<p>Hey, hey, I don't claim a whitewash, and I totally accept that removing info was inadvertent. I have no objection to changing the structure of the article. (Actually, I'm not sure it was me who made the divisions? But whatevs.) I will say that I think the division of beliefs into lib/conserv. is actually potentially quite helpful. My feeling is that readers coming to the page will helped by this. It does, for example, answer "in actions" allegations that BO'R is liberal/is conservative without having to have a separate section discussing it (and, IMO, the article should probably handle those allegations, since they come up quite a bit.)</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you both consider it a recipe for disaster? What do you think will happen because of this organization? It is clear we need some principle for organization -- we want to be able to cover his positions in a full and complete manner without cascades of undifferentiated text. If you like, perhaps you can do something like make subsections for "Economics", "Civil Liberties", "Environment", "International Relations", etc. etc. -- but this will perhaps be unweidly? Another option is just to get rid of the subsections and have a long single section for "Political Beliefs" and hope that as it continues to grow someone will come up with a better idea.</p>
<p>Finally, I am not sure why you don't like the info from the CBS article? Right now the bulk of our references are to either FOX news pages or to liberal blogs and action groups. This article needs more "middle of the road" sources, and IMO reporting what CBS thinks about O'Reilly is perhaps more valuable to the article than what Counterpunch thinks.</p>

<p>(Just want to reiterate that please feel free to reorganize the article; I just wanted to remind people that it's important not to get attached to one article in a particular state, and to err on the side of including and expanding upon additions, even if you think they are contaminated by POV, as opposed to maintaining a single "perfect article" state. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 06:21, 30 December 2005 (UTC))</p>

<dd>(As an example, do look at the developement of the <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html" title="ACLU">ACLU</a> article over the years; this is one I've put a lot of work into and is on my watchlist. In particular, we very often have people swoop in an add a sentence or two on a controversial case that bugs them. Instead of deleting the reference to the case, we've done our best to integrate and organize these cases, provide expanded information on them, and place them in context. This has resulted in I think a much better article than if we had just reverted those little contextless (and usually hyper-POV) edits. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 23:06, 29 December 2005 (UTC))

<dd>Sdedeo, in my opinion, your concerns are justified. Many of the edits have been made without discussion. The text on Doug Forrester has reappeared, but I believe that it was settled above. The deletion your refer to about CBS, I believe is important and should be in the article.

<p>I don't think it's necessary to put anyone "on notice", but I would definitely encourage editors to look at the diffs from the last few days to see if information has been removed and to put it back in at their discretion, to regard edits that remove information and sources with suspicion, and to encourage others to do so as well. It is much, much better to have a longer article with problems than a shorter "perfect consensus" article. Wikipedia articles are always in a state of flux and expansion, and it is almost a rule that additions that others make should be regarded with respect; even when they are written in a POV manner, strive to include the information; if you feel "one side" has too much promenance, the better thing to do is fill in the other side of the question.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding journalism</span></h2>
<p>Response to Hal and Ilyag regarding why "commentator" is a negative term: Greetings gentlemen. I appreciate the POV expressed in the paragraphs immediately above, but find that I am in stark contrast to them. This is in no way meant to be a personal attack on holders of that view, but I cannot characterize professional journalistic expression of opinion as mere "comment", and believe it to be an incorrect POV of the American political system. Please do not say to me that I am defending the honor of O'Reilly, or that I am an O'Reilly supporter. Because, I often find that he is overbearing and rude, but that does not minimize the role that he plays in American politics. In my view, to say that "comment" is not news leaves a distorted impression both on the role of journalists in the American political system and on the entire political process in America. In the American system of politics, the "comments" are dominantly the news. Look at what happened to Dan Rather and CBS News for not getting the story (really the source) right this summer about President Bush. In this case, the journalist became the news. Can we really say that journalists views on abortion (for example) are unimportant? I hope not. In a society where give-and-take and opinions are both paramount to decision making, calling people mere "commentators" is an insult, because all of us are participants, especially the journalists! In a sports match, the game occurs between the participants on the field (for example) only, people on the sidelines are observers, nothing more. But in American politics, the game is not merely between the politicians, the press plays a critical role, as do all Americans (if we are interested). Yes, the politicians are where the decisions are finally made, but their decisions are not made in isolation, but rather they are part of the give-and-take that is American politics. That give-and-take includes op-ed pieces, news shows, debate, etc; and those events are news worthy. Therefore, it is paramount that we recognize the subtlety of each individual's and each organization's POV in its presentation of political events. To ignore POV in news presentation, to call it mere "comment," is a naive position that I cannot agree. And to say that O'Reilly is a "commentator" is an insult, not just to him, but to the profession of journalism, to the entire American political system, and to its participants. Well, I have gone on for too long, I am Respectfully Yours, <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenwmccrary58_d710.html" title="User:Stevenwmccrary58">Steven McCrary</a> 14:16, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My comments on O'Reilly's status as a "journalist" are in no way referencing any kind of POV I may have of O'Reilly as an individual, or his politics. I believe that O'Reilly is in no way different from a typical Internet blogger. What does a typical political blogger do? They post links to various news stories, and offer up their own comments on the matter. This is essentially what O'Reilly does; I believe it is entirely the same. O'Reilly presents a brief summary (or short video clip) of a news event that has been covered elsewhere, and then proceeds to comment on it (and engage in debate with his guests). If one is to call O'Reilly a journalist for doing this, then one must also refer to all political bloggers as "journalists". I do not believe he's a journalist any more than I believe bloggers are journalists (I know many of them will disagree with me). The fact that his opinions are broadcast over a major television network is irrelevant. He himself does no journalistic work, and neither does any member of his staff (other than to put together so-called "links" to the news stories to be discussed on the show). I should also point out that my references here to "bloggers" are not meant as insults in any way. I can just as easily compare him to any highly successful political commentators on <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_radio.html" title="Talk radio">talk radio</a>, and guess what? None of them are considered journalists either. Neither <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Hannity_4353.html" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a> (conservative) nor <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Colmes_8f4d.html" title="Alan Colmes">Alan Colmes</a> (liberal) are referred to as journalists on Wikipedia.

<p>I think the argument for "journalist" is that O'Reilly built his early career on journalism, and perhaps even recently has received awards for "investigative journalism." Not arguing either way, though. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 07:22, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sdedeo has it correct, O'Reilly is a career journalist. Those comparisons (by Ilyag) are valid, but they only add small weight, in my mind. Al Franken is a humorist and comedian, by career; Howard Stern is a disc jockey; Liddy is a lawyer; Savage is a nutritionist; only one or two even have a background in journalism, let alone making an entire career of it. To me, the POV here is best exemplified in the statement, "He himself does no journalistic work." Going all the way back to college, Bill O'Reilly is a journalist, by education, by background, by career (except for short stint in secondary education), <b>as recognized by his peers</b> (read: the awards). Again, to characterize an individual life by one job, seems nnPOV to me. To characterize <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i> as mere blogging, is nnPOV as well. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenwmccrary58_d710.html" title="User:Stevenwmccrary58">SteveMc</a> 19:06, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, seems to me the discussion on this has gone on long enough, and we should try to bring it to a close. Any suggestions on another name that might bring consensus, such as Bill O'Reilly (journalist and commentator), Bill O'Reilly (journalator), Bill O'Reilly (commentalist), Bill O'Reilly (broadcaster), Bill O'Reilly (the loud and opinionated journalist who bloviates on Fox News Channel), Bill O'Reilly (non-partisan&#160;;-) )? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenwmccrary58_d710.html" title="User:Stevenwmccrary58">SteveMc</a> 20:36, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the only valid choices are Bill O'Reilly (commentator) and Bill O'Reilly (broadcaster). As far as him being a "career journalist"... this article's purpose is to describe who he is, what his personal and professional history is, and the reasons he's so well-known:</p>
<ul>
<li>What he is - a political commentator on television, radio, and in print, and host of television and radio programs.</li>
<li>Personal history - growing up on Long Island, attending college, family details, etc.</li>
<li>Professional history - he started as a journalist, had a brief stint as a teacher, moved up to host Inside Edition, did award-winning investigative reports, etc, up until his current job on Fox.</li>
<li>Reasons why he is well-known - controversies derived from his highly publicized views, the response of the critics, and O'Reilly's response to these critics.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that the article should be categorized in this manner, and as such believe that describing him as a "journalist" fits into only his professional history, not the section on who he currently is. This is a clear precedent established on Wikipedia. Despite of your reply to my listing of fellow radio and television personalities who do the same exact work as O'Reilly, Savage is NOT described as a "nutritionist", he is described as a commentator. If you change O'Reilly's description, change Savage's as well. Likewise, G. Gordon Liddy is not described as a "lawyer" for the same reason (regardless of what you personally may refer to him as). The precedent on Wikipedia exists, and should be followed. It exists even outside of political commentators. For example, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Edwards_8861.html" title="John Edwards">John Edwards</a> is a "career lawyer", but his primary description (i.e. the one in the opening paragraph and not in his professional history section) describes him as a Senator and Vice-Presidential candidate. --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 21:15, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Despite some thoughtful comments above, I haven't changed my mind on this issue. O'Reilly is a commentator. Thats his current occupation so, despite what work he may have done years ago, thats what his primary description should be.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 01:11, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have removed the POV tag and the talk regarding it, since I added it in the first place. I came here as a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Cabal_9d17.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal">cabal mediator</a> to help resolve the issues raised between Fluterst and Ilyag. Ilyag's original concerns were resolved early several days ago; Fluterest's concerns have not been resolved, but Ilyag may be willing to compromise on a different name, the suggestions for that remain above. I believe that a mediator's job is to suggest solutions to both parties, but the final solutions should be implemented by the parties. I did by best to defend the position of Fluterst, since he was blocked from using Wikipedia. However, I will not make the change, that would be going beyond the duties of a mediator (as I see them). In any case, my job is done. This page is too controversial for me to keep track of, so I hope to encounter each editor on another page.

<p>Is this one appearance on David Letterman's show really considered a highly publicized dispute? Sounds like Letterman got a few good jabs at O'Reilly but thats about it.

It doesn't because this is NOT a highly publicized dispute. I'm going to remove it. If someone wants to put it back, please try to justify its reinsertion.

<dd>Exactly. It simply hasn't turned into a highly publicized dispute. The consensus here seems to be that the Letterman stuff does not belong in this article, so it'll continue to be removed. The thing I don't get about people who keep adding this nonsense to the article is that O'Reilly has in fact had far more notable "disputes" of varying degrees with many other individuals that aren't even mentioned in this article. As an example, shouldn't there be a section on his repeated insults of Cindy Sheehan? Wouldn't that make much more sense than the Letterman non-issue?<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 05:03, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that the interview does provide important information to anyone who wishes to make a judgment about O'Reilly. It is an instance where he is faced with an openly hostile critic and where he is not in control of the interview. I very rarely watch his show, but I was impressed with how he handled himself and answered intelligently in the face of the ad hominem attacks by Letterman (Question - Have you ever had anyone close to you killed in combat Mr O'reilly?) Overall, I would say the article tilts slightly to the left and a reader with no knowledge of O'Reilly would be more likely to come away thinking he is conservative, opinionated to the point of being an ideologue, and not necessarily concerned about facts. A link to the full interview would allow them to see how he justifies himself in front of an antagonistic host and an audience that is sympathetic to the host. At least, I found my opinion of him was changed after watching the interview, though I doubt I'll be a regular viewer.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It was actually pretty rare, too. He hardly ever keeps his silence on his show, and has gotten pretty steamed when challenged by hosts and guests on shows like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardball.html" title="Hardball">Hardball</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fresh_Air_deea.html" title="Fresh Air">Fresh Air</a> (the latter of which he walked out on.) The thing is, any O'Reilly fan, critic or neutral observer could pick a promotional interview that they think is interesting, and highlights the side of him they would like to see more of in the article, but it would be extraneous. If a silly non-spat with Letterman was worthy of inclusion, surely the previous two examples and many more would also qualify, but I don't think any of them do.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think the rationality to his behavior is as follows: Fresh Air and Hardball purport to be neutral channels forums for the conveyance of news. Letterman's show is an entertainment vehicle. When he perceives neutral forums to be putting a slant on stories related to him, he flips out. There's no point in my addition here about the article, just thought I'd stick my nose in.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeveroon_d5fc.html" title="User:Severoon">Severoon</a> 22:57, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do you mean what does it have to do with 0'Reily. It's called criticism and the reader should be aware of the criticism of O'Reily. And I'm surprised there is no section for that.

<p>Thanks, the older article is certainly more accurate and unbiased than the current one. Yet it still doesn't mention (a simple sentence works) that O'Reilly settled out of court when he said he would fight the charges to the end. That's pretty major don't you think?</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. At best, it's just an attempt by opponents of O'Reilly to nitpick and then yell, "See? See? He really is a douchebag!" Unlike what certain people believe, this article's purpose is NOT to document each and every criticizable thing O'Reilly has ever said and done. Every time the article goes into this level of depth in attacking him (whether those attacks are justified or not) or even if they go into this level of depth to PRAISE him, the article must be edited down immediately. --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 17:24, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Level of depth? Give me a break. If you don't want to sound like a hypocrite then how about you delete the "feuds" that O'Reilly has, that is pretty in depth for a article. I mean what you say is pointless because level of depth is relative and subjective. The fact that he settled is just that a FACT and it should be included because I think that gives a really "IN DEPTH" and appropriate picture of who this man is. Nothing left wing or right wing about it, facts are facts. Isn't that what O'Reilly himself thinks?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reverts By Guettarda</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that Guettarda reverted some details that I had edited earlier today. I am not an O'Reilly fan, but I believe the article should remain as NPOV as possible. Could Guettarda, or anyone else, please explain why it is believed that the following is relevant to an encyclopedia?:</p>
<p>-"After the show, O'Reilly screamed at Glick, "Get out of my studio before I tear you to f_ _ _ _ _ g pieces." <i>I think its very possible that O'Reilly indeed made this threat but from what I understand the only source is Glick himself, who has said that it happened after the cameras were shut off and there were no witnesses around. I think if this line is reinstated it should say something like "According to Glick, after the show O'Reilly screamed at Glick, etc" and that should be immediately followed by a link to a source of information. This is pretty inflammatory material to have without a source, don't you think?</i></p>
<p>--"On the air since the advent of the Fox News Channel in 1996, The Factor gained its popularity in the late 1990's through O'Reilly's relentlesss attacks on Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal." <i>I don't believe this is NPOV. As is, the sentence indicates that it is completely unquestionable that O'Reilly relentlessly attacked Clinton; I believe my change is superior: "</i>On the air since the advent of the Fox News Channel in 1996, The Factor gained its popularity in the late 1990's through what some critics described as "O'Reilly's relentlesss attacks" on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> during the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monica_Lewinsky_f914.html" title="Monica Lewinsky">Monica Lewinsky</a> scandal." <i>Again, the way I feel about O'Reilly convinces me that he probably did rant against and attack Clinton but this is an encyclopedia and should not have such a negative tone.</i></p>
<p>--"According to the Rolling Stone, the Factor serves as the "centerpiece" of "a cable channel [that] operates as little more than a PR arm for the Republican Party: putting a negative spin on anything to do with Democrats and issuing a steady stream of upbeat, often factually inaccurate, cheerleading for the Bush administration." <i>Despite the fact that this is sourced, I think there's plenty of info later in the article strongly suggesting that O'Reilly is a conservative and a supporter of the Republican party. If you believe its important to retain this sentence, it should be moved to the more appropriate "Political Beliefs" section.</i></p>
<p>--"O'Reilly denounced Franken as an "idiot" and screamed his now-signature comment: "Shut up!" Fox then sued Franken and his publisher for using the words "fair and balanced" in his book's subtitle, claiming infringement of Fox News Channel's trademarked slogan. To no one's surprise, a judge called Fox's suit "wholly without merit" and threw it out." <i>The details are not at issue, as the linked video makes clear, its the hyperbolic, overly emotional tone of the writing I have a hard time with. Please "To know one's surprise"? I will try to rewrite, keeping the details but toning down the melodrama. Then you can tell me what you think.</i></p>

<dd>I looked at your edits, and they looked good. There were two sets of edits after your - one by an anon who reinserted material which was in the article previously (and Saginaw) and a second anon who had removed a lot of material critical of O'Reilly. Every so often someone comes along and removes criticisms of O'Reilly, and as I have been doing for months, I reverted the deletion. Deleting text without explanation is often considered vandalism. I was simply undoing vandalism, I have no interest in engaging in an edit dispute about whether the Saginaw material should or should not be in the article. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 05:48, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

While Bill O'Reilly is a noteworthy and controversial individual that people might wish to research, I firmly believe that this article needs to be trimmed down to a significantly more readable and managable size. People who either strongly agree or disagree with O'Reilly often come into this article and add anything and everything they agree/disagree with him on into the main article, and then claim that their "beef" with or "support" of O'Reilly is relevant and necessary. I disagree. While MENTIONS of these items may be necessary and appropriate, the sort of long-winded essay-sized elaborations into these topics are most certainly not. I'm asking for your opinions on this matter, and if you agree with me, suggestions on what should be trimmed, edited down to a smaller size, or entirely removed from this article. --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 07:15, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, the article can be cut down. The "Controversies" section has no real limits, as was evident when the Letterman appearance was discussed. Basically, the way this section is structured makes it prone to bloat. Mentioning so many incidents is prohibitive to brevity, because an incident has to have context, O'Reilly's opinions, and someone else's opinions. If we want to keep all of these controversy items, I think they may need their own page. Here's what I propose for further editing:</dd>
<dd>I see two classes of "controversies" here that can help focus editting and trimming specifically. First, there are habitual stances, almost themes, towards certain groups (alleging a left-wing bias in the media, derriding foreign governments who don't cooperate with U.S. policy [e.g. France], bias against critics of the U.S. military, bias against the ACLU, and harsh penalties for criminals). O"Reilly basically incorporates these themes thoughout all his commentary. These are part of his public persona.</dd>
<dd>Second, there are specific incidences where O'Reilly tells someone to shut up, insults them, or takes an extreme position. These almost always involve one or more opinions from the first category. They are examples where O'Reilly or someone he is talking to or about provokes the other and a "scene" developes. --<a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVector4F_755d.html" title="User:Vector4F">Vector4F</a> 23:34, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, articles are not "cut down". If an article becomes so large as to be unreadable, certain segments should be moved to a daughter article. An example would be the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> article which spawned <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_life_of_George_W._Bush_440e.html" title="Early life of George W. Bush">Early life of George W.

<li>Ilyag (and others): The article has been trimmed down about a dozen times in the past, and within two weeks balloons back up to what you see now. Honestly, your time would be better spent elsewhere unless you can figure out a real solution to the problem. Merely editing it won't work. A disclaimer at the top of the article, perhaps linking to a "manifesto" about the article's history and how future edits should be considered, would be a good step, though perhaps un-Wikipedian.</li>

<dd>Wikipedia is a great resource, and generally works very well, but when it comes to articles about individuals - especially the living and currently famous - it's an absolute mess.

<dd>I have not been able to recently watch the video, but from what I have read, Franken spoke for some time without O'reilly saying anything. O'reilly claimed Franken spoke for 35 minutes, however it supposedly was more like 22. Anyway, I do not know if it was O'reilly's turn to speak or whether he just got fed up with Franken, but when O'reilly started talking, Franken kept on trying to cut him off. That's when O'reilly told him, "Shut up. You had your 35 minutes. Shut up."--129.252.176.46 21:54, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Keith Olberman</span></h2>
<p>Someone has added a section on <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Olberman_332b.html" title="Keith Olberman">Keith Olberman</a>'s criticism of O'Reilly <b>three times</b>, referring to Olberman calling O'Reilly the "Worst Person in the World", and I removed the paragraph each time. My reasoning has nothing to do with POV. The fact is, O'Reilly is criticized by many people in many different venues. This is no more a "controversy" than when anyone else attacks O'Reilly. It clearly does not belong under the topic of "controversies", as it would be the ONLY part of the section that in NO WAY deals with anything that O'Reilly said or even participated in, and only deals with what Olberman said about O'Reilly. For whoever wants to keep adding this section: Please add it to Olberman's article, as it far more pertains to him than O'Reilly. And, if the defense for adding this paragraph here is that Al Franken has a section (he too criticises O'Reilly), the reason THAT belongs in this article is because there is a constant back-and-forth debate/fight/controversy in which both O'Reilly and Franken participate frequently. With Olberman, the only way O'Reilly has ever participated was by insulting Olberman's show over having low ratings.</p>
<p>To sum up, what Olberman says about O'Reilly is not O'Reilly's "controversy". If it is a controversy at all, it's Olberman's. If your intention is to merely catalogue a list of people or instances when O'Reilly has been attacked, please add a seperate section on that and include other instances as well. However, this would likely turn the POV of the article as a whole <b>significantly</b> into an anti-O'Reilly piece, and I don't think I'm the only one who would strongly discourage the formation of such a section, especially since the number of people who publically criticize O'Reilly numbers in the hundreds and even thousands (starting with almost every Democratic member of Congress, most well-known comedians, and about a million newspaper editorials), and would flood this already-lengthy article to death. So, please, don't even start that section at all. --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 06:01, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First of all, would you then go to the Wikipedia articles of every other individual that Olberman has called "Worst Person in the World" and make a reference to it, or isn't it much easier to go to Olberman's article and compile a list THERE of all the people he has given this title? And second, exactly how is it O'Reilly's controversy in any way? The section's subtitle is: <b>Over the years, there have been some ongoing controversial issues highlighted in O'Reilly's print and broadcast work.</b> How does Olberman's "Worst Person in the World" bit fit into this description in any way, shapre, or form? --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 07:10, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

First, I can't reply to you personally since you have no page. Second, I did bring it up here on the talk page and got no response. The source says nothing that proves he was "wrong" about anything, it says that he was wrong in their bias opinion. whatever though, I will leave it alone. --24.11.154.78</p>

<dd>Regardless of bias, the information on Media Matters is factual and accurate. They may use the information to showcase a specific point of view within the context of their own website, but this doesn't mean that the information is wrong. In other words, you may disagree with their conclusions, but you cannot disagree with their facts. --<a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyag_60d0.html" title="User:Ilyag">Ilyag</a> 19:31, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Regardless of whether you agree with the position of Mr. O'Reilly or not, it seems inappropriate and POV to claim that Mr. O'Reilly's statements have been "proven" false based solely on the editorials of a blatantly liberal-biased website. It seems to me that it would be better to rephrase the final line of this section to "Several of Mr. O'Reilly's claims have been disputed” rather then declare them proven wrong. It would also be better if a more accepted news source was quoted than a liberal activist website such as Media Matters (I am neither supporting nor opposing Mr. O'Reilly's position with this statement, just pointing out the apparent POV of this section).BambinoPrime 07:58, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>-But some of O'Reilly's claims aren't merely "disputed", they are inarguably false. Media Matters does indeed have a "bias", in that they proudly advertise themselves as a progressive organization intended to point out what they perceive as deliberate conservative misinformation in the media. Media Matters does so not by mere "editorials", as you claim, but by presenting links to actual interviews and news sources. Since you apparently didn't bother to read anything once you noticed the links took you to an alleged "liberal activist" website, please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>O'Reilly claimed that the U.S. Postal Service no longer sells spiritual postage stamps; Media Matters links to an interview in the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i> with a United Postal Service spokesperson who flat out calls O'Reilly's claim "absolutely not true." In another word, false. Do you believe the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i> is a "biased" "liberal activist" newspaper?</li>
<li>O'Reilly claimed of Sagina that "the township opposes red and green clothing on anyone." Media Matters referred to a linked report from WNEM-TV 5, a Saginaw TV station, in which the township supervisor called O'Reilly's claim "[F]lat-out not true." In another word, false. Is WNEM-TV 5 part of the "liberal activist" conspiracy?</li>
<li>O'Reilly claimed that a Plano school prohibited their students from wearing red and green clothing. Media Matters provides a link to a telecast in which O'Reilly himself admitted later that this was not true. In another words, it was a false claim.</li>
<li>O'Reilly claimed that a Wisconsin elementary school changed the lyrics to "Silent Night" and forced their students to sing only the "politically correct" new version. Media Matters provided a link to a <i>Washington Post</i> report that showed this was not true, and that the lyrics had been modified only within the context of a play that had been performed without controversy in numerous churches throughout the country. Nonetheless, O'Reilly has continued to repeat this, yep, false claim. Of course, I imagine you're going to say that the <i>Washington Post</i> is a "liberal activist" newspaper.</li>
</ul>
<p>The simple fact is that O'Reilly has made several false claims that he has utilized to support his allegations of a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>. Just because you dislike the Media Matters website doesn't mean their facts are wrong.<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHal_Raglan_623d.html" title="User:Hal Raglan">Hal Raglan</a> 16:40, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, there's no need to be insulting. Please make your point without resorting to attacking; that shows the weakness of your position, not mine. I will not respond, nor will I throw any insults back at you or any other editor of this website.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Nothing you have said changes the POV problems of this section. This is an encyclopedia. It is not meant to give, or even imply opinions. It is to be a simple statement of fact based upon unbiased information, no more and no less. Great care must be made to remove even an implied bias, or the information is useless.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Using one source, ANY one source as the factual proof of your claims is at best limited and at worst POV. I would have made the same argument if the only linked source of corroboration came from Free Republic or any other conservative media source. If you want to link offsite, link to the direct news articles, not a left (or right) leaning editorial. This allows the reader to make u p their own mind based on the facts presented. If the conclusion is as obvious as you believe. Then that is the conclusion that people will come to after an objective review of the facts. The fact that you or anyone else may or may not agree with the conclusions reached (I make no assumptions) does not make it appropriate for Wikipedia. No conclusion should be presented; simply lay out facts from respected news sources and let people make up their own minds.BambinoPrime 06:20, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, from the source cited it says "Are Herbert and others helping the terrorists by misdirecting, in my opinion, the motive for terrorism? "Talking Points" will not condemn Herbert for that opinion. I think it's wrong, but not intentionally aiding the killers."</p>
<p>SO, to say he called Herbert a "terrorist Helper" is very POV. The NPOV way to write is is to say waht he said , that he was unintentionally helping the trerorisys, but I see you reverted that change as well. 24.11.154.78 00:35, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article states that O'Reilly characterized Herbert as a "terrorist helper". In the cite, O'Reilly states, "So Bob Herbert is most likely helping the terrorists..." —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 00:38, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>and, in the cite as above, it also says "unintentionally", so why are you so opposed to making it more neutral?24.11.154.78 00:41, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's not exactly what is said. While O'Reilly does say that Herbert's opinion regarding the motive for terrorism (terrorism is being exacerbated by the Iraq War) is not intentionally aiding the killers, he makes it clear that Herbert "is most likely helping the terrorists" and that "those helping the enemy will be brought to your attention". —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 00:59, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, then put the quote as it is in the article rather than parphrasing it into "terrorist helper" so it can remain NPOV</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand your objection. O'Reilly characterized Herbert as a terrorist helper, even if he claims that one aspect of his "helping" is unintentional. O'Reilly also takes Herbert to task for not condemning the ACLU regarding Abu Ghraib. In this regard, O'Reilly claims that "any picture of accusation of an American abusing a Muslim is a terror recruiting tool", but O'Reilly chalks this up to Herbert's "hatred of Mr. Bush". He makes it clear that Herbert is "helping the enemy", intentional or not. —<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViriditas_d60b.html" title="User:Viriditas">Viriditas</a> | <a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViriditas_82a1.html" title="User talk:Viriditas">Talk</a> 01:14, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, where in those sources you gave does it say that Fox claimed a tape existes, much less that the tape was revealed to contain lewd sexual suggestions? I read "Fox believed Mackris had tape recordings of the long, highly detailed conversations alleged in the suit, but Morelli never confirmed that, saying only that they had concrete evidence." The other article says "that O'Reilly "wants to hear the tapes if they exist." SO, what I read is that the existence of the tape WAS NOT CONFIRMED, from your own source, so please delete the claim from the article, there was no tape revealed in which he made lewd sexual suggestions, there was only speculations. It is POV and innaccurate to say Mackris later revealed an audio tape of a telephone call in which O'Reilly made lewd sexual suggestions towards her. 24.11.154.78 00:57, 2 February 2006 (UTC) I also do not see where your last edit changes anything. Give me a link to this factual transcript of the tape. There was no transcript released, in fact, if one does exist it would be a breach of the settlement to release it anyway.</p>

"The draft complaint contained several lengthy block quotes of statements that O'Reilly allegedly made to Mackris.

<p>Right you are. See, these were ALLEGED statements, so it should be sufficient for the article to say that Oreilly allegedly made these lewd comments. The article now says "Mackris revealed a transcript of a telephone call (thought to be based on an audio tape) in which O'Reilly made lewd sexual suggestions towards her.". This is very POV. A transcript was not revealed in which he made these comments as a matter of fact (or beyond a preponderance of the evidence), AND the statement 'thought to be based on an audio tape" is POV too. Thought by who? Just remove it and let it be NPOV. There is no need to make him sound guilty or innocent. Write the stright facts and nothing more.24.11.154.78 01:18, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The following sentence appears in the introduction: "O'Reilly also hosts a radio program syndicated by Westwood One, called The Radio Factor, and has five books (one of which is a novel)." The clause <i>"...and has five books..."</i> is ambiguous, in my opinion. It seems to me that it could either mean that O'Reilly has <i>written</i> five books or that he <i>owns</i> five books.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Addition Under "Alleged Liberal bias in the media"</span></h2>
<p>The overall disputed text in this part appears to be this overall text&#160;:</p>
<p><i>This, in part, has lead many to view Bill O'Reilly as a closeted conservative Republican. According to imdb.com, "Politically he has always claimed he is a registered independent on The O'Reilly Factor. But it was later revealed O'Reilly was actually a registered Republican in Nassau County from 1994 to 2000. O'Reilly re-registered as an independent soon after."</i></p>
<p>To a certain extent, this text may be a good addition in that it adds understanding to earlier references to O'Reilly being a Republican but this text addition is still in dispute by some, including myself. For the moment, all I have done is revise the link formatting for the section since having a full quote as a link seemed kinda pointless. Anyway, lets talk about this hear instead of having an editing war on the main article! <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClindhartsen_3e98.html" title="User:Clindhartsen">Chris</a> 04:48, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, it seems to me there might in fact be a small NPOV problem that remains. The final paragraph of the section discussing the sexual harassment suit leaves one feeling as though O'Reilly's position is that he avoided admitting guilt, and therefore never wants to speak of the issue again. I believe it is more accurate to characterize O'Reilly's position differently—that he settled to avoid having the allegations played countless times in the media, but that he ultimately didn't do anything wrong. (Keep in mind, I'm not stating <i>my</i> viewpoint here, but I'm attempting to accurately characterize his.)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lack of Charitable Giving...POV?</span></h2>
<p>Would it be appropriate to list charitable giving as a significant aspect of O'Reilly's life? From what I've heard, he's tithed a certain percentage of his paycheck since he started working to charities (even before he hit it big). It seems to me excluding significant and ongoing philanthropy from the article is significant POV. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeveroon_d5fc.html" title="User:Severoon">Severoon</a> 17:43, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you want to add a section on O'Reilly's philanthropy, you should also add a section on his for profit mass marketing business which includes brand mechandise such as Factor cups, Factor pens, Factor baseball caps, and Factor holiday ornaments. <a href="http://www.billoreilly.com/store" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.billoreilly.com/store" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 21:13, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be relevant and fine to add to the charitable giving section a mention about Factor gear. It's not my intention to embarrass anyone...but the claim you make about his "for profit mass marketing" is incorrect. The Factor tchotchke is marketed by him for charitable purposes as well, at least according to him (the following are quotes taken from the email segment on his show, emphasis is my own):</dd>

<dd>As to O'Reilly 's money earned from billoreilly.com, it's a conflict of interest to use O'Reilly mouth as a source for these figures. Also I noticed that O'Reilly sells his books through that website. Are you claiming that the money made from his books goes to charity? I challenge you to find out what money he earns from mechardising. Is he paid a salary by the merchandising companies, does he get royalties, does he take part of the profit, is it a combination of these factors, or none at all?

I googled "oreilly charity site:foxnews.com" and hit <b>I'm feeling lucky</b> and got <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,178225,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,178225,00.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> (do a page search for <i>charity</i> and you'll go right to the line). Look, I'm not a big O'Reilly fanatic or anything, I just think this article shows a pretty big slant by omitting the philanthropy aspect of his life (wikipedia lists it for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Soros_3686.html#philanthropy" title="George Soros">George Soros</a> and those of other political persuasions). I think wikipedia runs the risk of being perceived as not giving traditional or right-of-center people a fair shake just because the subject of the article doesn't hold a fireworks show in honor of himself every time he writes a check for a good cause. Also, it's relevant to the article because it gives him a certain moral authority on the issues he raises about charities having responsibility to donors, as his history would seem to demonstrate that his motive is bigger than just getting ratings.</dd>

<dd>It is true that most of his donations, unlike Soros' for instance, are kept personal, though...so I'm not sure of how a resource such as this ought to handle the issue, hence the original question mark in the title of this section. There probably isn't going to be much in the way of third-party evidence of his giving; I just assumed that it makes sense to take him at his word unless there's a compelling reason not to. It does seem like a significant oversight to me, though, and not very balanced to go down the list of feuds and his holding of charitable organizations accountable to donors with no mention at all that he's interested in charities from both aspects, both holding them accountable and donating his own money to them—the impression of him immediately changes from one of opportunism to concern in light of this knowledge. It would also seem to unnecessarily cast doubt and inject POV if the article referred to his charitable giving as <i>O'Reilly claims...</i> when there is no compelling reason to think otherwise. Can someone more experienced suggest some wordsmithing on this one?</dd>

<dd>Regarding your questions as to whether he collects a profit on his books...I was discussing the "Factor tchotchke" if you read my reply carefully. The confusion in your question evidently arises from the idea that the term <i>tchotchke</i> includes books—an interpretation I admit that's never occurred to me. I hold books in relatively high regard, which typically prevents me from referring to them as <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=tchotchke" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=tchotchke" rel="nofollow">cheap, showy trinkets</a>...but that's just me I guess.</dd>

At no time was I advocating that we set up Mr. O'Reilly in this wikipedia article as one who is running (nor does he claim to run) a not-for-profit business or a charity with his personal website, his Fox News presence, or in any aspect of his life. Rather than have you guessing at what I'm trying to say, <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a>, I'll try to reiterate my original meaning in starting this section as concisely and simply as I can.</p>
<p>I feel the article (or the newly created controversies article, depending) ought to address his relationship with charities, both holding them accountable, and for perspective, his personal involvement in terms of donation. The changes made in the post-9/11 Red Cross and other big charities as a result of his scrutiny have been positive (at least as far as the charities themselves are concerned, all said and done). They've also generated quite a bit of controversy, which ought to be added to the controversies page (a George Clooney entry, perhaps). I do not believe I'm coming at this article from the standpoint of wanting to see him painted in a favorable light, nor do I want the article to leave a negative impression either. The fact that he promotes his show by selling mugs and doormats and whatever else I do not personally see as a big strike against his character (who doesn't engage in self-promotion? is that really a character issue? is it relevant to his effect on charities?).</p>
<p>I'm simply suggesting that someone add this relevant and significant info. As he is a highly controversial subject, I do not feel comfortable doing it myself. I don't see the need to put words in my mouth in order to make your point, <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a>, as pointed out by 65.83.137.137.

<p>If in this article other personalities with which O'Reilly has a beef are refered to as left-wing, should then O'Reilly's be labeled as well? I suggest either we remove references to Olberman and Franken as left-wing, or we be fair and also apply a label to O'Reilly. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 21:09, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What is the need for a one-word label when there's an entire section detailing his <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28commentator%29_c07d.html#Political_beliefs_and_point_of_view" title="Bill O'Reilly (commentator)">political beliefs and point of view</a>? My opinion on this is that one should not be objectively labelled something other than what they claim for themselves unless there is a compelling reason to do so (not to invoke Godwin's Law&#160;:-)...but the example comes to mind—it would be fine to override a label if the self-assigned label were totally unsupportable, such as Hitler describing himself to be a pacifist). However, in this case, O'Reilly calls himself an independent, and the article shows he does not clearly fall into line on every issue with either the Republicans or the Democrats. What does he believe deep in his heart? I don't know—we can't read minds, so we should stick to the facts as the article currently does.</dd>

<dd>To sum up, Reagan was a Republican because he claimed it for himself and his actions and stated beliefs accorded well with that label. Clinton was a Democrat for reasons the same. How ought we refer to Bill O'Reilly in this context? <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeveroon_d5fc.html" title="User:Severoon">Severoon</a> 01:41, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just say what Bill O"Reilly says and does. Left/right labels can only be established after all that has been stated anyway, but they frequently are used in place of actual information. In other words, we don't need left/right labeling. It only comes in handy when you want to make a group generalization (e.g. "leftist media"), but even there it is usually so vague as to be near-useless.</dd>

<dd>It seems reasonable to remove the left-wing categorization (note also the newly created <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies_bce5.html" title="Bill O'Reilly controversies">Bill O'Reilly controversies</a>). It seems ridiculous to even bother trying to make a scheme of left/right labeling fair (reminds me of Fox News) without going outside the bounds of an article like this. Only make use of general labels when they are necessary to understanding the controversy (e.g. when O'Reilly speaks of a leftist media). When in doubt, loose the jargon and keep the facts. --<a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVector4F_755d.html" title="User:Vector4F">Vector4F</a> 02:26, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bill O'Reilly has said that he is, in fact, a "traditionalist". Now, who else has he called a traditionalist? Bush and Dobson - "traditional leaders". So what are we to infer from that?</p>

<li>Removed "right-wing" label from description of O'Reilly at beginning of article. His views are adequately described in the article and readers can make up their own minds as to whether or not he's right wing. --<a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 02:11, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>When is it time to call a spade a spade? When does point of view and move from opinion to fact? I honestly can't believe that anyone with a modicum of independant capable thought and a passing familiarity with Bill doesn't realize he represents the conservative agenda. Just because Bill denies he is conservative, it does not make it so. To fail to call him a conservative is a attempt to fool the public, which is akin to lying. This litany of evidence, from Bill's mouth, is proof of his conservatism.</p>

<dd>why dont you listen to Limbaugh for a while? Limbaugh is further to the right than O'Reilly and hes still mainstream. You have to remember there are both economic and social dimensions to political affiliations and most people would agree that Bill OReilly leans conservative on social issues, but not far right. Almost no one would agree that he is an economic conservative. He's solidly centrist on economic issues.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 15:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, but I'd rather listen to a female cat in heat. Seriously though, Bill's TV show is a on a news network and thus he must make an attempt to follow some kind of news format. Limbaugh, on the other hand, runs his own show, can do whatever he wants, and doesn't have work with news producers. That difference is reflected in Bill's Radio Factor program where he says things like, "Howard Dean; the biggest coward in the country, bar none, number one on the hit parade", "I don't have any respect for the Iraqi people by and large. I think they are a prehistoric group", and "John Kerry is a sissy". On his O'Reily Factor program, he leaves those kinds on comments to his regular guests like Ann Coulter. Of her many appearances on that show, he has never used his no-spin rule to pull her reins. Describing Bill as not being as far right as Limbaugh isn't really much of a defense. They're both really out there, and it doesn't make much of a difference who leads the pack in which they run. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 16:23, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think he is far-right, but don't refer to him as far right-wing in the article. I do however support calling him a right-wing commentator, because that is exactly what he is. O'Reilly is an advocate for the right wing and this is fact as supported by the links I posted above. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 00:47, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"*Confirming he will never confront the right." The video cited did not "confirm" anything. O'Reilly was stating that TraToss' do not have the mainstream acknowledgment the far left does so they are irrelevant. This is probably the case because Bush is in office and the far right are more placated. When Clinton was in office it was the other way around. One could make the argument that O'Reilly never focused on them that much at the time but his Fox News show was fairly new and was only getting popular toward the end of Clinton's run. It might be interesting to see what O'Reilly was talking about his first few years on Fox.</p>
<p>As for labeling him a far-right conservative, that would still be POV. I believe he is more sympathetic with conservatism overall but as long as he claims to be independent, whether you think he is full of it or not, it is better to not use labels. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 03:20, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But the far-right has plenty of high profile activists, it's just that Bill's defenition of right extremists is so titled that it exlcudes just about everyone, which is further proof of Bill's conservatism. To him only people like Nazi Germany and David Duke are too far right. Meanwhile he calls Howard Dean, the leader of the democratic party, "The number one coward in America" and the ACLU "The most dangerous organization in the United States of America right now". Slanted? I'd say so! Later Bill, lauds praises on his regular guest Ann Coulter, who on her off time says extreme right and insulting things such as "There are a lot of bad Republicans; there are no good Democrats" and "It would be a much better country if women did not vote. That is simply a fact". How about taking on Billy Graham who directs his people to pray for the deaths of freely elected leaders? Nope, not extreme enough. Yes, Bill does not admit to being a conservative, but saying what you are does not make it a fact. You don't have to call yourself something to be something. Hitler never declare himself dictator, but that didn't stop the rational rest of the world from labeling him as one. Tell me why is it that overwhelmingly Republicans like Bill and the Democrats dislike him? Oh, and let's not forget Bill's registered as a Republican. Gentlemen, it is time to call a spade a spade. Bill advocates the right, he is a conservative. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 21:39, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Me and my comrades? Is that a thinly veiled attempt to label me a communist? Please, let's not resort to school yard tactics. I know Bill refuses to admit he is a Republican (even though his voter registration shows otherwise <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200510030001" class="external autonumber" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200510030001" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>), and I have stated Bill represents the far-right. I don't advocate that exact terminology in the article, but you need to realize that when we describe things like a public figure, it is sometimes useful to use labels like religious, secular, conservative, and liberal. For instance, when describing a figure that governs a nation by seizing power, and then abolishes the institutions which threaten his control, we could use the term dictator to describe him. This person may refuse to label himself a dictator, but the definition of who you are is not decided by the individual, but by society. In other words, a person is not how they describe themselves, he is what his words and actions make him. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 08:43, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am a avid fan of Wikipedia, and after reading many well-written and well-cited sources, I am extremely disappointed with the quality of this article. As a reader wishing to simply discover the facts about Mr. O'Reilly, I was astounded by the level of incoherentess to which this article has been degraded. This article seems like a battle ground between POV forces, using Weasel Words as well as inappropriate use of "Citation Needed" to either degrade or suppress facts. Wikipedia is not the place for this type of writing; readers can simply read their newspaper's Op-Ed section for this content. Wikipedia simply requires the statement of facts in a coherent and unbiased manner, and although these standards are realistically unachieveable, this article does not attempt to provide A neutral feel. I am not so much disappointed with Wikipedia as I am with those who have decided to abuse Wikipedia and the right to information that it provides.--Conchuir 09:33, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>O'Reilly is a conservative, no doubt about it (I am, too). But he has said before that he is against the death penalty. Wouldn't this count as one of his rare non-right wing views? He's also good friends (professionally, at least) with <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Asner_6d7e.html" title="Ed Asner">Ed Asner</a>, a self-avowed Socialist.</p>
<p>BTW, even Dubya acknowledges global warming is a fact. There is no scientific consensus as to its cause, or to the dangers it will bring, and Bush hasn't weighed in with a strong opinion in these areas. Acknowledging global warming has occurred over the last three decades is hardly a liberal POV. Lots of other conservatives have done the same. -- Gerkinstock 04:35, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

After Katrina, O'Reilly realized that everyone should own a firearm. On the radio, and on his show, he advised everyone to buy a rifle to defend themselves after a major catastrophe. He has changed his mind 180 degrees on gun control.</p>

<dd>This section is necessary but it is a tough thing to present in a NPOV context. The template is great and keeps POV edits contained. There is still need for improvement but it is a step in the right direction. Since O'Reilly has claimed many times that his is an independent, it would be interesting to have a section that shows which of his opinions are Democratic talking points and those that are Republican. It may be a good alternative to the "implied" section. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMurph101_c20f.html" title="User:MrMurph101">MrMurph101</a> 03:21, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mrmiscellanious, I think you have a very good point regarding "implications". They probably don't have a place in wikipedia.

<p>It seems to me that simply retitling the sections as "Liberal Views", "Moderate Views", and "Conservative Views" would solve the POV problem since while whether a view is conservative, moderate or liberal or not is a matter of perspective, as long as a consensus can be reached it should be okay. In addition, these titles simply state the facts, with as little bias as possible. <a href="../../../b/w/a/User%7EBwabes_043c.html" title="User:Bwabes">Bwabes</a> 02:44, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I claim that voter decided definitions of marriage is a liberal position. I think it is opposed by most conservatives and moderates. I think that people who erase this or rhetoricize that marriage is a 'human right' are simply trying to pigeonhole BIll Oreilly as a conservative. Rush Limbaugh is conservative. Bill Oreilly is center right.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 00:20, 24 May 2006 (UTC) I also thnk that the dont ask dont tell military policy is moderate, not conservative. The question is not can gays serve in teh military-- that happens now. Citing a poll where 60% of americans favor that is false. I agree that banning gays from the military is a conservative view. But the question was not about banning gays from the military, rathter it was about the moderate position of 'dont ask dont tell' which bans gays from opnely serving in the military.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 00:20, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I have reviewed this section of the article. It seems unlikely that we will attain consensus on which positions are conservative, moderate and liberal. We could edit this section to include O'Reilly's characterization of himself along the political spectrum and how various noted liberals, moderates and conservatives charatcterize him. We could then discuss his positions without labelling them liberal, moderate or conservative. --<a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 00:27, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think consensus can easily be reached if we try. I am sure that a consensus can be reached on what is liberal and what is conservative on a 5 point scale or something. It is deciding where teh center is that is difficult. But we can agree on methods. For instance we can assume that the Republican party is right wing with a right-center platform and the Democratic party is left wing with a left-center platform. Then research the platforms what is in common is moderate. Or suggestion 2 assume moderate means the central tendency of voters and what is popular vis-avis polling data. <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 05:52, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm less optimistic. There are numerous reverts on the section. On some of these issues it is not entirely clear to me what the conservative or liberal position is. For example, on gay marriage is the conservative position a federal ban (favored by social conservatives) or leaving it up to the states (which would be favored by those who support states' rights)? --<a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 06:19, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well if you cast a net and reel in 90% of conservatives and 5% liberals or moderates its a conservative view. Sometimes you have to choose to participate in a system because you think its useful and you try to ask more general questions that can be clearly classified. I like the system of pigeonholing issues into conventional political stands.

<li>I favor keeping the current system and simply debating what is liberal, moderate and conservative. Most only require common sense. The fact of the matter is that liberals do not support voter decided definitions of marriage, because liberals believe no one's rights should be decided by voters. Period. That's a very widespread belief and as simple as saying conservatives believe in "tax cuts". You can call it a "moderate" viewpoint if you want, since conservatives would rather keep marriage between a man and a woman at all costs, and merely use voting to do so. I don't think it really belongs on the list at all, though. It's simply a strange thing to say. Why don't you simply edit the statement and make it "O'Reilly believes marriage should be a man and a woman" and call that a moderate statement? It's such a strange statement, the idea that that is a political viewpoint. Someone's belief about WHAT marriage should be between (man-woman, same-sex) should be the political viewpoint, not HOW to get there. That's simply odd.--69.249.195.232 01:16, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you are that young let me explain that it was only in the last five or so years that dictionaries began to change the definition of marriage. The oxford english dictionary cites 1975 as the first year in the english language that the term 'marriage' was used in a published work to refer to a same-sex marriage. Currently the OED defines marriage as: The condition of being a husband or wife; the relation between persons married to each other; matrimony (In small print it includes "The term is now sometimes used with reference to long-term relationships between partners of the same sex"). Now husband is 'A man joined to a woman by marriage' and wife is "A woman joined to a man by marriage". It is a liberal or progressive view to change an established social institution and it is a conservative view to resist changing it.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 15:10, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Supporting the descisions of voters either way it turns out (either for or against) is NOT a liberal position. I do not know how to make that any more plain. If I were to say in a dispute that the voted will decide one way or another, and that I will support their decision it is not polically slanted. On the other hand if I said I supported the legislation to allow gays to be legally married and it should be cast to a vote, that is different. Bill's statement is that he would support the descision of the voters. Case closed. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 05:34, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A moderate position is civil unions. A liberal position is redefining marriage.

<p>Okay, I will say this again, perhaps in a different way. Supporting the idea that if some reason the people are to vote on a new law (however it may turn out, yea or nea), you will support the decision of the voters ... this is neither left, right, or moderate. It is expressing support of our system of government.

<dd>Bill O'Reilly stance is that he would support the decisions of the people in this matter after it is put to a vote. When you do not know the outcome of the vote, it is neither, left, nor right, nor moderate. For example, if the vote was majority no, Bill could then say, "The people have spoken by refusing to pass law X and have declined to allow gays the rights to marry" and thus Bill would be against gay marriage. If you read carefully what Bill saying it's that he supports the Populist view, a support of the voice of the people. It is an example of the Populist postition O'Reilly claims to be coming from, and one that he states (actually referenced in the first paragraph of that section of the article) does NOT fall into any political category. Now, I said "not know the outcome of the vote" earlier ... if you know of a specific law that was passed by the people regarding a definition of marriage, and can reference a quote from Bill where he said he supports that particular law, then you can throw it into a political column, otherwise like I have said it is neither a left, a right, or a moderate stance. If not I say this specific issue be dropped from the left, right, and moderate columns, though perhaps it could be added somewhere else in the article to support O'Reilly's Populist claims. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 19:19, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now to the issue of the deterring crime. Bill has sometimes states he opposes of the death penalty, and at other times he is in support of it as verfied by references.

<p>You cant seriously doubt that he has an anti-death penalty position, especially since even media matters acknowledges it (this is the same case currently cited in the article) <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200503160005" class="external autonumber" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200503160005" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. It is however important to point out his inconsistancies (which is what the article does-- I even think I added the inconsitency). As for his death penalty views you are trying to claim they are linked to his views on hard labor. My sense of his death penalty position is that he is against the death penalty because he is Catholic (or at least for the reasons given in the popes opinion). In which case I dont see what hard labor has to do with it.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 14:02, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bill has stated that he doesn't believe the death penalty is approriate because it doesn't serve as a good deterrent. As for him not believing in killing people for crimes, just read here <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200503160005" class="external autonumber" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200503160005" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200503170008" class="external autonumber" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200503170008" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> where he laments people that don't support putting people to death. How about when Bill advocates hanging here <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200601030007" class="external autonumber" title="http://mediamatters.org/items/200601030007" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>? There goes your he doesn't believe in the morality of the death penaly argument. As to my point about Bill believing the death penality is not harsh enough, how about this quote "I don't believe in the death penalty, but I don't think what we have now is enough. When you kill a human being you should be forced to work for the rest of your life in a harsh environment." <a href="http://billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShow&amp;showID=86#6" class="external autonumber" title="http://billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShow&amp;showID=86#6" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> You may also want to read <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penal_labour.html" title="Penal labour">this</a> wikipedia article on penal labor. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 00:23, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The above is more than enough evidence to support that Bill's position on the matter of the death penalty is not liberal. Like I said before, I think his view could be considered conservative.

<dd>We know big government does not have all the answers. We know there's not a program for every problem. We have worked to give the American people a smaller, less bureaucratic government in Washington. And we have to give the American people one that lives within its means.The era of big government is over. But we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves. Instead, we must go forward as one America, one nation working together to meet the challenges we face together. Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we must have both.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe our new, smaller government must work in an old-fashioned American way, together with all of our citizens through state and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable and civic associations. Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of their own lives -- with stronger families, more educational opportunity, economic security, safer streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world.</p>

<p>The rally cry against big government has long been a staple of conservatism. Though it is not easily accomplish does not remove it from the conservative sphere. You must instead rely on the sweeping of history of the republican party's rhetoric, as compared to the democratic party, to draw your corollary conclusions. In that regards I'm sure you'll find the social repertoire of conservatism opposes the interests of big government. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 02:31, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You may also want to see policy on drug companies writing medication legislation for the conservatives, and energy companies doing the same. Conservatives arguing against federal banking requirements, and taking social security into privatization. You can alos look at the goverment power company supervision the conservatives oppossed and pushed for <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_electricity_crisis.html" title="California electricity crisis">deregulation</a>.</p>

<p>If your point above is that conservatives can have liberal viewpoints, I agree. My point is that we need an objective measure of what is conservative, liberal, or moderate. Centrist is a provable term, and relates to the central tendency of the population. THe polling tends to agree with intuition about liberal and conservative, showing that conservative and liberal issues are not favored by a majority. Social security privatization has variable polling-- there is a majority in favor of partial privatization and a majority against eliminating social security.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 01:57, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I take it back. There are a few polls showing a small majority (an NBC poll) but more consistently there is a majority against partial privatization (CBS, ABC, CNN, etc.)<a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/social.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pollingreport.com/social.htm" rel="nofollow">[42]</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Joseph Lieberman Edit</span></h2>
<p>Why was the entry on Lieberman removed? Lieberman is widely regarded as a centrist in the party, and O'Reilly attacked him during the primary campaign in 2003 as a secular, quasi-socialist who had an "immoral" tax plan.</p>

<p>I do not believe this section contributes much to understanding O'Reilly, but is merely a seratim list of people he allegedly views as "far-right" or "far-left." Except for the Ayn Rand Institute, the people he views as far-right are universally regarded as such. We might as well say "O'Reilly believes in gravity. The list of people he regards on the far-left is missing cites. Some of the cites that are included do not support the proposition that O'Reilly thinks they are far-right. I will go through the list and remove those names without citation.</p>
<p>Generally, even if we are left with some names on the list, I do not know that this contributes all that much to an understanding of O'Reilly. --<a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap</a> 21:49, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>the only citation that had confusion is the Ayn Rand institute. It didnt say strictly he considered tehm far right, but close enough. He has said it on his show tons of times.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Malmedy massacre</span></h2>
<p>Added new section on the second time O'Reilly has claimed that American soldiers were responsible for the mass murder at the Malmedy massacre. The claim is false and disgustingly paints the murdered American soldiers as war criminals. Also, note that FOX News has editied the witten transcripts for the interview replacing the words "Malmedy" with "Normandy", even though in the video transcripts show he was unmistakable referencing Malmedy. References for both the first and second claims should be online shortly. Also since the original newsite is editing the written transcript, what is the policy for officialy quotations in this matter? <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysrpl_89a7.html" title="User:Sysrpl">Sysrpl</a> 01:43, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
