<p>Normally, I would slap the appropriate copyvio template on the page, and it would be deleted soon after, however, in this case the content seems to have come from a source which is intended for public research, so I would at least like to offer you the chance to re-write the article from scratch, replacing any text from that site with text of your own.

<p>Hi, I have just been doing some tidying up, disambiguating links to <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican.html" title="Republican">Republican</a>. I see you have been doing great work on lots of articles, but I thought I'd drop you a message because a lot of the edits I have been correcting are yours.</p>
<p>As you'll see, the link in my first sentence here (which I wrote as [[Republican]]) points to a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> page -- in this case, a page which describes all the different meanings of the word "Republican".</p>
<p>In several of your edits, you have used [[Republican]] when the link was clearly intended to refer to the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party (United States)</a>.</p>
<p>The way to that correctly is to used this text, which I have italicised here for clarity: <i>[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]</i>. That way, the link will appear as <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> ... but it will bring you to the page you want.</p>
<p>Please could you try to use this form of link when you mean to refer to the Republican Party? Thanks! --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 12:23, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your reply on <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">my talk</a>.

<dd>However, I hope you won't take this the wrong way when I say that although you are doing great work creating lots of new articles, it'd be even better if you took a little more time to learn how Wikipedia works. Apart from the link problems I pointed out, most of your articles are uncategorised, and that makes your hard work much less valuable, as well as leaving it to other editirs to do a lot of tidying up.</dd>

<p>As someone who's also working on articles related to New Orleans and Louisiana politics, I really appreciate the work you're putting into articles on Louisiana politicians. I'm thinking, though, that now that I've started a series of articles on Louisiana and New Orleans elections, a lot of the material on specific campaigns and election results that you've added to articles on politicians might be better suited to the new articles on specific elections. See the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_gubernatorial_election%2C_1963-64.html" title="Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1963-64">Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1963-64</a> article for an example of how I've used your data to add detail to an election article. I'll wait until I hear what you think before I start removing it from biographical articles on politicians, though.--<a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPraxedis_G_3baa.html" title="User:Praxedis G">Praxedis G</a> 18:01, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Billy. I just ran through your excellent article on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_T._Beaird_96fa.html" title="Charles T. Beaird">Charles T. Beaird</a> to bring it more into line with Wikipedia policies and procedures. In particular, be careful not to violate the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> policy. Writing that sounds overly praising of the subject is not in keeping with Wikipedia's established style. Also, it is accepted practice to only link to the first occurrence of a term and then not to link thereafter (in your piece, you linked almost every instance of <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shreveport.html" title="Shreveport">Shreveport</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_8fa4.html" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a>). Lastly, we have many categories for people in particular rather than the broad categories you applied. For example, rather than <a href="../../../p/h/i/Category%7EPhilanthropy_083a.html" title="Category:Philanthropy">Category:Philanthropy</a>, Beaird falls under <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_philanthropists_2525.html" title="Category:American philanthropists">Category:American philanthropists</a>. These categories go at the end of the article, and you can make sure the article will sort correctly (by last name) by using a piped link. For example, putting <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_T._Beaird_96fa.html" title="Charles T. Beaird">Charles T. Beaird</a> into a category with text like [[Category:American philanthropists]] will cause the article to be sorted under its first letter, C. To force it to sort by last name, you do this: [[Category:American philanthropists|Beaird, Charles T.]] The category name will show up on the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_T._Beaird_96fa.html" title="Charles T. Beaird">Charles T. Beaird</a> page, and the article will now be filed under the letter B on the appropriate category page. In the end, though, don't sweat the small stuff. You'll pick all this up in time. I hope you stick around and continue editing! — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 17:00, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, for example if you added categories, "categorized" would be a good summary as would "+Category:<i>whichever ones added</i>". If somebody has died and you add info about that, "Add materal on death", etc... It lets others see what was done, which can speed up editorial review. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:44, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We welcome people who are knowledgable about a subject writing about that subject; but verifiability and lack of biased editing is important. Sometimes experts about a subject feel their opinion should count rather than supply a source; we can't verify an editor's identity let alone expertise and so we insist on verifiable sources. Sometimes experts have a bias or a conflict of interest that that gets in the way of a NPOV article; behavior on the part of the expert and common sense on the part of observers can lead to the expert being asked to contribute to the talk page instead of the article itself. Sometimes wikipedia inadvertently drives away experts for no good reason at all; I hope things work out ok. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 03:25, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks, but I could not find where on the Talk Page to place comments. The original challenge to the article is in the "edit" section of the article itself. Also, I have been given directions on how to place photos in an article, and I cannot understand the directions. Do you have a simplifed set of directions, listed 1, 2, 3, etc.</p>

<p>Hi, Billy. I saw a comment from you somewhere that you didn't know how to sign your comments on talk pages. All you do is type ~~~~ (four tilde symbols in a row). When you save the page, the tildes will be converted into your signature and the date and time. The tilde ~ is the key at the upper-left-hand side of your keyboard.</p>
<p>As for adding images to articles, are you having trouble uploading them or simply adding them to the article page? Let me know which, and I'll try to explain it in simple terms.

<p>Thanks, Brian, but the instructions make no sense to me on either finding the pictures, tagging them, or uploading them.</p>

<dd>If you have a specific image you want to use, you can email it to me and I'll place it for you. Just click on my name, then click "E-mail this user" on the left of the browser window.

<p>Just so you know, I did some cleanup work on the Richey article and the links in it.</p>
<p>Although, you might want to find some other location to store the information that you could have had in those Yahoo mail links. Linking to Yahoo mail isn't going to work, because we all can't access your inbox.</p>

<p>Billy, I wish to commend you on your work on the "Seymour Weiss" page. I'm a newbie, and was feeling a bit down over how to clean up, or amend the article to fit within the most proper guildline here. Also, I was at a small loss as how to communicate with someone, who could assist me, or 'carry the ball' for awhile. Your additions, and revisions, are clean, and professional, and very much appreciated. Thanks - Sincerely, Brad Michael Moore bmm at bradmichaelmoore.com67.142.130.35 22:16, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for the kind comment, Brad. I find that one of the most difficult things about Wikipedia is how to contact other writers. I happened to have the Dict. of La. Biog. on Weiss and was going to add some of that material to the roster. Then I found that someone had already written on Weiss. So I blended what I had with what you had already presented and made it consistent in style. I don't think I left out any of your points in the editing process.</p>
<p>I really did not know much about Weiss until I did this editing earlier in the week. I had no idea, for instance, that he golfed with Bob Hope, but so many golfed with ol' Bob, didn't they?</p>

<p>Thanks, Scott for the kind remarks. I also will add that Cleveland appointed Nicholls to the Board of Visitors of West Point, but I don't know just what that board was (or is). It would also be good to find what Nicholls raised on his plantation, presumably sugar. It would also be good if we could find the exact 1876 election returns between Nicholls and Packard.</p>

<p>Thanks for your great contributions to the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_L._Madla_a684.html" title="Frank L. Madla">Frank L. Madla</a> article. With finals coming up, I hadn't had a chance to add some more extensive info on the page. One quick question, though, about the changes to the references that I had. I had been trying to follow other examples on reference usage and had the embedded <i>&lt;ref&gt;(reference info)&lt;/ref&gt;</i> tags to indicate what info came from what source, and the <i>&lt;div class="references-small"&gt;&lt;references/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</i>, in the <i>References</i> section to consolidate them and "pretty" them up. I noticed that your edits moved my embedded references from the info that was being cited, and copied them into the <i>References</i> section. Not having worked on that many bios while making references myself, I want to abide by what's accepted practice for references, so if you have ny thoughts on or reasons for the changes, please let me know. — <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBellhalla_a3a2.html" title="User:Bellhalla">Bellhalla</a> 13:46, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To Bellhalla, I d not know how to do the imbedded commands. When I saw that my article was much more extensive than your, I just went with my artice but kept your commands in the Reference section. I think that all your information was already in my article too. I wrote the article without seeing that someone else had already done an article on Mr. Madla. That was a horrible tragedy! Fell free to move your commands back to the exact text. Do you know how to get a photo of Madla in the story?</p>

<dd><b>Example:</b> in the <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzanna_Hupp_c410.html" title="Suzanna Hupp">Suzanna Hupp</a> article several references you have listed are from <a href="http://www.ussearch.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ussearch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ussearch.com</a>.

(If you had used a footnote, it would of course eliminate any doubt as to what this is supporting and/or your source for Mr. Lindsey’s date of birth.) Setting aside the issue of the lack of relevance of Mr. Lindsey's age to <i>this</i> article, at best it gives an estimated year of birth for Edward Lindsey.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would also suggest that you try to keep the information in articles relevant to what one would expect in an encyclopedia. For example, in the <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Grover_61be.html" title="Henry Grover">Henry Grover</a> article, of the approximately 2,600 words you added, almost 1,100 — over 40% — were the eulogy by his son. If anything is included in the eulogy that is not covered in the article, include that portion, reference it, and then put the link to the full item in an <i>External links</i> section.</p>
<p>In some articles you have often included information that is relevant in an encyclopedic sense, but not in the context of the current article. For example, in the <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzanna_Hupp_c410.html" title="Suzanna Hupp">Suzanna Hupp</a> article, the extended discussion of Mr. Aycock’s electoral win and percentages is more appropriate for a Jimmie Don Aycock article rather than the Hupp article.</p>
<p>Another thing I have seen in several articles that you have contributed to are dates of births and deaths for other people mentioned in the article. The dates of birth and death for the subject of the article are of course relevant, but are usually not for others mentioned in normal contexts. The <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzanna_Hupp_c410.html" title="Suzanna Hupp">Suzanna Hupp</a> has some good examples of where dates are relevant and where they probably aren't. In my view the fact that Edward Lindsey was born in 1938 is not relevant to the Hupp article (unless his age was a factor in the campaign, for example). But the date and manner of death for her parents are important in the formation of Hupp’s political beliefs, and are therefore relevant.</p>

<p>Billy, some helpful information you might like to know: When you are posting a comment on a Talk Page, all you need to type is this: ~~~~ (The tilde symbol, <b>~</b>, is usually in the upper left corner of your keyboard. You might have to hold the SHIFT key down when pressing the key in order to make sure it is a tilde and not a back tick symbol, which looks like this: <b>`</b>.</p>
<p>As an example, in the previous Talk Page item I left above, at the end I typed this: <b>Thanks — ~~~~</b>. The wiki software in use here automatically turned it into this: <b>Thanks — <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBellhalla_a3a2.html" title="User:Bellhalla">Bellhalla</a> 13:42, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</b>.

<p>I'm not sure if there's a better place for this, but this could work.</p>
<p>Anyways, from the results that I see on the CQ Voting and Elections database for 1920, it appears that Harding won 14 Parishes in South Louisiana. Splitting the results into regions says that Cox won North Louisiana by 71%, won Southeast Louisiana by 36%, and won Acadiana by 318 votes. (When it comes to regions, <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acadiana.html" title="Acadiana">Acadiana</a> is the region mapped on Wikipedia, SE-LA is everything Southeast of West Feliciana, North LA is everything else. Just in case you wanted more info there)</p>
<p>Anyways, would there be any articles on here worth checking out when it comes to Republicans in Acadiana? The results I get to see as a member on Dave Leip's site say that the Republicans best region in the 1912 and 1924 elections was Acadiana. And then the region voted for Al Smith (for regions that are probably not a huge shock).</p>
<p>But then again, maybe Woodrow Wilson angered that part of the US a lot around 1920. It's possible.</p>
<p>Either way, if there's any more useful information on this topic, feel free to pass it on.</p>

<p>I think it is a good idea to put party in the succession boxes. It shows if there is continuity when an office changes hands or if there is a party switch. It also looks much better from an aesthetic view to have the party labels listed. And it is almost no extra work at all.</p>
<p>Compare: clearly the former looks much better than the latter.</p>

<dd>The consensus — by practice, if not by vote — seems to be that party labels are not included in the succession boxes. While I respect your <i>opinion</i> that the former box “looks much better”, I <i>disagree</i> with it and feel the latter is much cleaner and easier to read. Nevertheless, the consensus is <b>not</b> to put party labels in boxes, and I hope you will abide by that. Also, whether or not it is more or less work is irrelevant, because the consensus is <b>not</b> to put party labels in boxes.</dd>

<dd>Also, in you second box, presumably this is the box that would appear at the bottom of the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Richards_47ae.html" title="Ann Richards">Ann Richards</a> <s>box</s> article. If that is the case, adding her name in the box is redundant because the <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Richards_47ae.html" title="Ann Richards">Ann Richards</a> article is — <i>by definition</i> — about <i>her</i>.

<dd>Sorry if I was not explicit enough on the {{<a href="../../../h/e/l/Template%7EHelpme_09e4.html" title="Template:Helpme">helpme</a>}}, but what you need to do is to create a new section on this, your talk page, and give it an appropriate title, like “I need help on <b>X</b>” (where <b>X</b> is what ever you need help with). Then, below the heading type these actual characters: two left braces, the letters ‘helpme’ and two right braces. (It should look like this when you type it: {{<a href="../../../h/e/l/Template%7EHelpme_09e4.html" title="Template:Helpme">helpme</a>}}.) Then state your problem or question, along the lines of “Where would I go to propose a change to <b>Z</b>” (where <b>Z</b> is whatever you want to ask about.</dd>

Mayor Robertson</p>
<p>This is certainly not autobiographical, or it would likely have included the full date of birth, rather than the year.</p>
<p>It is not really biographical either (almost nothing found on his earlier years) -- it is mostly about local elections in which Mr. Robertson has been a candidate and Mr. Robertson's leadership over his city.</p>
<p>Where is there a Wikipedia policy that a city must have a population of 20,000 for its five-times-elected mayor to be included? Many notable people have come from small cities.</p>
<p>He is the longest serving mayor (it appears) in the history of his city, certainly the longest serving since World War II.</p>
<p>He is notable in his section of the state. The article contributes to the political history of Louisiana.</p>

<p>Mr. Wimberly was an official of the American Ex-Prisoners of War interest group and was a POW in Germany from 1944-1945. He was principal of four public schools in Webster Parish, Louisiana, and meets the test of notability in his area. He is listed on the Springhill, Louisiana, town website as among the notable persons in his community, along with the football player John David Crow and the singer Joe Stampley.</p>

<p>Billy as I said in my tag; "Mr. Wimberly" sounds like a very nice man. However, I know several individuals who were POW's. Some in WWII and a few in 'Nam. A few have the same creditanls, some even better, as Mr. Wimberly. Praise worthy a big YES Encylopedia note worthy sorry to say no.

<p>Hi, Billy.

In the future, you should direct those kinds of questions to the admin who deleted the article (you can check the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" title="Special:Log">log</a> to see who it was -- just click there, enter the name of the article that was deleted, and it will show who deleted it), or <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">the Help Desk</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Peer_review/Keggy_the_Keg&amp;oldid=104693698" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Peer_review/Keggy_the_Keg&amp;oldid=104693698" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the last version of the page that you edited, in case you wish to copy &amp; paste your comments from there to the Help Desk or elsewhere.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with the article about the POW that you're talking about, but it sounds like it was deleted under the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">speedy deletion policy</a> -- usually deletions require discussion, as you mentioned, but in certain specific cases, they can be deleted without warning. It also sounds like the page you're talking about was a <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> delete -- the criteria for a speedy delete in that case is any article that makes no <i>assertion</i> of notability, i.e. one that does not say anything that could be construed as a claim of notability.</p>
<p>If you think the article was deleted unjustly, you can seek a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a> to undelete it. I'd say your best place to start, though, is the deletion log above and asking the admin who deleted it why s/he did so and under what justification.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a line -- I'd be glad to help you through whatever channels you choose to pursue. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 23:04, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The editor who deleted the article also deleted my challenge. It was a one-man decision. That is why I wonder why no one else was involved. The person deleted is listed under the "notables" section of his hometown municipal web page. He, like all of the POWs, I presume, had an interesting story to tell.</p>
<p>By doing "speedy deletion", the editor can make a decision unilaterally. If he allows input from others, he is less likely able to get the article he opposes deleted.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help or suggestions that you may give.</p>

<p>Thanks for your edits on <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Nolan_e82b.html" title="Philip Nolan">Philip Nolan</a>. A couple of pointers. Check when you create a link to see where it goes. In the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Nolan_e82b.html" title="Philip Nolan">Philip Nolan</a> article you linked <i>Spanish</i> which goes to a disambiguation page, where none of the items really apply to Spanish colonial possessions. The more appropriate link might have been to <i>Spanish Empire</i> piped as <i>Spanish</i>. I have made the change. Second the Wikipedia convention is to refer to the subject of a biographical article by just using his or her last name, unless the article is talking about a variety of people with that same last name. So after the introductory sentence, Philip Nolan is correctly referred to as <i>Nolan</i>. Date conventions vary within Wikipedia. It is considered impolite by some to change the date format of another editor, except to make an article internally consistent. As you may have noted, the software default in Wikipedia is: day, month year. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 00:05, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like the Thomas H. Welch article to be sent to a committee for review, not just have one person unilaterally decide that it is unsuitable. I had never heard of River Phoenix until he died. This artist may not be that notable, but this story is unique in part because of the name of the punk rock band.</p>

<p>The article about Thomas H. Welch may be notable, but should be delete because the information lacks any reliable sources or references. We have to make sure the information is correct and verified. Add some sources, msg me, and I should likely change my opinion. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 04:18, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>What if I called the Los Angeles County coroner's office and tried to find out about the cause of death? It might be that the information can or cannot be obtained?</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBilly_Hathorn_274c.html" title="Edit section: Your biographical articles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Your biographical articles</span></h2>
<p>I see that you have a an extensive history of creating biographical articles. The enthusiasm is genuinely appreciated. However, I'm wondering if perhaps the Wikipedia community can get you to pay more attention in your work to Wikipedia policies on such things as <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">copyright violations</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is <i>not</i></a>?</p>
<p>Your talk page seems to indicate that you have been cautioned about these things many times. A number of your articles have been deleted for the policy violations. Yet, your editing behavior in those areas doesn't seem to have changed. Just today you have created several articles on non-notable individuals, some of which appear to be copied straight from the obituary section of a newspaper. I'm sure the Wikipedia community would like you to bring you to the understanding that that is simply not acceptable.</p>
<p>One of your creations today Wayne L. DuBose is simply a re-creation of an article you created that the community already rejected, (when it was called Wayne DuBose). You obviously were aware of the community's decision on that article since you participated in its <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Wayne_DuBose_5662.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wayne DuBose">deletion discussion</a>. Yet you've intentionally defied that community consensus by just re-creating the article with a slightly different title. Unfortunately, actions like this do not help to show <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> on your part.</p>
<p>You obviously have a great deal of energy for working on biographical articles, so that's certainly something Wikipedia can use. And indeed you seem to be genuinely desirous of making a positive contribution. So in the interest of helping to make sure that that happens, I'd like to reach out and ask you if you wouldn't please start making an effort to be more mindful of the encyclopedia's policies in your future efforts?</p>

<dd>First of all, allow me thank you sincerely for reading what I had to say and taking the time out to reply. I really do appreciate the fact that you are thinking about it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Two minor notes before getting into the rest of it: 1) you wrote your reply to me on my user page, rather than on my talk page. I went ahead and moved it for you, but please try to remember to put further comments on the talk page, and 2) I noted on my user page that I am actually <i>not</i> Matt Welch. My name is Michael. 8-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now as to the issue at hand, I appreciate the fact that you attempted to re-write the article, but what you need to keep in mind is that the primarly <i>reason</i> the article was rejected the first time around is that the individual is <i><b>not</b></i> notable by <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Wikipedia's standards</a>. The primary issue was not how the artcile was written; it was simply that Pastor DuBose does not merit an article <i>at all</i> in the first place, no matter how well-written it might be. Now, I know you disagree with that assessment. But the community has already made it's judgment on that point and quite convincingly. About a dozen other editors chimed in and not a single person other than you found this person to be notable. You are not required to agree, by any means, but we do need you to at least please put your personal disagreement aside, accept the community's consensus on the issue even though you don't like it, and move on to helping out on other articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So what I'm saying is that re-writing the article is simply not the point here. The person was not notable then. And nothing has happened between now and then that would increase the person's notoriety. So re-creating the article was not an appropriate thing to do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do you see what I am saying? <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 02:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your arguments in defense of articles such as Preston Dunn and William S. Gannaway are troubling, particularly given that, as I've said, you'd been notified before about this issue of your creating articles for non-notable people. You seem to have your own standards for what you consider to be "notable". And while you are entitled to your opinion personally on that point, it would be helpful if you would understand that when you contribute to Wikipedia, you are participating in the process as <i>part of the community</i>. That means you need to respect the <i>community's</i> polices on what makes a person notable, not stubbornly insist on applying your own standards, even though you've been advised otherwise.</p>
<p>The community's standards are outlined <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">here</a>. Please read it, and <i>please</i> respect it. For you to defend a subject's notablity on the basis of things like "he worked with the elderly" or "he went on combat missions" or "he was notable within the community of Portales, New Mexico" flies in the face of this community's established policies for notability. For you to offer reasons like that means that either you haven't read the community's policies, or you have read them and are just choosing to ignore them. Which ever the case is, I'm asking you if you would please correct that situation.</p>
<p>Perhaps, when considering creating future biographical articles, you can take a moment out and first ask yourself, "Has this person, or what this person created, been the subject of books or articles in major magazines or newspapers that the person or their organization did not publish themselves?" If the answer to that question is "no", then you should probably be thinking twice about creating a Wikipedia article about them. There are a few exceptions here and there, of course, but since you seem to be having some trouble with the notability issue right now, I think that might be a good guideline with which you can start. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 07:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The subject of the bio is notable. His or her children and parents are not notable, though they are usually mentioned. His or her spouse(es) are notable/. The details of their life and career are not, unless they are notable in their own right. The details of the early education are only of minor interest, along with the details of the early career, unless famous for that career. The details of whom the subject defeated in elections are not--if the opponents are notable, they will have their own articles. The details of the subjects illness are not, and--if living--are dubious also under BLP.</p>
<p>As for style, when a link to a WP article for a person is given, the b and d years are not usually required, for they will be in the linked article. It just adds to the clutter for the linked years. When a person is in a category, it automatically places the person in supercategories. Encyclopedic wording requires conciseness- the expansion of the exposition into as many sentences as possible is typical of obituary writing and political advertising, and inappropriate here. \</p>
<p>If too much or the wrong kind of detail is given, it tends, rightly or wrongly, to arouse suspicion of copyvio, personal or political advertising, spam, POV, and COI . This tends to make an article susceptible to AfD. Many of your articles have already been nominated for AfD, though not yet by me. If you are going to do the work, write them so they stay in. You will of course understand, that this is a friendly comment.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:38, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Related question: place. I tried editing one of the articles removing the town and parish of the peripheral characters in the plot, but I soon realized that it did help tell them apart. But again, just as you suggested on my talk page, this might be limited to the immediately relevant ones--and perhaps not both town and parish, especially for the larger towns. I recognize sometimes it's relevant, eg., is the opponent from the same immediate locality. So I'm going to check over what I did, and you too might make it read smoother this way, too, for you can select better than I can.</dd>
<dd>Except for people like monarchs and presidents, the bio articles here usually mention only the brothers and sisters and children, not the grandchildren. Birth date is I suppose relevant for brothers and sisters at least. (Similarly parents with both dates)</dd>
<dd>Links in general--I think you are using a program that automatically links the first mention of a particular year in the narrative. But this does not always make sense, because the use of this link is to produce: Events during ____, and probably it should be linked only for key events, such as the year of an election. Links to professions, etc.: some people do link al such words the first time they occur,but again, I think it's confusing. I am also wondering about links to such words as Senator--I think in most places they too slow down the narrative. People reading one of these articles will know what a senator is.</dd>

<ol>
<li>For physicians, the form of the name used is Dr.Ralph E. Maurer which usually avoids ambiguity</li>
<li>. Physicians are added to WP if their professional accomplishments are notable. This has usually required at least some of the following: A/appointments as clinical professors in medical schools</li>
</ol>
<p>B/ Published medical work of their own in books or numerous articles in peer-reviewed journals C/ Membership in a major specialty society, D/ membership in the appropriate <i>elite</i> professional society, such as FACS or FACP, E/ An award of some kind--the profession gives out many awards, so any notable doctor will have at least one or two, F/ Articles about their work in medical or general journals. For physicians before the 1950s, C/ &amp; D/ are sometimes not necessary</p>
<ol>
<li>With politicians you've been using a loophole about the stat legislatures. There isn't one here.</li>
</ol>
<p>I advise you to stick with politicians.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you really want to do medical biographies, get a list of the members of the National Academy of Medicine and do each of them. The members of the national Academy of Science already mostly have articles.</li>
<li>The amount of detail in a professional bio is limited to the education and immediate family and anything really interesting--e.g., some are also poets or musicians. .</li>
<li>I very strongly advise you NOT to include the final paragraph from the obit. It makes every article you do look suspicious, even if rewritten. The usual place to give the names of spouses and children is either at the end of the lede paragraph, of right after the education. For living minor children, birthdates are not usually given unless the guy has listed them on his own web p. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 17:29, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
