<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Bailey_b846.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Bailey spent the majority of his childhood in Bath, where he attended <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Edward%27s_School%2C_Bath_c900.html" title="King Edward's School, Bath">King Edward's School</a>.<sup id="_ref-KES_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-KES" title="">[1]</a></sup> He excelled in music, but also claims to have been good at sports, which often surprised his teachers. It was here that he was given his nickname Bill, when a history teacher once sang the song "<a href="../../../w/o/n/Won%27t_You_Come_Home_Bill_Bailey_40b4.html" title="Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey">Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey</a>" in class.</p>
<p>He spent his early years listening to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_f0e0.html" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a> records, and rehearsing with a band called the "Famous Five",<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> who he himself confesses were very bad but still much better than him. However, he is a classically trained musician and received an associateship with the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_College_of_Music_e076.html" title="London College of Music">London College of Music</a>. Despite this, he has said that he always had the temptation to be silly with music, a trait that influences his <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stand-up_comedy.html" title="Stand-up comedy">stand-up</a> shows.</p>
<p>Bailey often mythologises his early years in his stand-up. In his show <i>Bewilderness</i>, he claims to have attended Bovington Gurney School of Performing Arts and Owl Sanctuary. He talks about a succession of jobs he had before becoming a comedian, including lounge <a href="../../../p/i/a/Pianist.html" title="Pianist">pianist</a>, door-to-door door salesman and accompaniment for a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telepathy.html" title="Telepathy">mind-reading</a> dog. The third is verifiable, as a clip was shown during his <i><a href="../../../r/o/o/Room_101_%28TV_series%29_51fc.html" title="Room 101 (TV series)">Room 101</a></i> appearance.</p>
<p>He also talks about his role as a Disenfranchised Owl in an experimental <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Welsh</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre.html" title="Theatre">theatre</a> troupe (mentioned in an <a href="http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20020209/impressions/on_stage.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20020209/impressions/on_stage.shtml" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> newspaper <i>Post</i>). Other acting roles included a part in a <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers%27_Revolutionary_Party_%28UK%29_2491.html" title="Workers' Revolutionary Party (UK)">Workers' Revolutionary Party</a> stage production called <i>The Printers</i>, which also featured <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanessa_Redgrave_964f.html" title="Vanessa Redgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frances_de_la_Tour_cf6c.html" title="Frances de la Tour">Frances de la Tour</a>. His <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trivia.html" title="Trivia">trivia</a> page on <a href="../../../i/m/d/IMDb_27b2.html" title="IMDb">IMDb</a> also claims that he was awarded Best Actor in the 1986 Institut Français awards.</p>

<p>Bailey began touring the country with other comedians such as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Lamarr_3cae.html" title="Mark Lamarr">Mark Lamarr</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phill_Jupitus_fc85.html" title="Phill Jupitus">Phill Jupitus</a>. In 1986 he formed a double act, the Rubber Bishops, with <a href="../../../t/o/b/Toby_Longworth_56aa.html" title="Toby Longworth">Toby Longworth</a> who was replaced in 1988 by Martin Stubbs. They achieved a certain amount of success on the club circuit, partly due to their rigorous schedule — sometimes as many as three or four gigs a night. It was here that Bailey began developing his own unique style, mixing in musical <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parody.html" title="Parody">parodies</a> with <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deconstruction.html" title="Deconstruction">deconstructions</a> or variations of traditional jokes ("How many <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amoeba.html" title="Amoeba">amoebas</a> does it take to change a <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightbulb.html" title="Lightbulb">lightbulb</a>? One, no two! No four! No eight..."). Stubbs later quit to pursue a more serious career.</p>
<p>In 1994 Bailey performed <i>Rock</i> at the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh_Fringe_5b6f.html" title="Edinburgh Fringe">Edinburgh Fringe</a> with <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Lock_5823.html" title="Sean Lock">Sean Lock</a>, a show about an ageing rockstar and his <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadie.html" title="Roadie">roadie</a>, script-edited by comedy writer <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Miller_dde0.html" title="Jim Miller">Jim Miller</a>. It was later <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial.html" title="Serial">serialised</a> for the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Radcliffe_41e7.html" title="Mark Radcliffe">Mark Radcliffe</a> show on <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Radio_1_3f66.html" title="BBC Radio 1">BBC Radio 1</a>. However, the show's attendances were not impressive and on one occasion the only person in the audience was comedian <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominic_Holland_b33f.html" title="Dominic Holland">Dominic Holland</a>. Bailey confessed in an <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/theatre/features/article20740.ece" class="external text" title="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/theatre/features/article20740.ece" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> that he almost gave it up to do a telesales job.</p>
<p>He persevered, however, and went <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solo_%28music%29.html" title="Solo (music)">solo</a> the next year with the one man show <i>Bill Bailey's Cosmic Jam</i>. The show was very well received and led to a recording at the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Bloomsbury_Theatre_84d6.html" title="Bloomsbury Theatre">Bloomsbury Theatre</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> which was broadcast in 1996 on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> as a one-hour special called <i>Bill Bailey Live</i>. It was not until 2005 that this was released in <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncut.html" title="Uncut">uncut</a> and under its original title. It marked the first time that Bailey had been able to tie together his music and <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-modern.html" title="Post-modern">post-modern</a> <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html" title="Joke">gags</a> with the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whimsy.html" title="Whimsy">whimsical</a> <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rambling.html" title="Rambling">rambling</a> style he is now known for. (It should be noted that a lot of the jokes from this early show were reused for the later <i>Bewilderness</i> and <i>Part Troll</i> shows, leading to some consternation from fans for "recycling").</p>
<p>After supporting <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_McPhail_b7e5.html" title="Donna McPhail">Donna McPhail</a> in 1995 and winning a <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Out_dcb6.html" title="Time Out">Time Out</a></i> award, he returned to <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh.html" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> in 1996 with a critically acclaimed show that was nominated for the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perrier_Comedy_Award_c7fe.html" title="Perrier Comedy Award">Perrier Comedy Award</a>. Amongst the other nominees was future <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Books_cf3d.html" title="Black Books">Black Books</a></i> co-star <a href="../../../d/y/l/Dylan_Moran_ab1b.html" title="Dylan Moran">Dylan Moran</a>, who narrowly beat him in the closest vote in the award's history.</p>

<p>Though he had not won the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perrier_Comedy_Award_c7fe.html" title="Perrier Comedy Award">Perrier</a> in 1996, the nomination was enough to get him noticed, and in 1998 the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> gave him his own television show, <i><a href="../../../i/s/_/Is_It_Bill_Bailey__f668.html" title="Is It Bill Bailey?">Is It Bill Bailey?</a></i></p>
<p>This was not Bailey's first foray into television. As early as 1991, he was appearing in stand-up shows such as <i>The Happening</i>, <i>Packing Them In</i>, <i>The Stand Up Show</i>, and <i>The Comedy Store</i>. He also appeared as captain on two <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panel_game.html" title="Panel game">panel games</a>, an <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a> music quiz pilot called <i>Pop Dogs</i>, and the poorly received <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sci-fi.html" title="Sci-fi">sci-fi</a> quiz show, <i><a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Cadets_%28game_show%29_c3b9.html" title="Space Cadets (game show)">Space Cadets</a></i>. However <i>Is it Bill Bailey?</i> was the first time he had written and presented his own show.</p>
<p>With his star on the rise and gaining public recognition, over the next few years, Bailey made well received guest appearances on shows such as <i><a href="../../../h/a/v/Have_I_Got_News_For_You_715d.html" title="Have I Got News For You">Have I Got News For You</a></i>, <i>World Cup Comedy</i>, <i><a href="../../../r/o/o/Room_101_%28TV_series%29_51fc.html" title="Room 101 (TV series)">Room 101</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_O%27Connor_f408.html" title="Des O'Connor">Des O'Connor</a> Tonight</i>, <i>Coast to Coast</i> and three episodes of off-beat Channel 4 sitcom <i><a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaced.html" title="Spaced">Spaced</a></i>, in which he played comic-shop manager Bilbo Bagshot.</p>
<p>In 1998, <a href="../../../d/y/l/Dylan_Moran_ab1b.html" title="Dylan Moran">Dylan Moran</a> approached him with the pilot script for <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Books_cf3d.html" title="Black Books">Black Books</a></i>, a Channel 4 sitcom about a grumpy bookshop owner, his put-upon assistant, and their neurotic female friend. It was commissioned in 2000, and Bailey took the part of the assistant <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manny_Bianco_b1b2.html" title="Manny Bianco">Manny Bianco</a>, with Moran playing the owner Bernard, and <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamsin_Greig_9b0f.html" title="Tamsin Greig">Tamsin Greig</a> the friend, Fran. Three series of six episodes were made, building up a large cult <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanbase.html" title="Fanbase">fanbase</a>, providing the public awareness on which Bailey would build a successful national tour in 2001.</p>
<p>When <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Hughes_%28comedian%29_c4f8.html" title="Sean Hughes (comedian)">Sean Hughes</a> left his long-term role as a captain on <i><a href="../../../n/e/v/Never_Mind_the_Buzzcocks_ed34.html" title="Never Mind the Buzzcocks">Never Mind the Buzzcocks</a></i> in 2002, Bailey became his successor. His style quickly blended into the show, possibly helped by his background in music. He soon developed a rapport of sorts with host <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Lamarr_3cae.html" title="Mark Lamarr">Mark Lamarr</a>, who continually teased him about his looks and his pre-occupation with woodland animals.</p>
<p>When intellectual panel game <i><a href="../../../q/i/_/QI_f9ff.html" title="QI">QI</a></i> began in 2003, he quickly became a regular fixture, alongside host <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Fry_d29b.html" title="Stephen Fry">Stephen Fry</a> and comedian <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Davies_4cd9.html" title="Alan Davies">Alan Davies</a>. Other television appearances include a cameo role in the drama series <i><a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Creek_f883.html" title="Jonathan Creek">Jonathan Creek</a></i> as failing street <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magician_%28illusion%29.html" title="Magician (illusion)">magician</a> Kenny Starkiss and obsessed guitar teacher in the "Holiday" episode of Sean Lock's <i><a href="../../../1/5/_/15_Storeys_High_f0d8.html" title="15 Storeys High">Fifteen Storeys High</a></i>. He later appeared with Lock again as a guest on his show <i><a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Heaven%2C_Telly_Hell_9db2.html" title="TV Heaven, Telly Hell">TV Heaven, Telly Hell</a></i>. He has also appeared twice on <i><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_Night_with_Jonathan_Ross_8e14.html" title="Friday Night with Jonathan Ross">Friday Night with Jonathan Ross</a></i>, and is in demand as a guest on shows such as <i><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_%26_Judy_4507.html" title="Richard &amp; Judy">Richard &amp; Judy</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_News_5160.html" title="BBC News">BBC News</a></i>.</p>
<p>Bailey also presents <i><a href="http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/W/wild_thing/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/W/wild_thing/index.html" rel="nofollow">Wild Thing I Love You</a></i> which began on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_4.html" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_15.html" title="October 15">October 15</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.

<p>In 2001, Bailey began touring the globe with <i>Bewilderness</i>, which became a huge success. A recording of a performance in <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swansea.html" title="Swansea">Swansea</a> was released on <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> the same year, and the show was broadcast on Channel 4 that Christmas. A modified version of it also proved successful in America, and in 2002 Bill released a <a href="../../../c/d/_/CD_4170.html" title="CD">CD</a> of a recording at the WestBeth Theatre in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>. The show contained all his trademarks, popular music parodies (such as Unisex Chip Shop, a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Bragg_395a.html" title="Billy Bragg">Billy Bragg</a> tribute which he actually performed with Billy Bragg at the 2005 <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glastonbury_Festival_90b4.html" title="Glastonbury Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a>), "three men in a pub" jokes (including one in the style of <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geoffrey_Chaucer_fbe6.html" title="Geoffrey Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>) and deconstructions of television themes such as <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Countdown_%28game_show%29.html" title="Countdown (game show)">Countdown</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magic_Roundabout_1fab.html" title="The Magic Roundabout">The Magic Roundabout</a></i>. A 'Bewilderness' CD was sold outside gigs, which was actually just a mixture of studio recordings of songs and monologues Bill had performed in the past - it was later released in shops as <i>Bill Bailey: The Ultimate Collection... Ever!</i>. That same year he also presented a Channel 4 countdown, <i>Top Ten Prog Rock</i>.</p>
<p>Bailey premiered his show <i>Part Troll</i> at the Edinburgh Fringe in the summer of 2003. A critical and commercial success, he then transferred it to the <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_End_theatre_47e0.html" title="West End theatre">West End</a> where tickets sold out in under 24 hours, and new dates had to be added. Since then he has toured it all over the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> as well as in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">America</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. The show marked the first time Bill had really tackled <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">political</a> material, as he expanded on subjects such as the war on Iraq, which he had only touched upon before in his <i>Bewilderness New York</i> show. He also talks extensively on <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drugs.html" title="Drugs">drugs</a>, at one point asking the audience to name different ways of baking <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannabis_%28drug%29.html" title="Cannabis (drug)">cannabis</a>. A DVD was released in 2004.</p>
<p>2005 finally saw the release of his 1996 show <i>Bill Bailey's Cosmic Jam</i>. The 2-disc set also contained a <a href="../../../d/i/r/Director%27s_cut.html" title="Director's cut">director's cut</a> of <i>Bewilderness</i>, which featured a routine on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawking_e11c.html" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Brief_History_of_Time_c400.html" title="A Brief History of Time">A Brief History of Time</a></i> not seen in the original version.</p>
<p>In March 2007, Bill Bailey was recognised as the 7th greatest stand-up comedian of all time, part of the 100 Greatest Stand-Ups show on Channel 4.</p>

<p>Bailey has also proved to be a talented dramatic actor in two <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh_Fringe_5b6f.html" title="Edinburgh Fringe">Edinburgh Fringe</a> shows directed by Guy Masterson. He played Juror Number 4 in a 2003 version of <i><a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Angry_Men_7166.html" title="Twelve Angry Men">Twelve Angry Men</a></i> featuring 12 comedians, and also co-starred as Oscar in a 2005 production of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Odd_Couple_f29f.html" title="The Odd Couple">The Odd Couple</a></i>, alongside Alan Davies and several other comedians, including Owen O'Neill and Ian Coppinger.

<p>Many people have believed that Bill Bailey is in <i><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaun_of_the_Dead_2223.html" title="Shaun of the Dead">Shaun of the Dead</a></i>, thought to be a zombie in the background somewhere, but in the commentary included with the DVD <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Pegg_771c.html" title="Simon Pegg">Simon Pegg</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Wright_d84c.html" title="Edgar Wright">Edgar Wright</a> confirm he is not in the film because he was busy with other commitments at the time. He did however play two characters in the Pegg and Wright film <i><a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_Fuzz_633e.html" title="Hot Fuzz">Hot Fuzz</a></i>, perhaps making up for his earlier absence.</p>
<p>In February 2007 Bailey organised, produced and starred in a <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_End_6c5d.html" title="West End">West End</a> show called <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinter%27s_People_ab9e.html" title="Pinter's People">Pinter's People</a>, a collection of sketches by playwright <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Pinter_87e1.html" title="Harold Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>.
