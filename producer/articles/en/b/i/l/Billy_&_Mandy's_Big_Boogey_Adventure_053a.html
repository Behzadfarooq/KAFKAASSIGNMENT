<p>The movie begins with Endsville, two weeks from the past as an Underworld Master; Lord Horror sends two unrealistic robot replicas of Billy and Mandy named, Mandroid and Billybot to the past to stop Mandy and Billy from obtaining Horror’s Hand, a giant gauntlet/stone hand which Lord Horror has himself. As Mandroid and Billybot leave in a giant swirling vortex, future Billy and Irwin remember the old times and discover themselves too late to go in the vortex with Mandroid and Billybot. Billy takes out his time traveling blue prints for a new machine but turns out that it’s merely a drawing of policemen fighting a dinosaur. The duo decides to make a new machine while the audience must guess where Mandy or Grim is in the future.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the past, Grim goes to reap General Skarr who first thinks Grim is the TV repairman. He discovers the truth when Grim sends the TV into a vortex. It turns out that somehow Skarr has a hole through his stomach. Grim discovers Billy and Mandy in the room as well. Mandy claims that the two are bored and want to go with Grim to work. Grim refuses and Mandy claims that since Mandy won Grim in the game of Limbo, Grim has to be a best friend and any best friend would take they’re other friend to work if the friend had a cool job. Skarr makes a run for it in a modified car and Grim and the children chase Skarr using Grim’s scythe as part broom and part car. While Grim argues with the children, they crash into a fireworks tent having fire crackers in their clothes and mouths. They also end up having an oil truck tied to the broom. Later, Skarr even uses oil slick which merely causes the scythe to scrape the ground causing a fire starting in the oil and following the group. Skarr finally moves into the ocean by turning his car into a sub and happy that he cheated Death. Skarr notices a button and pushes it. He realizes that the button shot a laser through his stomach making the hole again (the first hole must’ve healed) The group discovers the oil truck behind them and the small fire coming. When the fire hit the oil truck, everything exploded in a result with addition to the fireworks. The angry group comes home to Billy’s house, burnt. Irwin comes in attempting to kiss Mandy but fails. Mandy slams the door on him and is surprised when Irwin is sitting on the couch eating popcorn. Suddenly, the Underworld police break in and send Grim to court. In court, Grim discovers that he’s charged for abusing his powers. The jury is split up in pairs and each pair sits atop a giant pillar. The jury includes Dracula, Frankenstein’s Bride, Fred Fredburger (famous from his role in Keeper of the Reaper), the blue vampire annoyed by Fred, a mud ghoul, and about two other citizens. The fly guard is also seen. Of course, Judge Roy Spleen is judge as he sits in the flaming mouth of a giant statue head. To everybody’s surprise, Boogeyman is the prosecutor. In the end, Fred Fredburger finds Grim and the gang innocent. But later, he realizes that he made a mistake and Grim is guilty. Boogeyman has the kids and Grim in custody and Numbuh 3 (guest starring as an evil being trying to reap parents from KND) who becomes the new reaper. Judge reveals that the girl is on a six week trial. Grim and the children are sent to Boogey’s pirate ship along with a few supernatural pirates and Boogeyman as captain with his friend, Creeper as first mate!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mandroid and Billybot go to Billy’s Dad’s/Harold’s house where they attempt to get information out of Harold. The androids find nothing and Billy gets damaged after drinking a cup of root beer and malfunctioning, making Billybot turning into a more realistic Billy. Boogey’s ship makes it way to the Lava Sea where Boogey plans to feed the children to Lava Sharks. Boogey reveals his plot to steal Horror’s Hand and use it to be scary again. Then he’ll scare Grim until he’s destroyed. But first, Boogeyman must conquer his worst fears to own the Hand. Boogeyman sends Billy first to walk the plank. Billy reveals that he’s not scared as long as the sharks don’t eat them and starts a song called; I’m Not Scaryed-O. Along with the song, Mandy and the rest of the captives make a run for it. Billy sings the song about how he’s not scared of earthquakes if the earth doesn’t shake and at the end of the song, he briefly sings about how he’s hungry. Irwin, Mandy, and Grim make a run on the getaway ship called, The Death Ship. Billy comes along and Mandy asks what he was doing, Billy responds saying that every animated movie needs a song. Mandy sees Boogey dancing and claims that, that’s something disturbing.</p>
<p>Boogeyman is first to go through the gate to Horror’s Hand and claims that Billy and Mandy must go through the Cyclops to go through the gate. The group decides to stop Boogey and claim Horror’s Hand. Mandy wants to rule the world with the hand, Billy wants to buy food, Irwin wants to marry Mandy with the hand, and Grim could reclaim his role as Grim Reaper and get his scythe back. The group meets a little blind Cyclops with no eye replacing it with an eye-patch. The little Cyclops sends his friend, a giant orange Cyclops to go test the children. Irwin thinks the test is a riddle and offers to step up. But the test is actually a taste test as the Big Cyclops puts the group in his mouth to see if he tastes good. The children have passed the test! The Cyclops puts the group into a soup to wait for them to cook. Mandy fakes the Cyclops into thinking Billy urinated in the soup. Billy reveals he actually did and the Big Cyclops throws the group out. Mandy jumps out and steals the bigger Cyclops’ eye. There is a fight and the eye ends up in Billy’s stomach. It turns out that the eye is used also for Boogeyman to see the group. Boogeyman turns his head into disgust as he looks where the eye goes. Creeper offers to build robot replicas of the children and shows Boogeyman the blue prints. Suddenly, Mandroid and Billybot teleport into the ship and Boogeyman is surprised of how fast Creeper worked. Mandroid offers to help Boogeyman destroy Mandy and Billy.</p>
<p>The group run away from the Cyclops Cove and discover a giant cake as they run near the getaway ship. Mandy is suspicious but a crazy Irwin and Billy stuff the cake into Mandy and Grim’s mouths. Suddenly, the rest of the group fall into a sleep and Mandy soon follows into the trance. Inside the cake, Mandroid comes of the cake’s hatch out and reveals that she plans on taking the brains of the group. Mandy! The groups are having a hive mind dream when Boogeyman come sin and kidnaps Mandy. Meanwhile, Mandy is drugged making her sleep until she’s totally weak. Boogeyman laughs as a mad Irwin storms in and beats up all the pirates. Grim tells Billy that love makes people do stupid things. Billy reveals that he loves everything and Grim says that, that explains a whole lot. Irwin kisses Mandy awake to Grim’s and Billy’s utter disgust. Mandy is grossed out. Mandroid comes in and threatens with a laser gun. Mandy is disgusted by how unrealistic Mandroid is and causes Mandroid to malfunction. Mandy takes the laser gun and shoots a stalactite down stopping the pirates from attacking and the group makes a run for it on the Death Ship and goes in the lead to Horror’s Hand’s Temple. Boogeyman sends the Kraken to go after the four. The group climbs up the long stairs of the temple and meet Horror and his cut left hand at the top of the temple. Horror is an alive statue. Horror reveals that he cut out his own left hand to put his fears inside the hand and became courageous. But new fears came so now, Horror just plays computer games on the computer. Boogeyman comes in and the Kraken engulfs Billy to everybody’s horror. Horror decides to hold a river race called the Cannibal Run and the winner will have to fight Horror and then receive the hand if the race winner beats Horror.</p>
<p>Boogeyman’s ship gets a sea monster ties to the ship for extra speed and Mandy, Grim and Irwin must race in a small boat without Billy. Mandy shows a sign of weakness before Billy resurfaces and reveals he breathed by using his own farts and also made friends with the Kraken. The race starts and the team become puppets, destroy a sea witch with laser guns, glue back the ship with snot, and even get attacked by Japanese monsters. After all that, Team Grim wins and easily defeat Horror with a single punch from Mandy. The group try to face their worse fears but Grim is the only one who conquers them as his nightmare has already happened, living with Billy and Mandy. But Boogeyman steals the Hand but is defeated by his worse fear. Discovering that he’s not funny and getting laughed by his own crew. Grim later reveals that he turned the Hand off and Boogeyman now is living his life in his fears. Forever. The police come in and Judge Roy Spleen banishes Mandy. But Mandy convinces or threatens the Judge so Roy Spleen decides to offer the job back to Grim with Numbuh 3, fired. (Judge is sad because Numbuh 3 was a better reaper) Grim is forced to put the Hand somewhere. Grim decides to put the Hand in his trunk. The team learns a valuable lesson when Fred Fredburger says that he wants nachos. Grim saved the world even without the scythe, Mandy is still mean and demanding even without the Hand, Irwin finally got to kiss Mandy, and Billy is getting a new bike for Christmas. To everybody’s surprise, future Billy teleports in the temple and reveals that Mandy is planning to rob the Hand, just as Mandy gets hypnotized by it and seeing future Billy, naked, makes her trance go away. Mandy merely shrugs and hands the hand back to Grim. The group returns home with future-Billy saying his farewells. Billy asks what he’s going to have for next Tuesday and future Billy says, “I could tell you but then I would need to kill you. The Future Billy explodes into the future and Mandy orders Grim to make dinner. Meanwhile, Billybot and now more realistic Mandroid order their own servant, Boogeyman’s friend, Creeper to serve his drinks.</p>
<p>The Hand's Master After the credits, future Billy goes back to his own time to discover that nothing has changed and someone has stole the hand out of Grim’s trunk. Lord Horror is Fred Fredburger!</p>
