<p>He was an OB/GYN and she was a partner at a law firm. They owned a Brownstone in an excellent area of Brooklyn. I think a good argument can be made that the Huxtables were upper-class. Why not just leave the family's social standing out? --Ted 21:49, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think their financial situation is relevent. Whereas I do agree that calling them middle-class puts into question "What defines it?" it was a very obtuse direction in comparison to previous Black family sitcoms such as <i>Sanford &amp; Son</i>, <i>Good Times</i>, &amp; even the <i>Jeffersons</i> (the Jeffersons were rich, not because of hard work but because they won the lottery). From <i>What's Happening</i> to <i>Different Strokes</i> there was never a sitcom based on Blacks that were more than poor through any effort on their part. --<a href="../../../d/u/e/User%7EDuemellon_5403.html" title="User:Duemellon">Duemellon</a> 22:01, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As I recall, the Jeffersons did win the lottery in an episode of "All In the Family," but George was depicted as having worked hard to build up his chain of dry-cleaning stores. He was portrayed as a racist, posturing blowhard, but never as lacking in ambition.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlaclaws_689d.html" title="User:Carlaclaws">Carlaclaws</a> 15:13, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Brooklyn?? I remember the Cosby's residence being in Philadelphia for the entire run of the series. Am I mistaken about this or is Ted in his above post? <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianMist_b1ca.html" title="User:CanadianMist">CanadianMist</a> 16:49, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>On the "Military Brats" Wikipedia page, Cosby is listed as a famous 'military brat' (child of a military family, which is not considered a derogatory term by most who grew up in military families) and more specifically, he is listed as a Navy brat. A military childhood has many significant challenges and strengths associated with it, and the military aspect of Cosby's own childhood should be included here in the "Early Life" section.</p>

<p>Can we get a link to the text of his speech to support "In the same speech he had scathing remarks for Christians and the police, as well as praise for the efforts of the Black Muslim organization and it's effectiveness, however, these statements were not reported in the articles in the mainstream media."</p>

<dd>The Gettosburg Address's full text is the link that needs to be moved to WikiSource has the full text for review (those statements appear at the middle and end of the speech).

<p>"There wasn't any proof that these last two alleged allegations took place and Cosby was acquitted." This is very poor. No details are offored of any trials, just that allegations were made.

<dd>The background section needs MAJOR work. It is completely unsourced and frequently POV. With the intense scrutiny Wikipedia receives regarding entries on real people, a section such as this would seem to fail to meet the necessary standards of Wiki for biographical entries. But for the loss of a great deal of information, I would be inclined to delete the entire section. Hopefully someone can find the time for the badly-needed rewrite. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESINsApple_0d69.html" title="User:SINsApple">SINsApple</a> 06:31, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure it is academically profitable for an article to indicate that Cosby had an "ugly" wife, nor to comment on her academic standing unless the author would like to cite a credible source for the proposition. Second,66.157.144.28 15:50, 28 December 2006 (UTC) I don't think it is necessary to repeat the stories of his possible indiscretions, once in the article is likely enough to bring it to the reader's attention.</p>

<p>I always heard that Bill Cosby did not accept awards, yet there are several instances here that mention him being honored with awards and also "accepting" awards. Is this hypnocrisy in later life or does Cosby only accept certain kinds of award (i.e. he won't accept an emmy but he will accept an humanitarian award)? In any event, should there be a paragraph on Cosby's history with accepting and not accepting awards?--<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_who1975_66e5.html" title="User:Dr who1975">Dr who1975</a> 01:44, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
