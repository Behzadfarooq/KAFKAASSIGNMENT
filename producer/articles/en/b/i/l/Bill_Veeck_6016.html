<p>According to Veeck's memoirs, in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, before entering the military, he acquired backing to purchase the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, planning to stock the club with stars from the <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negro_Leagues_54ee.html" title="Negro Leagues">Negro Leagues</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Veeck_6016.html" title="Edit section: Cleveland Indians">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cleveland Indians</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>, Veeck finally became the owner of a major league team, the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Indians_918e.html" title="Cleveland Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, using a debenture-common stock group making remuneration to his partners non-taxable loan payments instead of taxable income. He immediately put the team's games on radio, and set about to put his own indelible stamp on the franchise.</p>
<p>The following year, he signed <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Doby_4b43.html" title="Larry Doby">Larry Doby</a> as the first <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-American</a> player in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a>, then followed that one year later by inking <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satchel_Paige_2d9f.html" title="Satchel Paige">Satchel Paige</a> to a contract, making the hurler the oldest rookie in major league history; there was much speculation at the time about Paige's true age, with most sources stating that he was 42 when he joined the Indians.</p>
<p>When the Indians moved to cavernous <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Municipal_Stadium_ba67.html" title="Cleveland Municipal Stadium">Cleveland Municipal Stadium</a> for good in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, Veeck had a movable fence installed in the outfield that moved as much as 15 feet between series, depending on how the distance helped or hurt the Indians against a particular opponent. The <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a> soon passed a new rule fixing the outfield fences during any given season.</p>
<p>Although Veeck's image has long been considered fan-friendly, his actions during the early part of the 1947 season briefly gave a different view. When the city of <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland.html" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> began renting Cleveland Stadium for midget auto racing, an activity that often left the field in shambles, Veeck hinted that he might consider moving the team to the then-virgin territory of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. However, after the two sides discussed the issue, the matter was settled.</p>
<p>As in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee.html" title="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, Veeck took a whimsical approach to promotions, hiring rubber-faced <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Patkin_9578.html" title="Max Patkin">Max Patkin</a>, the "Clown Prince of Baseball" as a coach. Patkin's appearance in the coaching box delighted fans and infuriated the front office of the American League.</p>
<p>Although he had become extremely popular, an attempt to trade <a href="../../../l/o/u/Lou_Boudreau_445c.html" title="Lou Boudreau">Lou Boudreau</a> to the Browns led to mass protests and petitions supporting Boudreau. Veeck, in response, visited every bar in <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland%2C_Ohio_cd1a.html" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland</a> apologizing for his mistake, and reassuring fans that the trade would not occur. By <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_in_sports.html" title="1948 in sports">1948</a>, Cleveland won its first pennant and <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> since <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920_in_sports.html" title="1920 in sports">1920</a>. Famously, Veeck buried the 1948 flag, once it became obvious the team could not repeat its championship in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949_in_sports.html" title="1949 in sports">1949</a>. That year, Veeck sold his shares in Cleveland in order to finalize an expensive divorce with his first wife.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Veeck_6016.html" title="Edit section: St. Louis Browns">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">St. Louis Browns</span></h2>
<p>After marrying Mary Frances Ackerman, Veeck returned as the owner of the St. Louis Browns in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951_in_sports.html" title="1951 in sports">1951</a>. Hoping to force the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> out of town, Veeck spited Cardinals owner <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Saigh_0613.html" title="Fred Saigh">Fred Saigh</a>, hiring Cardinal greats <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogers_Hornsby_8f7a.html" title="Rogers Hornsby">Rogers Hornsby</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marty_Marion_141e.html" title="Marty Marion">Marty Marion</a> as managers, and <a href="../../../d/i/z/Dizzy_Dean_d3cf.html" title="Dizzy Dean">Dizzy Dean</a> as an announcer; and he decorated their shared home park, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sportsman%27s_Park_0d8e.html" title="Sportsman's Park">Sportsman's Park</a>, exclusively with Browns memorabilia. Although the Cardinals were easily the more successful team, it was the Browns, and thus whoever owned them, who owned the ballpark.</p>
<p>Some of Veeck's most memorable publicity stunts occurred during his tenure with the Browns, including the famous appearance by midget <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Gaedel_57e4.html" title="Eddie Gaedel">Eddie Gaedel</a> for which Veeck predicted he'd be most remembered; and shortly afterward, <i>Grandstand Manager's Day</i> - involving Veeck, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Connie_Mack_%28baseball%29_9d38.html" title="Connie Mack (baseball)">Connie Mack</a>, Bob Fishel, and thousands of regular fans, directing the entirety of the game via placards: the Browns won, 5-3, snapping a four-game losing streak.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952_in_sports.html" title="1952 in sports">1952</a> season, Veeck suggested that the American League clubs share radio and television revenue with visiting clubs. Outvoted, he refused to allow the Browns' opponents to broadcast games played against his team on the road. The league responded by eliminating Friday night games in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a>. When Saigh sold the Cardinals to <a href="../../../a/n/h/Anheuser-Busch_c875.html" title="Anheuser-Busch">Anheuser-Busch</a>, Veeck realized he would never have the resources to compete. He began to look for other cities for the Browns to play.</p>
<p>In the early 1950s, Veeck considered moving the Browns back to <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milwaukee.html" title="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a> (where they had played their inaugural season in 1901). He was denied permission by the other American League owners. He also wanted to move his club to the lucrative-yet-still untapped Los Angeles market, but was denied as well. Veeck was later forced to sell the Browns, who then moved to <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore%2C_Maryland_9c87.html" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore</a> and became the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Orioles_01d9.html" title="Baltimore Orioles">Orioles</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Veeck_6016.html" title="Edit section: Chicago White Sox">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chicago White Sox</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1959_in_baseball.html" title="1959 in baseball">1959</a>, Veeck became head of a group that purchased a controlling interest in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_White_Sox_cecb.html" title="Chicago White Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>, who went on to win their first pennant in 40 years, and broke a team attendance record for home games with 1.4 million. The next year, the team broke the same record with 1.6 million visitors to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comiskey_Park_3d00.html" title="Comiskey Park">Comiskey Park</a> with the addition of the first "exploding <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scoreboard.html" title="Scoreboard">scoreboard</a>" in the major leagues - producing electrical and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_effects.html" title="Sound effects">sound effects</a>, and shooting <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fireworks.html" title="Fireworks">fireworks</a> whenever the White Sox hit a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home run</a>, and also began adding player's surnames on the back of their uniform, a practice now standard by 25 of 30 clubs on all jerseys, and by three more clubs on road jerseys. (According to Lee Allen in <i>The American League Story</i> (1961), After the <a href="../../../y/a/n/Yankees.html" title="Yankees">Yankees</a> watched the exploding scoreboard a few times, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clete_Boyer_8ad6.html" title="Clete Boyer">Clete Boyer</a>, the weak-hitting third baseman, hit the ball over the outfield fence and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mickey_Mantle_2f71.html" title="Mickey Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a> and several other Yankee players came out of the dugout waving <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparkler.html" title="Sparkler">sparklers</a>. The point was not lost on Veeck.) In <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961_in_baseball.html" title="1961 in baseball">1961</a>, due to poor health, Veeck sold his share of the team, only to return in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975_in_baseball.html" title="1975 in baseball">1975</a> as the full owner, much to the chagrin of baseball's owner establishment, most of the old guard viewing him as a pariah after both exposing most of his peers in his 1961 book <i>Veeck As In Wreck</i> and for testifying against the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reserve_clause.html" title="Reserve clause">reserve clause</a> in the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Flood_c175.html" title="Curt Flood">Curt Flood</a> case.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after taking control of the Sox for a second time, Veeck unleashed another <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publicity_stunt.html" title="Publicity stunt">publicity stunt</a> designed to irritate his fellow owners. He and general manager Roland Hemond conducted four trades in a hotel lobby, in full view of the public. Two weeks later, however, <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seitz_decision.html" title="Seitz decision">Peter Seitz</a> ruled in favor of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_agency.html" title="Free agency">free agency</a>, and Veeck's power as an owner began to wane in opposition to richer owners. Ironically, Veeck had been the only baseball owner to testify in support of <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curt_Flood_c175.html" title="Curt Flood">Curt Flood</a> during his famous court case, where Flood had attempted to gain free agency after being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies.</p>
<p>Veeck presented a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Bicentennial_f401.html" title="United States Bicentennial">Bicentennial</a>-themed <i><a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_MacNeal_Willard_9a51.html" title="Archibald MacNeal Willard">Spirit of '76</a></i> parade on opening day in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1976_in_baseball.html" title="1976 in baseball">1976</a>, casting himself as the peg-legged fifer bringing up the rear. The same year, he reactivated <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnie_Mi%C3%B1oso_7f49.html" title="Minnie Miñoso">Minnie Miñoso</a> for eight at-bats, in order to give Miñoso a claim towards playing in four decades; he did so again in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_in_baseball.html" title="1980 in baseball">1980</a>, to expand the claim to five. In addition, he also had the team play in shorts for one contest.</p>
<p>In an attempt to adapt to free agency, he developed a <i>rent-a-player</i> model, centering on the acquisition of other clubs' stars in their option years. The gambit was moderately successful: in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977_in_baseball.html" title="1977 in baseball">1977</a>, the White Sox won 90 games, and finished third behind <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Gamble_a34c.html" title="Oscar Gamble">Oscar Gamble</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richie_Zisk_8c12.html" title="Richie Zisk">Richie Zisk</a>.</p>
<p>During this last run, Veeck decided to have announcer <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Caray_7812.html" title="Harry Caray">Harry Caray</a> sing "<a href="../../../t/a/k/Take_Me_Out_to_the_Ball_Game_a30a.html" title="Take Me Out to the Ball Game">Take Me Out to the Ball Game</a>" during the seventh-inning stretch. On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_12.html" title="July 12">July 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979.html" title="1979">1979</a>, Veeck, with an assist from son Mike and radio host <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Dahl_8f3c.html" title="Steve Dahl">Steve Dahl</a>, held one of his most infamous promotion nights, <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disco_Demolition_Night_a7ab.html" title="Disco Demolition Night">Disco Demolition Night</a>, which resulted in a riot at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comiskey_Park_3d00.html" title="Comiskey Park">Comiskey Park</a> and a forfeit to the visiting Tigers.</p>
<p>Finding himself no longer able to financially compete in the free agent era, Veeck sold the White Sox in January <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981_in_baseball.html" title="1981 in baseball">1981</a>. He retired to his home in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Michaels%2C_Maryland_ef95.html" title="St. Michaels, Maryland">St. Michaels, Maryland</a>, where he had earlier discovered White Sox star <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Baines_593b.html" title="Harold Baines">Harold Baines</a> while Baines was in high school there.</p>
<p>Veeck, weak from emphysema and having had a cancerous lung removed in 1984, died of a <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulmonary_embolism.html" title="Pulmonary embolism">pulmonary embolism</a> at age 71. His health had begun to fail after decades of smoking 3-4 packs of cigarettes a day. He was elected five years later to the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_4e80.html" title="Baseball Hall of Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
