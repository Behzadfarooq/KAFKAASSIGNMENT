<p>Kal Korff's book Spaceships of the Pleiades is coming out in an all new series. Contrary to what Meier believers claim, Korff's expose of Meier has largely held up. In the new versions, people will be empowered to fake their own "UFO" photos just like Billy Meier.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>If anyone here has actually gone through the material carefully, it become shockingly apparent that meier is just a deluded old man. All his contact notes are full of self aggrandising nonsense about overpopulation etc. in fact contact 264, which deals with the topic that Maury referred to, of the two pictures of aliens, meier tries to explain it away saying that he had amnesia at the time the photos were taken, and that the "Men in black" faked them. This article should definately be more balanced, and mention specifically that the photos were infact just a couple of obscure models that meier thought nobody would recognise. [BeliefInSkeptic]</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
This article seems shockingly uncritical. I think it should at least mention the fact that the UFO that appears in many of his pictures was found to be a model stored in his garage. Moreover many of the photos show obvious signs of double-exposure and other simplistic tricks. In one case a photograph he claimed was of an alien appears to be a picture of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dean_Martin_1f3d.html" title="Dean Martin">Dean Martin</a> snapped from a television.</p>
<p>To anyone <b>not</b> seeking enlightenment from alients, Meier is simply a guy who's little fun hoax got out of control until everyone interested, himself included, believed it. It also attracted the attention of the "professional" myth busters, who's attention he did not find so fun.</p>
<p>There are others that are not so kind. Meier's wife described the "foundation" as a cult, or at least a swindling excersize.</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Excuse me? The photos were a mixture of snapshots of members of the Golddiggers, a singing group that worked with Dean Martin, and not of Dean Martin himself. Many of the photos have been altered by others and presented as being Meier's when they are not, etc., and this has been documented. Did you just skim over an article by Kal Korff about this issue and then regurgitate his information as fact, or what? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_A.J.%D7%99.B._30fb.html" title="User:Matthew A.J.י.B.">Matthew A.J.י.B.</a> 22:03, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Criticism is good, but before you assert such claims as fact, you might want to document your sources. The Meier photos have held up extremely well under critical scrutiny against all kinds of tests. Besides light table examinations, they include background and foreground reference objects, reflections, etc., the motion video is supposed to be excellent -- and all this decades before photoshop and computer generation, and that's before mentioning the other evidence, from then-unfakeable audio to metal samples, as I recall. The chief criticism I've seen is in regard to ones he claims were taken in space rather than ground-based, which Moorsbrugger (sp?) discusses in his book, and an ex-wife you'd have to admit also presents some partiality issues. But ufo's are real, as I know first-hand, and the evidence favors the guy. Check out Michael Horn on this subject, the first link in the list, he's got some very good exchanges with skeptics. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Rodgers_82ba.html" title="User:Chris Rodgers">Chris Rodgers</a> 07:18, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Actually, from what I've heard, the models were brought to Billy's house for photos to be taken and compared to his photos. His wife, including some others that claimed to have seen the aliens with Meier, took a lie detector test and passed saying that they saw aliens. His wife and him got devorced so whatever she has to say could be a lie because they may not get along anymore. You have to judge the case on facts, not just opinions and theories. If you did that with everything, you wouldn't get very far when trying to build things for example. I also heard that some myth busters or whoever tried to duplicate one of his photos but couldn't. They have been put under intense scrutiny and nothing has been proving otherwise from what he has stated. I'm not saying that he's telling the truth. I'm just saying that the case really needs to be looked at inside and out so it can be over with. There still isn't a definitive answer of if he is sencere. But more evidence falls in his favor. Oh, and if it is a hoax, it is more than a little hoax. He should be thrown in jail if it is. He's claims to have had contact since 1942 I think. That's a long time to hold on to some hoax. And his life has been threatened over 20 times. I wouldn't go out of my way to pull a hoax if I might get killed and not even get rich from my hoax.</p>
<p>Roland Reid. Email me if you have more to talk about the case. Roland_Reid23@yahoo.com</p>
<hr />
<p>I can sympathize.</p>
<p>I added some interesting stuff about the name "Semjaze". I think it would be interesting (and a bit chilling) to consider (Aaron Donahue has nothing on this guy!). Also consider some of the predictions made by Meier (supposedly most of them came true).</p>

<p>This page is embarrassingly credulous, with every other word a link to some page on FIGU, the organization founded by Meier. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 21:26, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Phiwum has a point in that "every other word a link to some page on FIGU", however if one goes through the links on the page you will find that there are links to opposing viewpoints and criticisms, including a link to the "table top model", the book from which the "dinosaur photo" was copied, the Dean Martin show actresses, etc., etc. The external links are provided to enhance the information presented in this encyclopedic entry. The breadth of this case is such that to get a grasp on it either pro or con requires a vast amount of study and thought. The Kal Korff book which is the source of much debunking of this case has itself been thoroughly debunked as shoddy "investigative research". This case is the single most controversial case in Ufology, and with good reason. For an extensive bibliography of this case, both pro and con, see <a href="http://www25.brinkster.com/chancede/Meier.html" class="external free" title="http://www25.brinkster.com/chancede/Meier.html" rel="nofollow">http://www25.brinkster.com/chancede/Meier.html</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no particular balance to the article at all. I am not very interested in Meier, frankly, and won't rewrite the whole thing myself, but it needs improvement. As an example of less credulous presentation, I have rewritten:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Meier's unique photography, he maintains, resulted easily from the fact that he was (and currently is) in direct face-to-face contact with the humanoid extraterrestrials who fly the crafts (called beamships). He was given permission by the extraterrestrials (called Plejarens) to photograph and film their beamships during aerial maneuvers in order to produce the best evidence for extraterrestrial visitation of Earth, and thereby to create a controversy to stimulate thinking about the matter and its impact on humanity.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now it reads</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Meier has created a large collection of controversial photographs. He claims that these photos show spaceships (called beamships} as well as extraterrestrials (call Plejarens). Meier says that the Plejerans have given him permission to photograph and film their beamships in order to produce the best evidence for extraterrestrial visitation of Earth. This should stimulate thinking about the matter and its impact on humanity. These claims are disputed by both UFO skeptics<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_n2_v20/ai_18158449" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_n2_v20/ai_18158449" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and some UFO believers<a href="http://70.86.59.150/forum/thread53600/pg1" class="external autonumber" title="http://70.86.59.150/forum/thread53600/pg1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, who argue that the photographs could easily be faked<a href="http://www.iigwest.com/ufopix.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iigwest.com/ufopix.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and are unpersuasive.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My writing can certainly be improved, but it's a start. Personally, I find the whole premise very odd. How on earth would questionable photos provide "the best evidence"? If the Plejarens want to provide undeniable evidence, then a four hour tour of New York City would probably do the trick better. But I don't think my criticism belongs in the article, so I'll just mention it here instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that the previous paragraph took Meier's word at face value, without any mention that the photographs are controversial. Of course, there is indeed some discussion of the controversy below (in need of formatting), but this discussion has no references to skeptical articles.<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 09:19, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The more I look at Meier, the more ludicrous that this page doesn't mention the Korff book. I don't really care what you think of it. It is clearly an influential criticism of Meier and it should be mentioned on this page. The fact that Korff isn't mentioned <i>anywhere</i> is a perfectly good indication of bias. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 09:32, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just couldn't let it rest now. You people just had to parrot Meier's unsubstantiated propaganda, including "pointing out the frauds". Still on that quest for authority. Seeing this highly subjective article which of course omits a few negative details such as Meier's imprisonment and his desertion from the French Foreign Legion (left it?), I can only hope the moderators of Wikipedia act swiftly in restricting this biased article which is entirely based on the claims of one questionable individual.

<dd>Agreed, but why should someone like yourself choose to venture into such a controversy such as the Billy Meier case?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>Because the article sets a very bad example for Wikipedia. I like Wikipedia and I would prefer that the articles found here meet a certain standard for unbiased presentation.

<p>Thanks for your efforts, but in case you haven't noticed Jesse, myself and a number of others would like to know why you keep edditing this page with a few added errors which you may or may not have previously taken notice.

<dd>No sir, but thanks for your invitation. This is a Wikipedia page, and not a page for your advocacy group. The discussions should stay here. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 20:59, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, You're right, it is a Wikipedia page, but be advised that it's not just you're page either. In fact, Billy Meier and his group at FIGU can in-force the legal rights to have this page removed should they request it and since the page's topic is specifically focused on them and their controversy and not you.</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I failed to answer your other questions. There's no reason to take this to email. We can just as well work it out on this talk page. Let's do that.

<dd>OK now that we know you're not TerraX, then OK let's work this out. My changes were actually some improvements on what was already written here, from you and from some other Meier supporters whom, I'm familiar with. While I found some other stuff written out by some other people which I was also attempting to work on for awhile, it was not long before I found your deletions. So let's start from the begginng. Finnish up all your editing the way it is, then when your done I'll make any corrections I may find and if you disapprove then we'll both discuss it along with further ideas for some improvements which can possibly be made. After we have "nutral page", then we can expand out on both sides, whether that be from the skeptics point of veiw or from Billy's, Michael Horn's, FIGU's and so on...

<dd>I don't intend to re-write the page much. I really am not very interested in Meier, but this page needs attention from a neutral and knowledgeable party. (I may be neutral but I don't know much about Meier and I don't intend to spend much time studying him and his critics.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Among things that obviously need attention: the formatting of the criticism section doesn't fit the Wikipedia standard. More importantly, it is biased towards showing that Meier is reputable, by pointing out that he calls other contactees frauds. Of course, this is utterly irrelevant to criticisms against Meier. Finally, regardless of <i>your</i> opinion of the scholarship found in Korff's book, there should be a balanced discussion of the book on this page. The book is influential and to fail to mention it is inexcusable.</dd>

<dd>These are a few of the things I've noticed. I may make changes later, but I don't have a grand scheme for what I'll do, so there's not much reason to proceed in the way you suggest. By all means, edit the page in ways you believe are NPOV improvements and we can discuss the results. This is much preferable to a useless revert war. If you want to know why I made the changes I did, I'd be happy to explain — including my removal of the two recent paragraphs.

<p>OK I think we are getting somewhere, good. I hope you don't mind me saying, but for someone who may not know to much about Meier as yourself, I'm surprised that you got this far as you did with this article. As for the 2 deleted articles which I had not decided what to do with myself before you deleted them, that was actually written by a guy in Brazil in which case after editing it, a POV reference could be attributed to him in a separate subtopic in his expressed disapproval to whom he was directing it, etc. And not just for him, but others also. BTW: Billy Meier does not call other contactees frauds, I also have a list of people somewhere of what he calls "Real UFO contactees and UFO experiences" such as; Dan Fry, Kenneth Arnold, Wilbur Smith, along with a host of others. Unfortunately much of the details from Meier regarding who he said was real and who isn't, was deleted by UFO investigator Wendelle Stevens in his book report publications. This in particularly led to further unnecessary conclusions about Meier from people. In one or two cases that I know of, Meier and his Plejarens have made errors regarding this which they have already admitted to.</p>
<p>As far as giving comments to Korff's book, I have no problem with that even-though "in my opinion" there are more skillful skeptics then say Korff, But that too can also be referenced and added into a POV subtopic to this one. (J-Truthseeker March 27 2006)</p>

<p>I figured I would mention this here first. Would there be any objection to deleting the tiny Talmud Jmmanuel and Billy Meier categories? There is a grand total of 4 articles among both... and two of them are the namesake articles.</p>
<p>Now, small categories are fine (See Category:Historical Christian denominations for an example; I've added 3 of those personally, but clearly it could be much larger)... so long as they have potential for expansion later and are sufficiently general. Are there going to be vast piles of articles on Talmud Jimannuel? I somewhat doubt it. Everything of importance you'd want to know is linked from the Billy Meier and Talmud Jmmanuel pages.
