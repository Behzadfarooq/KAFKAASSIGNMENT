<dd>"No religion objects no sex at ovulation. Whats special is that one of few permitted methods by observant catholics. NB fails meet all limitations for observant Orthodox Jews (seeNiddah))"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Most Billings users live in countries where Catholicism is not a major religion. The experience of Billings International is that most religions do not have moral objections to the BOM, and that it is acceptable to most women. From my reading of the Niddah article, it appears that the Billings could be used within that context, as Billings merely provides information about fertility, and does not 'tell' people when to have relations. Wanfactor 20:47, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Fair enough - the issue for observant Orthodox Jews is that there is a prohibition of having sex within a set time from teh end of a period - so the week of the period &amp; week after (ie the early part of the contraceptively "safe window") is prohibited, the week around ovulation needs be avoided, which leaves very little window for full intimancy if pregnancy is to be avoided (PS condoms generally prohibited). So whilst <i>"Billings could be used within that context"</i>, it is only small part of approach taken. Furthermore I have never heard Billings mentioned in Orthdox Jewish "lifestyle" - the term seems applied only by Catholic Christians (its not a requirement of UK Church of England Prostastant values). Whilst, I guess, similar safe-window calculation is probably also applied by strict Muslims, again is it specificaaly and precisely the "Billings Method" the method or the term that they would use/recognise&#160;? Fertility awareness approaches are taken by these groups - I just don't see them using/recognising this specific named ("Billings") method, especially as their carefully regulated/codefied practices far pre-date Mr Billings. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 00:13, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem with Niddah is that on mikveh night (when the woman's period of ritual impurity ends and she immerses in a mikveh - special bath) there is a mitzvah (not exactly a commandment, but strongly recommended) of having sex. And mikveh night is almost always going to fall during the fertile period, creating somewhat of a problem if a couple wanted to use any of the fertility awareness/NFP methods (including Billings) as their sole method of avoiding pregnancy. This issue is discussed <a href="http://www.yoatzot.org/article.php?id=108" class="external text" title="http://www.yoatzot.org/article.php?id=108" rel="nofollow">here</a> (near the bottom of the page) and I've seen another article (can't find it now) that suggested delaying the bedikot (cloth inserted into the vagina to help determine the end of ritual impurity) to attempt to put mitzvah night in the post-ovulatory infertile period; but implied that while that would be technically acceptable, it would be somewhat frowned on. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> 14:45, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The article you point to appears to endorse the use of natural family planning.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I doubt you would find most of the methods of family planning "recognized" by religions, though some religions may ban some methods. I do not consider it a defining characteristic of Billings that Catholicism endorses it (though does not require the use of it, you will not find a specific method referred to Church Teachings); rather, that is a defining characteristic of Catholicism. Unlike the other methods of natural family planning, Billings is used primarily in underdeveloped nations, to populations that are not predominately Catholic. The overall experience of teachers is that religious beliefs do not form a barrier to use of the method. "Most religions" does not imply "all religions", for example certain Catholics believe that even learning about fertility is immoral, and/or that the use of even natural family planning is sinful.Wanfactor 15:57, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do see your point on the users of Billings, but the headquarters organization is strongly Catholic, and the motivation for the development of the method was driven by Catholic doctrine. On the infobox - "most religions do not have moral objections" to <b>any</b> method of birth control, including the pill and condoms. I don't see how that is special to Billings, either. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> 17:42, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Interestingly enough, only 2 of the 4 people who started and have done the most work on Billings are Catholic. It was also my impression from what I have read on the introduction of birth control in underdeveloped nations that artificial methods (pill, condom) are often not well accepted by the people there (who are not necessarily Catholic) but Billings does not run into the same problems. Perhaps "Usable throughout a woman's entire life, in all economic circumstances" would be more Billings specific. Wanfactor 19:29, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Are there contraceptives that can't be used at certain times in a woman's (reproductive) life? I suppose combined hormonal methods during breastfeeding, but nothing else comes to mind. As far as economic circumstances, I think I've read about the Two-Day Method and the Standard Days Method are being pushed for underdeveloped countries. Their teaching requirements are less than for Billings and Creighton (so less travel for students, and less money spent on facilities, teacher training, teacher pay, ongoing supplies such as charts and stamps, etc.) However, Wanfactor is right that such low-cost (especially over longer time periods) pregnancy avoidance methods are rare. Especially since it's not in the text anywhere, I'd support putting low-cost in the infobox. Then we could just avoid the religion issue altogether. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> 22:36, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that we could drop the religion issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Billings is not unique in that it is low cost, but that it is both low-cost and universally usable. Standard Days is a variation of rhythm that works only during regular cycles, two-day method is much less effective than Billings, and also cannot be used at times of continual discharge (as far as I can tell). Most contraceptives are not usuable at all times. For example the Pill is not recommended for women with high blood pressure, the cervical cap is much less effective after a woman has had a vaginal delivery, condoms are not always available and typically cost money, IUDs cost money and should be inserted by medical personnel. If women plan to use hormonal forms of contraception, they should have access to a doctor to monitor their health and protect them from side effects. As far as paying for things, charting methods for Billings will reflect the literacy level and economic circumstances of the users. It is not necessary to purchase supplies, and the cost of training teachers is limited to the immediate costs of accomodation, travel, etc. As far as I can tell, the Billings method in unique in that it is suitable for essentially all women at all times during their lives, regardless of their personal health, access to medical services, literacy level, economic status, or what stage of their reproductive life they are in.

<p>I spoke to Dr. Billings a number of years ago, I think it was in the 90's. He said that he got the idea for his method in 1950 and started research in 1951. I spoke to him at a pro-life meeting in the San Jose area. It was close to the Great America theme park. He had just finished a talk in one of the lecture rooms of the fancy hotel where the conference was being conducted.</p>

<p>I've seen references online that the book by Evelyn Billings says that three African tribes and one Austrailian Aborigines tribe was discovered to have known the fertility significance of cervical mucus. This seems of historical interest, but I don't have the book and the online references are pretty disjointed, so I would be hesitant to write anything based off of them. I thought I'd put the suggestion here in case anyone has the book. <a href="../../../l/y/r/User%7ELyrl_6da9.html" title="User:Lyrl">Lyrl</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/y/r/User_talk%7ELyrl_8f39.html" title="User talk:Lyrl">Talk</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lyrl_0a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lyrl">Contribs</a></sub> 21:29, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In accordance with WOOMB preference, I have changed the description from Natural Family Planning to Natural Fertility Regulation. This is beneficial for a couple of reasons 1) Not all BOM users are using this information to 'plan a family' and 2) the wikipedia entry on Natural Family Planning is not descriptive or relevant to the Billings Ovulation Method. I have also removed the paragraph on Natural Family Planning for the same reason.</p>
