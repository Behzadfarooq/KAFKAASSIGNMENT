<li>Cowan graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1966...(Yes, he did)</li>
<li>He would later join the elite Delta Force and assist in the rescue of some American citizens who were taken as hostages by Iran in 1979. (No, he didn't and he has NEVER so claimed. Whoever wrote that is wrong.)</li>
<li>He is also the founding member of an organization that, according to a Discovery Channel documentary, is so secretive that not even the United States government knows its mailing address, and that operates like a real-life Mission Impossible organization. (Some peripheral truth to this.)</li>

Was Bill Cowan ever in Guwahati, Assam, India, involved in the evacuatin of Bangladeshi refugees after the war of Bangladesh?--203.197.115.68 17:47, 24 July 2006 (UTC)Manu Kashyap</p>
<p>Bill served in Marine Recon Battalions during the Vietman War.</p>
<p>The Book "Bravo 6" by a Rifle Company commander has a "Bill Cowan" as aplatoon leader for awhile. Is this the same guy?--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurpleslog_79ef.html" title="User:Purpleslog">Purpleslog</a> 22:47, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is this the same guy:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.specwarnet.net/americas/isa.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.specwarnet.net/americas/isa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.specwarnet.net/americas/isa.htm</a> --&gt;</p>
<p>"In 1983, a five-man ISA unit led by Lt. Col. William Cowan was dispatched to Beirut, Lebanon to deal with the increasing threat to American interests in the area. Cowan and another ISA agent managed to drive through every sector of Beirut, even the Shiite suburb, a dangerous practice at the time. They acquainted themselves with the layout and landmarks of the city for future reference. ISA members conducted extensive interviews with Special Forces members in the country, Lebanese Army and CIA and embassy officials. They discovered there was no co-ordination between them, and vital information regarding terrorist attacks was not being shared. The team put together a detailed critique and proposed changes to the organization of the forces, but the document was ignored by the higher officials insisting that security was adequate. On October 23, 1983, a truck bomb slammed into the US Marine barracks in Beirut, killing 241 Americans, and injuring scores more. Almost simultaneously, another truck bomb exploded in the French barracks, killing 56. The decision was made to deploy another ISA unit.</p>
<p>Cowan put together another five-man team, but their deployment was stalled for three weeks. This time around, travel through the city was a very dangerous endeavour, with roadblocks everywhere. Along with reviewing the security and organization again, ISA was also tasked with formulating plans for reprisals against the Syrians who had shot down two US fighters. The agents prepared contingency plans for a commando force to enter Beirut clandestinely, and to strike at Hizbollah and Syrian targets. Cowan traveled the Lebanese countryside pinpointing the locations of Syrian anti-aircraft emplacements. While driving through northern Lebanon, Cowan and his mates suffered several close calls with Syrian roadblocks and patrols. Landing zones were established, Lebanese militias contacted for help, and plans formulated for a commando force. ISA agents even managed to obtain Lebanese license plates, which would allow Delta to be parachuted in with their own cars, then "legitimized" with the plates. The ISA team left Beirut in January 1984. Sadly, the team's evaluation did not serve to upgrade American security standards, and a truck bomb exploded from within 40 feet of the embassy entrance later that year."</p>
<p>If so the Secret Group was the Intelligence Support Activity. It (under whatever cover name it goes by now) is part of Special Operations Command.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurpleslog_79ef.html" title="User:Purpleslog">Purpleslog</a> 22:04, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A recent book about the ISA is Killer Elite, by reporter Michael Smith. It confirms the main facts quoted by Steven Emerson (and repeated by the specwarnet.net page). There are some errors often quoted after Emerson and Jeffrey Richelson's writtings about the ISA&#160;: Cowan was NOT the leader of the teams send to Lebanon, only a member (the leader for both teams was Calvin "Cal" Sasai, the then deputy commander of the ISA), and Cowan is not the only Marine to have joined the ISA because there was a previous USMC representative in the ISA. He was not a "ISA member" when he joined the first team, he would only accept to join the ISA after having seen the high-level of operators in the first mission in Lebanon. He would later pass ISA selection and training courses, take part to the second team send in Lebanon and in ISA's efforts to save US hostages in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Killer Elite doesn't quote Cowan's full name, but it states that "the" Bill Cowan of the ISA enlisted in the Navy at age of 17, was appointed at the Naval Academy, he became USMC officer in 1966. Two stints in Vietnam, during about 3 years and a half, including five months with the vietnamese "Kit Carsons". Recon Btn. are not quoted in the book, but obviously Cowan operated in little units for special operations&#160;; because Cowan's unit is not depicted, it might be a Recon Btn. His background in intelligence and special ops in Vietnam was one reason he was chosen by the ISA as a potantial recruit. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob1bureau_a856.html" title="User:Rob1bureau">Rob1bureau</a> 13:03, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
