	    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>It seems we might have gotten off a bad start. Like I said, Wikipedia is built on compromise, and I believe the compromise I offered in <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics_of_fascism.html" title="Economics of fascism">economics of fascism</a> was more than reasonable. None of your citations were removed. We can either talk about it and reach a decision that we are both satisfied with, or we can keep reverting forever. It's your call... <a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuadh_22e1.html" title="User:Ruadh">Ruadh</a> 15:14, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You should notice that the only thing I removed was your Hitler quote, and the only reason for that was because it could easily be misunderstood when read out of context. Hitler also made numerous statements in support of private property and private enterprise, especially farmers and small businesses. As you point out on your user page, he advocated a "third way" approach. The quote may give the wrong impression that he sided with state socialism, or Marxism, or something like communism, when in fact he was strongly opposed to all those things (and any equality-based ideology in general). <a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuadh_22e1.html" title="User:Ruadh">Ruadh</a> 15:26, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's not all you removed. You removed the demands on the NAZI program as well. I disagree that the Hitler quote can be misunderstood out of context. He advocated a socialist system where the state directs private enterprise to work for the good of the people instead of being selfish. Laissez-faire capitalism was the enemy and was strangling the population. State control over the means of production is socialism. If anything could be taken out of context it's the Mussolini quote saying that there would be a laissez-faire system. It was not a laissez-faire system except in the begining because Mussolini had to compromise to gain more power. Once he gained more power, he did the right thing and took control over the economy.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Very well then, I will look for other Hitler quotes that we could add in order to clarify his position. "Socialism" is a buzzword that has been used by everyone to mean anything. I'd much rather give a slightly longer but more accurate description, such as "Hitler advocated a private enterprise economy directed by the state to serve the national interest". Remember also that, although Hitler did have economic views, he did not consider them particularly important. Same goes for Mussolini. They were willing to accept any economic arrangement that promoted the good of the nation, as they saw it.</p>
<p>Also, please stop thinking that you could somehow make me go away just be reverting the page over and over again. I am not going away, and I think the compromise I offered is more than reasonable. I'm afraid you will just have to learn to work together with me. <a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuadh_22e1.html" title="User:Ruadh">Ruadh</a> 08:41, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is very relavant that that quote by in the article. Hitler was anti-laissez-faire. It was a socialist economy. I understand that socialism is a somewhat vague term but that doesn't matter. It was called "national socialism" afterall. The means of production were controlled by the people with the Fuhrer as their representative. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 04:12, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ok, fine. I've decided to adopt your policy that nothing should be removed from the article if it has a citation. I have shortened the quote a bit, however, because I believe long quotes disrupt the flow of an article. I also found a quote of my own which I believe clarifies Hitler's views:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"I absolutely insist on protecting private property. It is natural and salutary that the individual should be inspired by the wish to devote a part of his income from his work to building up and expanding a family estate. Suppose the estate consists of a factory. I regard it as axiomatic that this factory will be better run by one of the members of the family than it would be by a State functionary... In this sense, we must encourage private initiative."</i><sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Notice that I only added a shortened version of this quote into the article. That seemed like the fair thing to do, since I also shortened your quote. I think putting two long quotes side by side would be ugly. <a href="../../../r/u/a/User%7ERuadh_22e1.html" title="User:Ruadh">Ruadh</a> 10:58, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It shouldn't be shortened. It's an informative quote that needs a full statement. You're also deleting other things that are sourced like that both national socialism and italian fascism are essentially opposed to laissez-faire. The source says that is an essential to them. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 20:15, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again you deleted it without giving me a change to vote or respond. And what are you talking about "material"? It's not the posting of "material." It is the creation of a category.

<dd>Quit recreating the category, I have speedy deleted it again. I have explained why it meets the speedy deletion criteria on the deletion review.

<dd>So you don't even let others review that hangon notice? You're the dictator of Wikipedia?

<dd>What's the harm of recreating it before the review is over? Look. The review is whether to overturn the deletion. To overturn the deletion is going to require a consensus right?

<dd>NO the speedy delete does not follow from that. It is permissible to recreated articles or categories with the same title as long as the contents are not identical.

<dd>Think of the insanity of what you're saying. You're saying that a category can forever be summarily deleted from Wikipedia simply because it was deleted once in the past. If that's not true for article names then why would it be true for category names? The contents of the "Category:Fascist Wikipedians" article are NOT identical at all from the first time it was deleted. The contents of that article now is my username. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 21:51, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with tjstrf. The speedy deletion was clearly in line with policy; I do think that the policy has, in this case, allowed for an injustice to occur, and is imperfect in that regard. But a category with an additional user is indeed "substantially identical" to its the category without that user. If the original deletion had cited a total absence of members in the category, that would be different. -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 20:15, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Billy, I happened upon this discussion, and would like to weigh in. I will summarize my two points here, but maybe you can direct me to a better place - it seems this discussion is occurring on multiple pages. (1) To the degree that I understand your political views, I disagree with them. (2) I think you are correct that Wikipedia policy has been unfairly applied in your case.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't understand why there should be Wikipedia USER categories at all, and I don't know what the policy regarding that is. In short, believe those interfering with your attempts to create the category certainly owe you a better explanation than I've seen them give, and may need to follow a better process, and possibly are simply wrong in what they're trying to do. -<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteforsyth_da42.html" title="User:Peteforsyth">Pete</a> 22:30, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK. Enough is enough. If you two wish to bicker on either of your talk pages, that's one thing. But you also now have arguments going on at WP:RCU and WP:AN/I. Enough. You have both made yourselves quite clear. I'm giving this as a warning to both of you. Back off from the arguing on WP:RCU and WP:AN/I. You've both made yourselves clear. Continuing to fill those pages with your arguments is serving neither of you much good. If the arguments on those two pages continue, you will both soon find yourselves with 24 hour enforced cooling off periods. So please, stop it now. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 18:55, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, a clerk just dealt with that issue well enough at the WP:RCU subpage. He moved the argument to the talk page of the RCU, and asked that it be continued there, not on the main page. Which makes perfect sense. As for more evidence, I'm really not sure what the point of more evidence is at this point. You've made your request. It's now a question of whether the request will be accepted or not. If this goes further, to a RFC or mediation, or such, then it'll be evidence time.</dd>
<dd>And As I said on Nikodemos' talk, this is not about silencing you two, or preventing you from communicating (on each other's talk pages). It's about you both getting more and more worked up, arguing on pages that are not appropriate places for arguments.</dd>
<dd>So, in the end, I'm in no way banning you from either WP:RCU or WP:AN/I. If you feel you need to post more evidence at the checkuser page, do so. But please. If you find yourself debating the evidence with him, take it to the talk page there as soon as possible to avoid cluttering up the RCU page with stuff that really does not belong there. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasAndroid_b0eb.html" title="User:TexasAndroid">TexasAndroid</a> 20:07, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good. First, though, I want to see if we can agree to a principle that I call "quote balance". Basically, it goes like this: When there is a controversy supported by quotes, the two sides should agree to limit themselves to an equal number of quotes. In other words, in our case, we should agree on the number of Hitler quotes on the topic of socialism vs. capitalism that we can add to the article, and split them in half. You get half, I get half. It will not do me any good if you have 10 Hitler quotes supporting your view and I have 12 (and likewise it will not do you any good if you have 12 and I have 10). It will only clutter the page. I want to avoid the situation where you add a quote, then I add a counter-quote, then you add a third quote in response and so on until the whole article is just quotes. We will only ever reach agreement if we are satisfied with a balanced article. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 02:27, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't agree with agreeing to a "number" of quotes. It should be whatever it takes to make whatever needs to be clear, to be clear. I think you want to add Hitler quotes saying that he supported private property, am I right? If you do that then I have to add quotes showing that this property was still to be controlled for social benefit. Just because people are allowed to have private property it doesn't mean that it is a capitalist system. If the state controls the use of that property for social good then it's not capitalism. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 02:32, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The complaint is that sockpuppets are being used to create the illusion that more than one person supports a particular version articles by reverting to that particular version with the Nikodemos account, the Ruadh account, and the 66.9.*.* account. That's a violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>. It makes it look like more than one person is supporting that version of the article. It doesn't matter on what the timing is. Some of them are on the SAME DAY. It says in the section "Voting and other shows of support" that "In addition to double-voting, sock puppets should not be used for the purpose of deception, distraction, or to create the illusion of broader support for a position than actually exists." What are you telling me to "cease and desist" doing? <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 19:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your pattern of edits suggests otherwise.</dd>
<dd>In response to the claims you made on ANI and the Checkuser case - you misunderstand the sockpuppet policy. There is nothing in the policy or precedents or expected WP account usage which forbids someone from using multiple accounts, as long as the combined accounts don't vote more than once on a vote, commit more than 3 reversions on an article to a preferred version within 24 hrs, or act in concert to try to affect a consensus. "in concert" means "at the same time". These are accounts where there's no chronological overlap.</dd>

<dd>Yes there is a violation. The policy against using sockpuppets to create the illusion of broaders support is not confined to voting issues. Notice that the section in <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> is entitled "Voting AND OTHER SHOWS OF SUPPORT." In that section it says: "In addition to double-voting, sock puppets should not be used for the purpose of deception, distraction, or to create the illusion of broader support for a position than actually exists." Nikodemoes created the Ruadh sockpuppet to make changes and revert back to those changes when I made an edit. He was also doing the same reversions as the Ruadh sockpuppet with his Nikodemos username (and also with the 69.6.*.* IP). This was using sockpuppets for the purpose of creating the illusion that there was broader support for that version of the article than actually existed. It wasn't multiple people that kept reverting the article. It was one person, Nikodemos. In reality there was no broader support for that version of the article than just him. Anyone who didn't know that he was using sockpuppets would think there was 3 people supporting the reversion. It made it look like I was going against a consensus, but I wasn't. I was only going against him. Understand? <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 02:30, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can tell you that I had no knowledge of your identity as fascist, and I had never editted those articles before today (that I can seriously remember) so "preferred versions" are out of the question. I was merely viewing revert warring between you and others, and especially after you had been blocked for 8 hours today for violating 3RR.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 04:10, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Guy, I had already been punished for violating 3RR which was my first violation ever. I have not violated it since and was not "edit warring." What makes you think you can re-punish me for violating 3RR? I feel like any more edits or reversions that I do again you are going to block me for a longer period of time, just like you said, because you will consider it "edit warring." It is my understanding that reversions, changing wording, adding sources, etc is allowed. How are you defining "edit warring." And why are you punishing me again for violating 3RR when I had already been blocked for that? And why were others doing the same general kind of editing as I have since then were not blocked by you? Is it that you had a prejudice because you had seen that I had recently been punished for violating 3RR? Doesn't my slate start clean after I've been punished? Do I now have less of a right to edit than others and have special restrictions? And how can you legally revert my changes if they weren't a violation of the 3RR? None of this make sense. I apologize for blowing up a little earlier because there may be no malice on your part but I can't help thinking that you are in the wrong here. I can't imagine that Wikipedia's justice system would allow this. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 04:15, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are not being penalized for your political views, unorthodox though they may be. The problem is, you were already blocked for violating the 3RR. What that does <b>not</b> mean is "Make sure you carefully stay to three reverts a day from now on." It means you need to find a different way to resolve your problem then edit-warring. We've got <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a>, you certainly might wish to try it.

<dd>Can you define edit warring? I have been discussing things in the discussion pages, adding references, etc. What constitutes edit warring? How was I edit warring? Are there special restrictions on me that are not on others? Am I going to be singled out again simply because I was blocked for "edit warring" in the past? That would be just as unjustified as this block was, which was because I had been blocked for violating the 3RR in the past. Don't you see where this is leading? It builds on itself, when all I really did was violate the 3RR. Next time I will be blocked for "edit warring" even though I'm not behaving any differently from anyone else, just based on this history of "edit warring" that's being manufactured. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 21:43, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I had originally made the image smaller because it was simply too large, and really should not be kept at the actual size. While you are certainly allowed to keep such an image, it is much better that you keep the image at a size that is not too large for several screen resolutions. My screen resolution (1920x1200) is just big enough that I can see the whole width, but there are obviously editors who have much smaller screen resolutions and the large white field that the eagle is on would be an eyesore. I was in no way intimidating you before, and I have decreased the size of the eagle to 1000 pixels in width (and I have centered it).—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 02:45, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am curious about something. You say you are a fascist, but disagree with Hitler and Mussolini on many important points (such as anti-semitism and racism). In that case, why do you still call yourself a fascist? As far as I can tell, the only parts of fascism that you agree with are fascist economic policies - and those policies are not unique to fascism. Why not call yourself simply a supporter of the Third Way, or a corporatist, or something similar? I am asking this because you seem to go through a lot of trouble for the sake of something (namely fascism) that you do not even completely agree with. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 21:19, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Racism was not a constitutive element of fascism although a number of fascist movements expressed racist beliefs." ---Herbert Kitschelt, The Radical Right in Western Europe. The fundamentals of fascism does not include racism. It's just that some fascists were themselves anti-semites. Anti-semitism was popular back then, not only among fascists. Fascism to me is the basic belief that benefit to the community should precede benefit to the individual. The individuals should sacrifice self-interest for the good of society. If they aren't willing, then the state should step in to make sure of that. This applies to individuals as well as businesses. I believe everything should be absorbed into the state, so that there is no real distinction between the state and the private. Most businesses would be privately owned, but at the same time they should be subject to the control of the collectivity. There should be no antagonisms between classes. I believe in one big fascist machine, so to speak, where everyone works together for the common good. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 21:28, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You say that "fascism to me is the basic belief that benefit to the community should precede benefit to the individual". But clearly, that belief is much older than fascism. Fascists were not the only people - not even the first people - who believed that benefit to the community should precede benefit to the individual. You don't have to be a fascist to believe all the things you listed above (in fact, almost no people called themselves fascists after WW2, even though many people share your views). For the most part, "fascism" is used either as an insult or as a label for a historical movement that existed between the world wars. I do not understand why you wish to keep that label - but most of all, given the extreme negative connotation that the word "fascism" has in the West today, I do not understand why you spend more effort on trying to prove that fascism is socialist than on trying to prove that fascism is not as bad as most people think. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 01:45, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not trying to get him to "justify his views". On the contrary, I am trying to help him (while indulging my own curiosity in the process, granted). "Fascism" is a highly negative label, and I think this user would have more success on both wikipedia and elsewhere if he reconsidered his self-label. This is particularly true given the fact that he only agrees with <i>some</i>, not all, of the positions traditionally considered "fascist". To put it another way: I've met many people whose views were very similar to Billy's but who did not consider themselves fascists. I am thus curious to know why Billy calls himself a fascist. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 01:27, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Surely it isn't the same. Nikodemos is attempting to enter into a friendly and informative exchange of views about Billy's faschist beliefs which, contrary to a statement by Billy above, he does actively deploy in edits and uses that particular POV to make edits, which is of course against WP policies. Therefore I think Nikodemos is acting on behalf of the best interests of WP and attempting to politely encourage this editor to discuss and review rather than simply getting involved in POV fights. I think it could be argued that it's none of your business to seek to interfere with such a sensible thing Cloveoil and indeed to desist from making allegations that Nikodemos is acting against WP's interests when doing so, which he clearly is not. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkThomas_730d.html" title="User:MarkThomas">MarkThomas</a> 13:14, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As an administrator (and left-leaning libertarian to boot!) I am uncomfortable with this block. I can certainly see why Billy Ego wishes to label himself a "facist" in areas such as economics and understandably wants to be able to distant himself from the racism inextricably associated with it throughout its history. Editors will always enter disagreements with other editors and if Billy wants to explain how his ideology (no matter how unpopular it may be) shapes his point of view, then it can be justified that the controversial paragraphs on his userpage definitely falls under the goal of user pages which is "<i>to facilitate communication among participants in its project to build an encyclopedia</i>". I can also see why you have blocked because others may try to point to your user page as having set a precedent of misusing user pages for political soapboxing. However, all said, <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a> is indeed a guideline and not policy -- as such, I do not believe that constraining what you can and cannot have on your userpage regarding your point of view is a decision that can be made by any one administrator -- it is up to the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_a514.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee</a> to set such limits.

<p>I randomly stumbled across this, and this looks like a misuse of power to me. Note that I did not say abuse, as I don't feel that this was intentional. Everyone has the right to express their POV on their user pages, and no one has the right to silence it short of racism and pedophilia. I was ready to see another case of the admin doing the right thing, and the policy violator making unfounded claims, but when I look at the diffs I see an admin removing perfectly reasonable userpage material and blocking the user. If this user is a fascist, he has the right to say that, and to quote other fascists. It is just like a Christian user quoting Jesus, or a conservative user quoting Bill O'Reilly. Fascism has negative connotations in the minds of many, but that does not give an admin the right to block or remove quotes. There is no Wikipedia policy saying that fascists aren't allowed to edit the encyclopedia, or that they are the only people not allowed to express what POV they have and why on their user page. This is not enforcement of policy. This is censorship. This is crossing the line. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">The</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">Hyb</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">rid</font></a></b> 23:42, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're mistaken. It's clearly not a violation. [8] is retaining the same meaning as was there before but just making it more explicit. A "capitalist" is an "owner of capital." There is no way it can be construed as a revert. I understand that you are busy doing your adminstrative functions but please take more care next time in evaluating things. I request an unblock immediately. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 20:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You removed "major capitalist" twice; I know what I meant, and I disagree (the State could own capital). Regardless, it was a revert. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 20:28, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, let's look at what "capitalists" was replaced with. First this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nazism&amp;diff=118349544&amp;oldid=118347228" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nazism&amp;diff=118349544&amp;oldid=118347228" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> then this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nazism&amp;diff=118413301&amp;oldid=118412876" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nazism&amp;diff=118413301&amp;oldid=118412876" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> That doesn't constitute reversion, but two different changes of changing of wording in an attempt to make things more accurate, neither of them being reversions. "Capitalism" has two meanings. One is a owner of capital. The other is a supporter of capitalism. I was intending to clarify that "capitalist" in the sense that it was being used was not referring to a supporter of capitalism as a system but simply one who owns of capital. To block me for this is unjust, and to claim it is a reversion is dead wrong. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 21:26, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have attempted to write a consensus version that combines text from both your version and mine, but you keep reverting without discussion. Here is some useful information.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is my version: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;oldid=114465897" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;oldid=114465897" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></li>
<li>This is your version: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;oldid=118349920" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;oldid=118349920" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></li>
<li>And this is the compromise that I propose: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;oldid=118461633" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;oldid=118461633" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></li>
<li>This is the difference between the compromise and my version: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;diff=118461633&amp;oldid=114465897" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;diff=118461633&amp;oldid=114465897" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></li>
<li>This is the difference between the compromise and your version: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;diff=118461633&amp;oldid=118349920" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economics_of_fascism&amp;diff=118461633&amp;oldid=118349920" rel="nofollow">[19]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that your version deletes 6 attributed sources that exist in the compromise version: <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> You have given no explanation for their deletion. In fact, you have not commented on my proposed compromise at all, except to accuse me of removing sources you consider important. I have listed the sources you removed. Now, please do the same and list the sources <i>I</i> removed. Then we can work out a better compromise acceptable to both sides. Or we can keep reverting until one of us gets bored. Your choice... For my part, I honestly want to reach a compromise with you. Yes, we've had our conflicts in the past, and that makes cooperation more difficult than it should be.

<dd>You started out deleting sourced things while adding your own things. You know exactly what you're deleting. That's what I opposed you deleting it, because it's sourced. I don't see any reason to "compromise" if by compromise you mean allow sourced things to be deleted. Delete unsourced things if you want but not sourced things. The reason I am reverting away your sourced things is because you started this by deleting sourced things in the article. You should go back to square one and add sourced things instead of deleting sourced things in the process. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 19:10, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>So now you are here trying to force me into a "compromise" when there needn't be one of the type you describe where we delete sourced info. Simply allow others to put sourced info in the article and you can put source info in the ariitcle too. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBilly_Ego_b974.html" title="User:Billy Ego">Billy Ego</a> 19:18, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that we shouldn't be deleting sourced info. That's the point. <i>I want to create a version that includes both your sourced info and mine.</i> That's why I kept asking you to tell me what you wanted included in the article. See <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EAssume_good_faith_cd17.html" title="WP:Assume good faith">WP:Assume good faith</a>. Now I went back and tried to figure it out myself, and added back in the things I had removed in my previous edit. Next time please <i>tell me</i> what your objections are, rather than assume I can somehow read your mind. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 19:42, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
