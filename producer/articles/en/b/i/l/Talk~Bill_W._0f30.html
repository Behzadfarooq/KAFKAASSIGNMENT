<p>Much of Wikipedia is done well; this article is an object lesson in how to everything poorly.</p>
<p>The article is hopelessly non-NPOV: it reads like AA literature, and was clearly written by a "true believer." One without a modicum of writing talent.</p>
<p>But more importantly, there are vast swaths of the article without a footnote, a citation, any kind of referential support whatsoever. I realize the writer just copied most of the drivel write of an AA pamphlet or their "Big Book." But couldn't somebody find a citation or two?</p>
<p>For what claims to be an encyclopedia this is laughably bad. And how could you possibly completely omit the massive amounts of criticism leveled at AA by the therapeutic community? For a layman's level perspective, see e.g. <a href="http://www.orange-papers.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.orange-papers.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.orange-papers.org/</a>.</p>
<p>There are countless scholarly journals containing similar criticisms of Bill Wilson's organization. They don't merit a single mention?</p>
<p>Worst. Article. Ever.</p>

<p>It was a ridiculously biased mess so I fixed it to reflect reality.</p>
<p>Bill Wilson and the Alcoholics Anonymous fellowship came to a mutual decision to decrease his involvement because of his extra-traditional activities;such as, promoting niacin as a cure for alcoholism.My source on that is "A.A. comes of Age".<a href="../../../t/j/c/User%7ETjc_447c.html" title="User:Tjc">Tjc</a> 06:34, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I realized after sober [sic] reflection that in the article I LIBELED Susan Cheever by speculating that she was an adult child of an alcoholic John Cheever. The only basis I had for speculating that John Cheever was a drunk and that Susan is an adult child was Cheever's fiction, which may not constitute a roman a clef, and the seeming anger in Susan's bio, which may or may not have a Freudian content.</p>
<p>I have removed my speculation and I apologize if I have given any offense to the Cheever family or violated wikipedia's rules. And as always my text is Powerless over emendation.</p>

<p>Wilson never claimed that popping LSD was the peak spiritual experience of his life. It may have been the peak spiritual experience of the life of the clown who posted that claim, but Wilson clearly states that an experience he had while recovering from a bout before his trip to Akron was the key or peak spiritual experience of his goddamn life. This is confirmed both inside and outside authorized AA literature.</p>
<p>Wilson's debt to the Oxford group was exagerrated, and it had nothing to do with Christianity. Instead, he seems to have realized that their humility, not their faith in God, needed to be incorporated into AA.</p>
<p>Susan Cheever IS an adult child, and to the best of my knowledge, her Dad was a drunk who fucked up her life, and then had the nerve (as do many alcoholics, to pay the rent and support the ungrateful little brats, like Cheever and Ray Carver) to write about it. Her "documentation" is an adult child's cry of pain that her Daddy loved the bottle more than her, because she's confusing Cheever with Wilson. Furthermore, Bill W. is not the only recovered alcoholic to make, after twenty years off the sauce, a beeline for the bar, only to be saved at the last minute, whether by a spiritual thought or (it seems in the case of the incident Cheever uses to libel Wilson) Big Nurse.</p>
<p>Wikipedia doesn't have to be AA approved literature, but it needs to keep its facts straight. I have done major surgery on this article and the patient is recovering nicely.</p>

<p>I'm in the club. I've read Susan's book and felt it had an objective tone, not hostile. I was startled by the events discribed on Bill's deathbed but I won't drink over it. It reinforced his humanity. One thing though. Did Bill receive royalties from the Big Book (capitalizing like the Bible for reverential effect)? If so, how do you sanction that with the tradition accounting his struggle with "a laborer is worthy of his hire and making money out of AA?<a href="../../../1/6/6/User%7E166.68.134.175.html" title="User:166.68.134.175">166.68.134.175</a> 17:11, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes Bill made royalties from the Big Book.

<p>The tone of the article is typical AA propoganda. Bill Wilson had a serious character defect, he took LSD 20 years into sobriety. The LSD experiments were intended for drunks initial phase of drying out. To add insult to injury, AA literature comments that Wilson advocated the drug enthusiastically. The operative word here is enthusiastic. Coming from a recovering guru, you would have to think very seriously before turning your will over to this program. Also, the OxFord groups Buchman was a vocal admirer of Heinrich Himmler and Buchman was on the cover of Time featured, "Cultist Buchman". AA is a cult. This article personifies condesending tone of AA propoganda and will not objectively call a spade a spade. The recovery rate after 10 years in AA is less than 5 %. That is not a successful program, that is an absolute failure rate. Would you want a batter at the plate pinch-hitting in the World Series with a batting average of 50&#160;?????? That batter would be looking for a new career.160.136.109.109 21:43, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article sounds more like a history of AA than a bio of Bill. Bill was a great man, leader, and thinker, and also a man with deep flaws; that's what makes him interesting.

If you can do the necessary copy editing to bring it up to standards, I don't have a problem with it. But as you've currently written it, "The Importance of The Occult" is the largest section in this article.

<p>I disagree...quotes are used in numerous occassions. Quoatations and leading. I mean we are quoting Pass It On How AA message reached the world so how can that be leading. It is out of AA own resource material.</p>
<p>Not only that but the AA pass it on is not in the reference section. <small>—The preceding unsigned comment was added by 207.194.108.93 00:26, 31 March 2007</small></p>

<dd>It is, it's the second reference, take a look: <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_W._e203.html#References" title="Bill W.">Bill_W.#References</a>. The number of times the quotes have been used, that their source is official A.A. literature, etc, is not a reason to include them. This has all ready been discussed. -- <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigtalbert_4dbc.html" title="User:Craigtalbert">Craigtalbert</a> 00:51, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
