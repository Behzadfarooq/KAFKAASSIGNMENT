<p>This article needs to be substantially expanded. Janklow was a hard charging prosecutor in the 1970's who relied on his successful prosecution of AIM members to propel him to higher office. Someone with more knowledge of political and racial attitudes toward Native Americans in South Dakota in that era should comment on that. In addition, the impunity he enjoyed while Governor is worth noting, as are the other details of his biography, such as his education and his early years as a Legal Aid attorney.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.126.42.45 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.126.42.45_3e21.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.126.42.45">contribs</a>) 09:21, 14 December 2003 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>This page also says practically nothing about his significant record during his sixteen years as governor. That should obviously be the focus of the article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tonywiki (<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywiki_8160.html" title="User talk:Tonywiki">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tonywiki_5276.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tonywiki">contribs</a>) 21:08, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>I write this plea for an expansion of the Bill Janklow article. For a man who has impacted South Dakota in so many ways, this article seems lopsided in devoting the same amount of space to Mr. Janklow's car accident as it does to the rest of his political life. If an expert on Mr. Janklow (if one even exists) would kindly take the time to expand this work, the wiki community would be appreciative.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.230.148.173 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.230.148.173_19d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.230.148.173">contribs</a>) 19:41, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>The phrase "Though controversial" is used to excuse his speach and behavior with the text that follws and is thus not neutral.

<dl>
<dd>I am well acquainted with Janklow's record in South Dakota, but I don't have the time to do the research that would be necessary to write a complete biography. Janklow had a significant number of vocal detractors, and a complete biography should reflect that; however, he was also one of the most successful politicians in South Dakota's history, both in his record in office and at the ballot box. I think it would be unfortunate for a biography of Janklow to be written only by his detrators.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The current version of this article is really nothing more than a biographical "stub" followed by a more detailed discussion of his manslaughter conviction. As I said before, Janklow's career deserves a more detailed treatment of his assent in politics (including his career on the Rosebud reservation and his work in the AG's office dealing with AIM), his four terms as governor, his successful election campaigns and his failed challenge of Jim Abdnor, and his short congressional career.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also do not agree with the assertion that "though controversial" is not neutral. In the full context of the sentence, it is simply saying, in a summartive way, that Janklow was a very successful politician even though he was very controversial. I think that any person who is familiar with Janklow's career would agree that that is a very fair and factual statement. His "speech and behavior" are largely not specified.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tonywiki (<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywiki_8160.html" title="User talk:Tonywiki">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tonywiki_5276.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tonywiki">contribs</a>) 02:18, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>This article contains some factual errors. Janklow did not receive an undergraduate degree from the University of South Dakota.

<p>why have the sections and the incidences of rape been removed?

<dd>I would guess that this is because the old rape stories are based largely on rumor and there is really no documented proof of any of it.

I have never before or since seen a governor get down and get his hands dirty helping in a disaster.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.137.40.178 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.137.40.178_4104.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.137.40.178">contribs</a>) 19:39, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</small>–</p>
<p>He didn't do the same thing for the American Indians though after a tornado flattened many of their homes. Once he set the precedent to help people after a disaster, he should have done it for everyone who experienced a disaster.</p>

<p>The picture that's up for this guy looks like he's trying to pass gas. I've done a quick Google image search but couldn't find anything better, of an appropriate size, and that wouldn't cause copyright problems. Any ideas? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAliceinlampyland_08a2.html" title="User:Aliceinlampyland">aliceinlampyland</a> 22:12, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bill Janklow was not exactly "Mr. Photogenic" my any stretch. I generally supported him as governor (I am from SD), and I would say that this picture is pretty good. Really good pictures of Bill are difficult to find.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tonywiki (<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywiki_8160.html" title="User talk:Tonywiki">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tonywiki_5276.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tonywiki">contribs</a>) 02:01, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>Agreed. Bill Janklow's adversarial relationship with the media precluded many flattering photos being taken of him. He made it clear he neither liked nor trusted the media; they often returned the favor publishing photos of him with his mouth wide open or his eyes squinting. Whether you like or dislike the man (and opinion in SD remains deeply polarized about him), Janklow simply didn't seem to enjoy letting the media photograph him. Consequently, they didn't care if they ran a bad picture. The existing photo here is as good as any I've seen SD newspapers or television stations use. If someone could find an official Congressional Portrait or something from the actual SD Governor's office that might be slightly more objective (though as the above anon user points out -- no matter how you slice it, he just wasn't a photogenic person). 66.17.118.207 16:30, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The death of Gina Score was under Janklow's watch and a direct result of his policies on how to treat offfenders and juvenile offenders in particular. The state got away with her murder. Janklow blocked reporters from the boot camp and generally did everything he could to protect himself, the state, and the boot camp people who killed her.</p>
<p>Funny how when he became the offender he expected understanding and mercy. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Sbilli1 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sbilli1_db1f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sbilli1">contribs</a>) 23:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>I removed the rape allegations. This incident happened in 1967, long before he was elected Attorney General. He was cleared by the FBI and the US Attorneys Office long before Indian Troubles began in South Dakota.</p>

<p>I noticed the expansion request. You can't have expansion as long as the morons and other Janklow haters keep putting inane offal into this entry. If they would start sticking to the bare facts, then you could get somewhere. This is supposed to be an encyclopedia rather than a rah rah political rally.</p>

<p>The previous poster has mixed the civil, federal tort claim and state criminal case. I attempted to clear this up but he removed my revision. If he wants to make separate sections on the civil aspect of Janklow's accicent, that is appropriate. He can plug into that all the anti-Janklow stuff he wants. My clean up revision of the criminal case was unbiased, factual and foot-noted. I intend to restore it after a few days. If he removes it again I intend to call for an editorial review.</p>

<p>I would ask for an editorial review from an NPOV perspective of the comments and actions of Jonathunder who removed my neutral comments about Janklow's criminal trial and put back his politically biased comments.</p>

<p>I reverted to my encyclopedia type article and removed the combination civil suit, tort claims act and political statement mishmash. None of it was compentent for a criminal law article. If you want to make a political statement about Janklow, then make a separate article or separate heading. If you want to discuss the civil action or tort claims case, this is appropriate under its own heading. I would think that political statements and attacks do not show a NPOV, and I would challenge them on that basis. This is supposed to be a neutral article.</p>
