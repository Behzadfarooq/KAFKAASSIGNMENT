<p>Twas reading about Doug, and other classic Nicktoons, feeling all nostalgic, and read that Doug's middle name was Yancy. Because I'm also in part a Futurama Geek, I know that Fry's brother's name is Yancy. Does Billy West like the name, or know someone close with the name? Or is this just a case where I'm making connections where there really aren't any? (For instance, Lincoln and JFK were assasinated for political reasons that would make Hideo Kojima's idea of the Patriots likely. Those people have tons of "Evidence" to prove their clames...) But I digress, to extreme points. So, Billy West knows a Yancy, or not? <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.96.98.74.html" title="User:65.96.98.74">65.96.98.74</a> 02:59, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>www.billywest.com cites Billy West's date of birth as 1952, but this article says 1950. I guess this is the one that's incorrect? -- <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupermorff_0984.html" title="User:Supermorff">Supermorff</a> 15:17, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"West's roles in Futurama include Philip J. Fry, Professor Hubert Farnsworth, Dr. Zoidberg and Zapp Brannigan (all of which, except Zoidberg, were set to be played by Phil Hartman)."</p>
<p>Where is this from?? I am pretty sure only Zapp Brannigan was going to be played by Phil Hartman.</p>

<dd>I'm not an avid Billy West fan, so I can't comment to be sure, but if you think that's true then I recommend editing it to be so.

<dl>
<dd>This made me react as well. I've never heard anyone involved in the show suggest Fry and Farnsworth were to be voiced by Hartman, so claiming this without sourcing it won't do. Pjalne 11:51, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Billy West states that the voice itself of Zapp Brannigan was an imitation of Phil Hartman, but that the actual vocalizations of the character were based on old-time radio announcers." This makes absolutely no sense to me, I recall West saying on a commentary that he was NOT doing an impersonation and had come in with his own thoughts on the character, and that the voice of Brannigan was more along the lines of a "DJ that loves the sound of his own voice." This may or may not be true, I require some more time to research this.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyRush10_88b8.html" title="User:JohnnyRush10">JohnnyRush10</a> 07:04, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I, being a big fan of Billy West, pay attention to all the interviews and such that he does. He has been asked about this in nearly every interview. His answer has changed a bit a couple times. In my opinion, I believe the sound of the character's voice was intentionally close to Phil Hartman's voice, and the actual way the character speaks and acts and his persona were based on DJs/radio announcers. In the interview linked, though, West says (verbatim) "I was imitating Phil Hartman". So, given the apparent contradiction, it is unknown. Since the current information is sourced with an interview of the man himself, it should be taken as reliable. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickenmonkey_1a0f.html" title="User:Chickenmonkey">Chickenmonkey</a> 20:20, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, after having seen it reverted back and forth several times, I've come to the conclusion that the information about Hartman originally being pegged to play Fry must be sourced somehow. Where is this assertion coming from? Pointing toward the character Fry's Wikipedia page isn't helpful, since it is also unsourced on THAT page as well.</p>
<p>If nobody can find a credible source for this "fact," then I think we should remove it. I'd consider a credible source either an episode transcript, a commentary from one of the DVDs, an interview with one of the show's creators or something in an established news outlet (New York Times, etc). <a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESGreenwell_25be.html" title="User:SGreenwell">SGreenwell</a> 02:46, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a very credible source that indicates that Billy West was known as Billy Warstein when he was playing guitar in a rock band in Boston in the early/mid 1970's. Unfortunately, this credible source is not suitable for encyclopedia citation, and of course, the source may be wrong. Does anybody have any irrefutable evidence of his actual last name?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've never heard this, but I'm not a huge Billy West fan. Regardless, you would need some sort of citation to support the claim, as you mentioned. It's possible that he went as Billy Warstein for only the band, as well. <a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESGreenwell_25be.html" title="User:SGreenwell">SGreenwell</a> 23:21, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Say, is there any info on why Billy West did not do work on the "Lost Episodes" of Ren &amp; Stimpy (besides the obvious reason that they weren't that good)? I'd like to know if there were any official statements from Mr. West regarding his absence. Twineball 00:00, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In at least one of the interviews that are linked in the article now, Billy talks about that.

<p>What is the basis of thought of Billy West voicing Whiskers on Brandy and Mr. Whiskers? The <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brandy_and_Mr._Whiskers_2212.html" title="Brandy and Mr. Whiskers">Brandy and Mr. Whiskers</a> article even has a contradiction of this fact.

<dd>I noticed that in the infobox it indicates Billy West took over for Andre Sogliuzzo, but not Charlie Adler. Then in the article it says West took over for both of them. I, personally, would take the word of those who are fans of the show, but I haven't been able to find anything other than their word that says West joined the show. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChickenmonkey_1a0f.html" title="User:Chickenmonkey">Chickenmonkey</a> 01:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
