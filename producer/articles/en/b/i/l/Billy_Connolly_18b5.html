<p>Billy Connolly was born at 65 Dover Street ("on the linoleum, three floors up"<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>) in <a href="../../../a/n/d/Anderston.html" title="Anderston">Anderston</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> to Mary and William Connolly, the son of an Irish immigrant.<sup id="_ref-Profile_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Profile" title="">[2]</a></sup> In 1946, with their son barely four years old, Connolly's mother abandoned his sister and him, while his father was away for the war. He and his sister, Florence ("Flo"), were then looked after by two aunts, Margaret and Mona, his father's sisters.</p>
<p>Connolly was brought up in the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Anderston.html" title="Anderston">Anderston</a>, and later <a href="../../../p/a/r/Partick.html" title="Partick">Partick</a>, districts of Glasgow. He attended St. Peter's Primary School in Glasgow and St. Gerard's Secondary School in <a href="../../../g/o/v/Govan.html" title="Govan">Govan</a>.<sup id="_ref-Profile_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Profile" title="">[2]</a></sup> At the age of 12, he decided he wanted to become a comedian but felt he didn't fit the mold; he felt he needed to become more "windswept and interesting". Instead, at the age of 15, he left school and became a <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welder.html" title="Welder">welder</a> in a <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shipyard.html" title="Shipyard">Glasgow shipyard</a>. Around the same time he joined the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Territorial_Army_c362.html" title="Territorial Army">Territorial Army</a>'s <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachute_Regiment_51c4.html" title="Parachute Regiment">Parachute Regiment</a>. At the medical, the doctor noted to him, "You're not very big downstairs, are you?", to which Connolly replied, "I thought we were only going to <i>fight</i> them."</p>

<p>In 1965, after he had completed a five-year apprenticeship as a welder, Connolly accepted a ten-week job building an <a href="../../../o/i/l/Oil_rig.html" title="Oil rig">oil rig</a> in <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. Upon his return to Scotland, he focused on being a <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_singer.html" title="Folk singer">folk singer</a>. "How do you know when you're finished being a welder?" asked fellow Scot <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Ferguson_087b.html" title="Craig Ferguson">Craig Ferguson</a> of Connolly on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Late_Late_Show_%28CBS_TV_series%29_62a2.html" title="The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)">The Late Show</a></i> on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>. "Well," begins Connolly, "from heaven comes this noise. It's something like <i>Fuck this</i>."</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">27 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>, a 26-year-old Connolly married his first wife, Iris Pressagh. In December of that year, his first child, Jamie, was born. He has four more children, all girls — one (Cara, born <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>) with Iris, and three with his second wife, Pamela: Daisy (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a>), Amy (<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">7 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>), and Scarlett (<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_28.html" title="July 28">28 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>).</p>
<p>Connolly's career as a folk singer led to him forming a folk-pop duo called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Humblebums_340a.html" title="The Humblebums">The Humblebums</a> with a fellow musician Tam Harvey. After recording one album, Harvey left the partnership and was replaced by future rock star <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerry_Rafferty_dcad.html" title="Gerry Rafferty">Gerry Rafferty</a>. The Connolly-Rafferty version of The Humblebums recorded two more albums for independent record label <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transatlantic_Records_a8df.html" title="Transatlantic Records">Transatlantic Records</a>. The albums were not big commercial successes but enjoyed cult status and critical acclaim. Connolly's contributions were primarily straight-forward pop-folk with quirky and whimsical lyrics - but he had not especially focused on comedy at this point.</p>
<p>In 1970, the Humblebums broke up with Rafferty going on to record a solo album for Transatlantic Records - <i>Can I Have My Money Back</i> (1971). Connolly returned to being a folk singer. His live performances featured folks songs with humorous introductions that became increasingly long in duration.</p>
<p>The head of Transatlantic Records, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathan_Joseph_c6d8.html" title="Nathan Joseph">Nat Joseph</a>, who had signed the Humblebums and had nurtured their career, was concerned that Connolly find a way to develop a distinctive solo career just as his former bandmate Gerry Rafferty was doing. Joseph saw several of Connolly's performances and noted his comedic skills. Joseph had successfully nurtured the recording career of another Scottish folk entertainer <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamish_Imlach_6cf9.html" title="Hamish Imlach">Hamish Imlach</a> - and Joseph saw potential in Connolly following a similar path. He suggested to Connolly that he drop the folk-singing and focus primarily on becoming a comedian. It was a life-changing suggestion.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Connolly_18b5.html" title="Edit section: 1970s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1970s</span></h3>
<p>In 1972 Joseph produced Connolly's first solo album <i>Billy Connolly Live!</i> a mixture of comedic songs and short monologues that hinted at what was to follow. In late 1973, Joseph produced the breakthrough album that propelled Connolly to British stardom. Recorded at a small venue, The Tudor Hotel in <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airdrie.html" title="Airdrie">Airdrie</a>, Scotland - the record was a double-album titled <i>Solo Concert</i>. Releasing a live double-album by a comedian who was virtually unknown (except to a cult audience in Glasgow) was an unusual gambit by Joseph but his faith in Connolly's talent was justified. Joseph and his Transatlantic Records marketing team - which included publicist <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Lewis_d67b.html" title="Martin Lewis">Martin Lewis</a> (who as a producer in 1979 would cast Connolly in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Secret_Policeman%27s_Ball_f582.html" title="The Secret Policeman's Ball">The Secret Policeman's Ball</a></i> show) - successfully promoted the album to chart success on its release in 1974. Building on his cult Scottish following - Transatlantic broke Connolly throughout the UK - an unusual development for a regional comedian.</p>
<p>In 1975, Transatlantic used the rapidity and extent of Connolly's breakthrough to secure him a booking on Britain's premier TV talkshow - the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>'s <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson_%28TV_series%29_ff07.html" title="Parkinson (TV series)">Parkinson</a></i> show. Connolly made the most of the opportunity and told a bawdy joke about a man who had murdered his wife and buried her bottom-up so he'd have somewhere to park his bike. This ribald humour was unusually forthright on a primetime Saturday night on British television in the mid-1970s and his appearance made a great impact and was much talked-about. He became a good friend of the host, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Parkinson_dbbe.html" title="Michael Parkinson">Michael Parkinson</a>, and now holds the joint record (with <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Williams_4dcf.html" title="Kenneth Williams">Kenneth Williams</a>) for appearances on the programme, having been a guest on eight occasions. Referring to that debut appearance, he later said: "That programme changed my entire life." Parkinson, in the documentary <i>Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years</i>, stated that people still remember Connolly telling the punchline to the 'bike joke' three decades after that TV appearance.</p>
<p>Connolly's UK success spread to other English-speaking countries - Australia, New Zealand and Canada. However his broad Scottish accent and parochial British references made success in the US improbable.</p>
<p>His popularity in Britain endeared him to many other British entertainers including musicians such as <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a>. John at that time was trying to assist British performers he personally liked, to achieve success in the US. (He had released records in the US by veteran British pop singer <a href="../../../c/l/i/Cliff_Richard_d0cb.html" title="Cliff Richard">Cliff Richard</a> on his own <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket_Records_4e9e.html" title="Rocket Records">Rocket Records</a> label.) John tried to give Connolly a boost in America by using him as the opening act on his 1976 US tour. But the well-intentioned gesture was a failure. Elton John's American fans had no interest in being warmed-up by an unknown comedic performer - especially a Scotsman whose accent was indecipherable to most Americans. "In Washington, some guy threw a pipe and it hit me right between my eyes", he told Michael Parkinson two years later. "It wasn't my audience. They made me feel about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit."</p>
<p>Connolly continued to grow in popularity in the UK. In 1975 he signed with <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polydor_Records_bb15.html" title="Polydor Records">Polydor Records</a> and the label built on Transatlantic's groundwork. Connolly continued to release live albums and he also recorded several comedic songs that enjoyed commercial success as novelty singles including parodies of <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammy_Wynette_292f.html" title="Tammy Wynette">Tammy Wynette</a>'s song <i><a href="../../../d/2E/i/D.I.V.O.R.C.E._95fb.html" title="D.I.V.O.R.C.E.">D.I.V.O.R.C.E.</a></i> and the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_People_6b80.html" title="Village People">Village People</a>'s <i>In The Navy</i> - titled <i>In The Brownies</i>.</p>
<p>In 1979, Connolly was invited by producer <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Lewis_d67b.html" title="Martin Lewis">Martin Lewis</a> to join the cast of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Secret_Policeman%27s_Ball_%281979%29_2b25.html" title="The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)">The Secret Policeman's Ball</a></i> - the third in the series of the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Secret_Policeman%27s_Balls_ef9d.html" title="The Secret Policeman's Balls">Secret Policeman's Ball</a></i> fundraising shows for Amnesty International. Connolly was the first comedic perfomer in the series who was not an alumnus of the <i><a href="../../../o/x/b/Oxbridge.html" title="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a></i> school of middle-class university-educated entertainers and he made the most of his appearance. His performance was considered to be one of the highlights of the show's comedy album (released by <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Records_88d9.html" title="Island Records">Island Records</a> in December 1979) and feature film (released by ITC Films in 1980). Appearing in the same company as long-established talents such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Cook_1071.html" title="Peter Cook">Peter Cook</a> helped elevate the perception of Connolly as one of Britain's leading comedic talents. Lewis also teamed Connolly with Cleese and Cook to appear in the television commercial for the album.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Connolly_18b5.html" title="Edit section: 1980s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1980s</span></h3>
<p>In 1981, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Lewis_d67b.html" title="Martin Lewis">Martin Lewis</a> invited Connolly to appear in that year's Amnesty show <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Secret_Policeman%27s_Other_Ball_8d21.html" title="The Secret Policeman's Other Ball">The Secret Policeman's Other Ball</a></i>. Connolly's performance was again reported as one of the highlights of the show and he was prominently featured in the subsequent comedy album (Springtime!/<a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Records_88d9.html" title="Island Records">Island Records</a> 1981) and UK film (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_International_Pictures_a0c9.html" title="United International Pictures">UIP</a> 1982). The commercial success of the special US version of the <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Secret_Policeman%27s_Other_Ball_8d21.html" title="The Secret Policeman's Other Ball">Secret Policeman's Other Ball</a></i> film (<a href="../../../m/i/r/Miramax_Films_4831.html" title="Miramax Films">Miramax Films</a> 1982) introduced Connolly to a wider American audience - attracted to the film because of the presence of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monty_Python_f0e0.html" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a> members. His on-screen presence alongside British comedic performers - who were already familiar to Anglophile comedy buffs - helped lay down a marker for Connolly's eventual return to America in his own right eight years later.</p>
<p>In 1985, he divorced his wife of sixteen years (they had separated four years earlier). He was awarded custody of their two children. That same year, he recorded <i><a href="../../../a/n/_/An_Audience_with..._4cb3.html" title="An Audience with...">An Audience with...</a></i> which was broadcast in front of a celebrity audience on <a href="../../../i/t/v/ITV_7461.html" title="ITV">ITV</a>. The uncut, uncensored version was subsequently released on video. In July of 1985 he performed at the <a href="../../../w/e/m/Wembley_Stadium_7314.html" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley</a> leg of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Live_Aid_f42b.html" title="Live Aid">Live Aid</a> - immediately preceding Elton John.</p>
<p>In 1986 he visited <a href="../../../m/o/z/Mozambique.html" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> to appear in a documentary for <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Relief_ec40.html" title="Comic Relief">Comic Relief</a>. He also featured in the charity's inaugural live stage show, both as a stand-up and portraying a willing 'victim' in his partner <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela_Stephenson_f22b.html" title="Pamela Stephenson">Pamela Stephenson</a>'s act of sawing a man in half to create two <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf.html" title="Dwarf">dwarves</a>.</p>
<p>Connolly completed his first world tour in 1987, including six nights at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Albert_Hall_a74f.html" title="Royal Albert Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in London, which was documented in the <i>Billy and Albert</i> video.</p>
<p>When the Fox Network aired <i>Freedomfest: <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>'s 70th Birthday Celebration</i> in 1988, Connolly was still virtually unknown in the States, but his performance drew attention, particularly from producers, and interest in him grew.</p>
<p>In 1989, Connolly's father died after a stroke. (His mother died four years later of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_neurone_disease.html" title="Motor neurone disease">motor neurone disease</a>.) On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_20.html" title="December 20">December 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, in <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji.html" title="Fiji">Fiji</a>, Connolly married <a href="../../../p/a/m/Pamela_Stephenson_f22b.html" title="Pamela Stephenson">Pamela Stephenson</a>, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>-born comedic actress whom he'd met when making a cameo appearance on the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> sketch show <i><a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_The_Nine_O%27Clock_News_b264.html" title="Not The Nine O'Clock News">Not The Nine O'Clock News</a></i>, a series on which she was one of four regular performers. He had been living with her since 1981. "Marriage to Pam didn't change me, it saved me", he later said. "I was going to die. I was on a downwards spiral and enjoying every second of it. Not only was I dying, but I was looking forward to it."</p>
<p>Earlier in 1989 Connolly shaved off his trademark shaggy beard for a film role and he remained clean-shaven for several years.</p>

<p>Although Connolly had performed in North America as early as the 1970s, and had appeared in several movies that played in American theatres, he nonetheless remained relatively unknown until 1990 when he was featured in the <a href="../../../h/b/o/HBO_509e.html" title="HBO">HBO</a> special <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Whoopi_Goldberg_25bb.html" title="Whoopi Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a> and Billy Connolly in Performance</i>, produced by New York's <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Academy_of_Music_1dbe.html" title="Brooklyn Academy of Music">Brooklyn Academy of Music</a>. Goldberg introduced Connolly, and his performance has been cited as the moment that officially launched his career in the States. Soon after, Connolly succeeded <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Hesseman_fac9.html" title="Howard Hesseman">Howard Hesseman</a> as the star of the <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcom</a> <i><a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_the_Class_207e.html" title="Head of the Class">Head of the Class</a></i> for the 1990-1991 season, but the series was cancelled during his tenure.</p>
<p>The following year saw Connolly and Stephenson move to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, and the family won <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Permanent_Resident_Card_e4ec.html" title="United States Permanent Resident Card">green cards</a> in the <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Morrison_7f5c.html" title="Bruce Morrison">Morrison</a> Visa Lottery. In 1991, Connolly received his first (and, to date, only) leading television role as the star of <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_%28TV_series%29_fbb5.html" title="Billy (TV series)">Billy</a></i>, another sitcom and a spinoff of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_the_Class_207e.html" title="Head of the Class">Head of the Class</a>. It lasted only a half season.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_4.html" title="June 4">June 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, Connolly performed his 25th-anniversary concert in Glasgow. Parts of the show, and its build-up, were documented in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_South_Bank_Show_1928.html" title="The South Bank Show">The South Bank Show</a></i>, which aired later in the year.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Connolly was dealt a blow in 1993 when his close friend and fishing partner, Jimmy Kent, passed away.</p>
<p>In early January 1994, Connolly began a 40-date <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Connolly%27s_World_Tour_of_Scotland_4a16.html" title="Billy Connolly's World Tour of Scotland">World Tour of Scotland</a></i>, which would be broadcast by the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> later in the year as a six-part series. It was so well received that the BBC signed him up to do a similar tour two years later, this time in Australia. The eight-part series followed Connolly on his custom-made <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harley_Davidson_10ea.html" title="Harley Davidson">Harley Davidson</a> trike <a href="http://www.boom-trikes.co.uk/ImageLibrary/350x350/327.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boom-trikes.co.uk/ImageLibrary/350x350/327.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Also in 1996, Connolly recorded a BBC special, entitled <i>A Scot in the Arctic</i>, in which he spends a week by himself in the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_Circle_346a.html" title="Arctic Circle">Arctic Circle</a>. A notable feature of these shows is that he strips <a href="../../../n/u/d/Nudity.html" title="Nudity">naked</a> in one scene in each of them, usually in some remote wilderness area where no one is likely to complain, although for <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Relief_ec40.html" title="Comic Relief">Comic Relief</a></i> he once danced naked around <a href="../../../p/i/c/Piccadilly_Circus_f55e.html" title="Piccadilly Circus">Piccadilly Circus</a>.</p>
<p>In 1998, Connolly's best friend, Danny Kyle, died. "He was me dearest, dearest, oldest friend," Connolly explained to an Australian audience on his <i>Greatest Hits</i> compilation, released in 2001.</p>
<p>In November 1998, Connolly was the subject of a two-hour retrospective entitled <i>Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years</i>, which included tributes from <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Judi_Dench_36f1.html" title="Dame Judi Dench">Dame Judi Dench</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Connery_c5ee.html" title="Sean Connery">Sean Connery</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/o/Whoopi_Goldberg_25bb.html" title="Whoopi Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Williams_a8f4.html" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dustin_Hoffman_be7f.html" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>, and <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Izzard_1f45.html" title="Eddie Izzard">Eddie Izzard</a>. The special was released on <a href="../../../d/v/d/DVD_1991.html" title="DVD">DVD</a> in North America in 2004.</p>
<p>The following year, Connolly undertook a four-month, 59-date sellout tour of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Later in the year, he completed a five-week, 25-date sellout run at London's <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammersmith_Apollo_e177.html" title="Hammersmith Apollo">Hammersmith Apollo</a>. In 2000 he travelled to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> for two weeks on a 13-date tour.</p>

<p>In 2001, Connolly completed the third in his "World Tour" BBC series, this time of <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Connolly%27s_World_Tour_of_England%2C_Ireland_and_Wales_5044.html" title="Billy Connolly's World Tour of England, Ireland and Wales">England, Ireland and Wales</a></i>, which began in <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> and ended in <a href="../../../p/l/y/Plymouth.html" title="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>. It was broadcast the following year.</p>
<p>Also in 2001, Pamela Stephenson's biography of her husband, <i>Billy</i>, was published. It outlines his career and life, including the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_abuse.html" title="Sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a> by his father that lasted from his tenth to his fourteenth years. Much of the book is about Connolly the celebrity but the account of his early years provides a context for his humour and point of view. A follow-up, <i>Bravemouth</i>, was published in 2003.</p>
<p>Connolly himself is credited with writing several books, including <i>Billy Connolly</i> (late 1970s) and <i>Gullible's Travels</i> (early 1980s), both based upon his stage act, as well as books based upon some of his "World Tour" television series. Connolly, however, has stated that his comedy does not work on the printed page.</p>
<p>A fourth BBC series, <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Connolly%27s_World_Tour_of_New_Zealand_cddb.html" title="Billy Connolly's World Tour of New Zealand">World Tour of New Zealand</a></i>, was filmed in 2004 and aired that winter. Also in his 63rd year, Connolly performed two sold-out <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefit_concert.html" title="Benefit concert">benefit concerts</a> at the Oxford New Theatre in memory of Malcolm Kingsnorth, who for twenty-five years was Connolly's <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tour_Manager_4ee3.html" title="Tour Manager">tour manager</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_engineer.html" title="Sound engineer">sound engineer</a>.</p>
<p>In October 2004, during an 18-night stint at London's <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammersmith_Apollo_e177.html" title="Hammersmith Apollo">Hammersmith Apollo</a>, the comedian was criticised for making jokes about the hostage <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Bigley_7844.html" title="Kenneth Bigley">Kenneth Bigley</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/3717462.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/3717462.stm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Shortly after Connolly joked about the future beheading of the hostage, Bigley was beheaded in Iraq. Connolly does not deny that the incident happened, but claims he was misquoted. He has declined to clarify what he actually said, claiming that the context was as important as the precise words used.</p>
<p>However, despite the bad press, in January 2005, Connolly came 8th in <i>The Comedian's Comedian</i>, a poll voted for by fellow comedians and comedy insider and embarked on a major UK tour with an impressive 15 sold-out nights in <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>.</p>
<p>Also in 2005, Connolly and Stephenson announced, after fourteen years of living in <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, they were returning to live in the former's native land. They purchased a 120-foot yacht with the profits from their house-sale, and now split the year between <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malta.html" title="Malta">Malta</a> and an estate in <a href="../../../a/b/e/Aberdeenshire.html" title="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a>.</p>
<p>Later in the year, Connolly topped an unscientific poll of "Britain's Favourite Comedian" conducted by TV network <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Five_3848.html" title="Channel Five">Channel Five</a> placing him ahead of performers such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cleese_d081.html" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronnie_Barker_5658.html" title="Ronnie Barker">Ronnie Barker</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/w/Dawn_French_0d9a.html" title="Dawn French">Dawn French</a>, and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Cook_1071.html" title="Peter Cook">Peter Cook</a>.</p>
<p>In March 2006, Connolly completed a two-month sold-out tour of Australia.</p>
<p>During the months of May and June 2006, Connolly performed a six-week stand at the 37 Arts Theater in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> as part of his "Too Old To Die Young" tour <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/nycguide/ve12788,8.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.villagevoice.com/nycguide/ve12788,8.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/20/theater/20conn.html?ex=1305777600&amp;en=a46e2ee9de3cc46c&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/20/theater/20conn.html?ex=1305777600&amp;en=a46e2ee9de3cc46c&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. During one show, featured on his <i>Live in New York</i> DVD, he revealed that his 23-year-old daughter, Daisy, was in the audience.</p>
<p>In the Autumn of 2006, Connolly completed a month-long <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a> tour.</p>
<p>Connolly's first live shows of 2007 are due to take place at the Brentwood Theater in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> from March 6 to March 24.</p>

<p>In 1965, together with Tam Harvey, Connolly started a group called the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humblebums.html" title="Humblebums">Humblebums</a>. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, "My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum." The band would later include <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerry_Rafferty_dcad.html" title="Gerry Rafferty">Gerry Rafferty</a>. Connolly sang, played <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banjo.html" title="Banjo">banjo</a> and <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a>, and entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.</p>
<p>In his <i>World Tour of Scotland</i>, Connolly reveals that at a trailer show during the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edinburgh_Festival_2109.html" title="Edinburgh Festival">Edinburgh Festival</a>, the Humblebums took to the stage just before the late <a href="../../../y/e/h/Yehudi_Menuhin_50aa.html" title="Yehudi Menuhin">Yehudi Menuhin</a>.</p>
<p>The trio broke up in 1971, at which point Connolly went solo. His first solo album in 1972, <i>Billy Connolly Live!</i> on <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transatlantic_Records_a8df.html" title="Transatlantic Records">Transatlantic Records</a>, features Connolly as a singer, songwriter, and musician.</p>
<p>His early albums were a mixture of comedy performances with comedic and serious musical interludes. Among his best known musical performances were "The Welly Boot Song", a comical ode to the working class which became his theme song for several years; "In the Brownies", a parody of the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Village_People_6b80.html" title="Village People">Village People</a> classics "<a href="../../../y/2E/m/Y.M.C.A._1917.html" title="Y.M.C.A.">Y.M.C.A.</a>" and "<a href="../../../i/n/_/In_the_Navy_233e.html" title="In the Navy">In the Navy</a>" (for which Connolly filmed a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_video.html" title="Music video">music video</a>); "Two Little Boys in Blue", a tongue-in-cheek indictment of police brutality done to the tune of <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolf_Harris_544a.html" title="Rolf Harris">Rolf Harris</a>' "Two Little Boys"; and the ballad "I Wish I Was in Glasgow" which Connolly would later perform on a guest appearance on the 1990s American <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcom</a> <i>Pearl</i> (which starred <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhea_Perlman_2da3.html" title="Rhea Perlman">Rhea Perlman</a>). He also performed the occasional Humblebums-era song such as "Oh, No!" as well as straightforward covers such as a version of <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolly_Parton_7625.html" title="Dolly Parton">Dolly Parton</a>'s "Coat of Many Colors" which was included on his <i>Riotous Assembly</i> album.</p>
<p>In November 1975, his spoof of the <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammy_Wynette_292f.html" title="Tammy Wynette">Tammy Wynette</a> song "D-I-V-O-R-C-E" had a one-week spell as the UK's No. 1 single. Wynette's original was about parents spelling out words of an impending marital split to avoid traumatizing their young child. Connolly's version "<a href="../../../d/2E/i/D.I.V.O.R.C.E._95fb.html" title="D.I.V.O.R.C.E.">D.I.V.O.R.C.E.</a>", on the other hand, played off of the fact that many dog owners use the same tactic when they do not wish their pet to become upset about an impending trip to the <a href="../../../v/e/t/Veterinarian.html" title="Veterinarian">veterinarian</a>. <i>His</i> song is about a couple whose marriage is ruined by a bad vet visit (spelling out "W.O.R.M." or "Q.U.A.R.A.N.T.I.N.E.", for example.)</p>
<p>His song "No Chance" was a parody of J.J. Barrie's "No Charge".</p>
<p>In 1985 he sang the theme song to <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Supergran.html" title="Supergran">Supergran</a></i>, which was released as a single and in 1996 he performed a cover of <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_McTell_fbfd.html" title="Ralph McTell">Ralph McTell</a>'s <i>In The Dreamtime</i> as the theme to his <i>World Tour of Australia</i>. By the late 1980s, Connolly had all but dropped the music from his act, though he still records the occasional musical performance. In 1998 he covered <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles'</a> "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite" on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Martin_fbf9.html" title="George Martin">George Martin</a> tribute, <i>In My Life</i> and he also recorded a rewritten version of <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alanis_Morissette_39bf.html" title="Alanis Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a>'s "Hand in My Pocket" entitled "The Evil Scotsman". Most recently, he sang a song during the film <i><a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemony_Snicket%27s_A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events_dd75.html" title="Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events">Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></i>.</p>
<p>Connolly is among the artists featured on <i>Banjoman</i>, a tribute to American folk musician <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derroll_Adams_6a12.html" title="Derroll Adams">Derroll Adams</a>, released in 2002. He plays one song, "The Rock".</p>

<p>It is as a stand-up comedian that Connolly is best known. His <a href="../../../o/b/s/Observational_comedy.html" title="Observational comedy">observational comedy</a> is <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiosyncratic.html" title="Idiosyncratic">idiosyncratic</a> and often off-the-cuff. He talks about himself, who he is, where he's been, what he thinks and how he reacts to the world around him. He has outraged audiences, critics and, of course, the media with his free use of the word "<a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>". He has used <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasphemy.html" title="Blasphemy">blasphemy</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defecation.html" title="Defecation">defecation</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatulence.html" title="Flatulence">flatulence</a>, sex, his father's illness and his aunts' cruelty to entertain. By exploring these subjects with humour, Connolly has done much to strip away the taboos surrounding them. Yet he does not tell jokes in the conventional way. At the end of a concert the audience can be convulsed with laughter, though few can remember a specific "funny" line.</p>
<p>One of Connolly's most famous comedy routines is <i>The Crucifixion</i>, a 1973 live recording produced by Nat Joseph in which he likened <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ.html" title="Christ">Christ</a>'s <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Supper_561f.html" title="Last Supper">Last Supper</a> to a drunken night out in <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>. The recording was banned by many radio stations at the time. Around this same time, a joke told during a television talk show appearance (about a murderer and his <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycle.html" title="Bicycle">bike</a>) became a sensation that, reportedly, people still remember three decades after the appearance. (A transcript of the complete joke can be found <a href="http://www.joebattsarm.com/connolly/welly.html" class="external text" title="http://www.joebattsarm.com/connolly/welly.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)</p>

<p>On one of his appearances on <i>Parkinson</i>, the host put it to Connolly that it was his talent that was responsible for his success. The comedian responded:</p>

The host, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Kenny_a890.html" title="Pat Kenny">Pat Kenny</a>, was trying to coax Connolly into reproducing a funny line he had read in <i>Bravemouth</i> about his knowledge of an organism that lives on a human eyelid that has two penises. Kenny asked Connolly, "What was it called?", to which Connolly replied, "Some Latin name that I can't remember." Stephenson then interrupted, "But the translation means <i>lucky bastard</i>, right?" Connolly broke down in a fit of laughter. When he complimented his wife on the line, she had to remind him that it was his own work.</li>
<li>Connolly is a lifelong supporter of Glasgow-based <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> team, <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_F.C._6309.html" title="Celtic F.C.">Celtic</a>, and is often seen at their home games.</li>
