<ul>
<li>Intro sentence makes it sound as if "bilingual education teaches children to become bilingual"</li>
<li>Most so-called bilingual education, in the U.S., places a higher priority on (a) preventing schoolchildren from falling behind their mainstream peers than on (b) helping them to become bilingual</li>
<li>The article doesn't address the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_assimilation.html" title="Cultural assimilation">cultural assimilation</a> issue: some educators want immigrants' children to assimilate into their host culture ("We are wonderful, you should become one of us!"); others actively <b>oppose</b> such assimilation ("Why should we give up our Hispanic (or fill in the blankian) heritage just to fit in?")</li>
<li>Much terminology is unclear or ambiguous (this might be intentional on the part of advocates)</li>
</ul>
<p>I began the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native-language_instruction.html" title="Native-language instruction">native-language instruction</a> article partly as a way of starting afresh. But much more work remains to be done. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">--user:Ed Poor</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 19:44, Dec 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBilingual_education_b498.html" title="Edit section: US info">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">US info</span></h2>
<p>First of all, the second sentence of the first paragraph is a badly chopped version of the <a href="http://www.helpforschools.com/ELLKBase/legal/Definition_LEP.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.helpforschools.com/ELLKBase/legal/Definition_LEP.shtml" rel="nofollow">federal definition</a>. Going by the definition in the article as long as a person's first language was other than English they would be considered LEP no matter how proficient they were in English. Wrong. A better definition would be:</p>
<p>The term ‘limited English proficient’, when used with respect to an individual, means an individual whose primary language is other than English and whose difficulties in speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language may be sufficient to deny the individual the ability to successfully achieve in classrooms where the language of instruction is English or the opportunity to participate fully in society.</p>
<p>I would also add that while the term used in the law is still "limited English proficient" in schools these students are more commonly referred to as "English language learners" or "language minority students"."</p>
<p>In the second paragraph "between immigrating and mastering English" assumes that the LEP child is an immigrant. Part of the official definition that was left out in the first paragraph is "who is a Native American or Alaska Native, or a native resident of the outlying areas." This reflects the fact that not all LEP students are immigrants. I would suggest the sentence be changed to "falling behind their peers while they master English." Also in the same paragraph the politicking isn't limited to California and if you're going to mention Proposition 227 at all a much clearer explanation is needed.</p>
<p>In the third paragraph what you are calling an 'immersion program' is really known as an 'English as a Second Language' or ESL program. An 'immersion program' throws the LEP child into a mainstream classroom with no help. By the way, it was also made illegal by the Supreme Court case Lau vs. Nichols in 1974. Jumping down to the fifth paragraph another type of program is described, but never named. A program where half the students are English speakers and half the students are LEP is called 'dual immersion' and the dual purpose is to teach <b>both groups of children</b> a new language and to let them learn about <b>one another's cultures</b>.</p>
<p>Is the final paragraph really talking about bilingual education at all as defined in the rest of the article? While I was unable to find the article on oregonlive.com that it refers to, it seems to me it is describing a second language program for English speakers and not a bilingual program for LEP students. While the goal of the program is to make the English speakers bilingual, it would still be considered a second language program and not a bilingual program as previously defined in the article. --TKeefer 13:01, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have added a few lines about bilingual education in Australia, added to the list of references, included a few more external web links, and put the various country examples in alphabetical order. --BDevlin, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The first sentence under United States is unsubstantiated. The only source is a preschool! There needs to be more hard facts. Until they are provided, the first sentance and the source shall be eliminated.</p>

<p>Bilingual education for little kids are quite common all over the world. Why is the article concentrated on USA? -- <a href="../../../w/s/h/User%7EWshun_5beb.html" title="User:Wshun">Wshun</a></p>

<p>I have added a few lines to summarise the Southeast Asian situation as I know it, focussing on Thailand and Malaysia. I would be pleased to know if there are any inaccuracies and for additional information to be provided.</p>
<p>-- A M Jones 9 August 2006</p>
<p>Multiple languages are taught in other countries, e.g., <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catalan_language.html" title="Catalan language">Catalan</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> taught in Spain. Does anyone know further about this, and want to add to this discussion? How is French imparted to its sizable Arabic speaking population? <a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDogru144_d5a8.html" title="User:Dogru144">Dogru144</a> 00:38, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A *lot* of examples from around the world could be added. Noting for instance the absence of mention of Africa, India, and China, a large proportion of the world is omitted. Discussions of bilingual ed in the US have become highly politicized (relating to issues sometimes far from education), and discussions there might seem to the outsider to be rather self-contained. This article could help expand the consideration - perhaps including more comparative references, or even spawning a section of articles. --<a href="../../../a/1/2/User%7EA12n_b0f6.html" title="User:A12n">A12n</a> 13:43, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This paragraph is repeated elsewhere on Wikipedia at Plurilingualism Promotion Plan and Plan for the promotion of plurilingualism in Andalusia; also the style is rather too personal.

<p>I put the {{<a href="../../../g/l/o/Template%7EGlobalize_49bb.html" title="Template:Globalize">globalize</a>}} template in, because the entire article is written from a U.S. viewpoint. It starts out with examples and information about bilingual education in the U.S., then has a section "Around the world", which further emphasizes the viewpoint of "U.S. and the rest of the world". The article needs to be rewritten from scratch, or heavily restructured. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Harald_S%C3%B8by_4866.html" title="User:Jon Harald Søby">Jon</a> <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJon_Harald_S%C3%B8by_2146.html" title="User talk:Jon Harald Søby">Harald</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jon_Harald_S%C3%B8by" class="extiw" title="m:User:Jon_Harald_Søby">Søby</a> 17:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
