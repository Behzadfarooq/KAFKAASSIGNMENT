<p><b>William Edward Wagner</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_25.html" title="July 25">July 25</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> in <a href="../../../t/a/z/Tazewell_County%2C_Virginia_d2e7.html" title="Tazewell County, Virginia">Tannersville</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>) is an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closer.html" title="Closer">closer</a> for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Mets_19ff.html" title="New York Mets">New York Mets</a>. Previously, Wagner pitched for the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> (2004-2005) and the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Astros_ddc6.html" title="Houston Astros">Houston Astros</a> (1995-2003). He bats and throws <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-handed.html" title="Left-handed">left-handed</a>. He is known for his exceptional <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fastball.html" title="Fastball">fastball</a>, which is routinely measured around, and occasionally even exceeding, 100 MPH.</p>
<p>As a youth, Wagner was a natural <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-handed.html" title="Right-handed">right-handed</a> <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcher.html" title="Pitcher">pitcher</a>, but after breaking his throwing arm twice, he taught himself how to use his left arm by throwing nothing but fastballs against a barn wall. He graduated from <a href="../../../t/a/z/Tazewell_High_School_9cdb.html" title="Tazewell High School">Tazewell High School</a>, where he was named the 1990 Baseball Player of the Year. He also attended <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferrum_College_f4dd.html" title="Ferrum College">Ferrum College</a> in <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> and went 17-3 there, while setting single season <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> records for <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strikeouts_per_nine_innings.html" title="Strikeouts per nine innings">strikeouts per nine innings</a> (19.1 in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>) and fewest <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hits_per_nine_innings.html" title="Hits per nine innings">hits per nine innings</a> allowed (1.58 in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>), and holds the <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_III_0582.html" title="Division III">Division III</a> mark for career strikeouts (327 in 182.1 innings pitched). Wagner was inducted into the Salem-Roanoke Baseball Hall of Fame in <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salem%2C_Virginia_aa03.html" title="Salem, Virginia">Salem, Virginia</a>, in February of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>.</p>
<p>Wagner was selected in the first round of the June <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993_in_baseball.html" title="1993 in baseball">1993</a> Major League Baseball draft by the Houston Astros, and was used exclusively as a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starting_pitcher.html" title="Starting pitcher">starting pitcher</a> in the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_league_baseball.html" title="Minor league baseball">minor leagues</a>. He made his major league debut on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_13.html" title="September 13">September 13</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995_in_sports.html" title="1995 in sports">1995</a>, retiring the only batter he faced in a 10-5 defeat against the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Mets_19ff.html" title="New York Mets">Mets</a>. It was his only appearance during that season.</p>
<p>Wagner began <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a> in the minors as a starter, and finished it by becoming a major league reliever. He posted a 6-2 record with a 3.28 <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earned_run_average.html" title="Earned run average">ERA</a> in twelve starts for Triple-A <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tucson_Toros_b528.html" title="Tucson Toros">Tucson</a>. His contract was purchased by the Astros on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_2.html" title="June 2">June 2</a>, and Wagner was immediately converted to a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relief_pitcher.html" title="Relief pitcher">reliever</a>. He finished the year with nine <a href="../../../s/a/v/Save_%28baseball_statistics%29.html" title="Save (baseball statistics)">saves</a> in 13 opportunities, allowed only 28 hits and struck out 67 hitters in 51.2 innings (11.7 SO/9). Opponents hit only .165 against him.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1997_in_baseball.html" title="1997 in baseball">1997</a>, Wagner played his first full season in the majors. He converted 23 of 29 save opportunities while striking out 106 hitters in only 66.1 innings, which established a major league record for SO/9 at 14.4, breaking the old mark of 14.1 set by former <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Reds</a> reliever <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Dibble_48f2.html" title="Rob Dibble">Rob Dibble</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992_in_baseball.html" title="1992 in baseball">1992</a> (110 SO in 70.1 innings). He struck out the side 13 times, and his 106 strikeouts also set a club record for relievers.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998_in_baseball.html" title="1998 in baseball">1998</a>, Wagner posted a 4-3 record with a 2.70 ERA and 97 strikeouts in 60 innings, and saved 30 games, which was the third best single season in club history. He converted 19 consecutive save opportunities between his first blown save against the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Dodgers_bc90.html" title="Los Angeles Dodgers">Dodgers</a> (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">April 12</a>) and his second facing the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Cardinals_d4bc.html" title="St. Louis Cardinals">Cardinals</a> (<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_11.html" title="July 11">July 11</a>). On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">July 15</a>, while trying to hold on to an 8-7 lead against <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona_Diamondbacks_a0bb.html" title="Arizona Diamondbacks">Arizona</a>, he was struck on the left side of his head behind the ear by a line drive off the bat of <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelly_Stinnett_edc9.html" title="Kelly Stinnett">Kelly Stinnett</a>. Wagner was alert and conscious on the ground as his vital signs remained good. He was removed from the field on a stretcher after suffering a concussion and spent the night at a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix%2C_Arizona_97f7.html" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix</a> hospital. The next day, he returned to <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston.html" title="Houston">Houston</a> and was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Wagner worked on balanced and coordination exercises before being cleared by doctors to go on a rehabilitation assignment in the minors. After working three games, he was recalled on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_6.html" title="August 6">August 6</a>, and remained healthy for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>Wagner had an outstanding <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999_in_sports.html" title="1999 in sports">1999</a> season. He captured the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolaids_Relief_Man_of_the_Year_d00e.html" title="Rolaids Relief Man of the Year">Relief Man of the Year Award</a> in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_League_1c21.html" title="National League">National League</a>. He saved 39 games and struck out 124 in only 74 innings (15 SO/9), establishing a new major league record for strikeouts in at least 50 innings, including the side 15 times. Wagner posted a 4-1 record with an ERA of 1.57, and actually had more saves than hits allowed (in 74.2 innings, he allowed 35 hits).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_in_baseball.html" title="2000 in baseball">2000</a> season started off in typical fashion for Wagner, who saved three of the Astros' first four wins while retiring 16 of the first 20 batters he faced. But after recording a save on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">May 4</a> against the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Cubs_c37b.html" title="Chicago Cubs">Cubs</a>, he suffered back-to-back blown saves on May 12-13 versus the Reds. While he was still hitting 100-MPH on the radar gun, he wasn't throwing his 85-90 MPH <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slider.html" title="Slider">slider</a> as much as he used to. Wagner would continue to struggle before going on the disabled with a torn flexor tendon in his pitching arm and would miss the final three and a half months of the season. He finished with 2-4 record, a 6.18 ERA, and six saves in 15 opportunities, striking out 28 and <a href="../../../b/a/s/Base_on_balls.html" title="Base on balls">walking</a> 18 in 27.2 innings. He would rebound in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001_in_baseball.html" title="2001 in baseball">2001</a>. Coming off elbow surgery, he posted a record of 2-5 with 39 saves in 41 chances, and an ERA of 2.73. He was one of the leading candidates for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sporting_News_Comeback_Player_of_the_Year_Award_a146.html" title="The Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award"><i>TSN</i> Comeback Player of the Year</a> in the National League. In 62.2 innings, he struck out 79 hitters.</p>

</div>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002_in_baseball.html" title="2002 in baseball">2002</a>, Wagner went 4-2 with a 2.52 ERA, 88 strikeouts, and 35 saves in 75 innings. Then, he enjoyed his best season in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_in_sports.html" title="2003 in sports">2003</a>, when he reached career-highs in saves (44), innings pitched (86.0) and games (78), and got 105 strikeouts. In that year, he also cemented his status as the hardest-throwing man in baseball by leading the <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">major leagues</a> with 159 pitches at 100 <a href="../../../m/p/h/Mph.html" title="Mph">mph</a> or above. Second on the list was starter <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bartolo_Colon_b102.html" title="Bartolo Colon">Bartolo Colon</a> with 12.</p>
<p>Wagner was traded to Philadelphia before the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_in_baseball.html" title="2004 in baseball">2004</a> season, only to have his season shortened by a strain in his throwing shoulder. Wagner became a free agent after the 2005 season. He signed a 4 year, $43 million contract (including a team option for a 5th year) with the Mets on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_28.html" title="November 28">November 28</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_7.html" title="May 7">May 7</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> interview, Wagner stated that he was confronted by all of his former <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Phillies_8565.html" title="Philadelphia Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> teammates in September 2005 after Wagner criticized their performance in the media by repeatedly saying that the Phillies had "no chance" of making the playoffs, with Phillies left fielder <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Burrell_f129.html" title="Pat Burrell">Pat Burrell</a> reportedly calling Wagner a "rat." The confrontation reportedly was one of several factors that drove Wagner from Philadelphia in the 2005-06 offseason. Upon his return to Philadelphia as a New York Met, a number of Phillies fans booed him and called him a traitor. Wagner pitched very well against Philadelphia in the 2006 regular season however, posting a 0.00 <a href="../../../e/r/a/ERA_7431.html" title="ERA">ERA</a> with four <a href="../../../s/a/v/Saves.html" title="Saves">saves</a> in 7 games against his former club while leading the New York Mets to the NL East Division Championship.</p>
<p>Although Wagner is known for stellar relief, like all major league pitchers he too has his bad days. On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_20.html" title="May 20">May 20</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, he gave up a 4-0 lead against the Yankees in the 9th inning, recording only one out. The Yankees tied the game in the ninth, and scored the winning run in extra innings.</p>
<p>On Opening Day of 2006, Wagner's entrance in the ninth inning was accompanied by his long-time theme song, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metallica.html" title="Metallica">Metallica's</a> "<a href="../../../e/n/t/Enter_Sandman_b89f.html" title="Enter Sandman">Enter Sandman</a>". This was notable because <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> reliever <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariano_Rivera_a9af.html" title="Mariano Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> also used the same song as his <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_baseball_entrance_music.html" title="List of baseball entrance music">entrance music</a>, although Rivera only started using it years after Wagner did. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/sports/baseball/05mets.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/sports/baseball/05mets.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Wagner recorded his milestone 300th career save on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> against the <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Pirates_22c6.html" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>.</p>
<p>In a twelve-year career, Wagner has compiled a 37-34 record with 934 strikeouts, a 2.38 ERA, and 324 saves in 702 2/3 innings.</p>
