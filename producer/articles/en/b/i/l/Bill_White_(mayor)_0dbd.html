<p>Born in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Antonio%2C_Texas_74ae.html" title="San Antonio, Texas">San Antonio</a> as the son of school teachers, White attended <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Legion_4a0e.html" title="American Legion">American Legion</a> scholarships and graduated <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magna_cum_laude.html" title="Magna cum laude">magna cum laude</a> with a degree in economics. He then attended <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Texas_School_of_Law_c8bd.html" title="University of Texas School of Law">The University of Texas School of Law</a>, where he was elected editor-in-chief of its law review and graduated with highest honors.</p>
<p>White began his career as a <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">lawyer</a> at Susman Godfrey, LLP, a leading Houston law firm, from 1979 to 1993, where he practiced business litigation and anti-trust law, and eventually became partner. He served as U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy under <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">President Clinton</a> from 1993 to 1995. He organized Frontera Resources, a developer of oil and gas in the Caspian Sea region, and was also the chairman of the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Democratic_Party_a3de.html" title="Texas Democratic Party">Texas Democratic Party</a>, from 1995 to 1998. He was the president and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_executive_officer.html" title="Chief executive officer">CEO</a> of WEDGE Group, an energy, construction and real estate company, from 1997 to 2004.</p>

<p>White has served on the board of directors for the North American Electrical Reliability Council. He was chairman for both the World Trade Division and the Environmental Advisory Committee, and served on the executive committee, for the Greater Houston Partnership. He has also served on the board of directors for the Houston Quality of Life Coalition.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28mayor%29_0dbd.html" title="Edit section: Mayor of Houston">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mayor of Houston</span></h2>
<p>In 2003, White, a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_Party_%28United_States%29_2333.html" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrat</a>, ran in Houston's officially nonpartisan mayoral election to succeed <a href="../../../t/e/r/Term_limit.html" title="Term limit">term-limited</a> Mayor <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_Brown_ad93.html" title="Lee Brown">Lee Brown</a>, who was the first African-American mayor of the city. Running as a moderate with business experience, he appealed to Democrats as well as many Republicans despite having almost no name recognition. In fact, White's television ads mainly consisted of a plain white background with himself in the middle of the screen and a black bar displaying info such as his campaign website in the lower third of the screen.</p>
<p>White faced off against Republican former Houston City Councilman Orlando Sanchez, a Cuban-American who unsuccessfully challenged Brown in a heated 2001 bid to become Houston's first Hispanic mayor, and black Democratic Texas State Representative Sylvester Turner, who also ran for mayor in 1991 (against then-incumbent <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathryn_J._Whitmire_95eb.html" title="Kathryn J. Whitmire">Kathy Whitmire</a> and real estate developer <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Lanier_%28politician%29_b982.html" title="Bob Lanier (politician)">Bob Lanier</a>) but was embroiled in an insurance scandal exposed in an investigation by Houston's <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> affiliate, <a href="../../../k/t/r/KTRK-TV_a402.html" title="KTRK-TV">KTRK-TV</a> that eventually led to a 1996 lawsuit. (Lanier went on to defeat Whitmire)</p>
<p>In the November election, White, along with Sanchez, defeated Turner. In the runoff, White defeated Sanchez with 63 percent of the vote.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28mayor%29_0dbd.html" title="Edit section: First term (2003-2004)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First term (2003-2004)</span></h3>
<p>As mayor, White used his business-like approach to government to guide the city through some of its biggest events, including <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_7703.html" title="Super Bowl XXXVIII">Super Bowl XXXVIII</a>, the 2004 MLB All-Star Game, the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_World_Series_dd89.html" title="2005 World Series">2005 World Series</a>, and the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_NBA_All-Star_Game_c521.html" title="2006 NBA All-Star Game">2006 NBA All-Star Game</a>. In addition, White also began a local recycling campaign known as "Stop Trashing Houston" and received local and national praise for his hands-on management style when he helped lead Houston during the aftermath of <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, which brought in thousands of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana_f945.html" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a> residents displaced by the storm, and the evacuation of <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Rita_540c.html" title="Hurricane Rita">Hurricane Rita</a>, which while sparing the city, clogged its major thoroughfares and led to a massive reform of disaster preparedness and evacuation policies.</p>
<p>Other hallmarks of White's leadership included dealing with neighborhood water sewage, a reform of the city's pension fund, cutting property tax rates, and pinpointing areas of high crime to curb criminal activity. White also initiated a "Safe Clear" program that called for the immediate removal of stalled vehicles on Houston freeways, eliminating the possibility of car wrecks and traffic blockages.</p>
<p><a name="Second_term" id="Second_term"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28mayor%29_0dbd.html" title="Edit section: Second term">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second term</span></h3>
<p>In 2005, White was challenged for re-election by minor and perennial candidates and won re-election with 91 percent of the vote (a record landslide since Mayor <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Lanier_%28politician%29_b982.html" title="Bob Lanier (politician)">Bob Lanier's</a> re-election in 1995), preventing the need for a runoff.</p>
<p>During his second term, White focused his work on improving graduation rates in the city's high schools, enforcing air pollution standards, reducing the possibility of flooding in newer areas, adopted a more flexible system of working hours, and capitalized even further on his business experience to create public-private initiatives with private business and community organizations to stimulate growth in the city's most neglected subdivisions.</p>
<p>Crime became a serious concern as Hurricane Katrina evacuees played a major role in a citywide crime wave concentrated around inner and southern neighborhoods of the city, where evacuees were not only crime victims, but were suspects themselves. For example, Houston's murder rate has increased to its highest level in over a decade, which is no surprise given that New Orleans, one of the most dangerous cities in the nation before Katrina, is known for its high murder rate.</p>
<p>Immigration also became a concern in the city during White's second term after federal legislation was proposed regarding illegal immigration. This especially became a hot topic after a Houston police officer was killed in the line of duty by a Mexican national who was not questioned by police in regards to his immigration status; this controversial practice is known as a "sanctuary" law.</p>
<p>In 2006, White proposed a series of eight city propositions aimed at improving infrastructure and putting more police officers on duty, among other things, without a tax increase. All eight city propositions passed in a November 2006 election.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_White_%28mayor%29_0dbd.html" title="Edit section: Political future">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political future</span></h3>
<p>Seen as one of the most popular and influential mayors in Houston history, White is being considered as a possible candidate for the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senate_2092.html" title="U.S. Senate">U.S. Senate</a> in 2008 against incumbent Republican <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Cornyn_4514.html" title="John Cornyn">John Cornyn</a>, whose popularity has been surprisingly modest among Texas' strongly Republican political base. Cornyn , a strong ally of President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, is also being rumored to have ties to convicted lobbyist <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Abramoff_37c3.html" title="Jack Abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a>, who also has connections to ex-Congressman and former House Majority Leader <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_DeLay_86e9.html" title="Tom DeLay">Tom DeLay</a>.</p>
<p>White is also being mentioned as a leading candidate for <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_Texas_3876.html" title="Governor of Texas">Governor of Texas</a> in 2010, when Republican <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Perry_3a83.html" title="Rick Perry">Rick Perry</a> is next up for re-election. While the Governor's Mansion in Texas has no term limits, conventional wisdom indicates that Perry is unlikely to consider another term for Governor. Should White run in that election, he would likely face another candidate, such as Lieutenant Governor <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Dewhurst_2e25.html" title="David Dewhurst">David Dewhurst</a>, US Senator <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kay_Bailey_Hutchison_2c55.html" title="Kay Bailey Hutchison">Kay Bailey Hutchison</a>, or State Senator Dan Patrick.</p>
