<p>My life is an interesting one. I'm 16 years old witout a licence. I live in no where, Iowa (Eldora). I'm about 5'10 <i>tall and weigh about 160lbs. I'm a football player who runs cross country. A Prep thats a little bit Emo.... I'm an A student and a 4 sport athlete. And I'm not happy with myself. I have two Lawyer parents that i can't ever please. A sister in Yale that i have to try to live up to. And annother sister thats a collegate golfer. And even though I'm second in my class and have a 3.9, Have two varsity letters halfway through my sophomore year, am the class president, and I am part of the minority that doesn't drink, smoke, or chew. Its never enough. If I have a girlfriend, she is never good enough but i hope that somewhere out there there is a girl that i will be happy with. I've spent most of my life thus far waisting it in the pursuit of a girl that really isnt that great. I've done most everything for her; the reason i'm in music, and cross country,to name a few, even though i had a big football carrier ahead of me. The ironic thing about it is that i've been with most of the girls in our school but the one i want is the one that i've never been with. I dont know if i wanted her so much because i couldnt have her or if i really liked her that much to be able to like her from grade school on. I know her better then i know myself. When i cut myself before freshman year she is the one that i would call. She is the one who told my parents about my problem. She was my best friend. But she wasnt interested in more than that and i couldnt stand being friends when thats not what i wanted. Its like being traped starving in a cage and just outta your reach is a plate full of delicious food, your favorite. but you cant have it and you have to look at it day after day and i couldnt take it anymore and said that i didnt want to be friends anymore. She didnt like that idea and couldnt understand where i was coming from. so were still friends kinda... but know she's dating someone and we arent really close at all. Its kinda unfortunate what happened. i honestly think that if i had ever dated her even if i didnt really work out i wouldnt be tied to her like i am. she has like chains that hold me back from other relationships. but now that we arent talking at all, i think that i might be able to get something going. but there is one small problem of me not having a licence. being that most of the girls in my school r dating someone else, my x-fling, or i wouldnt date. i have to venture outta town for love. But i cant drive. i had a good thing going with one girl when i was 15 and still thought i would get my licence in a month or so but then i got a ticket and its kinda faded then was starting to get going again but being that she was the one that kinda put things on hault i assumed that us talking again was just her playing with me so i kept open to new ideas. so i had a friend well not so much a friend but an aquatance have me add a girl on myspace and normally i don't really do that, but he was kinda seeing someonen from there and she had a friend so i thought that it wouldnt really work but i'll give it a shot.... so i started talkign to her. and i called her probably just once. i think i added her on wednesday and then we went to visit them on saturday and we just hit it off... normally when your around someoen that you dont know that well it can be kinda akward and theres nervous in your voice. well with us there wasnt any and we've hung out a few times most weekends for about a month now and its been good mostly. But she is 18 and a senior so there are advantages and disadvantages to that. driving is a plus, but she's a senior so she's going to college next year. but i dont like to think about those things ahead of time. well i gotta go for now. i'll continue later, and add names so it isnt so confusing.</i></p>
