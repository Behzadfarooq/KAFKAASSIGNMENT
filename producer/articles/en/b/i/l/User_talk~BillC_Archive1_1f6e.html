<p>Hey, thanks for catching the potential copyright problem at this page. Nice work! --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 23:43, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, if you're interested, you can check out <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>. The instructions there are much simpler to follow than votes for deletion, if you've ever tried processing VFDs. On the very odd occasion when I first started, I've encountered other users complaining about these things being handled incorrectly by me, but I sort of shrug it off and think there's a first for everything and try to learn from it. At times I find it really enjoyable to combat copyright problems and vandalism of sorts on Wikipedia, and it only takes practise to do it well. If you want to dabble in this sort of stuff just make sure along the way you don't get burned out, and you'll do fine&#160;:) Thanks for those links - I'll process them right away! --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 00:10, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree that it would be useful to get rid of the disputes and opinionated rambling in the article. Doing this, however, does not necessarilly require getting rid of detail. It should be quite possible to have extensive encyclopedic detail about a topic without having POV pushing occur, it just requires some restraint placed on those who want to push a POV. In this case, this should probably be done by gaining a consensus among the other editors. I also think that the article replacement needs to have sufficient detail within it to warrant a full replacement of the original article. It should probably even have a summary description of the points regarding the experiment which were subject to critical debate, I just think this should be written by someone who can write it in a neutral way which simply describes the areas disputed, rather than tries to persuade that opinions are correct. <a href="../../../f/r/j/User%7EFRJohn_ba1e.html" title="User:FRJohn">FRJohn</a> 20:44, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The statistical analysis is essential, because most people have no intuition for the statistical likelihood or unlikelihood of getting a result. Many people have intuitions that place "half right" as the typical value, so they think someone would get 3 or 4 right just by guessing. But this is quite wrong, as shown by the math, where the actual expectation value is 1 correct. It is important to specify this as part of any meaningful description of that test design. After all, the goal here is to write an informative encyclopedia entry which can help readers make their own decisions, rather than to placate the agendas of people involved with a situation. As such, the reader needs to be given the knowledge necessary to make those decisions. I believe this includes a detail of how likely each result is, as well as a description of the major points of criticism regarding the experimental setup. Then the readers are equipped with the necessary information to make their own informed decisions about how to interpret the events, rather than being fed an answer. <a href="../../../f/r/j/User%7EFRJohn_ba1e.html" title="User:FRJohn">FRJohn</a> 20:58, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One group of people think the test is valid, one group of people think the test is invalid, and of course, an additional much larger group do not know if it is valid. If the test is valid, the statistical analysis tells exactly how to interpret it. If the test is invalid, or dubious, then it is invalid or dubious. Since the test WAS performed, the proper approach is to explain how to interpret the results if you assume it is valid, and to explain what the major criticisms are which question its validity. The statistical analysis is fact because that IS how you interpret such a test if it is valid. The problem is, the article has been focusing on a banter back and forth between whether or not she has an ability, and reads like a playground argument. So the solution is simply to equip the reader with the available information, and then not try to interpret whether or not Natasha Demkina has any ability. This requires editors who are determined to demonstrate to the world that Natasha Demkina does or does not have any ability, to either change their editing habits, or refrain from editing the article. Unfortunately, there will not be a resolution until one of those two occurs, and I'm afraid that you and I will not be able to hammer out a lasting solution until something is changed with the combating editors. The article will simply expand with time and each side will keep trying to prove their point to the world. Wikipedia does not work well when this occurs. I don't believe that removing all relevant information will provide a solution. <a href="../../../f/r/j/User%7EFRJohn_ba1e.html" title="User:FRJohn">FRJohn</a> 22:54, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello BillC,</p>
<p>Thanks very much for the message. All the copyright and related information to Weeze is okay for use in wikipedia, because I work in the Town Hall in Weeze in Germany and am responsible for the PR-stuff, whether on the internet or other media. I have personally translated all the german texts into english and am also responsible for the photos which I placed on the weeze-wikipedia-website. In the rush to get the information placed on the site, I made the mistake of not always logging on! Sorry. The German and English websites (which I also linked) - to include information on Weeze's twin-town Watton has also been cleared for use by me because it is also on the Weeze website - were my doing and as such I would be grateful if you would release them for public viewing again. Thanks very much. Khalid Rashid 12:57, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello Bill, Thanks for the response and the information. Once again I would like you to know that I am responsible for the content of the information provided on the Municipality of Weeze website and as such have my employer's approval for the use of the contents contained on this site. However, I will take your advice and try to improve upon copyright and tone issues. The text on the twin-town of Watton will also be improved. So give me a couple of days to sort things out. This was my first venture into wikipedia and I am more than willing to learn as to how to use wikipedia. And sensible advice from some one with experience in wikipedia is more than welcome. Therefore thanks for the tips. 194.77.253.245 07:29, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The SVG format is harder to create but it works much better: PNG is a bitmap, with a limited definition, while SVG draws pictures using vectors. It has a higher quality and it needs a very small space.</p>
<p>Make this test. Put the following code wherever you want (in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">Wikipedia:Sandbox</a>, for example):</p>
<p>[[Image:Single-phase_transformer.png|1000px]] [[Image:Single-phase_transformer.svg|1000px]]</p>

If you can't, I'll try to do it when I have some time.</p>

<dd>Sorry, I can't help you that much. SVG is a new format, and its support within software is increasing, but it is still far from being stable and consistent. I have several programs supporting SVG, but they have different outputs one from the other. Moreover Wikipedia has its own engine, so you can't be sure of the output as long as you don't upload it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here is what I can suggest you to do. If you create an SVG image, make it consistent, with its own structure. For example, the idea of putting the subscripts manually won't work very good because the rendering engine (whichever you are using) doesn't know you want to make a subscript, so it will behave differently from what you expect. I don't know if SVG provides a way to write subscripts. When I had to write one, I just used Ns instead of N<sub>s</sub>. I know, it is not <i>exactly</i> the same thing but it works. Moreover I can't add Greek letters to any SVG, that is why I have been quite surprised to see a proper <span class="texhtml">Î¦</span> in your first graph. But then I realised you couldn't see it properly, so I think it is a problem within Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>About now, just publish the SVG version of the PNG you updated, then we'll be waiting for the Wikipedia engine to be improved. Report on the PNG page that there is an SVG version, too, and vice versa, maybe somebody else will note the problems and will find a way to fix them. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlejo2083_d4a3.html" title="User:Alejo2083">Alessio Damato</a> 15:02, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>about the arrow: it does not matter that much, as long as it is consistent with any mathematical formula within the document. There isn't any mathematical model for the Transformer in its page, but I might add it as soon as I have some free time. As you say in the featured images page, <i>conventionally, in a 'two-port network' as is shown here, current is defined as positive for flows into the device</i>; that is absolutely right. Since the encyclopedia has to be consistent, I think it is better to use the same conventions for all the two-port networks. Aesthetically the picture is not affected at all. About commons, since the second colored version looks better I suggest: upload the final version overwriting <a href="../../../t/r/a/Image%7ETransformer3d_col.svg_fc59.html" title="Image:Transformer3d col.svg">Image:Transformer3d_col.svg</a>, remove (or request it) <a href="../../../t/r/a/Image%7ETransformer3d_col3.svg_06e4.html" title="Image:Transformer3d col3.svg">Image:Transformer3d_col3.svg</a> because it will be just a copy, finally upload it in commons with the name <a href="../../../t/r/a/Image%7ETransformer3d_col.svg_fc59.html" title="Image:Transformer3d col.svg">Image:Transformer3d_col.svg</a>, using the same description. The wiki-engine will take care of the fact that the two images have the same name. It will create no problem at all.

<p>I have started a section on substation design and protection, and I would value your input on something. It is the Luton flashover and related matters.</p>
<p>The Luton flashover was interesting becuase what happened was that an arc from a HT conductor to earth occured. This short then caused circuit breakers to open becuase of the overcurrent. Too many protection devices were activated and then everything went to pot. The defense against such an overreaction in the event of such a fault which I was told about was that a substation has all 'earthed' metal work isolated from earth except for one cable which passes through a current transformer. If current is detected in the earth cable then the location of the fault is clear to the protection electronics. Hence with good design of the protection systems it is possible to open fewer circuit breakers then it would be otherwise. The problem is that I do not have the references to back up this design concept which I was told about some years ago by a substation expert.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a> 21:31, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What I do know about the Luton flashover is that it occured at a very large substation/switching station in Luton ( you can see it from the M1). The event started as a phase to earth arc/short. I do not know much more about the event, I do not know the date on which it occured. But I imagine that it was pre 1970s.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a> 22:18, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice, I do not think that the section was too UK centric. I have seen that some of the other parts of the world do things differently. eg I saw at a Czech substation that sheep can be used as a means of controlling the grass in one part of the compound (or somewhere to graze them) but I imagine that while the Czechs use different voltages for transmission lines (and different grass control) the basics of how the system works will be the same.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a> 00:58, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Bill, Thanks for your input on the subject of power outages. I have heard of quite a few cases of big outages which have started with small foul ups which then snowball into a big outage. Would you feel OK about improving the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_outage.html" title="Power outage">Power outage</a> page to explain more about the physics of how power grids can fail in this Cascade-based way.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a> 21:31, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bill!</p>
<p>To begin I would say that on my system, <a href="../../../3/-/p/Image%7E3-phase_flow.gif.html" title="Image:3-phase flow.gif">Image:3-phase flow.gif</a> runs pretty nicely - it doesn't seem jerky or anything to me. I'm not on a fancy system (Athlon XP 1500+ w/512Mb <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_1c6b.html" title="Windows XP">XP</a>/<a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefox.html" title="Firefox">FF</a>)</p>
<p>I put together that animation by making a solid model in <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocad.html" title="Autocad">Autocad</a>, animating it in <a href="../../../3/d/_/3d_studio_max.html" title="3d studio max">3d studio max</a>, exporting it as (if I remember correctly) an uncompressed AVI (functionally identical to a series of bitmap frames, just all in one file), then opening it in <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasc.html" title="Jasc">Jasc</a>'s Animation Shop (makers of <a href="../../../p/a/i/Paint_Shop_Pro_54dd.html" title="Paint Shop Pro">Paint Shop Pro</a>), which I used to compress it into an animated GIF.</p>
<p>Certainly, Animation Shop did some optimisation on it (mapping identical unchanged pixels to transparent, reducing number of colours) which might lead to better performance... as I say, though, I don't see a problem with your current animation. I could take a shot at recompressing yours for you if you're sure there's something wrong with it.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure whether the optimisation got lost anyway if/when the software resizes our images so I decided to have a look at what happens. Looking at the images to the right, I see mine broken and yours fine. Perhaps my map-identical-pixels-to-transparent causes the brokenness in my image - that would also fit with yours not having the same problems.</p>
<p>Incidentally I recently broke my installation of Jasc software so I've been trying Photoshop/ImageReady. I wasn't aware ImageReady did animated GIFs. I have investigated and it seems to do all the optimisations I used except for 'map identical pixels to transparent'. I would guess, then, that that is the optimisation making the difference between the two animations.</p>

<p>The variable transformer picture in the transformer article is actually a Superior Electric <i>Powerstat</i> rather than a General Radio or Instrument Services and Equipment <i>Variac</i>. Variac is certainly used extremely widely as a generic term, but is it ok to use it in the caption of the picture? -<a href="../../../c/_/j/User%7EC_J_Cowie_7c97.html" title="User:C J Cowie">C J Cowie</a> 00:45, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The General Radio trademark was cancelled in 2002. In 2004, Instrument Service Equipment Inc. submitted a new application to the US Patent and Trademark Office and is apparently about to be granted the trademark. In the practical sense, it must be fair to say that variac is a generic term. In the legal sense, that is apparently not the case. There might be an interesting story behind this, but I already feel foolish for looking this up. I would not be inclined to revise anything beyond the caption unless someone complains. -<a href="../../../c/_/j/User%7EC_J_Cowie_7c97.html" title="User:C J Cowie">C J Cowie</a> 02:07, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually, I rather like the edits to the page. And about the {globalize} tag, I always try to see things from the other persons perspective. If we can not admit out short falls and blind spots here than all we do is create the proper atmosphere for an edit war, and an edit war serves no real purpose.

<p>Hi Bill, I see some more improvements have been made to the page. It is really starting to take shape. I am very new to Wikipedia, so I'm still a little hesitant to contribute untill I understand the process fully. In saying that I did add a link to KCGLOBAL.ORG (Now I see that I should have discussed this first, sorry) I just felt that it has more international coverage and that it contains a wealth of data. This information covers both the standard and unconventional approuches to treatment. If you feel that there is already enough representation of public action groups then I'll gladly remove the link. Also, I'm gathering some information regarding Mini A.R.K that may be able to be used to give readers a little more insight to the procedure. I do not want to turn the article into a selling platform for the technique but I do feel, as do many others, that it is a valid operation that warrants inclusion. So the trick I guess is to provide the data in a raw non judgemental format and then allow readers to decide for themselves. In much the same way as corneal graft or the use of contact lenses are. --Hari 08:27, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the heads up. I checked the licensing before linking to the picture but didn't realize the need for a separate rationale for each article. In reviewing the info at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image_description_page.html#Fair_use_rationale" title="Image description page">Image_description_page#Fair_use_rationale</a>, I noticed that each usage of a fair use image should also have a comment in the article itself pointing to the rationale at the image description page.

<p>Hi BillC. Iâm not mediating the Natasha Demkia dispute, that would be difficult since Iâm on one side of the dispute. In the Cabal Mediation request, I agreed to serve as a mediator for another case, and have been assigned one. The mediator for my Natasha Demkina request is <a href="../../../r/o/h/User_talk%7ERohirok_f5ee.html" title="User talk:Rohirok">User_talk:Rohirok</a>. I guess the question on the request page looks like it might be asking if I am willing to mediate my own dispute, but if you check out the <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMediation_Cabal_1f7f.html#Making_a_request_for_assistance" title="WP:Mediation Cabal">Request for assistance</a> page, it explains the question a bit better. Unless I misunderstood your comments.</p>
<p>Perhaps my attitude on the Natasha talk page is wrong because Iâve offered to serve as a mediator in other disputes? I believe other mediators have withdrawn from mediating the Natasha dispute because of the aggressive approach of Mr. Skolnick, but Iâm not sure what the best route to take is. I just donât like being attacked, and would rather work with people who want to make an honest, civil effort to move the discussion forward. Mr. Skolnick doesnât seem to want to do that. If I had been mediating the Natasha case, I probably would have withdrawn by now - having become a target for Mr. Skolnick.</p>
<p>I respect your feedback, so if you think I need to answer Mr. Skolnickâs questions, please let me know. I donât feel that he is arguing in good faith, and seems to be continually on the attack. I'm awaiting mediation at this point. Iâm a fairly new user, so I may be completely wrong.</p>
<p>Besides, the talk page there is way too long already.&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> 16:27, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Bill, this time I got to the right place (thank you for the direction). So, as I said, it is nice that you corrected things and explained that you are not a wikipedia administrator, but only Skolnick's most helpful "friend"... You know that my position is that many times apple polishing serves no one. And the intances when you engaged in such questionable actions are clearly representative of it.

<p>Hi, with regard to the above AfD, I have been contacted by the article author, who was newly-registered, and told me she created the article under a misunderstanding about what WP was for. She was apologetic, very good-natured about it, and seemed to have acted in good faith. Given that the AfD vote is very one-sided, and that it is probably an embarrassment for her for it still to be up, is there any chance of this one getting closed off soon?

<dd>Hi there, if the author requested deletion, I suppose it could be tagged under <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#General" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">CSD G7</a>. Usually, the admin who deletes it would like to see the original author add the tag, or see the discussion by the author that led to its tagging. (Personally, I am unable to close an AfD of this nature, since I am not an administrator.)

<p>I think you've done an excellent job on presenting a very informative article. The front page is well overdue for a medically-oriented article, so I can't see why this one wouldn't be accepted. Although they probably wouldn't bother Wikipedia's target audience, I have one or two concerns that I'll attempt to bring up in the article's <a href="../../../k/e/r/Talk%7EKeratoconus_23b8.html" title="Talk:Keratoconus">talk</a> page. -<a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 03:47, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>RE: "harder to separate Signs from Diagnosis". I agree. I am not positive what <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Clinical_medicine_Template_for_medical_conditions_7f16.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/Template for medical conditions">Wikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/Template for medical conditions</a> has in mind. Books and articles vary on how they subcategorize the discussion of diseases. Some combine "signs and symptoms", other state "signs and diagnoses" or "signs and detection". To me, symptoms, signs, and diagnostic tests could all fall under "Diagnosis". I'll think about it a little more to see what may work best in <a href="../../../k/e/r/Keratoconus.html" title="Keratoconus">Keratoconus</a>. -<a href="../../../a/e/d/User%7EAED_76b1.html" title="User:AED">AED</a> 23:16, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let's clarify which ones we are talking about. Sudish and Medish are the only ones from this website.

<p>I would not normally be so quick to jump the gun, but the article has been previously deleted (speedily) one month ago.

<p>It is important to have an extensive listing of historical race scientists racial classification schemes, becuase it is shows classification is just an opinion. From the book <u>Race The History of an Idea in America</u>, there are records of race scientists disagreeing with each other. Historical race scientists disagreed with each other on who were included in what races and how many races existed. This does not make one historical race system more important than another. All racial classification schemes are important because they show there are no objective races. This is why every historical racial classification scheme is beneficial to have in an encylcopedia. --- <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 05:11, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You may have some kind of point here. Your listing of "racial scientists" is mirky in the extreme though, judging by the way you handle your sources. "<a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropologists.html" title="Anthropologists">Anthropologists</a>" or "<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnologists.html" title="Ethnologists">ethnologists</a>" would perhaps be a better choice of words (when it came from someone who sounded as if he knew what he was doing). As it stands you miss the point about racial science -admitted such a <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> exists.

<p>The primary reason why the Mongoloid page is very long is because it has a lot of opinions about the way different peoples look, representative pictures and it has genetic history of Asians near the bottom. If it was shortened to "Mongoloid is a term made by Carleton Coon in his book to include these peoples. The term is not used anymore and considered offensive because of its previous use to labele people with Down Syndrome" it would be as short as all the other race articles. Either the extra stuff should be added to all the other race stubs to make them comprable to the Mongoloid page or the Mongoloid page as well as the stubs should be merged with their respective race scientist. --- <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 06:22, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your message. The <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongoloid.html" title="Mongoloid">Mongoloid</a> article is 17kB; which makes it neither a long nor a short article. No-one, least of all <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukobe_9277.html" title="User:Lukobe">Lukobe</a> or I, is suggesting it be shortened. The reason why <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongoloid.html" title="Mongoloid">Mongoloid</a> is not 'as short as all the other race articles' you have created is because the topic has significance: the material is encylopaedic. <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wood_Eater_race_18c6.html" title="Wood Eater race">Wood Eater race</a>, at least in its present state, does not.

<p>No, the reason it is long is not because the "topic has significance", it's because there are a lot of opinions about how each group looks. If the Western American Temperate group had information about how they looked it would also be a long article.</p>
<p>The only reason why these articles lack incomming links is because until now everyone was convinced that Coon's system was the absolute truth. This caused all users to edit seamingly unrelated pages to conform with his system. For example, the Mexican page used to say they were New World Mongoloids to conform with Coon's system. I also could add in the American Indian page the that they are really the Tropical American race or I could add to the East India page that their real race is racially mixed or they are all their own race or part of the degenerative race.</p>
<p>They have the same context as Coon's system. They are historical races nobody believes in anymore.</p>
<p>They are significant because they prove that everyone disagreed on who was part of what race, but this statement is not needed on every page. --- <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 07:05, 24 April 2006 (UTC) Do you want me to add to every article that this race is important because it</p>

Q: gallery with the complete nuvola set?<br />

<p>probably they suit my "NEAT" project (for user templates). see my user page/news for this structure.</p>

<ul>
<li>it only includes high-power transformers (in improveable quality). they suit to put them in a gallery (except the one in the cooling section).</li>
<li>the analogy is not state-of-the-art.</li>
<li>it requires more data about other transformers (a section "appliance of transformers"). i added a few to "operation at different frequencies".</li>

<p>Oh, I don't mind the question at all. My belief is that a newbie who gets his edits reverted with a summary message of <i>rv</i>, <i>rvv</i>, <i>revert vandalism</i> or <i>Revert to revision dated 10:12, May 3, 2006 by XXX, oldid 51505322 using popups</i> does not teach him why it was reverted (unless he has done blatant vandalism). Thus, my reverts look similar to <i>Reverted to version as of 02:26, 6 May 2006, use consistent date formatting throughout an article per <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html#Incorrect_date_formats" title="WP:DATE">date formatting guidelines</a>.</i> This way, the newbie is able to click on the wikilink and learn more about this guideline. I have most, if not all, the guidelines for <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html" title="WP:DATE">WP:DATE</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSHEAD_020f.html" title="WP:MOSHEAD">WP:MOSHEAD</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/n/WP%7ESONG_9898.html" title="WP:SONG">WP:SONG</a>.</p>
<p>This appears as a combo box to one side or below the summary box (depending on screen resolution), with items like <i>WP:DATE No ordinal suffixes</i>, which once selected, replaces the summary with <i>XXX: do not use ordinal suffixes ('February 14th' or '14th February') per <a href="../../../d/a/t/WP%7EDATE_3c44.html#Incorrect_date_formats" title="WP:DATE">date formatting guidelines</a>.</i> If you are editing a previous version of the page, you get the "Reverted to version as of XXXXXX, do not use ordinal...". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wii&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51783492" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wii&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51783492" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> If you are editing the current version, "Clean up: do not use ordinal..." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mortal_Kombat_Trilogy&amp;diff=51106111&amp;oldid=51048135" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mortal_Kombat_Trilogy&amp;diff=51106111&amp;oldid=51048135" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Legend_of_Zelda&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51920383" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Legend_of_Zelda&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51920383" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Explanations are limited to around 160 characters including the wikilink.</p>
<p>I use this with Firefox in Windows and Linux with no problem, and I think it works correctly with IE as well.

<dd>I'll work on the observation section next, I think. I've found some interesting stuff about the Ashen Light, a phenomenon not mentioned at all in the current article - see <a href="http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2000JBAA..110..325B" class="external text" title="http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2000JBAA..110..325B" rel="nofollow">this paper</a>, for example.</dd>
<dd>As for peer review, I don't mind but I am not sure if it will be of much use to be honest. I find it works well when I'm not sure what else an article needs, but I feel in this case we will have already ensured comprehensiveness as we write it. If you copyedit my parts and I copyedit yours before we submit to FAC I think that would be more than sufficient. But, as I say, I don't mind a pass through peer review. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:39, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a>, I now have an account on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://test.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">test.wikipedia.org</a></span> with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_suggestions_a7f1.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/suggestions">suggestions</a> for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful.

<p>Thanks for your comments on my first draft. The line you quote as an example of the article being "heavy" with my POV is not mine, it is a quote from the cited critique of Professor Josephson. I presented both sides of the issue as best I could.</p>
<p>Siqueira and Zammit's sites are not used as citable references, but only as links included in the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html#Further_reading.2Fexternal_links" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Further Reading</a> section, which does not appear to require the same level of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> scrutiny as articles cited as References. From the way I (and others) read the Guideline, there is a distinct difference between Cited References and External Links/Further Reading. Further Reading provides space for <i>"..links to websites related to the topic that might be of interest to the reader, but which have not been used as sources for the article."</i></p>
<p>Feel free to improve on the article, such as adding criticism of the Japanese appearance. Everything I've written there I've provided sources for, so I'm unsure how it "falls short" of what would be acceptable. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreadlocke_8280.html" title="User:Dreadlocke">Dreadlocke</a> 22:59, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks BillC, I'll go through and attribute the quotes properly. I wasn't sure how much material I could actually take directly from another site, and in the "critique" section I didn't take the time to rewrite most of it as I did with the earlier material.

I sincerely hope you haven't taken any offence to my remarks on the issue of the appropriateness of the originally featured image, or thought that I was in any way belittling the medical condition or the quality of article and images. I have re-read my postings and am now worried that they may be misconstrued as flippant and dismissive. I was merely aiming to comment on my astonsihment at the furore that seemed to have erupted over the originally featured image which, in my view, is the one that best illustrates the article on the main page. I was also trying to inject a little bit of humour but, with this imperfect digital communication medium, I am now worried that this may have been taken wrongly. I hope that clears things up (if necessary).

<p>Hey, Bill. Congratulations, again! For medical conditions, I think the image is pretty tame.

<p>Well, we've filled all the sections and I've just added images to the bits I've done, so aesthetically I think it's looking excellent. Your 'in fiction' bit should be held up as a model of what these sections should be - so much better than the arbitrary list which is all too common. I think we could probably finish off the article by copyediting - how about I do the bits you wrote and you do mine? Once that's done I think we'll be ready for an FA nomination.</p>

<dd>I just made a slight adjustment to the intro, and I think it now summarises the article's content pretty well. If you feel like giving my parts a critical eye that would be great. Then I can go ahead and move all the content to the main article and merge the page histories. And then, I think we're about ready for an FAC nomination.

<dd>Well, I've taken the plunge: <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Venus_46f7.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Venus">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Venus</a>. I haven't merged the page histories - first of all because I've never done that before and I feared messing it up. Secondly, because of all the edits to Venus since we've been working on the temp page, I think it would have ended up being massively confusing, with revisions of the temp page and the main page appearing alternately in the history. So, what I've done is just copy and paste, and leave a note in the edit summary indicating where the history of the rewrite can be found. I could still merge the histories if that would be preferable.</dd>

<p>Yes, that would save a lot of time.&#160;:) One thing that would be nice would be to add the district navigational template at the bottom (adding {{Navigation bar XXXX district}}); however, many of the districts don't have that yet. If you feel so inclined, perhaps you could make a script to copy those from the de wikipedia. They should be in the category <a href="../../../../de/n/a/v/Vorlage%7ENavigationsleiste_Politische_Gemeinden_f8b6.html" class="extiw" title="de:Vorlage:Navigationsleiste_Politische_Gemeinden">de:Vorlage:Navigationsleiste Politische Gemeinden</a>, but unfortunately most of them have not been categorized. (The districts in a canton navigational boxes seem much more organized.) When you run it, be sure to keep a list of added municipalities somewhere, so that someone (hopefully not just me) can go through them and make them look less stubby or bot-generated by adding some facts from whichever interwiki versions exist. In the meantime, I'll work on other articles.<a href="../../../r/i/g/User%7ERigadoun_9ecb.html" title="User:Rigadoun">Rigadoun</a> 18:10, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So, will you just put all the text to be copied on a user subpage (or something), to be pasted into the articles as they get created? That solves the issue of the list. One other thing, is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Swiss_municipalities_6e3c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Swiss municipalities">Wikipedia:WikiProject Swiss municipalities</a> active?

<dd>I want to make sure I understand your stance on Pravda.RU for the limited material I've sourced from it. You and Mikka reject Pravda.RU as an âultimate sourceâ, but accept it for certain things. Things like the quote from Natashaâs mom: <i>âOverall,â her mother says, âshe was just a normal kid. Never was she able to see through humans!"</i> as well as the general outline of the trip to Japan. After all, thereâs no doubt that she went to Japan at the behest of Professor Machi, and that he proclaimed her to have passed his tests, right?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I said on the ND talk page, in no way is my intent to use Pravda.RU as a source equivalent to the CSICOP or Discovery Channel Documentary for scientific or qualitative purposes, but just as a general âoutlineâ of what happened. With the dearth of online information for that trip, I donât seem to have much choice, and it seems to fall well under the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Sources_of_dubious_reliability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">âtabloidâ</a> policy.
