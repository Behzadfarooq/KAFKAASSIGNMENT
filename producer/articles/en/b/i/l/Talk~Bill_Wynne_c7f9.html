<p>I did some research and the only thing that he is notable for is his dog. This needs to be drastically condensed. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 21:29, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is solid proof of all of Mr. Wynne's authentic history as detailed on this page. Most definitely, he is known for much more than his famous WWII dog, Smoky. He is one of only two non-engineers mentioned in the enitre published NASA Lewis Laborarory 50 yr History book. There is official proof of ALL photographic awards received by Mr. Wynne within the organizations that awarded the honors to him in addition to his having the actual awards. In September 2006 he will be inducted in the West Tech High School Hall of Fame based on his incredible and diverse life.</p>
<p>Sooo...if his notability is for his photography, that is fine. Regardless the article needs to be cleaned up so as to be readable. Also, some sources should be cited. Additionally, if the dog is notable in and of itself, shouldn't the dog have his own entry? Ladydayelle 19:32, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for your comments. Sources have been added. The info on Smoky, WWII Yorkshire Terrier has been removed and will be placed on her own page (entry). (mwd)</p>
<p>That helped but this article still reads more like a CV or lengthy resume rather than an encyclopedia article. It needs to be cleaned up so as to adhere to the Wikipedia Manual of Style. Ladydayelle 14:24, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you again "Ladydayelle" ~ still working on cleaning up the article... wanted to hit the main points first. Am currently rereading the Wikipedia Manual of Style and criteria for bios of living persons so the next changes conform. (mwd)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Wynne_c7f9.html" title="Edit section: Request for editing of the Flaming Mamie entry in the B-25 article">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Request for editing of the Flaming Mamie entry in the B-25 article</span></h2>
<p>Bill, I am reproducing the entry you have made in the Wikipedia article on the B-25. First of all, it is an interesting and relevant episode in the story of the B-25. However, there are two serious issues here. First, it could be construed as "original research" which would mean it would be automatically deleted from a Wikipedia "encyclopedic" article and secondly, it is just too lengthy a submission, compared to the rest of the article. It may be best edited down by yourself. The other method is to establish this story as a separate or sub-page to the main article which unfortunately removes it from the B-25 page. I have made some editing changes to your story, as well, but mainly to have it read more in a standard style that is used for Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>I think you could make the most cogent revisions since you know the story intimately:</p>
<p><a name="De-icing_tests" id="De-icing_tests"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Wynne_c7f9.html" title="Edit section: De-icing tests">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">De-icing tests</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942_in_aviation.html" title="1942 in aviation">1942</a>, two B-25Cs were converted to test aircraft in order to investigate de-icing and anti-icing equipment; these planes were redesignated XB-25E and XB-25F. The XB-25E (nicknamed "Flamin' Maimie") used engine exhaust gases circulated through chambers in the wing to melt ice. The XB-25F used insulated electrical coils to heat the metal surfaces. Both were tested extensively until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944_in_aviation.html" title="1944 in aviation">1944</a>; the XB-25E system was extremely reliable and more practical than the XB-25F system.</p>
<p>While the results of the tests on the XB-25E were promising, no aircraft during World War II was built to utilise that system, although it is commonly used today. Most propeller-driven planes used by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a> use so-called "piccolo tubes" that run along the leading edges of the wings. Hot air bled from the engines is blown through these tubes, and melts away any ice formations on the wings.</p>
<p>The further history of the XB-25F is unknown, but the sole XB-25E (<i>42-32281</i>) was crashed in a test program to develop fire extinguishing systems for aircraft. "Flaming Mamie" got her name from the fact that an engine caught fire every time they started it up. The nose art of the plane showed a mechanic in a winter flight jacket running away from a fire with a extinguisher in his hand.</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">I flew in "Flaming Mamie" on many Flight Icing Research missions from The Cleveland <a href="../../../n/a/c/NACA_11bb.html" title="NACA">NACA</a> Lewis Flight Propulsion Lab. between January 1947-50.
<dl>
<dd>I sat in the Navigator's seat to take photos in flight. The system used hot gases for heating the leading edges of the wings and tail sections. This method was invented by Lewis Rodert who won the Collier Trophy for this work. I was on her when we lost the starboard engine on takeoff and was safely brought down by pilots Howard Lilly and <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Walker_3871.html" title="Joe Walker">Joe Walker</a>, both later killed in flights in NACA/NASA planes at Muroc AFB; Lilly in the Douglas D-558-1 Skystreak and Walker in a F-104 chase plane. Walker went into orbit with the X-15 on one of his flights.</dd>

<dd><i>Flaming Mamie</i></dd>
<dd>After the Flight Icing Research program which the B-25 shared with a B-24 Liberator, <i>Flaming Mamie</i> was turned over to NASA Lewis Cleveland for use in the Full Scale Aircraft Crash Fire Program at the Ravenna Ohio Arsenal and was among 57 planes used in the seven-year program. The aircraft was scrapped but not in the conventional way but "died" in the furtherance of air safety. These two aircraft were the most were "de-iceable" planes in the world. On two separate occasions, both planes experienced the gathering of seven inches of ice in 70 seconds and lost 70 miles per hour and got down on the ground with the ice still clinging to the aircraft after making runs testing the amount of ice that could be accumulated. All aircraft, military and airlines, use the anti-icing or de-icing systems today from the program started in the early 1940s ending in 1957. It is said that no aircraft has ever been lost using the equipment if the equipment is turned on. The B-24 was returned to the Air Force and scrapped in the conventional way. It is too bad that one of these historic planes, so important to aviation air safety was not preserved in the Air Force Museum WPAFB where two other Lewis Lab planes are housed today. Icing photos are available through NASA <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Research_Center_67c3.html" title="Glenn Research Center">Glenn Research Center</a> (formerly Lewis) in Cleveland. I was one of two flight photographers working in the program.</dd>
