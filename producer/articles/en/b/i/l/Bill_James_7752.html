<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>After four years at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Kansas_7e6d.html" title="University of Kansas">University of Kansas</a> and one course short of graduating, James joined the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">Army</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>. James was the last person in Kansas to be drafted for the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_war.html" title="Vietnam war">Vietnam war</a>, although he never saw action there. Instead, he spent two years stationed in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Korea_aa29.html" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, during which time he wrote to KU about taking his final class. He was told he actually had met all his graduation requirements, so he returned to Lawrence in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> with degrees in English and economics. He also finished an Education degree in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, likewise from the University of Kansas.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Edit section: The Bill James Baseball Abstracts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Bill James Baseball Abstract</i>s</span></h3>
<p>An aspiring writer and obsessive fan, James began writing baseball articles after leaving the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Army_9bfc.html" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> in his mid-twenties. Many of his first baseball writings came while he was doing nightshifts as a security guard. Unlike most writers, his pieces didn't recount games in epic terms or offer insights gleaned from interviews with players. A typical James piece posed a question (e.g., "Which pitchers and catchers allow runners to steal the most bases?") and then presented data and analysis written in a lively, insightful and witty style, that answered the question.</p>
<p>Editors considered James' pieces so unusual that few believed them suitable for their readers. In an effort to reach a wider audience, James self-published an annual book titled <i>The Bill James Baseball Abstract</i> beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1977.html" title="1977">1977</a>. The first edition of the book presented 80 pages of in-depth statistics compiled from James' study of <a href="../../../b/o/x/Box_score.html" title="Box score">box scores</a> from the preceding season.</p>
<p>Over the next three years James' work won respect including a very favorable review by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Okrent_ddf6.html" title="Daniel Okrent">Daniel Okrent</a> in <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_Illustrated_9f1c.html" title="Sports Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>. New annual editions added essays on teams and players. By <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> sales had increased tenfold and a media conglomerate agreed to publish and distribute future editions.</p>
<p>While writers had published books about baseball statistics before (most notably Earnshaw Cook's <i>Percentage Baseball</i>, in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>) few had ever reached a mass audience. Attempts to imitate James' work spawned a flood of books and articles that continue to this day.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>, James ceased writing the <i>Abstract</i>, citing workload-related burnout and concern about the volume of statistics on the market. He has continued to publish hardcover books about baseball history, which have sold well and received admiring reviews; these books include two editions of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bill_James_Historical_Baseball_Abstract_6758.html" title="The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract">The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract</a></i>.</p>
<p>On two occasions, James has published a series of new annuals. <i>The Baseball Book</i> (1990-1992) was a loosely-organized collection of commentary, profiles, historical articles and occasional pieces of research. <i>The Player Ratings Book</i> (1993-1995) offered statistics and 50-word profiles aimed at the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_baseball.html" title="Fantasy baseball">fantasy baseball</a> enthusiast.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Edit section: Innovations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Innovations</span></h3>
<p>Among the statistical innovations attributable to James are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/u/n/Runs_created.html" title="Runs created">Runs Created</a>. A statistic intended to quantify a player's contribution to runs scored, as well as a team's expected number of runs scored. Runs created is calculated from other offensive statistics. James' first version of it: Runs Created = ((<a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_bases.html" title="Total bases">Total Bases</a> * (<a href="../../../h/i/t/Hit_%28baseball%29.html" title="Hit (baseball)">Hits</a> + <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walk_%28baseball%29.html" title="Walk (baseball)">Walks</a>))/(Plate Appearances). Applied to an entire team or league, the statistic correlates closely to that team's or league's actual runs scored. Since James first created the statistic, sabermetricians have refined it to make it more accurate, and it is now used in many different variations.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/a/n/Range_Factor_7df0.html" title="Range Factor">Range Factor</a>. A statistic that quantifies the defensive contribution of a player, calculated in its simplest form as RF = (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Assist_%28baseball%29.html" title="Assist (baseball)">Assists</a> + <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putout.html" title="Putout">Put Outs</a>)/(Games Played). The statistic is premised on the notion that the total number of outs that a player participates in is more relevant in evaluating his defensive play than the percentage of cleanly handled chances as calculated by the conventional statistic <a href="../../../f/i/e/Fielding_percentage.html" title="Fielding percentage">Fielding Percentage</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../w/i/n/Win_shares.html" title="Win shares">Win Shares</a>. A unifying statistic intended to allow the comparison of players at different positions, as well as players of different eras. Win Shares incorporates a variety of pitching, hitting and fielding statistics.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagorean_expectation.html" title="Pythagorean expectation">Pythagorean Winning Percentage</a>. A statistic explaining the relationship of wins and losses to runs scored and runs allowed. In its simplest form: Winning Percentage equals Runs squared divided by the square of Runs plus the square of Runs Allowed. The statistic correlates closely to a team's actual winning percentage.</li>
<li>Major League Equivalency. A metric that uses <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_league_baseball.html" title="Minor league baseball">minor league</a> statistics to predict how a player is likely to perform at the major league level.</li>
<li>The Brock2 System. A system for projecting a player's performance over the remainder of his career based on past performance and the aging process.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/i/m/Similarity_score.html" title="Similarity score">Similarity scores</a>. Scoring a player's statistical similarity to other players.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_Average_0df1.html" title="Secondary Average">Secondary Average</a>. A statistic that attempts to measure a player's contribution to an offense in ways not reflected in batting average. The formula is (Extra bases on hits+Walks+Stolen Bases)/At bats. Secondary averages tend to be similar to batting averages, but can vary widely, from less than .100 to more than .500 in extreme cases. Extra bases on hits is calculated with the formula (Doubles)+(Triplesx2)+(Homerunsx3).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although James may be best known as an inventor of statistical tools, he has often written on the limitations of statistics and urged humility concerning their place amidst other kinds of information about baseball. To James, context is paramount: he was among the first to emphasize the importance of adjusting traditional statistics for <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_Park_Factor_5d19.html" title="Batting Park Factor">park factors</a> and to stress the role of luck in a pitcher's won-loss record. Many of his statistical innovations are arguably less important than the underlying ideas. When he introduced the notion of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_average.html" title="Secondary average">secondary average</a>, it was as a vehicle for the then-counterintuitive concept that <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batting_average.html" title="Batting average">batting average</a> represents only a fraction of a player's offensive contribution. (The <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runs_Created_97c0.html" title="Runs Created">runs-created statistic</a> plays a similar role vis-à-vis the traditional <a href="../../../r/u/n/Runs_batted_in.html" title="Runs batted in">RBI</a>.) Some of his contributions to the language of baseball, like the idea of the "<a href="../../../d/e/f/Defensive_spectrum.html" title="Defensive spectrum">defensive spectrum</a>," border on being entirely non-statistical.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Edit section: STATS, Inc.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">STATS, Inc.</span></h3>
<p>In an essay published in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> <i>Abstract</i>, James vented his frustration about <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_League_Baseball_9421.html" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s refusal to publish play-by-play accounts of every game. James proposed the creation of Project Scoresheet, a network of fans that would work together to collect and distribute this information.</p>
<p>While the resulting non-profit organization never functioned smoothly, it worked well enough to collect accounts of every game from <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> through <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>. James' publisher agreed to distribute two annuals of essays and data - the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> editions of <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_Presents_The_Great_American_Baseball_Statbook_ce19.html" title="Bill James Presents The Great American Baseball Statbook">Bill James Presents The Great American Baseball Statbook</a></i> (though only the first of these featured writing by James).</p>
<p>The organization was eventually disbanded, but many of its members went on to form for-profit companies with similar goals and structure. STATS, Inc., the company James joined, provided data and analysis to every major media outlet before being acquired by <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Network_c0e1.html" title="Fox Network">Fox</a> Sports in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Edit section: Acceptance in mainstream baseball">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Acceptance in mainstream baseball</span></h3>
<p>For most of his career, James' ideas have either been ignored or rejected by professional baseball teams. James' sabermetrics rejects much of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conventional_wisdom.html" title="Conventional wisdom">conventional wisdom</a> that has been passed down by players, executives, and writers over decades. Most teams, managers, and players prefer to continue to follow maxims that were developed decades ago, as well as their gut instincts.</p>
<p>In recent years, James' ideas have begun to gain official acceptance. <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Athletics_6739.html" title="Oakland Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> general manager <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Beane_0b1d.html" title="Billy Beane">Billy Beane</a> began applying sabermetric principles to running his low-budget team in the late <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a>, to great effect (as chronicled in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Lewis_%28author%29_8bac.html" title="Michael Lewis (author)">Michael Lewis</a>' book <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Moneyball.html" title="Moneyball">Moneyball</a></i>), and sabermetricians have penetrated other organizations since then.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_in_sports.html" title="2003 in sports">2003</a>, James was hired by a former reader, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Henry_%28baseball%29_bf63.html" title="John Henry (baseball)">John Henry</a>, the new owner of the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Red_Sox_8ec5.html" title="Boston Red Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>. The move generated some controversy, but after 25 years James had finally gained an official position within Major League Baseball. Current Red Sox GM <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theo_Epstein_d976.html" title="Theo Epstein">Theo Epstein</a> also turned out to have a sabermetric bent.</p>
<p>One point of controversy was in handling the Red Sox' relief pitching. James had previously published several analyses of the use of the <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closer_%28baseball%29.html" title="Closer (baseball)">closer</a> in baseball, and had concluded that the traditional use of the closer both overrated the abilities of that individual, and used him in suboptimal circumstances. Reportedly, James influenced a reorganization of the Boston bullpen, with several moderately talented relievers and no clear closer. When Boston lost a number of games due to bullpen failures, they were forced to acquire a traditional closer (<a href="../../../b/y/u/Byung-Hyun_Kim_a145.html" title="Byung-Hyun Kim">Byung-Hyun Kim</a>) in order to address the issue. Many writers considered this to be a rejection of James' ideas, and the signing of ace reliever <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Foulke_dd7b.html" title="Keith Foulke">Keith Foulke</a> following the season further suggests this. Others, however, argue that the Boston pen was simply not very talented and that the outcome doesn't necessarily undermine James' arguments.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Boston did not implement James' idea of the "relief ace". James did not suggest a "bullpen by committee"; rather, his studies showed that the relief ace should be used in close or tie games as early as the 7th inning, when the outcome of a ballgame is really decided. Boston had no relief ace in 2003. During the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> regular season Foulke was used primarily as a closer in the <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_La_Russa_c0f9.html" title="Tony La Russa">Tony La Russa</a> model; however, Foulke's usage in the 2004 postseason was along the lines of a relief ace with multiple inning appearances at pivotal times of the game. <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Astros_ddc6.html" title="Houston Astros">Houston Astros</a> manager <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Garner_6d28.html" title="Phil Garner">Phil Garner</a> also employed a relief ace model, perhaps unwittingly, with his use of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Lidge_918d.html" title="Brad Lidge">Brad Lidge</a> in the 2004 postseason, further demonstrating the efficacy of James's relief ace concept.</p>
<p>James is still (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>) employed by the Red Sox, having published two new sabermetric books in the preceding four years. Indeed, although James is typically tight-lipped about his activities on behalf of the Red Sox, he is credited with advocating some of the moves that led to the team's first <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a> championship in 86 years, including the signing of non-tendered free agent <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Ortiz_0347.html" title="David Ortiz">David Ortiz</a>, the trade for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Bellhorn_1528.html" title="Mark Bellhorn">Mark Bellhorn</a>, and the team's emphasis on <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_base_percentage.html" title="On base percentage">on base percentage</a>.</p>
<p>Several books have recently been published on Bill James. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mind_Of_Bill_James_1d92.html" title="The Mind Of Bill James">The Mind Of Bill James</a>, a biography-cum-chronicle of James' works was published in the spring of 2006. How Bill James Changed Our View of the Game of Baseball is due to be published in February 2007.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_James_7752.html" title="Edit section: Dowd Report controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dowd Report controversy</span></h3>
<p>James was a strong critic of the <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dowd_Report_0d39.html" title="Dowd Report">Dowd Report</a>, which was the most thorough investigation (commissioned by baseball commissioner <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Giamatti_aa82.html" title="Bart Giamatti">Bart Giamatti</a>) on the gambling activities of <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Rose_8e17.html" title="Pete Rose">Pete Rose</a>. James, in his <i>Baseball Book 1990</i>, dismissed Dowd's conclusion (based on the evidence available to Dowd at the time) that the former <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cincinnati_Reds_7554.html" title="Cincinnati Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> manager bet on baseball games. (For James to defend Rose was rather ironic: James had been sharply critical of Rose in James' yearly <i>Abstract</i>s late in Rose's playing career.) James reproached commissioner Giamatti and his successor, Fay Vincent, for their acceptance of the Dowd Report as the final word on Rose's gambling. In 2004, Rose admitted to having bet on baseball, though this in no way upended James' previous contention, that there had been no evidence on which to base his guilt.</p>
