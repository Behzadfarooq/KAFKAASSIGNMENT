<p>AMO or IBO organization: I don't have much preferences about the terminology. I clarify that they provide training also besides motivation.

<dd>Amway uses the terms LOA "IBO Organizations" and "professional development programs". I'm unaware of anytime they've used it in an offical capacity. They may have used it in a response to a "critics" claims. I considered it a somewhat ignorant, misleading, and even pejorative POV term, it shouldn't be used. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 17:42, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The links you gave seem specific to Quixtar. Is the terminology the same everywhere or has Quixtar developed some new terminology. Regarding terminology, first of all we should be consistent on all articles so as not to confuse readers. As sources, we can have Amway/Quixtar provided literature, as well as the terminology commonly used by everyone (for whatever reasons). Either we arbitrarily choose one of them or point to both. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 18:59, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I forgot, a third source is what terminology these organizations commonly use. All these sources have their own importance. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 19:08, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No WP:RS source that I am aware of use the term "AMO". The LOA term is global, I have both my LOA and LOS listed on my information page when I log in to Amway Australia, since they are different. The <i>PDP</i> term is one that is not unique to Amway/Quixtar - "Professional Development Program" is a normal business term for what the IBO organizations do. IBO Organizations is self descriptive. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 20:24, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>These organizations are always difficult to talk about. The N21 site <a href="http://www.n21corp.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.n21corp.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> does not even use the words "Amway" or "Quixtar" on its main page or on the company overview page. I saw the word "Alticor" on the press releases page, that seems all. Coming back to the question of sources, the phrase "motivation business" is repeatedly used in the PostMa Memo you mentioned above. Other than that the term 'Amway Motivational Organizations' is repeatedly used by the critics. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 21:39, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The PostMa memo was exactly that, a memo written by a staff member, and it is more than 20 years old, it has little relevance to what is acceptable and correct terminology today. The very fact the phrase is repeatedly used by critics but rarely used by supporters and not at all in any literature should tell you something - it's POV. I have no idea what your comments about the N21 website have to do with anything? --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 16:24, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My comment about N21 means that if they don't use the word "Amway" on their website then should we also say that N21 has no connection to Amway, and contest the letter "A" in the term "AMO"? PostMa memo was written by a staff member. But the famous DeVos directly speaking tapes of 1983 also talk about motivation business. So here we have Amway talking about motivation business and critics talking about motivation business, still it is POV? -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 16:40, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I still don't see any relevance to N21. The DeVos directly speaking tapes are also from the early 80s. If you can provide any evidence that Amway/Quixtar/or A/Q affiliated support companies use the term "AMO" then please do so. Motivation is part of what they do, and Amway is one of the companies they work with. Product education is also something they do. Quixtar is a company they work with. Quixtar Product Education Companies thus makes as much sense as "Amway Motivational Organization". Or should we go with Quixtar Sales Training Companies? Or Amway Personal Development Organizations? Or Amway Quixtar Leadership Development Companies? Etc etc etc. The term AMO is deliberately mocking on the part of critics, used in order to imply these companies are nothing but "rah rah" organizations that offer nothing of substance to IBOs. It's not an accurate description of what they do. There is no reason at all not to use the official terms except a desire to promote this pejorative myth. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 18:30, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't have to pick one or the other. We can say something like "PDP, also known as AMO". It isn't the job of Wikipedia to enforce the name that the company prefers, we should simply reflect actual usage and more than one term is used. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 19:01, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sure, though it should also be made clear that it's a term used by critics. Is it used in any WP:RS acceptable source? Though a PDP (Professional Education Program) is something offered by an LOA (Line of Affiliation) or IBO Organization. The latter are more accurate synonyms of AMOs. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 19:13, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My ideas were similar, that AMO is a common name but is probably used more by critics, and there are some official names in A/Q literature. That can be explained, and we have already stated that they provide training besides motivation. For names and terminology, traditions are also important besides accuracy. Just as an interesting example, consider that "Amway" means "American Way" but now US only has Quixtar and Amway is present only outside US&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>So should we say that we now have a consensus here? -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 19:39, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not quite, depends on the wording! For example, I would suggest for example saying in the <i>Amway Business</i> section that he "started his own company called the Britt World Wide (BWW) to provide training and motivation to his Amway downline".--<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 20:49, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
