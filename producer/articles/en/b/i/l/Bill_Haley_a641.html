<p>Haley was born <b>William John Clifton Haley</b> (some sources append "Junior" to his name, but his eldest son states that this is erroneous) in <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highland_Park%2C_Michigan_d30e.html" title="Highland Park, Michigan">Highland Park, Michigan</a> and raised in <a href="../../../b/e/t/Bethel_Township%2C_Delaware_County%2C_Pennsylvania_80b5.html" title="Bethel Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania">Booth's Corner, Pennsylvania</a>. Many sources (almost universally predating his death in 1981) state that Haley was born in 1927, which is due to Haley knocking two years off his age for publicity purposes in the 1950s. A few recent sources erroneously give a birth year of 1924.</p>
<p>Haley was blinded in his left eye as a child due to a botched operation. According to biographer John Swenson, Haley later adopted his distinctive spit-curl hairstyle to distract attention from his blind eye. The spit-curl caught on as a 50's style signature, although Haley and others had worn the hairstyle much earlier.</p>
<p>In 1946, Haley joined his first professional group, a Pennsylvania-based <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_swing.html" title="Western swing">western swing</a> band called the Down Homers run by Kenny Roberts. It has often been reported in musical reference works that Haley's first professional recordings were made with the Down Homers on a pair of singles released in 1946 by <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue_Records_bb1c.html" title="Vogue Records">Vogue Records</a>. <a href="http://www.library.ucsb.edu/speccoll/pa/vr736.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.library.ucsb.edu/speccoll/pa/vr736.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> This was later debunked by Roberts and others, stating Haley had already left the group by the time the singles were made. In the early 2000s, however, a set of 1946 radio recordings by the Down Homers were discovered and Haley is definitely present as he is identified by name and sings a solo number "She Taught Me to Yodel"; these recordings were commercially released for the first time in 2006.</p>
<p>After gaining experience with the Down Homers, Haley set out on his own, forming several groups such as the Range Drifters and the Four Aces of Western Swing. With the Four Aces, he made a number of regionally successful country music <a href="../../../s/i/n/Single_%28music%29.html" title="Single (music)">singles</a> in the late 1940s for Cowboy Records while working as a touring musician and, beginning in 1947 as musical director <a href="http://www.rockabillyhall.com/BillHaley.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rockabillyhall.com/BillHaley.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.oldchesterpa.com/wdrf.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oldchesterpa.com/wdrf.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> at WPWA. (Many of Haley's early recordings from this period would not be released until after his death.)</p>
<p>After disbanding the Four Aces and briefly trying a solo career using the names Jack Haley and Johnny Clifton (as chronicled in the biography <i>Sound and Glory</i>), Haley formed a new group called <b>The Saddlemen</b> in either 1949 or 1950 (sources vary as to the exact year); this new group recorded for several labels, including one single for <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Records_25c4.html" title="Atlantic Records">Atlantic Records</a>, Haley's first exposure to a major national record company. In 1951, Haley was signed to Dave Miller's Philadelphia-based <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holiday_Records_3134.html" title="Holiday Records">Holiday Records</a> and began to change musical styles, recording <a href="../../../c/o/v/Cover_version.html" title="Cover version">cover versions</a> of "<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket_88.html" title="Rocket 88">Rocket 88</a>" (previously recorded by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Brenston_and_His_Delta_Cats_0c86.html" title="Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats">Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats</a>), and in, 1952, "Rock the Joint", previously recorded by several bands including <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Preston_and_His_Prestonians_3d2a.html" title="Jimmy Preston and His Prestonians">Jimmy Preston and His Prestonians</a>. (By the time of "Rock the Joint", Haley had graduated from Holiday Records to Miller's larger Essex label.) The relative success of these recordings (both sold in the 75,000-100,000 copy range in the Pennsylvania-<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a> region) convinced Haley that his new and as-yet officially unnamed hybrid of country and <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhythm_and_blues.html" title="Rhythm and blues">rhythm and blues</a> could be a commercial success.</p>

<p>During the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Day_663d.html" title="Labor Day">Labor Day</a> weekend in 1952, The Saddlemen were renamed <b>Bill Haley with Haley's Comets</b> (inspired by a popular mispronunciation of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halley%27s_Comet_5171.html" title="Halley's Comet">Halley's Comet</a>), and in 1953, Haley's recording of "<a href="../../../c/r/a/Crazy_Man%2C_Crazy_6e43.html" title="Crazy Man, Crazy">Crazy Man, Crazy</a>" (co-written by Haley and his bass player, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_Lytle_dca3.html" title="Marshall Lytle">Marshall Lytle</a> although Lytle wouldn't receive credit until 2001) became the first rock and roll song to hit the American charts. Soon after, the band's name was revised to <b>Bill Haley &amp; His Comets.</b></p>
<p>In 1953, a song entitled "<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Around_the_Clock_a159.html" title="Rock Around the Clock">Rock Around the Clock</a>" was written for Haley, but he was unable to record it until <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">April 12</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>. Initially, it was relatively unsuccessful, but Haley soon scored a major worldwide hit with a cover version of <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Joe_Turner_18ed.html" title="Big Joe Turner">Big Joe Turner</a>'s "<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shake%2C_Rattle_and_Roll_4372.html" title="Shake, Rattle and Roll">Shake, Rattle and Roll</a>," which went on to sell a million copies and became the first ever rock'n'roll song to enter <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> singles charts in December 1954. Haley and his band were important in launching the music known as "Rock and Roll" to a wider (white) audience after years of it being considered an underground movement. When "Rock Around the Clock" appeared behind the opening credits of the 1955 film <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackboard_Jungle_ef96.html" title="Blackboard Jungle">Blackboard Jungle</a></i> starring <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Ford_6ae7.html" title="Glenn Ford">Glenn Ford</a>, it soared to the top of the American <i><a href="../../../b/i/l/Billboard_magazine.html" title="Billboard magazine">Billboard</a></i> charts for eight weeks, launching a musical revolution that opened the doors for the likes of <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>.</p>
<p>"Rock Around the Clock" was the first record ever to sell over one million copies in both Britain and Germany and, in 1957, Haley became the first major American rock singer to tour <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Haley continued to score hits throughout the 1950s such as "<a href="../../../s/e/e/See_You_Later%2C_Alligator_515c.html" title="See You Later, Alligator">See You Later, Alligator</a>" and he starred in the first rock and roll musical movies <i><a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Around_the_Clock_%28film%29_d16b.html" title="Rock Around the Clock (film)">Rock Around the Clock</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_Knock_the_Rock_500e.html" title="Don't Knock the Rock">Don't Knock the Rock</a></i>, both in 1956. His star was soon surpassed in the USA by the younger, sexier Elvis, but Haley continued to be a major star in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, and in Europe throughout the 1960s.</p>

<p>A self-admitted <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a> (as indicated in a 1974 radio interview for the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>), Haley fought a battle with liquor well into the 1970s. Nonetheless, he and his band continued to be a popular touring act, enjoying a career resurgence in the late 1960s with the Rock and Roll Revival movement and the signing of a lucrative record deal with the European Sonet Records label. After performing for <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom_e66a.html" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> at a command performance in 1979, Haley made his final performances in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> in May and June of 1980. Prior to the South African tour, he was diagnosed with a <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brain_tumor.html" title="Brain tumor">brain tumor</a>, and a planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 was canceled. Despite his ill health, Haley began compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he retired to his home in <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harlingen%2C_Texas_d083.html" title="Harlingen, Texas">Harlingen, Texas</a> where he died early on the morning <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_9.html" title="February 9">February 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1981.html" title="1981">1981</a>.</p>
<p>Media reports immediately following his death indicated Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in his final weeks, although beyond a biography of Haley by John Swenson released a year later which describes Haley painting the windows of his home black and making rambling late-night phone calls to friends and relatives, there is little information extant about Haley's final days. The exact cause of his death is controversial. Media reports, supported by Haley's death certificate (reproduced in the book <i>Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll</i> by John Swenson), suggest he died of "natural causes most likely <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myocardial_infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>". Members of Haley's family, however, contest that he died from the brain tumor.

<p>Bill Haley has also been portrayed - not always in a positive light - in several "period" films:</p>

<p>Bill Haley recorded prolifically during the 1940s, often at the radio stations where he worked, or in formal studio settings. Virtually none of these recordings were ever released. Liner notes for a 2003 CD release by Hydra Records entitled <i>Bill Haley and Friends Vol. 2: The Legendary Cowboy Recordings</i> reveal that several additional Cowboy label single releases were planned for the Four Aces, but this never occurred.</p>
<p>A number of previously unreleased Haley country-western recordings from the 1946-1950 period began to emerge near the end of Haley's life, some of which were released by the Arzee label, with titles such as "Yodel Your Blues Away" and "Rose of My Heart." Still more demos, alternate takes, and wholly unheard-before recordings have been released since Haley's death. Notable examples of such releases include the albums <i>Golden Country Origins</i> by Grassroots Records of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <i>Hillbilly Haley</i> by the British label, Rollercoaster, as well as the aforementioned German release by Hydra Records. In 2006, <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bear_Family_Records_89c6.html" title="Bear Family Records">Bear Family Records</a> of Germany released what is considered to be the most comprehensive (yet still incomplete) collection of Haley's 1946-1950 recordings as part of its Haley box set <i>Rock n' Roll Arrives</i>.</p>
