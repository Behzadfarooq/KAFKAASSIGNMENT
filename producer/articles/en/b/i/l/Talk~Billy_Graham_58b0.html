<p>I find Billy Graham's anti-jewish comments grossly unacceptable. But given the length of Graham's service, both negative and positive, his remarks are only one relatively small footnote in the full complex story of who Graham is and what is does or doesn't do. The paragraphs here should either be in a far longer article on Graham or if in a stub sized piece, reduced to a line to two with an explanatory footnote. In the current format, they dominate the article and (no doubt unintentionally) POV it by making one issue dominate and be given an importance far beyond what it should have in a balanced article. If this was an article on Billy Graham and anti-semitism, then they would be OK, but on Billy Graham the man they are unbalanced. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">ÉÍREman</a> 04:22 May 7, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looks like there is some vandalism on this page may need to be reverse</p>
<hr />
<p>Whether or not the man is anti-Semitic, the section of this article dealing with his alleged anti-Semitic remark is sloppy, sloppy, sloppy -- unworthy of Wikipedia. For instance, take a look at this pap:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In a 1994 book, the author H. R. Haldeman recalled a White House conversation between Graham and then president Richard Nixon...</dd>
</dl>
<p>Nixon was president in 1994? That's news to me! I suppose the contributor meant that Haldeman wrote about a conversation he overheard between Graham and Nixon when Nixon was president. And by the way, why do we have to take the contributor's word that Haldeman wrote this in some book. What book? Does it have a name? An ISBN?</p>
<p>And take a look at this error in the use of quotation marks:</p>
<dl>
<dd>He said the Jewish stranglehold has got to be broken or the country's going down the drain" and went on...</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is the second clause an exact quote from Graham? If so, why doesn't it begin with a quotation mark? If not, why does it end with a quotation mark?</p>
<p>And by the way, where do all these quotes come from? Are they the contributor's own transcription from the tapes he/she listened to him/herself? Are they from transcriptions someone else made? Are the transcriptions published somewhere, where someone else could check them for accuracy? And what about the denials and excuses the contributor quotes Graham as making: where did they come from?</p>
<p>All this should be documented.</p>
<p>And if the contributor has such ready access to quotes by Graham, I wonder why the reader has to rely on the contributor's summation of what Graham said about Jews and the media and pornography.</p>

<p>I think reference should be made to the antisemitic charges. Omitting such a reference is contrary to the idea of npov too.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The link is sufficient. It's time to remove the section, which is ridiculous when viewed with a little perspective. Graham grew up in a redneck culture, and the remarkable thing about him is how much his lifelong career has been free of typical redneck prejudices. If you try to hold me to every remark I made thirty some-odd years ago, you and me are gonna fight. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 06:18, July 27, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There has been <b>zero response</b> to this point made months ago. The charge is ancient history. And, when viewed in the context of his background and his life since then, it is insignificant. As to the documentation, the link is more than enough. As with any famous person, it's possible for find someone who'd say just about anything. It degrades the article to have this point included, and I am deleting it. It is true that he has been criticised by some Christian fundamentalists, and this has been a continuous and vociferous objection, so I'll leave it, but the writer who added "evangelicals" simply doesn't understand the difference. The link needs disambiuation, but I'll leave it at that. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 08:55, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've deleted unsubstantiated remarks re 'anti-semitism' written as if they were fact. If they are the views of one contributor, that's one thing - this is an encyclopedia which, it is hoped, will eventually have some credibility for being independent and factual. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgendum_46fd.html" title="User:Agendum">Agendum</a> 00:20, 18 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- I've written a new section on his anti-semetic remarks. It is very well-documented what he said, and I don't believe you'll find any factual errors in my addition, nor, I think, will you find it to violate NPOV. As for those who argue that such submissions don't belong in an article about him, his remarks are an important element in how many people think about him, and bear weight on his message.</p>

<p>Christian evangelicalism - like many absolutist dogmas - has as its essence an authoritarian and dismissive prejudice against contrary beliefs and philosophies. To refer to Mr. Graham's disparagement of jews as anti-semitic is not only stating the obvious, but arbitrarily distinguishing it from his prejudicial remarks about many other beliefs and holdings. As a secular humanist, I find the very idea of original sin to be prejudicial. I would encourage seekers to reject any doctrine which disparages any inocent, loving and peaceful person or group, and to embrace beliefs and philosophies that further the goal of a peaceful and just world. regards, jeroboam bramblejam</p>
<p><br />
^^^ Well then, wouldn't ANY ideology that disparages ANY form of beliefs and philosophies (including Christian evangelicalism) be inherently prejudicial; or is prejudice only defined as an ideology that defies the thinkings of secular humanism and their Gods, ruling the Empires of Earth? ~Firestorm</p>
<p>Hunh?... jeroboambramblejam</p>
<p>Translation of what Firestorm said: "Doesn't your own dogma has at its essence an authoritarian and dismissive prejudice against contrary beliefs and philosophies, ie: Christian evangelicalism?" Or in other words, your own viewpoint is that all philosophies are inherently equal, and thus any philosophy, such as evangelicalism, that claims to be absolutely true is wrong. Firestorm points out, that your own viewpoint implicitly assumes itself to represent an absolute truth above all other philosophies, and is thus self-contradictory. 152.23.79.74 15:09, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No. Reason is, by its very nature, non-dogmatic. Humanism embraces reason as a tool for distinguishing between what is good and what is not. Reason is what validates the findings of ethics, which subjects claims - even religious claims - to analysis in universally defensible terms. Just as the findings of science are subject to refutation, the philosophy of humanism welcomes reasoned criticism and correction. Humanist philosophy shares many of the precepts of many religions insofar as they are also supported by the fruits of reason. By the same process, it rejects claims from the same quarter that are counter to the good. There are parallels here to the rejection of "philosophical naturalism" by advocates of "intellegent design": Reject the foundational principle (reason), and the argument (secularism) becomes invalid. Much of what is defended as "christian doctrine" does not survive reasoned analysis. A first step might be for christians to weigh their holdings against Jesus' own guidance offered during his sermon on the mount. 70.179.77.19 18:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)jeroboambramblejam</p>

<p><b>Our God and Our Father, we thank You for the moral and spiritual foundation which our forefathers gave us, and which are rooted deeply in Holy Scripture. Those principle have nourished and guided us as a nation in the past.</b> <b>But we cannot say that we are a righteous people, for we are not. We have sinned against You. We have sown to the wind and are now reaping the whirlwind of crime, drug abuse, racism, immorality, and social injustice. We need to repent of our sins and turn by faith to You.</b> <b>And now we commit to You President Clinton and Vice President Gore, whom You have permitted to take leadership at this critical time in our nation's history. Help them always see the office to which they have been elected as a sacred trust from You. We pray that You will bless their wives, who will share so much of the responsibility and burdens.</b> <b>May President Clinton know that he is never really alone, but that the eternal God can be his refuge, and that he can turn to You in every circumstance. Give him the wisdom You have promised to those who ask, and the strength that You alone can give.</b> <b>I pray this in the name of the One who was called “Wonderful Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.” Amen!</b></p>

<p>Let's begin with the introduction. First of all, the phrase "decisions to accept Jesus Christ into their lives" seems hardly objective due to its floridity and wording which smacks of a televangelist's sermon and might be suited by being rephrased along the lines of "He is reportedly the catalyst in the decisions of numerous individuals to convert to his brand of Evangelical Christianity." This is clear regardless of the fact that there are no sources noted for the number of conversions claimed in the introduction. In fact in the same phrase as the one quoted above, the author makes a claim to Mr. Graham's "great[ness]."</p>
<p>Onto the <i>Politics</i> section, and an example of further editorialising with:"[...]but he is still very close to the powerful Bush family." Furthermore their is a lack of consideration for his views which are apparently not important to list on separate issues (even though the section is called "Politics" there is scant mention of actual policy, just a few phrases attesting to his choice in party).</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am not a theological/political expert and have little resource to rewrite this page without coming to similarly vague conclusions. I would hope that someone with the necessary qualifications might deal with this in an expedient manner.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't find any of these in the article so apparently they've been omitted or rewritten. While the article could stand more improvement, these objections seem to be satisfied. Removing POV tag</dd>

<p>I disagree. You have removed anti-semite category and NPOV tag. I replaced them. --68.217.110.143 13:42, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Billy Graham grew up in Ku Klux Klan territory, in a culture which believed that racism was an integral part of Christianity. He attended Bob Jones University. The one incident, thirty years old, is the only such comment that anyone has presented to Wikipedia. Would you want to be held responsible for a statement you made 30 years ago, when your whole life since then has been obviously in a different direction? Betcha we all have some things that we're glad the tape wasn't running. The point is that over his lifetime he remarkably moved away from that racism of his home culture. If you disbelieve that, look at the writings of Bob Jones, Sr. who never did break away and the topic comes up frequently to the end of his life. This is something that may be hard to understand for someone who did not grow up under the influence of the ever-present Klan and the slavery/reconstruction/Jim Crow culture that produced the Klan. It is biased and unencyclopedic to try to "extract a pound of flesh" (how's that for a racist stereotype?) from the guy. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 14:46, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>82.143.162.72 23:44, 23 January 2006 (UTC) Whether you like it or not, Billy Graham was recorded talking to an American President in an anti-Semtic manner. It is information and is as relevant to the wider picture as any other single event. If a reader believes it is 'negated' by anything else in Mr Graham's life, that is for them to conclude. One could equally draw conclusions from the fact that Mr Graham had not admitted it before it had been revealed. Both are opinions and neither would be suitable for an 'encyclopedia'.</p>
<p>Its constant deletion is one of many examples of why readers should take Wikipedia with a fairly liberal pinch of salt.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not a matter of whether I like it. Actually the constant harping on a petty criticism based on a single event many years ago is quite unencyclopedic, and is a more likely reason why readers would question Wikipedia. Look also at my comments above. Furthermore, the link is still there, so the pulp magazines can have at it if they wish. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 03:31, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, we cannot just pretend this didn't happen. This was a pretty shocking statement to millions of his supporters and made world headlines in the most respected news outlets thirty years after the fact. This was not something that Billy Graham said as a young man before he became a public figure, but as a confidante to the President of the US. As for the counterpunch link, well that's pretty useless, I would suggest <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1850077.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1850077.stm" rel="nofollow">this BBC story</a> instead.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 06:54, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anon keeps adding a petty arguement of anti-semitism based on one 30-year-old remark, then accuses me of making an advert for Graham when I've removed it, which is silly; I am opposing taking something out of context.</p>
<p>The charge, when viewed in the context of his lifetime is clearly false. One statement made while sucking up to a powerful and virulently anti-semitic President does not make him an anti-semite when viewed in his lifelong context. One could accuse him of weakness at that point, but not anti-semitism.</p>
<p>A Google search reveals many references to this which can be generally divided into two obvious categories. One group obviously and gleefully reports the quote as an <i>ad hominem</i> attack against his message. The other, including some Jewish authors, place the remark in the context of a lifelong pattern in the opposite. Graham grew up in the middle of Ku Klux Klan influence and Jim Crow laws, but his lifelong pattern is a movement away from racism.</p>
<p>He has alway supported the nation of Israel, and his organization gave assistence to oppressed Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel. He has often made pro-Jewish statements in his ministry. When the Southern Baptist sought to emphacize conversion of the Jews, Graham opposed the program. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 03:21, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I agree. Though I think we should keep the part about anti-semitism, I don't think the "Jews swarm around me..." should be listed as a quote. So can I remove it, or is anyone opposing this? - Áki</p>

RE: I edited "allegedly anti-semitic" to "anti-semitic. The fact he did apologize for the comments shows they are anti-semitic. There is nothing alleged about it. It is not useless. Tapes are about as factual as it gets. And while he may have apologized for the comments, it is important not to gloss over factual history. If his legacy as a whole makes up for this discrepancy, than that legacy should be written about, not have parts omitted that speak to the contrary.</p>

<p>I'm an admirer of Dr. Graham. I'm also an inerrantist and a Baptist, a staunch supporter of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Credobaptism.html" title="Credobaptism">credobaptism</a>. But I'm also a Wikipedian who is able to recognize my own baises. I tagged this section as NPOV vis à vis <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a>. This could be a textbook example of weasel words (and other NPOV writing as well), but I'll highlight what I find most objectionable:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Graham has been criticized for years by <i>many Christian Fundamentlists</i>..." not just "some" but "many"</li>
<li>"Funadementalism emphasizes doctrinal purity" I'm a fundamentalist, so I agree, but come on, let's strive for objectivity.</li>
<li>"scriptural baptism" What is "Scriptural baptism?" My opinion that any baptism that is not performed on a born-again Christian by total immersion with the understanding of both the baptizer and baptizee that it is non-regenerative is not a baptism. Is this is what is meant? Or is this a Church of Christ writer who thinks that there are no valid baptists outside the CoC?</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, the section on Scriptural Baptism was written by myself, a Southern Baptist minister who also admires Billy Graham, but wants to point out that he is far from a traditional Southern Baptist. It was a reference to believer baptism by immersion. Infant baptism is not Scriptural... Dr. Graham's tolerance for other religions is well known.. he has made statements that indicate that he believes some Islamic people will get to heaven without faith in Jesus Christ. Once again, not Southern Baptist doctrine.</p>
<ul>
<li>"groups that claim to be Christian" This is kind of like "I'm sorry if I offended you" (read I'm sorry that you so petty and easily offended."</li>
<li>"has been accused" (weasel words) "of a lack of tollerance for other religions." (NPOV) How are we defining tolerance? I'm highly tollerant of other religions, while still holding the opinion that those who die apart from a saving faith in Christ are damned. Is there a difference between intollerance and indifference?</li>
<li>"questions were raised about the morality and wisdom of the Reverend Graham's counsel."</li>
<li>"Some people have said that Graham has received excessive financial compensation from his ministry." "Some people" (Weasle Words) "excessive" (NPOV). The citation is spurious...a blog site that anyone can edit... without oversight.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would edit it, but I'm not going to take the time to sort out the "some people said" to find the references. I think it is valid in the discussion of Graham's life. Much as I support the man, I don't want the article to be a halography of him, so I don't want it removed.

<dd>Go for it! The page has a lot of problems. Here's another - the statement that Graham "absolved" Bush. I suspect it was written by a Roman Catholic (or ex-Roman Catholic), but it's not part of any Protestant belief, so the statement is nonsensical. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 02:54, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Webster Unabridged - <b>ABSOLVE is a general word</b></p>
<p>ab·solve �(ab zolvÆ, -solvÆ), v.t., -solved, -solv·ing. 1. to free from guilt or blame or their consequences: The court absolved her of guilt in his death. 2. to set free or release, as from some duty, obligation, or responsibility (usually fol. by from): to be absolved from one's oath. 3. to grant pardon for. 4. Eccles. a. to grant or pronounce remission of sins to. b. to remit (a sin) by absolution. c. to declare (censure, as excommunication) removed. [1525–35; &lt; L absolvere, equiv. to ab- AB- + solvere to loosen; see SOLVE] —ab·solvÆa·ble, adj. —ab·solÆvent, adj., n. —ab·solvÆer, n. —Syn.1. exculpate, clear. ABSOLVE, ACQUIT, EXONERATE all mean to free from blame. ABSOLVE is a general word for this idea. To ACQUIT is to release from a specific and usually formal accusation: The court must acquit the accused if there is not enough evidence of guilt. To EXONERATE is to consider a person clear of blame or consequences for an act (even when the act is admitted), or to justify the person for having done it: to be exonerated for a crime committed in self-defense. 2. liberate, exempt. 3. excuse, forgive. —Ant.1. blame.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Cruise_9e03.html" title="User:David Cruise">User:David Cruise</a></p>

<dd>David Cruise has a point; to "absolve" someone is an action that can be taken by any person or group. A nation can be absolved of debt, a judge can absolve a defendant of charges, or I can absolve the cat for spilling Friskies on my rug. I would assume that the Roman Catholic sense carries a very different weight, to the extent that Roman Catholics may believe priests have authority from God to absolve others of sins. In that case, to say that a priest absolved the President could be an assertion of tremendous moment. Regardless of whether Protestants and Roman Catholics disagree on a priest's authority to absolve of sin on God's behalf, they all do agree that Jesus has the authority to do so.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So here is where the problem with the word, as applied to Billy Graham, might arise. Because an evangelist is viewed by some as a kind of representative for God, to say that he "absolved" a person invokes a subtle wordplay. "Absolved" is so often used in the theological context of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation.html" title="Salvation">salvation</a> that the term nearly qualifies as <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianese.html" title="Christianese">Christianese</a>, and may therefore be somewhat less neutral than one of the other terms that David Cruise kindly presented in the above Webster definition, such as, for example, "excused." Billy Graham may have publicly excused Bush, based upon his own judgement and on his own behalf or that of his organization, but Billy Graham's judgement of the President is not to be confused with God's. The term "absolved" does slightly confuse this, perhaps in a wryly humorous way. I suspect that established publishers of a printed encyclopedia would avoid using the term in this context, if for no other reason than to maintain a tone of professional scholarship. Speaking on my own behalf, the way the term is used in the Billy Graham article doesn't strike me as a very big deal, since I imagine most intelligent people would realize that it only conveys a dry note of sarchasm.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>

<dd>As for whether such a tone is appropriate for use in Wikipedia, it's likely that the matter will eventually be addressed when somebody comes along to do a general cleanup of the prose, regardless of whether it happens now. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProjection70_a733.html" title="User:Projection70">Projection70</a> 22:40, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"* Graham has been criticized for years by many Christian Fundamentalists for his inclusive message and his close relationship with the Catholic Church (especially for his friendship with the late Pope John Paul II). Christian fundamentalism emphasizes doctrinal purity, scriptural baptism, and separatism, while Graham has taken a more evangelical position of cooperation wherever possible with other groups that claim to be Christians."</li>

<p>The word evangelical seems to be a mistake. Did they not mean Ecumenical?172.147.39.175 10:31, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the classical sense of ecumenical, yes. But modern ecumenism has been largely concerned with uniting various bodies, whereas Evangelicals like Graham promote working together, while being careful not to compromise core beliefs. Graham does not advocate physical union of churches. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 03:52, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This editor's concerns were already addressed and detailed in two different sections of the article before he added it yet a third time. Notwithstanding the redundant nature of this insertion, it betrays that editor's desire to use its placement to build a case in favor of his personal opinion of Graham.

No public figures are without controversy, so to label them as controversial in the introductions to their biographies is to suggest that the primary basis of their notariety is their deliberate intent to be controversial.

<p>I've seen examples cited of POV words in this article such as "accepting Jesus Christ as Savior" and "preaching the Good News of Jesus". I have to dispute the contention that these words and phrases are always inappropriate, as seems to be the opinion. When writing of a particular worldview, religion, or an organization or individual that espouses a particular philosophy, it must be understood that certain phrases and words are used in these groups that have a particular meaning to them and distinguish them from others. It's not wrong to use these words and phrases provided that they're understood in the proper context. For example, I'd never use the phrase "accept Jesus as Savior" when writing about Buddhism or Madalyn Murray O'Hair because this phrase would be irrelevant to the subject. However, with a Christian evangelist, this phrase is very appropriate. As long as it's understood that the phrase is peculiar to the subject being discussed and a meaning given for it, I see no problem with using it. Another reason we shouldn't unconditionally exclude these types of phrases is a particular one may be familiar to a reader, but he/she never understood its meaning. For example, using the phrase I used before, a person growing up in the "Bible Belt" of America may have heard this phrase used a lot but never comprehended it. By using it in its proper context and giving the meaning, the reader can be enlightened. As long as Wikipedia allows articles of topics, some of which are, by their very nature, considered biased, then liberty must be given to properly disseminate the information. That necessarily includes using words and phrases peculiar to it.Jlujan69 05:56, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

After seeing letters criticizing that comment, Graham later said "I remember saying it, and I immediately regretted it and almost went back and clarified the statement," and "To say God has judged people with AIDS would be very wrong and very cruel."[3]</i></p>
<p>And of course the source link given is broken. Well I poked around and found this was the WHOLE piece at the same source:</p>
<p><i>Cleveland--The Rev. Billy Graham has expressed deep regret for saying that AIDS may be God's judgment for people's sins. "Is AIDS a judgment of God?" asked Graham before a record-breaking crowd in Columbus, Ohio. "I could not say for sure, but I think so." After seeing letters criticizing that comment, Graham contacted the Cleveland Plain Dealer to retract his statement. "I remember saying it, and I immediately regretted it and almost went back and clarified the statement," said Graham in a telephone interview. He said he never intended to make the remark, explaining that he was tired during the sermon and forgot to retract or clarify his statement. "I do believe God stands in judgment of all sins...but AIDS is a disease that affects people and is not part of that judgment," Graham told the newspaper. "To say God has judged people with AIDS would be very wrong and very cruel."</i></p>
<p>What is in the article now is OBVIOUSLY quote mining and POV are both discouraged at Wikipedia. I could care less about Graham or his views on AIDS but I'm deleting the entire POV quote mine, smear that was done in this article. Feel free to add whatever Graham's thought on AIDS are as long as it is not obviously quote mines POV, smear. This is aliving biography, we have a duty to be responsible editors. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 03:11, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I read some more of the article and there seems to be quite a bit of POV and original research. Well, as I mentioned, I am not interested in the man so maybe others will try and improve it. I just saw the glaring quote mining on the AIDS subject and had to revert it. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 03:14, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For those of you who have a legitimate interest in this article and subject I would suggest you seek a peer review where you can get experienced editors to provide some feedback and guidance as to how the article can be cleaned up and improved. There is a lot of original research, unsupported claims, quote mining, and some obvious attempts to smear him. That's my $.02. Whether you like him or not, Graham is an intersting subject. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Christopher_e7f1.html" title="User:Mr Christopher">Mr Christopher</a> 03:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mr Christopher...you obviously have some strong feelings about this issue, having posted about it three times in less than 20 minutes. You should know that quote was originally added by <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Long_a032.html" title="User:Tim Long">Tim Long</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Billy_Graham&amp;diff=94429842&amp;oldid=94313470" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Billy_Graham&amp;diff=94429842&amp;oldid=94313470" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

I felt it was extremely POV, bordering on a smear. I added some context to the quote by adding:

<p>Have been unsourced and in this article since 2003 (according to the top of the talk page). I think that has been long enough.

<dd>Jasper23, you were entirely correct in removing the unsourced info. However at least some of the material is easily sourceable. I don't know why no one bothered to find them (I suppose I'm as much to blame as any other editor). <a href="http://www.stpetersburgtimes.com/2002/03/02/news_pf/Worldandnation/Nixon__Billy_Graham_t.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.stpetersburgtimes.com/2002/03/02/news_pf/Worldandnation/Nixon__Billy_Graham_t.shtml" rel="nofollow">Nixon, Billy Graham target Jews on tape</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1850077.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1850077.stm" rel="nofollow">Graham regrets Jewish slur</a>, or <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2063030/" class="external text" title="http://www.slate.com/id/2063030/" rel="nofollow">Nixon and the Jews.

<dd>Sure, as long as the text matches what the sources say. That is usually the most difficult part in situations such as these. But you shouldn't bother with the quote section as that should all be moved to wikiquote anyways but feel free to integrate the quotes into the antisemitism section. So as long as the sources match the text go ahead and put it back in. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 02:57, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have added the anti-semetism section back...<b>with sources</b>. While I'm a supporter of Rev. Graham and his message, I support truth and accuracy more. This is not some obscure reference to a comment made my Rev. Graham. This was a major news story covered by numerous media. It took very little searching to find these two references. Both of which have the text referenced in their respective paragraphs. ++ <a href="../../../a/r/x/User%7EArx_Fortis_c13b.html" title="User:Arx Fortis">Arx Fortis</a> 01:44, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please realize I have no interest in Rev. Graham whatsoever. I could care less. I do care about verifiable and well sourced information in articles. As you are the editor that keeps putting this back into the article when it is removed by others, I am sure you have decently strong feelings on this issue. However, this must be fully and accurately sourced. Throwing random citations on the end of these paragraphs won't cut it. Sources absolutely must match the text. As you mentioned, this has been covered by many in the news media. Therefore, it should be easy for you to accurately cite this section and word it as to meet those sources. This is a biography article and unsourced info of this nature will be removed, by me, immediately. You seem to be quite angry about the situation, please try to be civil in all future correspondence.

<li>The first sentence says "some reports".
