<p>Party Affiliation does not belong in the introductory area unless it is of historic importance. Instead, it is given in the fact box at the right. This stylistic convention is followed on all Wikipedia articles on Presidents.</p>
<p><br />
The reason the box is there is to give facts like that; the intro should not be duplicating the box material, it should be complimenting it, by stating in words what is historic about the President. For some Presidents, like Lincoln, party affiliation is historic; he was the first Republican President, and it is rightfully noted in the intro. For Clinton, there is nothing historic of note in mentioning his party, hence it does not belong in the intro. There is a scheme here to the display, and it should be uniform. Party information is important, and is easily found in the box, that's what its for. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChessPlayer_1f3d.html" title="User:ChessPlayer">ChessPlayer</a> 05:43, 29 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>How do we fit in the Clinton policy of using executive branch regulations and lawsuits to punish organizations/companies that he did not like? (and possibly to drive them out of business)</p>
<p>He did this to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the handgun industry</li>
<li>Microsoft (Al Gore went there to raise funds in 1996 but did not collect any).</li>
</ul>
<p>Obvious questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Were the lawsuits/legal actions designed to force companies to pay 'protection money' to Democrat campaign organizations?</li>
<li>Were the lawsuits/legal actions designed to force companies to not contest a union action?</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Oh, come on. I don't suppose we'd be willing to accept the canonical reasons for actions against such companies - namely "guns kill people" and "Microsoft is a monopoly"? You may not agree with either of those statements, but I don't see any reason to look for hidden motives here - these are precisely the sort of things democrats have a reputation of disagreeing with, so it's no surprise they took action against them.</i></p>
<p>What is questionable is whether or not the executive branch took legal action that could not be won just to bankrupt the target industry/company.</p>
<p>Unions do this to non-union shops. see <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salting.html" title="Salting">Salting</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Definately not one of the reasons Unions salt. The last thing the Union wishes is to destroy a non-Union business so long as there is a chance of converting it to a Union shop. Please refrain from displaying your antiunion bias. As a former salt, bankrupting a business is not in the best interests of the Union and isn't used as a tactic in conjuction with salting, at least not by any legitimate Union I've ever heard of. You are free to provide documentation if you dispute my contention.00:43, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>RE: Controversial Pardon. Excuse me for being an ignorant European, but what exactly happened?? -- WojPob</p>
<p>The PresidentOfTheUnitedStates has the power, under the UnitedStatesConstitution, to pardon people for crimes committed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>...or even crimes they haven't committed! --LDC</dd>
</dl>
<p>Clinton critics argue that Clinton's many last-minute pardons were more political than those of the past, and in some cases are baffling except in light of large donations to Clinton campaigns.</p>
<p>Clinton supporters can no doubt point to many other highly political pardons in history, including for example <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Ford_de6d.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a>'s pardon of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>. I'm sure that in the entire sordid history of politics, there have been many other cases of apparent pardons for money.</p>
<p>Clinton was considered by some to be the most <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machiavellian.html" title="Machiavellian">Machiavellian</a> president of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> often using presidential powers to decrease the focus on troublesome scandals. He ordered the bombing of Kosovo the day of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monica_Lewinsky_f914.html" title="Monica Lewinsky">Monica Lewinsky</a> impeachment vote and bombed an asprin factory in <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> to cover up&#160;? He used whatever was politically expedient to further his policies such as observing <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate.html" title="Confederate">Confederate</a> Day while govenor of <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> and then condeming <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate.html" title="Confederate">Confederate</a> flags while president.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton was a two (more?) time governor of the state of <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas.html" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>.</p>
<p>Major legislation he signed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balanced budget</li>
<li>Welfare Reform - vetoed twice - signed the third time</li>
<li>NAFTA - the previous president <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, was largely responsible for getting NAFTA enacted</li>
<li>Tax increase on Social Security recipients</li>
<li>Minimum wage increase</li>
</ul>
<p>SupremeCourt appointments:</p>
<p>Major legislation he vetoed:</p>
<p>Major legislation he failed to get passed through Congress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare Reform - socialized/nationalized health care (similar to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>)</li>
</ul>

<dd>Actually, although a significant fraction of Americans wanted a system like that, others, wary of a large complex system did not, and what Hillary Clinton and all the conferences etc. ended up with was a difficult-to-summarize public/private mish-mash.</dd>

<li>Social Security Reform - He appointed a committee on Social Security Reform and then dismissed their recommendations.</li>

Then there is all the stuff about national health care, nafta, welfare reform, increasing money for student loans ... lots more than the scandal happened. He was also the governor of Arkansas a few times. (this page entails lots of hmwk) --PhillipHankins</p>
<hr />
<p>Clinton's compromises on environmental and social issues were a great disappointment to the more progressive and/or radical types who vote <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democrat.html" title="Democrat">Democrat</a> sometimes. However, he did promote dialogue on race issues during his presidency, both in speeches and with a small budget.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice to have (is there already) a short standard for nations? There's one that's used for internet domains, us = <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, ca = Canada, etc. Then we could use us/Democrat (then a us/Democrat page redirects to UnitedStates/DemocraticParty i guess).</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>No, I don't think so. Such standards are too hard to formulate and extremely fallible, as well as being anti-wiki generally. Just let things develop naturally first, anyway, and see what happens a few months or years down the road. -- <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanger_037d.html" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a></i></dd>

<dd>Here's an interesting bug. There's patches at UseMod:UseMod/Bugs that look like they might fix it: The BlueQuestionMark after us/Democrat points to a page to edit William Jefferson Clinton/Democrat (the SubPage uses this page as the base page instead of "us"). I'm tempted to create a us page and a us/Democrat page to check, but i don't want to mess up the database.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>us/Democrat is not recognized as a link; /Democrat is. You can use square brackets to make us/Democrat a link.</dd>

<p>This would focus on parties as organizations in separate nations, although there are *sometimes* transnational commonalities in purpose between same-named parties.

<p>could someone make the history of his presidency less about "Deomocrats..." "Republicans....", and more like the presidential histories you read about presidents like John F. Kennedy, Truman, FDR, Teddy, etc. etc. etc. this reads like a history of the American two party system during the last decade of the 20th century.</p>
<hr />
<p>I totally agree. --<a href="../../../l/m/s/LMS_66a8.html" title="LMS">LMS</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I do not agree; at least not totally. First, it is impossible to write anything like the presidential histories of Kennedy, Truman, Roosevelt, etc. because the Clinton presidency is simply too recent for its historical significance to be judged. Second, the impact of the Clinton presidency on American politics is not unimportant; although I agree that in the current article it seems overemphasized, I believe that is mainly because the article is so incomplete in its treatment of other topics. - HWR</p>

<p>Actually, the NY Times article says the following: 'The Bill Clinton entry, for instance, said in late August he was "a two (more?) time governor of the state of Arkansas." Within two weeks it was updated to reflect the years he served as governor. (He served six two-year terms, or 12 years over a 14-year period.)' Our article says he served two terms as governor of Arkansas. --KQ</p>

<p>The article said that Paula Jones recieved money from conservative groups, which makes it sound like she decided to sue Clinton because she recieved money before deciding to sue. That is not the case. Please correct this.</p>
<p>Also, you describe Whitewater as a "failed land deal", but it was much more then that. Hillary Clinton was put in charge of investigating the bank- which lent that "failed land deal" money- to keep going. Another words, she was investigating the very bank that had kept her stake in Whitewater from going bankrupt. That's kind of shady, to say the least. Merely suggesting that it was a "failed land deal" makes it sound like someone was making a mountain out of a molehill. You also should have mentioned that at least 13 people were convicted or pled guilty in the Whitewater investigation, and that Ken Starr was given the edict to follow the investigation "wherever it led".</p>
<p>I would also like to see it mentioned in the article that President Clinton bombed a country on the day of the impeachment vote.</p>

Finally, I think its worth nothing that the impeachment vote was mainly along party lines. John Abbott</p>

<dd>As to your specific points, it is relevant that conservatives did fund her (would she have pursued her case so vigorously without their encouragement?), though if you want to clarify that fact, go ahead. For Whitewater, try to explain all the complexities of it on this page is probably inappropriate (because Whitewater involved more people than just Bill) but if you can come up with a better characterisation that would be acceptable to people from both sides of politics, go for it. As far as the "bombing on the day of the impeachment vote", why is that significant? If your implication is that a lot of conservatives think that he bombed on that day to avoid getting convicted, you'd want to say that (and provide evidence), otherwise, it's irrelevant. Finally, I agree without reservation that it is important to mention that the impeachment vote, despite the pretentiousness of the whole process, was essentially a party-line vote.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Osama Bin Laden</span></h2>
<p>This was just undone in the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is now becoming apparent, following the attacks on September 11th, 2001 that Bill Clinton could have pursued a more aggressive policy toward terrorist groups attacking American interests here in the United States and abroad. He even refused an offer to have Osama Bin Laden handed over to U.S. authorities twice during the '90s. Also, his policies that resulted in the reduction of our intelligence agencies hurt the U.S. abilities to uncover terrorist attacks before they occur. These policies were reversed with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, a cabinet level position, by President George W. Bush.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any way that some NPOV part of this can be included. My understanding was that Clinton got an least one opportunity to destroy or capture Bin Laden and decided not to take the action. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture">Texture</a> 22:47, 12 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The counterpoint is that the opportunity was not credible, and to take advantage of it would have been a major compromise of U.S. interests. The offer was made by Sudan's Defense Minister, ElFatih Erwa (who later became UN Ambassador), in early March 1996 during a secret trip to the United States where he met with the CIA's East Africa bureau chief at an Arlington hotel. The CIA officer had no political authority to negotiate terms of a capture, and the offer was therefore literally left on the table in that hotel room. Later in 1996, Wall Street financier, Mansoor Ijaz, made a trip to Sudan to meet various Sudanese leaders, including President Omar Hassan El Bashir and Hassan Al Turabi.</p>
<p>Turabi sent a letter to Clinton in August 1996 extending an olive branch for cooperation on terrorism-related issues in which Sudan had become embroiled. Ijaz was afforded access to Sudan's intelligence files in October 1996, and then informed Samuel R. "Sandy" Berger, then deputy national security adviser to Clinton. There was no response, according to Ijaz's account in Richard Miniter's New York Times bestseller "Losing Bin Laden".</p>
<p>Ijaz then returned to Sudan in early 1997, where he negotiated and received from Bashir an unconditional offer of counterterrorism assistance from Sudan to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, CIA and Congressional bodies that sought to review Sudan's intelligence files. The offer, according to Berger, was not credible because the Sudanese could not be trusted. Berger also repeatedly questioned Ijaz's motives in negotiating the offer, claiming Ijaz had business interests in Sudan (no independently verifiable evidence has ever been found to support Berger's claim). He charged that Ijaz had portrayed himself as acting on behalf of the administration in dealing with other governments, also a charge for which there is no independently corroborated evidence.</p>
<p>Sudan's 1997 offer to examine intelligence data on Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups that had operated in and around Khartoum, was acted upon on September 30, 1997 when Sec of State Madeleine Albright agreed to send a team of US diplomats, not including the US Ambassador, back to Khartoum to, among other agenda items, review Sudan's intelligence data on terrorist groups (source: New York Times report). The offer was rescinded less than a week later, when Albright appeared at a State Department news briefing and not only retracted the offer to send US officials to Khartoum, but increased sanctions against the Bashir regime.</p>
<p>Clinton did pursue an aggressive strategy against Osama (c.f. cruise missile attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998), but not a desperate one. It is far from clear, even in hindsight, that there was an opportunity. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebrane_d41b.html" title="User:Rebrane">Rebrane</a> 07:22, Feb 13, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>What is credible is that Clinton had no less than three opportunities to order strikes on Osama bin Laden, as he was spotted in real time by troops on the ground in Afghanistan. This information has been recounted and documented numerous times lately in American literature, by authors who were in or near Clinton's cabinet while the opportunities presented themselves. Each time, Clinton failed to act. Given the gravity of Osama bin Laden's actions and his impact to history, it's not justice to let these facts go without mention. I've added as neutral a point of view on this issue as possible, laying the credit/blame for the situation at his economic policies as many well educated writers and analysts have (policies which are not in dispute - he did cut military and intelligence funding dramatically during his tenure in office).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Post-Term Impact of Clinton's Policies</span></h2>
<p>I removed the following paragraphs:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Despite the dramatic increase in personal wealth amongst many Americans during this period, economists and analysts in the private sector, government, military, and even the Federal Reserve Bank predicted that policies enacted or supported by President Clinton were in fact damaging the country's long term economic health. Some of these fears did in fact become reality - particularly, the United States military has been forced to implement an unprecedented recall program for military retirees to address troop shortages in the nation's continuing <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terror_fa24.html" title="War on Terror">War on Terror</a>. During President Clinton's years in office, the strength of the nation's military was severely weakened due to dramatic spending cuts. It is also believed that these budget cuts led to breakdowns in the nation's intelligence capability, eventually leading to failures that did not predict the <a href="../../../w/t/c/WTC_70a8.html" title="WTC">WTC</a> attacks on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11th.html" title="September 11th">9/11/01</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Additionally, much of the strength of the economy for which President Clinton was credited resulted from the growth of the "dot-com bubble", and not the economic policies that President Clinton favored. When the <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrational_exuberance.html" title="Irrational exuberance">irrational exuberance</a> of the stock market, as termed by Federal Reserve Board chief <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Greenspan_c1c0.html" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a>, finally reached its maximum in the late 1990s, a much more accurate state of the impact of Clinton's economy was evidenced. The resulting economic downturn was, broadly and without specifics, blamed on President Clinton's successor to the Oval Office. Due to the fact that President Clinton's successor, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, had not been in office long enough to see his economic policies affect the nation's economy, many conservatives attributed the popular view of recent history to an American <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_media_bias.html" title="Liberal media bias">liberal media bias</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What specific policies of Clinton did the Federal Reserve predict to damage the economy? The reduction in military was IIRC largely bipartisan. Who believes these budget cuts led to breakdowns in the nation's intelligene capability? In the 2nd paragraph, we move into damned if you do and damned if you don't territory. It reads like Clinton wasn't actually responsible for the economy, but he is still blamed for it anyhow. I agree that Bush was sometimes unfairly blamed for the downturn, but I'm not sure what exactly that has to do with Clinton. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 03:59, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>To answer your first question, the surplusses that Clinton enjoyed as a result of the booming stock market were believed by Greenspan to be dangerously oversized. As a result, he suggested tax cuts to lower the surplusses and to prevent the economy from reaching a growth rate that could not be sustained. He also had some well founded but unpopular suggestions for handling Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid. Clinton and Greenspan had an unwritten agreement to "tolerate" one another in a friendly fashion. Clinton wouldn't argue with Greenspan publicly, and Greenspan wouldn't call him out as a tax-and-spend liberal. This is obviously subjective, and as such unfit for inclusion in the article, but can be backed up by interviews with former Clinton cabinet members and writings of prominent political thinkers (just do a Google search on "clinton greenspan disagree" for starters). The whole point of the contribution was to provide a balance to the immediate evidence of bias in this article. Clinton wasn't responsible for the unprecedented rise in the economy, the surging technology stock market was. Bush wasn't responsible for the downturn resulting from its explosion - the country was experiencing a hangover from the party that got out of control, which was then worsened by 9/11. In so far as the article does not unduly credit Clinton with this economic phenomenon (as is already, repeatedly, seems to do), I've no problem with altering the wording.</p>
<p>My issue is that virtually nothing in those bullet-points mentioned is universally, or even reasonably believed to be attributed to Bill Clinton's economic policies. That said, they were not removed as they were obviously believed by enough people to warrant its inclusion. And while you may not be aware of them, there are in fact quite a few people and numerous (dozens? hundreds?) of pundits/experts who attribute the meltdown of our military and our intelligence arsenals to events that occurred by Clinton's hand, or on his watch (e.g. cutting their spending in the face of huge surplusses, a mounting middle-eastern threat that went virtually ignored, and a surging economy????).</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like the rest of this article was subjected to the "prove it" mandate, if it were, it would necessarily read quite differently. However, if there is in fact some unwritten rule whereby every single contribution needs to be substantiated with a bibliographical reference, I'd be happy to perform that work - provided those who are painting this individual in a much rosier and glossier manner than is warranted do the same. If that's unreasonable, I'll put the text as written in place again in one week's time. Please try to act professionally toward those with whom you do not agree - provide a suggestion for modification that you feel is mutually agreeable rather than performing wholesale removal of a contribution.

<dd>Quote: <i>Please try to act professionally toward those with whom you do not agree - provide a suggestion for modification that you feel is mutually agreeable rather than performing wholesale removal of a contribution.</i> Huh? Simply because I removed a section of text that is full of unsubstanitated vagaries, I am also responsible for editing it? No, I don't think so. However, I am mildly offended that you consider it to be somehow "unprofessional" (whatever that might mean). That said, what I object to is not that something critical was said about ole Billy Boy, but that it was full of vague allegations. When you say "policies enacted or supported by President Clinton were in fact damaging the country's long term economic health", which policies? leaving it unspecified implies that it may be any or all of his policies. When you claim <i>there are in fact quite a few people and numerous (dozens? hundreds?) of pundits/experts who attribute the meltdown of our military and our intelligence arsenals to events that occurred by Clinton's hand</i>, there are in fact quite a few people and numerous (dozens? hundreds?) of pundits/experts who attribute any number of bad things to Clinton and his policies, some perhaps justified and many not--so what? That's what pundits do, offer opinions according to their biases. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 17:25, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you win. Herein lies the fundamental issue with "Open" technologies - the content/benefit becomes weighted by whomever is <i>loudest</i>. The fact is that the entire article could be construed as being full of "unsubstantiated vaguaries" - to wit, sentence #2: <b>"During his administration, the United States enjoyed more peace and economic well being than at any time in its history"</b>. Where is this substantiated? The problem is that I don't care enough about this guy, or the accuracy of the document, to argue with zealots such as yourself in cyberspace. Ultimately, people will believe what they want to believe, regardless as to what is written. However, the NPOV guidelines state that rather than removing a contribution, it should basically be couunterweigted by an opposite view - this is what I did, and you've plainly and blatantly acted contrary to those guidelines. I have better things to do. Maybe someone else will realize that you are not neutral enough to contribute and take appropriate action - a simple review of your user page reveals all, you in fact hold President Bush responsible for the state of the economy and your joblessness (or did at one time), hardly a neutral sentiment. I think if neutral individuals with as little tolerance for nonsense as I had visited this article before, this conversation would already have taken place. - TRM 17:52, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The pot calls the kettle black. Sure, I think Bush is a bonehead and that in general, Clinton was a far better president, even with his personal failings which were made into a public spectacle by right-wing zealots. I try not to hide my biases--NPOV applies to articles, not to user pages, and arguably not to the discussion pages. Once again, I removed the text not because it was biased (althoug it was that also), but because it was too vague for me to even know where to begin with editing it into something more acceptable. If what you wrote was so vague that I didn't know what you meant (aside from casting Clinton in a negative light), how am I supposed to know how to edit. And I will note, that I did not simple delete the text, I moved it to the discussion page, where it could be, well, um, discussed. If you think this is improper, well, so it goes...we have a different interpretation of the NPOV editing policy--if you think I have abused the policy, then you're free to pursue the matter. If you think the rest of the Clinton article is biased, you are welcome to edit it. I actually agree with you that it is probably a bit too rosy right now, but like you, I don't feel any particluar inclination to chase down details and edit it at this point. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 18:34, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Disclaimer: I didn't vote for Clinton, I am a Socialist and consider the Clintons to both be DINOs. Can't stand people who claim to be one party but belong in the other. Zell Miller for example, a good old "Southern Democrat" who should have had the decency to join his peers and become a Republican. I am, however, one who considers bias by ommission to be as aggregious as bias by demonstration. This claim of a "vast right wing conspiracy" was laughed at at the time, but has long since been placed in it's proper context. Had such a well funded and concerted effort not been ongoing, there is little doubt Ken Starr would have ever had any traction at all. The Jones incident would have died as it should have, since it was first tossed as having no merit, no timeliness, and most of all, no relevance to anything other than the 8 year campaign to damage the Clinton name in hopes of defusing some of his popularity and power. I am strongly in favor, in the interest of completeness, of seeing both Ken Starr's name in this section and at least a moderated concensus entry about the "vast right wing conspiracy". It is the most glaring ommission in the entire entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposed changes: The "vast right-wing conspiracy" charge</p>
<p>Clinton's political successes drew reactions from several well funded conservatives. Led by a network of largely conservative talk radio media outlets, &amp; FOX NEWS, radio broadcasters such as Rush Limbaugh and television commentators such as Sean Hannity, Geraldo Rivera, and The O'Reilly Factor's Bill O'Reilly (commentator) almost daily made accusations of corruption and dishonesty against Clinton and his administration. Other efforts such as Scaife's Arkansas Project funded by wealthy conservatives such as Pittsburgh banking heir Richard Mellon Scaife went about trying to find suggestions of wrongdoing in Clinton's past and publicizing allegations. When Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton described this informal network as a "vast, right-wing conspiracy," she was ridiculed by the conservative media; however, former conservative journalist David Brock has described in books such as Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative and The Republican Noise Machine&#160;: Right-Wing Media and How It Corrupts Democracy his own involvement in exaggerating claims against the Clintons and the network of conservative media operations (including those owned by Rupert Murdoch and the Rev. Sun Myung Moon) that kept such accusations at the forefront of the public's attention. Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's investigation covering an ever widening sphere of topics could well have ground to a halt without the support of public opinion bouyed by the these conservative efforts against Clinton.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have made the re-entry as neutrally as possible considering my own disdain for the Clintons. I have no problem with any further attempts at moderating the language but feel ommission of it completely would be less than full disclosure and demonstrate bias by ommission as a result.

<p>Cutting as promoting POV.</p>
<p>IT IS NOT POV!</p>
<p>Ask anyone, Democrat or Republican, what are the three most famous quotes. This is what you will get.</p>
<p>I am a Democrat (large D) and <b>I am a Clinton supporter</b>. If you can come up with any quote, recognizable by any <b>non-wonk</b>, then substute them - but by replacement one at a time - not removal - I think these quotes demonstrate the <i>humanity</i> (and <i>flaws</i>) of this <b>truely great president</b> <a href="../../../l/e/o/User%7ELeonard_G._0170.html" title="User:Leonard G.">Leonard G.</a> 03:59, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your political affiliation does not make you immune from POV edits. It may not be <i>your</i> point of view that Clinton is a scoundrel. But, that is the message of putting these selected quotes as the very last word of the article. That, by the way, is why I was careful to revert my phrasing 'intended to promote POV'. Each of the scandals is discussed in the text. Taking them out of context, calling them most famous, and making them the last word unduly emphasizes these already discussed scandals and quotes. Can you imagine the firestorm if someone tried to insert the analogous lists I created above as the last word? <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 05:14, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ramzi Yousef/Operation Bojinka</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me that most of the information here should go on some other page (such as Ramzi Yousef's page). Several of the points seem not to have a direct relationship to Clinton. <a href="../../../a/c/s/User%7EAcsenray_d459.html" title="User:Acsenray">Acsenray</a> 13:46, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Approval ratings</span></h2>
<p>I think the end of paragraph 2 needs to be changed. Clinton did have high approval ratings when he left office, but Eisenhower's ratings were as high, or higher (I don't have exact stats, so I'm going by <a href="http://wps.ablongman.com/wps/media/objects/14/14415/visuals/Chapter13/figure133.gif" class="external text" title="http://wps.ablongman.com/wps/media/objects/14/14415/visuals/Chapter13/figure133.gif" rel="nofollow">this chart</a>). Most of our presidents (at least up to Roosevelt) didn't even have to deal with approval ratings! - <a href="../../../s/e/k/User%7ESekicho_869d.html" title="User:Sekicho">Sekicho</a> 23:36, Sep 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Some excluded major accomplishments</span></h2>
<p>I think there should be a separate section or at least a link to his military endeavors as President. And how these especially fit in with his relationship with the UN. Sub-chapters or links could include "Attack on pharmaceutical plant in Sudan" , "Attack on Saudi Arabia", "Attack on Yugoslavia", etc. Numbers of civilian deaths for each attack would underscore the meaningfulness of each military adventure.</p>
<p>In the realm of his successful economic policies, mention of the the Wall Street Bubble Burst during the last year of his term as President and the resulting loss in value of pensions for working class Americans is pretty important. (Many people had also invested their savings during the period of economic optimism during Clinton's Presidency.) Also, the corruption in firms such as Enron during his Presidency, came to light only afterwards.</p>
<dl>
<dd>major military operations should be briefly mentioned somewhere with links to the relevant wikipedia article. what does enron have to do with clinton? some crimes happened there during his tenure, but so did the OJ Simpson incident. not everything that happens during a presidency is about the president. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 14:54, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For more on Clinton and Enron: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A37287-2002Jan12&amp;notFound=true" class="external free" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A37287-2002Jan12&amp;notFound=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A37287-2002Jan12&amp;notFound=true</a> <a href="http://www.bear-left.com/original/2002/0120lessons.html" class="external free" title="http://www.bear-left.com/original/2002/0120lessons.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bear-left.com/original/2002/0120lessons.html</a> I would think that in assessing the economic growth during the Clinton era one must at least mention the overly valued worth of firms such as Enron, Worldcom, etc. It was quite obvious that Clinton accepted this unprecendented "growth" which with increase employment, stock market and political contributions made "his" record look good. Whether he had anything to with the ensuing scandals is not the point. The economic growth was based on "fiction". As far as I know the stock market was near 4000 at the beginning and at the end of Clinton's Presidency. The tip of the iceberg at 10,000 points reflects self-delusion at best and greed at worst, quite characteristic in the 90's. To sum it up, the up-beat remarks in the Wikipedia entry concerning the economy during Clinton's Presidency has a dubious, if any, basis. Maybe there's someone more neutral than I who would put this in a few sentences. I would go overboard like Christopher Hitchens. whyerdWhyerd 19:36, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>you are factually mistaken about growth being a fiction. according to the BLS household incomes increased every year of Clinton's presidency. that's money directly in people's pockets. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 19:00, 24 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I added a few lines on Tom Harkin's statements about the trial of Clinton being a piece of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dung.html" title="Dung">dung</a>. And Harkin did actually say that during an impromptu interview at the capital. So not all the Senators were the impartial jurors that they had sworn to be - and that extends to both sides of the floor.</p>
<p>I removed the following sentence from the <b>Presidency</b> section because it doesn't make sense to me. If anyone knows what it means, please feel free to re-add it.
