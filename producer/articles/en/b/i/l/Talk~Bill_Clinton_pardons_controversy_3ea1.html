<p>I would LOVE to know what Republican pardons have to do with Clinton's pardons, other than that some Leftist loose screw wants to make Pardongate seem "not so bad".</p>

<dd>Putting Clinton's pardon in context seems appropriate. The POV of the poster is evident.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 19:32, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The Constitution gives the President unfettered authority to pardon anyone he wants, for any reason he wants. It is in fact one of the only Constitutional powers that has <b>no</b> limits whatsoever. That makes "Pardongate" the definition of a manufactured "scandal". It's funny how this "scandal" gets a separate article, but George H.W. Bush's last-minute pardons of his Iran-Contra accomplices gets only a short section in his own article. Wikipedia conservative bias, perhaps? 71.203.209.0 00:03, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In 1983, they claimed responsiblity for 120 bombings. At least 10 more bombings (some sources say 15) took place before the 16 FALN members who were pardoned were captured. After their caputre, the only other bombing incident that was planned by the group (to my knownledge) was the prison breakout of one of the members. If you look at this website <a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/puertorico/faln-chronology.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/puertorico/faln-chronology.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, you will see that there is not one bombing that took place outside of the US by this group. In fact, I don't know of a single bombing by this group that took place outside the US. Most of the bombings were in the cities of Chicago and New York City. The group did in fact commit other crimes, but they were in fact responsible for at least 130 bombings. But I'll be willing to compromise and only state that the had set off bombs 120 times in the US, a number that FALN itself has stated publicly in 1983. But I will not let anyone whitewash the number of bombings that they were responsible inside the US. --just an anon</p>

<p>I don't want to get in a revert war here, but somebody has added back in the sentence "It is widely believed she was a victim of Kenneth Starr's witchhunt." to the Susan McDougal section. Firstly, the term "witchhunt" doesn't belong in a neutral POV article. On top of that, "it is widely believed" is just weasel wording for "I think that..." If there's factual data to be included here, great. If someone wants to rewrite this sentence so that it's clearly true, that's wonderful. But as written, it simply doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_D_Robson_e7c8.html" title="User:Gary D Robson">Gary D Robson</a> 03:36, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay. We have an anonymous contributor (or possibly two) continuing to add this inflammatory statement each time it is reverted. Said contributor(s) won't defend this action here on the talk page, and hasn't tried any other wording. I've rephrased the sentence to make it NPOV. If it gets changed again, I'm afraid this article will need an NPOV tag and/or mediation. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_D_Robson_e7c8.html" title="User:Gary D Robson">Gary D Robson</a> 04:42, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Even having the line "Some believed that McDougal had been unjustly prosecuted as a part of Kenneth Starr's investigation of Clinton," is not NPOV, as it is an opinion that has no basis in fact. If we are to include opinions, we should also logically include "Some believed that McDougal was pardoned in exchange for keeping silent about Clinton's role in <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitewater.html" title="Whitewater">Whitewater</a>. --<a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlfoor_36af.html" title="User:Alfoor">Alfoor</a> 20:46, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article doesn't contain the word "Democrat" anywhere and doesn't criticize the Democratic party in any way whatsoever. Why, then, is the final section of the article entitled "Republican presidential pardons?" I think this section should be "Other presidential pardons" or "Comparable presidential pardons," and discuss controversial pardons by other presidents of both parties.

<p>On Clinton's last day in office, he pardoned over 200 convicted felons, including his brother Roger who had completed a prison sentence on drug charges and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Rostenkowski_a1be.html" title="Dan Rostenkowski">Dan Rostenkowski</a>, the former Chairman of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_Committee_on_Ways_and_Means_5c2b.html" title="United States House Committee on Ways and Means">House Ways and Means Committee</a> who had been convicted on corruption and mail fraud charges. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Vignali_5666.html" title="Carlos Vignali">Carlos Vignali</a> (convicted of cocaine trafficking) and Almon Braswell (convicted of fraud), both of whom were clients of Clinton’s brother-in-law <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Rodham_14ad.html" title="Hugh Rodham">Hugh Rodham</a>, were pardoned. Rodham later returned the $400,000 in legal fees he earned representing Vignali and Braswell. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Another one of those pardoned was <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Rich_4023.html" title="Marc Rich">Marc Rich</a>, a financier who had fled the United States decades before for tax evasion and other illegal activities including buying illegal oil from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Though his company put up a $200 million dollar bond on behalf of Rich and his partner, Rich fled the country before being indicted and never saw a day of trial or incarceration. Many questioned the pardon because Denise Rich was a generous donor to the Clinton campaigns and to his library. These actions quickly led to public hearings by congress, headed by Congressman <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Burton_6880.html" title="Dan Burton">Dan Burton</a> into the legality of all of Clinton's presidential pardons. Federal prosecutor <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Jo_White_30c4.html" title="Mary Jo White">Mary Jo White</a> was appointed to investigate as well. The investigation revealed that Denise Rich's last donation to the Clinton library came a full year before Marc Rich's attorney's even discussed asking her to lobby Clinton on his behalf. Burton, as part of his investigation, listened to taped recordings of Israeli Prime Minister <a href="../../../e/h/u/Ehud_Barak_d32a.html" title="Ehud Barak">Ehud Barak</a> pleading with Clinton to pardon Rich as well - Rich had provided millions of dollars in financing for Palestinian development projects and the Israelis considered Rich a significant part of the peace process.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Marc Rich was required to pay a $100 million dollar fine as part of the pardon and to waive all statute of limitations in regards to any future civil charges. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Comey_a4d7.html" title="James Comey">James Comey</a> later replaced Mary Jo White, and he closed the investigation without filing any indictments.</p>

<p>An editor has repeatedly deleted the following opening sentence from the "Pardons signed on final day of office" category: <i>"It is common practice for Presidents to grant a number of pardons shortly before leaving office".</i> This is a well known and referenced fact, and seems to me irrefutably relevant to the content of the category - Clinton wasn't setting a new precedent by any means, and his actions follow suit with prior presidents. As well, this same user has added the addendum <i>"...just hours before George W. Bush's inauguration.[10]"</i>. Not only is the unnecessary insertion of the word "just" a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_word.html" title="Weasel word">weasel word</a>, why would one not include the precise amount of time, as opposed to simply stating "hours". Was it two hours? Twenty? "Hours" certainly implies a very short amount of time, which makes a common and legit practice appear somewhat sneaky and underhanded. This looks more like POV pushing than encyclopedic and relevant editing, IMHO.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackbirdsong_8abb.html" title="User:Jackbirdsong">Jackbirdsong</a> 23:46, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sigh. Can you substantiate on your "well known and referenced fact" statement? No. The problem is that you do not read. I gave you a link to read: <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/pardons6.htm" class="external free" title="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/pardons6.htm" rel="nofollow">http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/pardons6.htm</a>. In case you truly are so lazy to even do that, here's all I really needed you to read (if you can do that): "reports began to circulate that there would be a large number of grants at the end of his term. This by itself would be unusual, for pardoning had in the past taken place regularly and consistently throughout the President’s term and was not reserved until its end." So, please, when people make edits, at least attempt to read their edit summaries. Further, when you delete content from Wikipedia, at least read (my underlying theme here) what you're deleting. For example, there was no need to delete the reference (very important on Wikipedia!) that clearly stated it was a "list of the people pardoned or commuted Saturday before President Clinton left office, as released by the White House." ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 18:06, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wow. Well, firstly, while I would prefer to stay on topic and discuss your actions as an editor, rather than stoop to your level of personal insults (although pretty funny- I cannot read, and yet I am supposed to respond to your written statement) you seem to have missed the point here. All that I was saying above was that it is not uncommon practice, or an unheard of event, for Presidents to grant late, or "last-minute" pardons. You want me to substantiate my claim? here's one example - <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/03/07/bush.pardon/index.html" class="external free" title="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/03/07/bush.pardon/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/03/07/bush.pardon/index.html</a>. The point was that it seemed to me (and now given your immature behavior on this page, it seems all the more plausible) that your edits are designed to show one side of the story. In your above ranting, nowhere did you address my concerns in a polite and civilized manner. Perhaps its my fault, for not having given you the benefit of the doubt in the first place, but those initial concerns are all the more justified by your belligerent and personally insulting response.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackbirdsong_8abb.html" title="User:Jackbirdsong">Jackbirdsong</a> 02:54, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am sorry for my harsh response, but let it be known that one should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> in the contributions of Wikipedia's contributors. It is especially detrimental to ignore the explanations said editor gave for edits, and then to ask for those same explanations after reverting the edits. I hope that you can see where I am coming from in that regard. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 03:10, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My main point was simply that it is common for presidents to grant last minute pardons. I in fact did initially read the link you provided, which states:<i>"reports began to circulate that there would be a large number of grants at the end of his term. This by itself would be unusual, for pardoning had in the past taken place regularly and consistently throughout the President’s term and was not reserved until its end."</i> As it is possible for two people to have different interpretations of the same information, here is the way I see it: This statement maintains that it is uncommon for presidents to reserve the majority of their pardons for the end of their term rather than spreading them envenly throughout. <i>But</i> it does not specifically say that prior presidents never granted last minute pardons. This was my point- that Clinton's actions were not unprecedented in the sense that they were late pardons, but rather in the sense that they were so numerous. It was the addition of <i>"...just hours before George W. Bush's inauguration.[10]"</i> that made the whole thing seem so POV to me. I think that simply stating the date and number of pardons granted would be entirely sufficient and NPOV. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackbirdsong_8abb.html" title="User:Jackbirdsong">Jackbirdsong</a> 03:54, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
