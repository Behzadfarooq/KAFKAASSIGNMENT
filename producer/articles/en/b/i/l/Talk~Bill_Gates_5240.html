<p>Sweet Jesus. Does anyone in Wikipedia understand basic English grammar and punctuation? Why are so many of these articles crammed with misplaced modifiers, dangling participles, and subject-verb disagreements? I cannot believe how poorly written these articles are. Facts will make no impression if they are presented via terrible English. The Gates article needs a vast amout of simple, straightforward, copy-editing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.79.25.120 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.79.25.120.html" title="User talk:68.79.25.120">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.79.25.120_1ef9.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.79.25.120">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>The content itself is not <i>necessarily</i> what I meant was ridiculous -- it was combined with the fact that it had nothing to do with Gates' specifically, it was being reinserted immediately after removal (7 times), and also the edits to Gates' photo's caption to make him sound like a criminal ("before his founding company was declared an illegal monopoly in the United States.").

<p>I think Bill Gates studied pre-law at Harvard, not computer science. He enrolled as pre-law.</p>

<dd>Regardless of whether that is true, "pre-law" is not a degree. It is a program of courses you take in addition to your degree studies to prepare for law school. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 01:15, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Were there even computer science degrees back then? I'd think almost certainly no... my only doubt stems from the fact that Harvard tends to be ahead of the curve <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoreydaj_695a.html" title="User:Coreydaj">User:coreydaj</a> 03:53 17 Sept 2006</p>

<p>I have removed the reference to centibillionaire in this article for two reasons. First, there is some doubt that Gates ever reached 100-billion USD. Forbes does not report it and they have been reporting Gates's wealth for many years. But the principal reason is that "centibillionaire" is not a notable term. Looking it up on Google only found a few dozen hits -- almost zero in today's world. Some media have used the term but it has not caught on, primarily because it runs completely counter to the use of "centi" in the SI "metric" system and therefore makes it confusing when we talk about centimetres (is that 100 metres?). If you have a different opinion (or support mine), please add to the discussion below.

<dd>The only reason Forbes doesn't report Gates being a centibillionaire is because they only take a snapshot of wealth at the same time every year. Gates was only a centibillionaire very briefly, &amp; unfortunately his status didn't last long enough to be documented by Forbes annual list. And the only reason centibillionaire's not an established term is because he was the only one and it didn't last. That makes it more notable, not less. And centimillionaire is quite established, so centibillionaire is valid by extrapolation. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimelist_e37b.html" title="User:Timelist">Timelist</a> 21:40, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel a major omission is the extent to which, in the early days, Bill Gates was given his products by and IBM Independent Business Unit desperate to get its PC off the ground. Thus it seems clear that IBM organised the sourcing of, and financing of, Gates' acquisition of MS DOS. Later, when IBM should have set out to compete with Microsoft, the fact that its then CEO was on the board of a charity with Gates' mother meant that IBM PC staff were banned from competing aggressively. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFutureobservatory_7c91.html" title="User:Futureobservatory">Futureobservatory</a> 09:31, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would someone please add why the IBM BIOS cloning ~ reverse engineering was allowed while no cloning ~ reverse engineering of MS-DOS took place? MS DOS was marketed aggressively to the manufacturers of IBM-PC clones.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC</a> it states that IBM published the ROM BIOS source code:</p>
<p><i>IBM decided on an open architecture so that other manufacturers could produce and sell peripheral components and compatible software. The ROM BIOS source code was published. IBM did not anticipate that its competitors would find ways to legally duplicate the entire system.</i></p>
<p>How did others find ways to legally duplicate the entire system according to IBM legal department?</p>
<p>At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_20th_century_in_review" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_20th_century_in_review" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_20th_century_in_review</a> the above is contradicted, IBM BIOS was not open:</p>
<p><i>IBM made all specifications for their computer open rather than proprietary, with the exception of their BIOS. As the only impediment to an open system with interchangeable suppliers was this BIOS, it was reverse-engineered by Compaq, and the IBM PC became the first fully open-specification computer system, leading to its current dominance in the marketplace. Riding on this wave of popularity, the operating system vendors for the PC (Microsoft) leveraged their position to become the most powerful software company in the world.</i></p>
<p>Was IBM BIOS open or proprietary?</p>
<p>It seems IBM failed to take ownership of the OS and of their own BIOS. Was this the largest financial mistake in the history of the world?</p>

<ul>
<li>MS-DOS <i>was</i> reverse engineered and cloned, by Digital Research. See <a href="../../../d/r/-/DR-DOS_044d.html" title="DR-DOS">DR-DOS</a>.</li>
<li>IBM provided the BIOS source code to the companies working on the system. It was definitely proprietary and has never been openly <i>published</i> to my knowledge.</li>
<li>Compaq, Phoenix, and other cloning companies had one team analyze the code and write a detailed functional spec for a compatible BIOS, then gave that specification to a development team that had never seen the BIOS code.</li>
<li>IBM outsourced <i>everything</i> in the PC, both hardware and software, with the exception of the BIOS. It did this to get the computer to market in a reasonable time frame. I wouldn't consider that a financial mistake because it was never IBM's goal to turn itself into a PC company. IBM was and still is a mainframe and server company and it does quite well financially.</li>

<p>OK, now that I've provided citations to <i>the</i> leading big-business critic in the United States, and Gates's own testimony to the Senate regarding how he does business... if that's not enough to keep the passage, what are people looking for?

<p>Yes, I read the archives, and yes I know this has been discussed... but from what I saw there was never a definitive answer one way or the other. I think it should go. It's irrelevant to the man, or to his actions now. I personally believe that any references to "adding humor" to the article or "he's clearly not ashamed" are irrelevant. Encyclopedias should not be humorous, they should be factual... and his attitude in being arrested was probably what any stupid kid's would be -- "whoa, this is cool". I'd be surprised if he'd even received as much as a parking ticket before that night. I have a great deal of respect for Gates, but I'm not a Gates fanatic. My opinion is that we remove it, and if not we at least have a formal decision on it, once and for all. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoreydaj_695a.html" title="User:Coreydaj">Coreydaj</a> 07:30, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. It might be different if there was some section about his "Brushes with the law", in that case it would be relevant.

<dd>I disagree. The event happened and it's part of his biography. It's notable and verifiable. And it doesn't detract from the person Gates became. It shows that even people who were a little wild as kids can grow up into responsible citizens. And having the nerdy photographs says that even nerds can make it. Put it under "trivia" if you'd like, but don't delete it. –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 18:29, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Shoaler, I understand and respect your opinion, but I do disagree with it. I think if we were to lookup other famous people on Wikipedia, we would not find content like the mug shot on Gates. Also, I believe if we were to lookup other encyclopedias we would certainly not see this kind of content on any person, including Gates. Granted, Wikipedia is unique, but I'm not sure if this type of content should establish its uniqueness and put the best foot of Wikipedia forward. Frankly, I'm not sure how we handle this... I'm not going to be audacious enough to take the picture down myself without getting an ok from the community... question is, how do we establish a consensus one way or the other to finally get this matter addressed once and for all...

<dd>Not even Nick Nolte, who has probably the most infamous celebrity mug shot, has it included in his wikipedia entry (although it is mentioned, and i think linked to). I'll say again, there's no context for this mugshot of gates. Nowhere (except for the caption) is any of this legal trouble mentioned. <a href="../../../b/j/e/User%7EBjewiki_11bf.html" title="User:Bjewiki">Bjewiki</a> 17:14, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also disagree. Photographs of Gates at that age are hard to come by, and photos that aren't legally encumbered more so (although I don't think anyone's looked into the rules on copying New Mexico mugshots). The photograph is relevant to the BASIC section, which talks about him moving to Albuquerque to work at MITS.

<dd>Ack! I find it a little irritating that although there is a very large wikipedia page for "lame edit wars", it seems that the only way to get a decision one way or another is by sheer exhaustion of one side of the arguement.

You'd think there would be an escalation process with voting or some kind of mechanism like that?

<p>Bill Gates' full title has to be added somewhere in the article to meet Wikipedia's title and reference standards. Though I recomend it for inclusion in the personal life section.<a href="../../../g/a/v/User%7EGavin_Scott_2ae2.html" title="User:Gavin Scott">Gavin Scott</a> 22:57, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article claims that a score of 1590 translates roughly to an IQ of about 170. According to whom? There is a nearby citation, now unavailable, but I assume that cite supports the claim that Gates has an IQ of 170, *not* the claim that SAT scores are directly translatable to IQ.</p>
<p>Far as I know, SAT measures scholastic aptitude and IQ measures intelligence or something or other. Even if we ignore the question of how well each does at this job, there's no reason to suppose that SAT has bloody much to do with IQ. Where does this translation come from? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 21:49, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That should be removed. Claiming 1590 SAT =~170 IQ doesn't make any sense. <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELaplacian_0e93.html" title="User:Laplacian">Laplacian</a> 07:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Done. The argument seems to be something like: only one in a million score 1590 SAT and also only one in a million have 170 IQ, so the 1590 SAT is evidence for a 170 IQ. Pretty flimsy. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhiwum_2ad0.html" title="User:Phiwum">Phiwum</a> 01:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Back in Gates day the SAT was nothing more than an IQ test.

<p>That's because Wikid77 wants to mix fact and fiction. I restored it to before his edits. Things that Gates has done, or people believe that he has done, are not "portrayals." They're facts or rumors. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 05:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just as a note when Gates was in school the SAT was only worth 1400 points. That would make it impossible to get a 1590. 1390 maybe, but not 1590. If someone would change that it would be appreciated.

<li>I've retitled this topic "SAT 1590" and will confirm the 1973 SAT max was 800+800 = 1600 maximum. I've read that classmate <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Allen_8154.html" title="Paul Allen">Paul Allen</a> scored 1600, but I don't know if they tested together or were seated near each other: it was an exclusive school and who knows how the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholastic_Aptitude_Test_4661.html" title="Scholastic Aptitude Test">SAT</a> was monitored there.
