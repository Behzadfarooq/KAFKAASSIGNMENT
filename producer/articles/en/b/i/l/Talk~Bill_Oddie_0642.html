<p>I'm not convinced that Bill Oddie fits in the category of painters.</p>
<ul>
<li>1) Even though he might paint sometimes and even present a TV programme on painting, that is not sufficient</li>
<li>2) Look at the rest of the list in <a href="../../../p/a/i/Category%7EPainters_098d.html" title="Category:Painters">Category:Painters</a>, Bill Oddie and Churchill look like interlopers</li>
<li>3) Painting is not even close to Bill Oddie's main claim to fame</li>
<li>4) You don't even list <a href="../../../p/a/i/Painter.html" title="Painter">painter</a> as on of his qualities in the opening paragraph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a reason he should be included? -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 14:14, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes: he's a painter. The category is not "people famous as painters"; "professional painters"; excluding him on thsoe grounds is rather PoV. If he and Churchill look like interlopers, it's becasue too few other painters are included. <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 15:50, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, still not good enough for me. If his qualities as a painter aren't strong enough to be mentioned in the article about him, I can't see that they are strong enough to include him in the category. Given the ammendment you have recently added, he would be more appropriate in <a href="../../../i/l/l/Category%7EIllustrators_2e9b.html" title="Category:Illustrators">Category:Illustrators</a>. Churchill at least published a book about painting, but that isn't mentioned in his article either. Perhaps the solution is to put them both in the Category:Amateur painters. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 17:15, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>still not good enough for me</i> - Like I said, PoV. Oddie and Churchill have probably each sold more pictures than Van Gough... <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 17:59, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No its PoV to put someone in a category that is not particularly relevant and ignore others. Or are you contending that painting <i>is</i> one of the most important aspects of Bill Oddie's life. If so, it doesn't show up much on a Google search. (As you probably know <a href="../../../v/a/n/Van_Gogh_78b2.html" title="Van Gogh">Van Gogh</a> only sold one painting during his lifetime, but he was included in professional exhibitions and has sold a vast number of reproductions since).</dd>
<dd>Lets also try Reductio ad absurdum and add Bill Oddie to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_writers_8fa3.html" title="Category:British writers">Category:British writers</a> certainly more relevant than painting, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_musicians_7dc7.html" title="Category:British musicians">Category:British musicians</a> lets not forget <i>Tie a Yellow Ribbon</i> and <i>The Funky Gibbon</i>, <a href="../../../p/h/o/Category%7EPhotographers_bd0f.html" title="Category:Photographers">Category:Photographers</a> he must have some holiday snaps and even published a few, its PoV to require all Photographers to be professional, <a href="../../../m/o/u/Category%7EMountaineers_9f61.html" title="Category:Mountaineers">Category:Mountaineers</a> I reckon he must have climbed Snowdon at least once.</dd>
<dd>It seems silly to be arguing about this when there isn't even an article on Philip Snow who would have a much better claim and an illustrator and painter in the same field. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 18:50, 29 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<p>As the man in question is still alive someone should ask him, shouldn't they? Having categories removed, re-inserted, removed again, re-inserted again is idiotic.</p>
<p>While you're at it, ask him if he considers himself an ornithologist. Given that this is a scientific didscipline, it seems unlikely that Mr Oddie has ever had the time to devote to the required amount of study needed to become a scientist of any kind. He certainly holds no scientific qualifications, though this is not necessarily a requirement to be a scientist.John H, Morgan 08:50, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think it would be useful to open the discussion on what kind of artist Bill is again - I'm not sure having him in a variety of different art-related categories is a good idea. Any views? <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 10:07, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd>On the whole, categories are supposed to be applied to help facilitate a reader to find an article relevant to a particular subject. In my opinion, this article is heavily over categorised - to the point of misrepresentation. As it happens, <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> is no longer an active editor. He had previously been very protective of this and several other articles, so there is certainly an opportunity to get the categories straightend out now.</dd>
<dd>We shouldn't really need to ask Bill Oddie which categories he would consider he belongs to, rather we should just include the categories that would be useful to readers. Personally, I see only two categories that really ought to be here:<a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_comedians_5883.html" title="Category:British comedians">Category:British comedians</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_television_presenters_7f8e.html" title="Category:British television presenters">Category:British television presenters</a>. Some of the other cats, such as <a href="../../../d/o/c/Category%7EDoctor_Who_actors_92e9.html" title="Category:Doctor Who actors">Category:Doctor Who actors</a> are effectively fixed sets. I'm not convinced they help much, but as long as those categories exist they should be complete. Some of the others such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Category%7EBritish_ornithologists_3a11.html" title="Category:British ornithologists">Category:British ornithologists</a> are more of a judgement call; and a judgement best made by editors who are active in managing those particular categories. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 14:01, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The fact AM is banned for 12 months will not stop him reverting any changes we make to the Oddie page. He has access to many computers, and then there is also the Internet cafe scene. A friend who knows him I once asked about the man, as he was also frequently posting on Usenet. My friend was reticent at first but eventually came up with - P*****k. All we can do is have all of us watching the page after we make agreed changes, and revert them as soon as some other "editor" makes problems. John H, Morgan 08:50, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry. I've amended the anecdote. What are your thoughts on the issue of petulant reverting, as may happen here if eventually we proceed in a way that hopefully we will all agree on. John H, Morgan 13:14, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A native means someone born there.

<p>That is a very biased, one sided and narrow interpretation of native that not everyone agrees with, partly in my case because of the nasty ways such an interpretation of the word could be used. Does this mean my brother cannot consider himself a native of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalfont_St_Giles_417a.html" title="Chalfont St Giles">Chalfont St Giles</a> because he was born in <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amersham.html" title="Amersham">Amersham</a> hospital and didn't arrive there till he was a few days old? Perhaps you could also enlighten me as tro whether I am a native of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrogate.html" title="Harrogate">Harrogate</a>, where I was born, or of Church Fenton where my parents lived at the time.

<dd>Sorry, that's the way it is. I was born in Bristol, am Scottish by ancestry and upbringing - and consider myself Scottish. BUT I would appear in a list of native Bristolians in wikipedia - if I'd ever done anything important, that is. Where you are born is a fact. Where you consider yourself to be "a native of" is a matter of opinion.</dd>

<p>Is it necessary to introduce him as "Bill Oddie, OBE, MA (Cantab)"? As far as I know its not standard to list degrees in the intro in this way, especially as a Cambridge MA isn't a proper qualification, it's something you buy. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Watts_14b9.html" title="User:Jeff Watts">JW</a> 19:36, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>It is usual for the Cambridge MA to supercede the BA in a post-nominal list, as it is automatically awarded about three years after the original BA. It is incorrect to refer to the MA as "something you buy" - it is not possible to get the MA without first having to have worked for the BA. However, there are other masters degrees (e.g. MSc) for which additional work is required, and these would be listed in addition to the BA/MA. Also some other universities do award MA degrees in their own right. -- <a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMightyWarrior_77f6.html" title="User:MightyWarrior">MightyWarrior</a> 09:47, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Surprisingly Bill's Wikipedia biography doesn't mention his main claim to fame as a birder before he rose to prominence as a wildlife presenter... On 29th September 1976, with Roger Broad, he found Britain's first example of Pallas's Reed Bunting, on the Shetland island of Fair Isle. This is well documented in, amongst other publications, "Birds New to Britain and Ireland" by Sharrock and Grant (Poyser, Calton, 1982).</p>
<p>In the birding fraternity getting your name against a "first" is a really big deal!</p>
<p>He also sketched the bird and reproduced same in his "Little Black Bird Book". Is this what makes him a British ornithologist, a British painter and British illustrator, as per the categories under which his name appears? John H, Morgan 07:09, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>No, his painting (including appearing on television in that capacity) makes him a painter. His ornithological work makes him an ornithologist.

<dd>A number of biographical articles on Oddie do make mention of his problems with depression, the earliest of which I saw was in the Sunday Times (London) over 10 years ago.
