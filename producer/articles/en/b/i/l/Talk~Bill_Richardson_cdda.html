<li><b>Oppose</b> - Unless you were to move <i>his</i> page back to Bill Richardson, there's not much point in that. A bigger issue is probably that there have been a number of politicians named Bill (or William) Richardson, including a few other Congressmen and a longtime California state Senator (H.L. "Bill" Richardson) who ran for U.S. Senate. Outside of politics, there are probably any number of others. I'd recommend leaving the Bill Richardson page as a disambig, but moving the N.M. governor's page to Bill Richardson (governor) or Bill Richardson (New Mexico). <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisfitToys_23f7.html" title="User:MisfitToys">MisfitToys</a> 21:19, Dec 27, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>As noted on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Talk%7EBill_Richardson_%28politician%29_cd0b.html" title="Talk:Bill Richardson (politician)">Talk:Bill Richardson (politician)</a> - I oppose in principle the moving of the article and replacement with disambig considering the politician is FAR more widely known (and has a full article vs. stub) compared to the CBC radio host. Also, moving the article has broken at least 10 wikilinks that are all evident from within the article (templates, infoboxes, succession order boxes for political office, etc). Since it was moved, I suggest someone (perhaps the mover, for example?) work on fixing this list: <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere%26target%3DBill_Richardson_1784.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Bill Richardson">Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Bill_Richardson</a>. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 06:47, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Reviewing AGAIN the what links here for Bill Richardson, I do not note even a single link which refers to the CBC journalist. Is he notable to an extent that the article to which all other Bill Richardson links link is replaced with a disambig page? Why not disambiguate Bill Richardson (journalist) at the top of Bill Richardson, and replace the disambig page with the primary article to which links refer? If anyone has any objections, let me know, or I'll consider moving the page myself (or having it moved) in a few days. --<a href="../../../a/b/q/User%7EAbqwildcat_6526.html" title="User:Abqwildcat">ABQCat</a> 08:35, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have a bone to pick. It doesn't seem appropriate, I believe, to list someone's profession as "politician." After all, you don't go to school to learn how to be a politician. Lawyer, diplomat, farmer...these are professions. I'm going to peg Richardson with a profession in International Relations, considering what he studied in college, his work for the State Department with Congress, his personal interest in international relations while serving in Congress, and being ambassador to the UN under Clinton. If anybody has a better idea, feel free to share/edit. But "politician" isn't a profession. Not even Ted Kennedy can say it's his profession. Pyroponce 09:40, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Interesting take. I've never seen International Relations called a profession. Does this mean you would also use "English" as a profession? I know several people whose major in college was "English." I'd guess that more than a few people end up in a profession that is not the area they trained. Thinking that politician is not a profession is a quaint Americanism, where they still mistakenly believe in a "citizen legislature." There are many people in college whose main goal <b>is</b> politics. In the same way that some people in college have a main goal of professional sports. Most don't make it, and end up in ancillary professions -- lobbyist, pundit, <i>etc</i>. Richardson has made it (so far). I see no reason to pretend he has some other profession. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a><sup><a href="../../../t/e/d/User_talk%7ETedE_69df.html" title="User talk:TedE"><font size="0.5">Talk</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TedE_bca7.html" title="Special:Contributions/TedE"><font size="0.5">Contributions</font></a></sub> 13:50, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, y'know, I can't think of any long-established encyclopedia that lists a politician's profession as a politician. International relations...I know it's not the best wording. Perhaps "Diplomat" would be better...I'm going to do a little more research. Pyroponce 18:20, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The US census bureau recognizes politician (2020 21-1099), as well as legislator (0030 11-1031).

<p>How about public management? I've done some hunting around and that term seems to describe the art of administration in the public sector. I'm not totally sure it applies though, since most of his public career has been spent in political activities besides administration.</p>

<p>Much of the info on his diplomatic efforts is in the "Governor of New Mexico" section. While chronological order can be nice, those particular events were not dependant on his position as governor. Should they be moved? If so, where? I suggest the "Career" section, but any move would affect the nearly-static chronology of the current layout. --<a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDiluvial_1857.html" title="User:Diluvial">Diluvial</a> 03:22, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suggest moving it to its own section. Invariable the cronology is not going to be maintianable in the future anyways as this article gets greatly expanded once the primaries get in full swing. His foreign diplomacy efforts certainly warrent their own section as they will be a big highlight of his campaign. I suggest placing the section between "Governer" and "Future politcal career". <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERusseasby_ef8a.html" title="User:Russeasby">Russeasby</a> 00:39, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bill Richardson, governor of New Mexico, is <b>not</b> the William A. Richardson Jr. affiliated with Generation 2000. Also, the "Richardson" portion of Generation 2000 is owned by both Mr. Bill A. Richardson Jr. <i>and</i> the Melissa Richardson trust. I have not found any "Melissa" associated with the governor "Richardson", either. --65.11.169.251 00:13, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a first for me, so let's see if this works... I find the bio for Gov. Richardson to be confusing. For example, the chronology of how his parents (and, apparently, his grandparents) met is unclear. His birth in Pasadena &amp; subsequent move to Massachusetts, likewise, is unclear and/or poorly written. These are just two examples; I find similar issues of clarity in various other parts of this document.</p>
<p>I don't know that these kinds of issues are typically discussed here but, for the sake of clarity &amp;, frankly, "aesthetics", I'd like to suggest a re-write...</p>

<dd>I personally think the extensive details of his ancestors, particularly his grandparents, ought to be in articles about those separate individuals (if at all considered worthy of being encyclopedic content). This article is about <i>his</i> life, not theirs. According to the page's history, much of the ancestoral information is from German-Nicaraguan writer Eddy Kuhl<a href="http://www.selvanegra.com/en/newsletter/2006/Fall2006-DetailEddy.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.selvanegra.com/en/newsletter/2006/Fall2006-DetailEddy.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.internationalliving.com/nicaragua/free/eletters_224.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.internationalliving.com/nicaragua/free/eletters_224.cfm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

<p>I added Richardson's comment about the Democratic presidential race being decided very early (January 2008) after the first four state contests (Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, and South Carolina). I cited the Associated Press source link (here: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Richardson-Interview.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Richardson-Interview.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). I would enjoy seeing a follow up comment over the next few months to see which of those four states Richardson believes he will do well in; I suppose Nevada and Iowa--but that is me just guessing.

<dd><b>Fixed</b>, sort of. The <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Governor_c09e.html" title="Template:Infobox Governor">"Infobox_Governor" template</a> is buggy and also was fed incompatible data. I had to hack how this article used the template so that "Appointed by" would move from the Governor heading to the 2nd profession's heading (in this case, UN Ambassador). --<a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDiluvial_1857.html" title="User:Diluvial">Diluvial</a> 23:57, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not an expert on Wikipedia code, so I don't know whether infobox is what I'm describing, but it seems Richardson should have a section under his picture for his having been Secretary of Energy as well, since other Energy Secretaries have it. Could someone with the appropriate know-how fix this?<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougOfDoom_2013.html" title="User:DougOfDoom"><font color="blue"><b>DougOfDoom</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDougOfDoom_604f.html" title="User talk:DougOfDoom"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 18:57, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Either the info could be within the current box which would limit its scope of information, or a separate Energy Secretary box could be placed underneath the current box and include all the Energy info but probably look ugly. I haven't seen any other politicians with more than one introduction infobox. --<a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDiluvial_1857.html" title="User:Diluvial">Diluvial</a> 21:28, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well he already has one section for being Governor of New Mexico and one for being US Ambassador to the UN, why not a third for a qualifying position?<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDougOfDoom_2013.html" title="User:DougOfDoom"><font color="blue"><b>DougOfDoom</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDougOfDoom_604f.html" title="User talk:DougOfDoom"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 05:52, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's possible to do, but adding a third office entry would be very difficult with the current templates. Adding a separate "Energy Secretary" infobox would be easy, but it would look ugly. For example, it expects to have its own photo. Try it in a sandbox or preview. --<a href="../../../d/i/l/User%7EDiluvial_1857.html" title="User:Diluvial">Diluvial</a> 18:50, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
